and\n\n3\n00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:08.830\nValidation.\n\n4\n00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.020\nWe wanna make sure that you have\nan understanding of what's going on,\n\n5\n00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.990\nand here to help us understand\nnot only some exam details but\n\n6\n00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.550\nalso what we'll be covering in this\nnew show is gonna be Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n7\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.617\nSo, Terry, tell us what we're\nactually gonna be taking a look at.\n\n8\n00:00:21.617 --> 00:00:25.874\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is an intermediate level\ncourse, release, control, and validation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:30.172\nAnd if you've had foundation,\nthat's actually a prerequisite for\n\n10\n00:00:30.172 --> 00:00:34.393\nthis course, you will have taken\na survey of all the topics in ITIL at\n\n11\n00:00:34.393 --> 00:00:36.450\na very superficial level.\n\n12\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.960\nAnd you need it to know some things and\nmemorize some things.\n\n13\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.930\nThis one's gonna dive deeper and actually\nmake you apply knowledge to pass the exam.\n\n14\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.010\nSo just take a look here at some of\nthe graphical treatments of this.\n\n15\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.520\nFirst of all, the expectation of this is\nthat certainly you're gonna learn from\n\n16\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.700\nthe episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.450\nI'm going to be giving lots of real world\nexamples in these upcoming episodes and\n\n18\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.850\nmake sure you understand conceptually how\nthese things apply in the real world and\n\n19\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.890\nhow this knowledge can be\napplied in an exam setting.\n\n20\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.100\nBut there's going to be some self-study.\n\n21\n00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580\nThere's also a lot of value\nengaging in discussion forums.\n\n22\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.783\nThere you can ask questions of\nother experts, other students.\n\n23\n00:01:12.783 --> 00:01:16.430\nAnd there's also some practice exams\navailable as downloads as well.\n\n24\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.202\nThat is probably the most valuable single\ndownload in this suite of downloads.\n\n25\n00:01:22.202 --> 00:01:24.600\nAll right.\n\n26\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.030\nThe analysis that you need to provide\nis not just providing knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.120\nYou're going to have to\napply this knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.453\nIt falls on this continuum of\nlearning called Bloom's taxonomy.\n\n29\n00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.750\nAnd you'll see it's not\njust remembering things.\n\n30\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.030\nThat's what foundation was.\n\n31\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.550\nIt was remembering and understanding.\n\n32\n00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.210\nWe've moved up the Bloom's taxonomy scale\na little bit to Level 3 and Level 4,\n\n33\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.920\nwhere you analyze and\nthen apply this information.\n\n34\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.900\nSo it's gonna be a deeper dive and\nactually going to be applying this\n\n35\n00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.890\nknowledge, not just regurgitating it,\nright.\n\n36\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.360\nSo to do that, you're gonna be listening\nto me, take part in the discussions, and\n\n37\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.830\nabsolutely critical that you\nlook at the exercises and\n\n38\n00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.070\nfollow through with the practice exams.\n\n39\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.600\nAll of these are available for\ndownloads, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.845\nSo how does this fit into\nthe qualification scheme of ITIL?\n\n41\n00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:13.160\nWell, first of all,\nI'm an accredited trainer.\n\n42\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.911\nI had to go through and\npass muster as an ITL Expert.\n\n43\n00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.610\nThat's an official title.\n\n44\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.750\nAnd that was given to my by following\nthrough with appropriate training and\n\n45\n00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.830\nexams through an accredited\ntraining organization.\n\n46\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.570\nI'm representing PassionIT Group as an\nATO, an authorized training organization.\n\n47\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.715\nAnd here working with the affiliate\nITProTV to deliver this training in\n\n48\n00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:35.660\nan accredited fashion, right?\n\n49\n00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.277\nThe exam institutes, PeopleCert, EXIN,\n\n50\n00:02:38.277 --> 00:02:43.600\nthey are actually the organizations that\naccredit these training schemes, right?\n\n51\n00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.190\nSo the course materials I'm presenting\nto you in lecture have been\n\n52\n00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.070\nreviewed by the accrediting agency,\nthey've been blessed by the accrediting\n\n53\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.630\nagency as being valid, and map to\nthe official syllabus as owned by AXELOS,\n\n54\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.350\nyou'll see there at\nthe bottom of the pyramid.\n\n55\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.237\nSo AXELOS is the parent and AXELOS is\nthe one that enable these other parts\n\n56\n00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:05.290\nof the accreditation scheme to work, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.380\nThis is the exam scheme, these\nare the various exams you could be taking.\n\n58\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.490\nIf you look in the green area there,\nyou'll see lifecycle stages.\n\n59\n00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.040\nThey're abbreviated, service strategy,\n\n60\n00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.830\nservice design, transition, operations,\nand continual service improvement.\n\n61\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.170\nOver here on the right, you'll see OSA,\n\n62\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.270\nPPO, RCV, that's this course,\nRelease Control and Validation.\n\n63\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.770\nThey give you a few more credits.\n\n64\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.251\nWhat RCV does is it takes from\nmultiple books on the left and\n\n65\n00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:38.929\ncreates a course that's\noperationally relevant, right.\n\n66\n00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:43.130\nSo Release, Control, and Validation is\nthis collection of topics that point to\n\n67\n00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.211\nthe value of delivering high quality\nservices through appropriate Release,\n\n68\n00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:49.470\nControl, and Validation processes.\n\n69\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.310\nWe're gonna be looking at those seven\nprocesses in the upcoming episodes, right.\n\n70\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.570\nAnother certification\npath you could be on,\n\n71\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.180\nis toward expert,\nwhere you collect these credits, right?\n\n72\n00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.150\nSo if you get two credits for foundation,\nyou can get three credits for\n\n73\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.210\npractitioner.\n\n74\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.760\nThree credits for\nthe ones there in the green,\n\n75\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.440\nwhich are called the lifecycle modules.\n\n76\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.560\nThe capability modules\ngives you four credits.\n\n77\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.230\nSo passing this exam is going to give you\nfour credits toward the accreditation\n\n78\n00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.780\nas an ITIL expert.\n\n79\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.325\nOnce you have 17 credits in your pocket,\n\n80\n00:04:20.325 --> 00:04:24.160\nyou're eligible to take the course\ncalled Managing Across the Lifecycle.\n\n81\n00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.255\nYou see it there in green,\nnear the top of this house.\n\n82\n00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:29.701\nThat gives you five credits.\n\n83\n00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:35.575\n17 plus the 5 give you the 22 credits\nyou need to be deemed an ITIL expert.\n\n84\n00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:40.045\nIf you're so inclined, you could also\nconsider an ITIL Master certification.\n\n85\n00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:45.615\nThis one is very hard to get\nin that you have to write and\n\n86\n00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:50.875\nhave basically a thesis, have a good\ncommand of all the principles of ITIL and\n\n87\n00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:54.550\nshow that you have that\ncommand in your paper, right?\n\n88\n00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.110\nA lot of pretty pictures,\nlot of pretty graphs.\n\n89\n00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.370\nYou send that good 20 page paper or\n\n90\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.420\nso off to the accrediting agencies\nalong with a check for $5,000.\n\n91\n00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.780\nAnd then you can have people snatch\nthe pebble from your hand and\n\n92\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.687\nbe called an ITIL master, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:13.180\nSo that's the exam scheme of things.\n\n94\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.887\nAgain, you're just one going into\nthe intermediates here with RVC.\n\n95\n00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:18.720\nYou'll see the other ones.\n\n96\n00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.069\nIn upcoming episodes here at ITProTV,\n\n97\n00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.779\nwe'll be tackling some of these\nother topics as well, okay.\n\n98\n00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.595\nSo moving forward then is again this\nrecognition that you need to be\n\n99\n00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:32.868\nproviding some solid information, right.\n\n100\n00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:35.860\nWe're looking here at\nthe lifecycle modules.\n\n101\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.653\nWe're in capabilities in RCV.\n\n102\n00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:43.855\nThe exam itself is only eight questions,\nso the margin of error is kind of small.\n\n103\n00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:46.215\nAnd you'll see that there's\nalso gradient scoring.\n\n104\n00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:50.395\nWhat that means is that for these eight\nquestions on the exam, you're going to be\n\n105\n00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:55.983\nanalyzing a scenario and then answering a\nquestion based on that specific scenario.\n\n106\n00:05:55.983 --> 00:06:00.031\nIf you pick the best answer out of\nthe four choices, you'll get a 5.\n\n107\n00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:04.563\nIf you pick the next best answer,\nyou'll get 3, a 1, and a 0, etc.\n\n108\n00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:09.243\nSo if you do the math here, you gotta do\neight questions, the max you can get on\n\n109\n00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:14.511\neach question is 5, so the total you\ncould score of 100% is getting 40, right?\n\n110\n00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:16.330\nYour score would be 40.\n\n111\n00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.330\nPassing is 28,\n70% of all available marks, right?\n\n112\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.092\nIf you do the math on that,\nacross eight questions, that means if\n\n113\n00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:31.030\nyou got six three point answers for\n18 plus two 5 point answers for\n\n114\n00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.034\n10, that would be the sweet\nspot of 28 out of 40.\n\n115\n00:06:35.034 --> 00:06:38.925\nOf course, as you do the math on that,\npicking a zero answer, of course is going\n\n116\n00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:43.180\nto mean you're going to have to find some\nmore five answers later on, on the exam.\n\n117\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.370\nSo they are challenging.\n\n118\n00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.570\nThey are fair.\n\n119\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.040\nBut they certainly are challenging\nas they try to test your ability\n\n120\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.970\nnot just to regurgitate knowledge, but\n\n121\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.910\nto apply knowledge,\nwhich is an interesting trick on an exam.\n\n122\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.122\nAgain, very challenging, also very fair.\n\n123\n00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:03.990\nAnd the good news is, you have some\nresources at your fingertips, right?\n\n124\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.720\nThese resources include practice exams\nthemselves, and you can download these.\n\n125\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.890\nThere's a case study, there are exercises\nassociated with that case study.\n\n126\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.910\nAnd there's also a glossary available for\ndownload.\n\n127\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.050\nThis download is available to you within\nthe episodes themselves to subscribers.\n\n128\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd you can download those that\nare available throughout the entire\n\n129\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.320\nshow, right?\n\n130\n00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.790\nI highly encourage you to\nrely on those resources and\n\n131\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.910\nuse them as self study tools\nas you're taking the episodes.\n\n132\n00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.380\nA great approach would be, watch an\nepisode, do some review, watch an episode,\n\n133\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.590\ndo some review.\n\n134\n00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.840\nThe discussion forums are also\na valuable place to turn to.\n\n135\n00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.830\nITProTV provides a discussion forum,\nyou can engage with other students,\n\n136\n00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.360\nyou can also engage with experts.\n\n137\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.750\nI'll be there to answer some questions,\n\n138\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.480\nother experts in the field will be\nthere to answer your questions.\n\n139\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.480\nA very great way to learn and\n\n140\n00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.610\nget over on this challenge of\nmastering the topics of RCV.\n\n141\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.670\nThe exam itself is available\nthrough an online format.\n\n142\n00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.189\nYou can take it

course in a classroom and\n\n145\n00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.130\nhave a live instructor\nthere proctoring your exam.\n\n146\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.170\nYou can take the exam online.\n\n147\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.760\nAs long as you have sufficient bandwidth\nthrough your network and have a camera\n\n148\n00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.700\non your laptop so they can see that you're\nnot cheating, you show them your desk\n\n149\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.530\nwith your camera and everything so\nyou don't have any materials on your desk,\n\n150\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.180\nyou can do the course online at your\nconvenience at a time of your choosing.\n\n151\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.760\nRight, so that's pretty cool.\n\n152\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.680\nThe exam vouchers themselves\nare available through PassionIT Group,\n\n153\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.020\nthe organization I'm representing today.\n\n154\n00:08:41.020 -->

okay.\n\n158\n00:08:52.758 --> 00:08:57.990\nThose practice exams, I can't\nreinforce just how valuable those are.\n\n159\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.700\nOf all the downloads, and they're all\nvaluable, of all of those downloads,\n\n160\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.710\nthe practice exams themselves\nare very valuable.\n\n161\n00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.880\nThey give you an idea to get\ninside the head of the test maker\n\n162\n00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.860\nwhile also practicing your skills and\napplying this knowledge.\n\n163\n00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.680\nThat's what you'd

They focus in on the basic service model and vocabulary that a viewer is expected to understand and know.  They compare services to solutions and give different examples.  These foundational concepts of ITIL are built around customer needs.  This is important for those desiring to move deeper into the Release, Control and Validation.",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nthat's why we do the review.\n\n47\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's why we do the review.\n\n48\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.340\nAgain, ITIL has its own language and we\ngotta remind ourselves of this language.\n\n49\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.100\nAnd this language is important\nbecause it's gonna be\n\n50\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.570\nthe language that's used on the exam.\n\n51\n00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.170\nSo, this is just an example.\n\n52\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.540\nBut this is-\n&gt;&gt; It went away.\n\n53\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.270\n&gt;&gt; This is the service provision\nthat removes constraints or\n\n54\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.050\nenhances performance.\n\n55\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.310\nIt's in contrast to warranty,\nwhich is the capacity, security,\n\n56\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.420\navailability, and continuity.\n\n57\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.670\nSo again,\njust to give you an idea where it goes.\n\n58\n00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.130\nWhich of the following\nmake up service assets?\n\n59\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so just taking a look at the\nfour different values that we have here,\n\n60\n00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.320\nI am going to pick at this point when\nwe talk about service assets, b.\n\n61\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.705\n&gt;&gt; The resources and capabilities of\nthe IT service provider, very good.\n\n62\n00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:00.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n63\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.010\nVery good.\n\n64\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.673\n&gt;&gt; That was just a guess.\n\n65\n00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:04.980\n&gt;&gt; It was a good guess, it's a good one.\n\n66\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.473\nBeing a good guesser could\nhelp you on the exam\n\n67\n00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:07.116\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:07.907\n&gt;&gt; it really can.\n\n69\n00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:10.829\nAgain we're talking about\nwords that ITIL has taken and\n\n70\n00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.850\ngiven a very specific meaning to.\n\n71\n00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.500\nAssets is one of those words.\n\n72\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.940\nAgain this is just a reminder to\nhow important the language is and\n\n73\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.830\nfinally Which of the following is\nan incorrect use of a RACI chart?\n\n74\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see here.\n\n75\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.980\nIn this one,\n\n76\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.580\nI'm gonna have to try to eliminate\nthings a lot of times to take a look.\n\n77\n00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.130\nBut what I want to actually do is remember\nwhat RACI stands for, I'm assuming.\n\n78\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.030\nSo responsibility, accountability,\nconsulting and informing.\n\n79\n00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.390\nLet's see, all of these look like\nthat they are, I'm gonna say a.\n\n80\n00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.290\n&gt;&gt; So which is incorrect Among\nthe incorrect ones it's d, right?\n\n81\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.034\n&gt;&gt; The incorrect, see I went backwards.\n\n82\n00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:54.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you went backwards.\n\n83\n00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:58.305\nYou're looking for a correct answer and\na certainly is correct but also b and\n\n84\n00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.035\nc is correct.\n\n85\n00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:01.905\nBut since we're looking for\nthe incorrect we would have to choose d.\n\n86\n00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:05.743\nAnd just as a note,\nthe intermediate exam you're preparing for\n\n87\n00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.445\nis not this kind of exam.\n\n88\n00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:08.615\nIt's a lot different.\n\n89\n00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.410\nBut this is just kinda reminding us that\nthere's language to be in play here.\n\n90\n00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.390\nAnd trying to make it clear that we\ngot to get our heads around this.\n\n91\n00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.030\nSo that's what we're gonna\ndo over this next several\n\n92\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.520\nminutes is we're gonna describe\nthe language and concepts of ITIL.\n\n93\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.930\nMuch of this I mean all of this not\nmuch all of this was given to you in\n\n94\n00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.608\nthe foundation exam, foundation\ncourse available here at ITProTV.\n\n95\n00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.157\nSo let's look at the service\nlifecycle first.\n\n96\n00:04:36.157 --> 00:04:36.657\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n97\n00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:43.526\n&gt;&gt; So you may recall from foundations\nthat basically there's five books,\n\n98\n00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:48.690\nand they coincide with five stages\nof the life cycle of a service.\n\n99\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.970\nService strategy, service design,\nservice transition.\n\n100\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.450\nBy the way that's always\nhave been our time\n\n101\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.490\nin this course is on service\ntransition processes.\n\n102\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.030\nService operation and\ncontinuous service improvement.\n\n103\n00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.380\nSo these five core books correspond\nwith five life cycle stages\n\n104\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.840\nand they look like this\nin terms of processes.\n\n105\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.810\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry so when we start\nto take a look here at this idea of\n\n106\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.310\nthe server life cycle process in itself.\n\n107\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.840\nSince we're focusing only on\ncertain service strategy and\n\n108\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.980\nwhat we're going to be seeing there\nnext few episodes, why is this one so\n\n109\n00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.020\nimportant that it needs its\nown little certification?\n\n110\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.680\n&gt;&gt; It's a good point.\n\n111\n00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.930\nTo be clear, we're gonna be focusing\non a lot of the processes and\n\n112\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.950\nservice transition, not service strategy.\n\n113\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.580\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n114\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.620\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, that's all right.\n\n115\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.350\nWhat ITIL has done, and\n\n116\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.990\nyou'll get this from the overview, is\nthat it breaks it down into five stages.\n\n117\n00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.930\nEach of them get their own exam.\n\n118\n00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.750\nSo this is just one of the many.\n\n119\n00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.010\nThe reason why this is\na good course at this time\n\n120\n00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.880\ncould be because you are directly\ninvolved in the changing of technology or\n\n121\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.000\nchanging of services in your organization.\n\n122\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.240\nOr you're just seeking certification.\n\n123\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.530\nAnd this is one of the courses\nyou'll want to take.\n\n124\n00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.430\nRCV, release control and validation,\n\n125\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.620\nhappens to be a set of topics that is\nvery closely related to operations,\n\n126\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.380\nwhere a lot of people live and\nbreathe in their daily work lives.\n\n127\n00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.550\nSo it's also relevant to\na large swathe of people.\n\n128\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.870\nService strategy is also very important,\nservice design.\n\n129\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.430\nSo there is no weight in terms of one\nis more important than the other.\n\n130\n00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.490\nIt's just one of many, yeah.\n\n131\n00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.540\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, when I think about some\ntype of practical application to this\n\n132\n00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.850\nparticular skill, is it something like I'm\nactually in charge of maybe bringing new\n\n133\n00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.590\ntechnology into my business and I wanna\nmake sure that everybody knows about it or\n\n134\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.720\nare we talking about something else?\n\n135\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.530\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about that and\na little bit more.\n\n136\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.856\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly,\n\n137\n00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:51.150\nITIL distinguishes\nservices from solutions.\n\n138\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.730\nSo bringing new technology into your\norganization is what this is about but\n\n139\n00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.550\nit's also about bringing new\nservice into the organization.\n\n140\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.720\nYou might be tweaking existing technology,\nbut\n\n141\n00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.280\nyou also could be tweaking the service.\n\n142\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.430\nIntroducing new processes, introducing\nnew interfaces with the business\n\n143\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.810\nthat aren't related to technology.\n\n144\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.500\nHow customers engage with your service,\n\n145\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.440\nhow customers report findings in\nyour service, those kind of things.\n\n146\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.680\nSo the whole theme of ITIL goes\nwell beyond just technology and\n\n147\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.450\nsolutions to talk about the service\nat large, which includes processes,\n\n148\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.430\npolicies, governance,\nas well as the solutions themselves.\n\n149\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, it sounds like there's a lot for\nus to start diving into.\n\n150\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.160\nSo, Terry, what else do we\nneed to review as we start to\n\n151\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.980\nmove forward in understanding this?\n\n152\n00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.080\n&gt;&gt; Let's have a look.\n\n153\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.800\nVery specifically we'll look at,\nI'm sorry, at this particular diagram.\n\n154\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.973\nIt's the classic hub and spoke where you\nsee service strategies in the center here.\n\n155\n00:07:51.973 --> 00:07:56.665\nIt drives the other stages so everything\nshould be revolving around strategy and\n\n156\n00:07:56.665 --> 00:08:00.671\nstrategy itself should be revolving\naround the customer's needs.\n\n157\n00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:04.820\nYou'll see that the service transition\nis one of the spokes circle behind here,\n\n158\n00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.820\nas well behind a services on\nservice operations, right?\n\n159\n00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.272\nIn a water fall fashion, what you see is\nstrategy giving design instructions for\n\n160\n00:08:13.272 --> 00:08:15.371\nwhat should be built, right?\n\n161\n00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:19.220\nIt's in terms of a service,\ntransition would actually get it built and\n\n162\n00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.590\nbring it to life.\n\n163\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.090\nAnd then of course,\nafter it's brought to life,\n\n164\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.620\nit'll be operated in service operations.\n\n165\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.780\nAnd then you see the points of leverage,\nlittle square around the hub,\n\n166\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.850\nthe little squares.\n\n167\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.850\nContinual service improvement\nis a stage within ITL and\n\n168\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.760\nthe service life cycle that it gives you\npoints of leverage, so you can continue to\n\n169\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.380\nmove in the right direction on\nbehalf of the customers, right?\n\n170\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.410\nGood, it even gets down to\nroot definitions of things.\n\n171\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.468\nYou may recall this from foundations\nRonnie, what is a service?\n\n172\n00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:52.888\nAnd it's very specific, I'm gonna\nhighlight these major things here.\n\n173\n00:08:52.888 --> 00:08:56.703\nIt means of delivering value to customers,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:56.703 --> 00:09:01.055\nBy facilitating the outcomes,\nthey wanna achieve without the ownership,\n\n175\n00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:03.918\na specific cost and risk,\ntextbook definition.\n\n176\n00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:08.690\nJust a reminder, on this exam, you're not\ngonna be asked to define what a service\n\n177\n00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.228\nis, but they're gonna be talking\nabout it in this context.\n\n178\n00:09:12.228 --> 00:09:17.350\nIt's gonna be focused on customers,\nit's going to be focused on value.\n\n179\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.150\nIn fact, just for you exam takers,\na good rule of thumb,\n\n180\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.445\nI call it the nine-tenths rule.\n\n181\n00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:28.650\nNine times out of ten, on an exam,\nif you have four choices to choose from.\n\n182\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.800\nOne of them has value in it,\nand the other three don't.\n\n183\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.740\nChances are, it's gonna be the right\nanswer, the same with the word customers.\n\n184\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.090\nIf one of the answers tends to have\nsome focus on the customer, and\n\n185\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:44.030\nthe other ones don't, chances\nare that's gonna be the correct answer.\n\n186\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.470\nITIL is built on delivering value,\nnot just solutions.\n\n187\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.080\nI think there's been over\nthe years of IT innovations,\n\n188\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.140\nIT people focus on solutions,\nit's a good place to focus.\n\n189\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.260\nBut by focusing on the customers,\nyou're gonna be more likely to look for\n\n190\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.440\nthe right solutions, and\nthat's what it always comes back to.\n\n191\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.553\nThat's the touch stone of ITIL,\nto focus on the customers.\n\n192\n00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:07.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, Terry, that sounds like\na great place for all of us to be,\n\n193\n00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.800\nbecause a lot of times, we might think\nthat we know what the proper solution is,\n\n194\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.388\nuntil the customer actually tells us that\nthis is what we're really looking for.\n\n195\n00:10:14.388 --> 00:10:17.477\nI could continue to try and\npush a solution that doesn't fit, but\n\n196\n00:10:17.477 --> 00:10:20.791\nITIL seems like it's really trying\nto help me to understand that fit,\n\n197\n00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:23.780\nand make sure I deliver the value\nto the customer, right?\n\n198\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and that value is often\nfocused on those business outcomes.\n\n199\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.050\nSo, the customers probably\ntrying to do something faster,\n\n200\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.428\nthey're maybe trying to do it more\nreliably with fewer errors, right?\n\n201\n00:10:34.428 --> 00:10:36.850\nThere are certain things out there that\nthe customer is trying to get done.\n\n202\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.790\nAnd depending on the service industry, or\nthe customers trying to serve, I mean, it\n\n203\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.360\ncan be an industrial manufacturing plant,\nso they're trying to produce widgets.\n\n204\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.232\nHow are you gonna help them produce\nwidgets work quickly with your\n\n205\n00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.370\nIT service, right?\n\n206\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.100\nThose type of things.\n\n207\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.780\nFocus on business outcomes.\n\n208\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.570\nWhat is the business trying to do?\n\n209\n00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:59.690\nNot just trying to make the perfect\nnice little gadget of IT wizardry.\n\n210\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, speaking of that\nidea, let's just take that ITPro.TV for\n\n211\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.040\nexample for a moment, and\n\n212\n00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.740\nyou try to help me to figure out where\nITool will fit in for this example here.\n\n213\n00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.000\nSo here at ITProTV, our goal is to\nbe able to deliver the subscriptions\n\n214\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.550\nto our members that we need, and\nto make sure that there's no downtime.\n\n215\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.030\nSo, we originally had thought\nabout the idea of just hosting\n\n216\n00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.150\nour data farm right here on site, okay?\n\n217\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.450\nAnd we thought, that's the way to go.\n\n218\n00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.728\nBut, then, we just said look, here's what\nwe want to do instead is, is host it in\n\n219\n00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:40.069\nthe cloud, because we realize something\nthat that's about the only way that we can\n\n220\n00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:44.126\nguarantee that our members can get access\nto the content whenever we want to.\n\n221\n00:11:44.126 --> 00:11:47.560\nSo, where would ITIL have really\nbenefited us in that process of\n\n222\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.861\nwhat we needed in the transition of stuff?\n\n223\n00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:53.613\n&gt;&gt; Well, it sounds like to me the way\nyou evaluated the calculus there,\n\n224\n00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:56.170\nyou consider the cost\nof doing it yourself.\n\n225\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.760\nYou consider the cost of having it hosted.\n\n226\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.210\nBut what you did,\nat least the way you sounded to me Ronnie,\n\n227\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.788\nis you focused on what about customers and\navailability.\n\n228\n00:12:04.788 --> 00:12:07.900\nWe're not gonna be successful\nas an IT service provider,\n\n229\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.240\neffectively, what you are.\n\n230\n00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.800\nYou're a provider of services.\n\n231\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.720\nWe're not going to be successful\nas a service provider if we can't\n\n232\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.940\nguarantee availability, because people\nwill shut us off and go somewhere else.\n\n233\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.862\nSo, you looked at the calculus there,\nand say well, it's gonna cost us more.\n\n234\n00:12:21.862 --> 00:12:22.405\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:24.639\n&gt;&gt; But the value proposition for\nus is so critical,\n\n236\n00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:28.310\nwe need to make sure we have a strategic\npartner who can help us deliver it.\n\n237\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.240\nSo, that was customer focused,\nand you made a valued statement\n\n238\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.730\nof what is valuable to the customer,\nand we're willing to invest in it.\n\n239\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.930\nThat's what ITIL would instruct.\n\n240\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.329\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so no.\n&gt;&gt; So, I think you followed it.\n\n241\n00:12:39.329 --> 00:12:42.663\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even without really knowing it,\nand don't get me wrong,\n\n242\n00:12:42.663 --> 00:12:44.680\nwe do have people that know ITIL.\n\n243\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.390\nBut at the same time, you may be wondering\nyourself if you're, I know I need to learn\n\n244\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.980\nthis, but I'm still not sure where that\nfits in to the practical nature of it.\n\n245\n00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.980\nSo, we just kinda wanted to give\nyou an example of that as well.\n\n246\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.890\nAll right, Terry, so what are the other\nconcepts that we need to also\n\n247\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.480\ncontinue to take a look at as well?\n\n248\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n249\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.120\nWell, I ITIL's build service capability,\nservice management capability.\n\n250\n00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.460\nThey call the capability to\ndeliver high-quality services.\n\n251\n00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.020\nThey give that a name.\n\n252\n00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.690\nSo, again, this is important for\ntest-takers.\n\n253\n00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.330\nIt's because this is the language\nthey're gonna be using on the exam.\n\n254\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.365\nSo, even though these concepts\ncould be expressed in other ways,\n\n255\n00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:20.730\nITIL expresses them in specific ways.\n\n256\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.790\nSo, we're reviewing that.\n\n257\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.540\nThe idea of having a capability to deliver\nservice is called service management.\n\n258\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.390\nService management equals capability.\n\n259\n00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.690\nThat means you have people\nthat understand services,\n\n260\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.750\nunderstand the management of services.\n\n261\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.750\nAnd then, of course, you add the word\nIT to that, IT service management\n\n262\n00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:41.780\nis the ability to deliver the same\nkinda value through IT services, right?\n\n263\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.290\nSo, would you consider yourself\nan IT service provider?\n\n264\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually kind\nof a hard one to think of,\n\n265\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.840\ncuz it depends on how you\ndefine the idea of IT.\n\n266\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.950\nWhat we would probably consider ourselves\nis some kind of content provider.\n\n267\n00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; More than the idea of IT, but\n\n268\n00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.680\nsometimes, we kind of look at ourselves\nand we go, yes, we're an IT provider.\n\n269\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.780\nSo, it's hard for us to distinguish\nthe arena or the area's of being\n\n270\n00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.460\nsuper specific, but I think we're\nactually more of a content provider.\n\n271\n00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.750\n&gt;&gt; I think you probably are, too.\n\n272\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.680\nThe way I address it, Dan,\n\n273\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.200\nthat's what people come for,\nthat your content has to be IT focused,\n\n274\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.620\nthat you have a lot of smart IT people\nthat help you deliver this content.\n\n275\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.720\nNot just in terms of subject matter\nexperts, but in terms of video technology.\n\n276\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.610\nNetwork technology,\ncontent management technology, etc.\n\n277\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:33.390\nSo, what's nice about this\nis that ITIL certainly\n\n278\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.770\nmakes it easily to discern,\nyou are a service.\n\n279\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.455\nGenerically, you provide a service.\n\n280\n00:14:38.455 --> 00:14:40.300\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You can apply these same principle, and\n\n281\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.470\nI've seen it happen in industries,\nalthough ITIL,\n\n282\n00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.754\nthere's IT in ITIL,\n&gt;&gt; It is about IT service management,\n\n283\n00:14:47.754 --> 00:14:49.440\nit is about IT service management.\n\n284\n00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.155\nThese principles can apply to service\ndelivery anywhere in any type of industry,\n\n285\n00:14:54.155 --> 00:14:58.480\nit really can, so, that's not a valuable\nstatement for ITIL in general.\n\n286\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:00.939\nGood questions.\n\n287\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nas we continue on then, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.110\nWe've already taken a look at\njust a couple different examples\n\n289\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.260\nthat we've been talking about here.\n\n290\n00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.320\nSo, when we're preparing for the exam,\nwe understand now that the vocabulary\n\n291\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.690\nis very important, that we keep that\nin mind, also reading the questions.\n\n292\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.510\nUnlike me, where I read the wrong\nquestion, and I answered a right answer,\n\n293\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.219\nbut, the wrong answer at the same time.\n\n294\n00:15:24.219 --> 00:15:26.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are some of the things we have to\n\n295\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.730\nactually focus in on when we're\ngetting ready for the exam.\n\n296\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.510\nThose concepts and\nunderstanding the basic vocabulary, and\n\n297\n00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.740\nthe definitions are also\ngonna help us out.\n\n298\n00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.032\nAll right, so Terry, when we start to take\na look at the idea of orientation then,\n\n299\n00:15:40.032 --> 00:15:45.018\nand the review of this, how are we gonna\nnarrow in that focus to what we need for\n\n300\n00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:47.499\nthe release control and validation?\n\n301\n00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:49.136\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n302\n00:15:49.136 --> 00:15:53.892\nWell, there's still some\nconcepts to be played out\n\n303\n00:15:53.892 --> 00:15:57.146\nhere in terms of The broad strokes.\n\n304\n00:15:57.146 --> 00:16:01.347\nYou said narrow it down, I still say\nwe can work rather broadly still and\n\n305\n00:16:01.347 --> 00:16:05.830\nthe broad scope is that ITIL provides\nall type of service providers as you can\n\n306\n00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:06.479\nsee here.\n\n307\n00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:08.520\nWhile these are distinctions,\n\n308\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.045\nthey are kinda distinctions without\na difference, if I could use those terms.\n\n309\n00:16:12.045 --> 00:16:15.657\nITIL would provide the same time\nof guidance, generally speaking,\n\n310\n00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:18.784\nat a broad level,\nto all three types of service providers.\n\n311\n00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:23.965\nYou say internal service providers\nare those like IT departments.\n\n312\n00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; They're like IT departments\n\n313\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.190\nthat are embedded within a business.\n\n314\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.500\nFirst, in my experience,\nI worked for a large organization.\n\n315\n00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.980\nBy large I mean hundreds of thousands\nof employees, 93 countries kinda large.\n\n316\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.292\nSo each of these business units, there was\na manufacturing business unit, there was\n\n317\n00:16:43.292 --> 00:16:46.880\na research and development business unit,\nthere was a sales business unit.\n\n318\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.552\nThese different business units had\ntheir own IT departments, right?\n\n319\n00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:53.150\nThat's what ITIL will call\nan internal service provider.\n\n320\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.750\nThey're internal to those business units.\n\n321\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.520\nAnd they provide specialized services for\nthose business units.\n\n322\n00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.180\nBecause R&amp;D's different than\nmanufacturing, different from sales.\n\n323\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.280\nSo they kinda focus on those.\n\n324\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.041\nAs opposed to shared services unit, which\nis also an internal IT department if you\n\n325\n00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:11.810\nwill, but\nthey provide services to everyone.\n\n326\n00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.500\nI've happened to be where I worked.\n\n327\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.195\nI worked in shared services and\nwe delivered things like e-mail services,\n\n328\n00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:21.198\ndocument management services,\nInternet portal services,\n\n329\n00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:24.622\nthose types of services that were\nconsumed by all the business units.\n\n330\n00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:26.901\nThat's why their called shared services,\nright?\n\n331\n00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:29.632\nSo again Type I and\nType II are both internal and\n\n332\n00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.505\nthen you could be an external\nservice provider,\n\n333\n00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:37.076\nwhere you actually provides services\nto people outside your organization.\n\n334\n00:17:37.076 --> 00:17:40.090\nCertainly, that's what ITProTV is, right?\n\n335\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.230\nYou provide services to folks\noutside of your organization, right?\n\n336\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.380\nAnd while you have internal technical\npeople that are providing services that\n\n337\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.810\nhelp you deliver that,\nyou're providing services externally.\n\n338\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.760\nAny given organization could\nbe all three at the same time.\n\n339\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.400\nIt's not like these paint\nthe corporate picture necessarily.\n\n340\n00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.650\nThey're just ways to describe it.\n\n341\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.520\nAnd I will say, again that this is rather\na distinction without a difference because\n\n342\n00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.230\nthe principles of service management,\nincluding those we're going to discuss in\n\n343\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.530\nthis course,\nrelease control and validation.\n\n344\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.990\nThey apply with your internal provider or\n\n345\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.018\nan external provider or shared service\nprovider, they apply to all, right?\n\n346\n00:18:18.018 --> 00:18:22.009\nJust give me an example of an organization\nthat actually has all three in play,\n\n347\n00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:22.923\nconsider a bank.\n\n348\n00:18:22.923 --> 00:18:23.735\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n349\n00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:27.750\n&gt;&gt; A bank certainly has internal IT,\nright?\n\n350\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:33.070\nThey may have special IT services for each\nbranch, or they may have IT services for\n\n351\n00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.440\nfinancial management versus consumer\nbanking versus commercial banking, right,\n\n352\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.550\ncuz they could have those\ndifferent internal ones.\n\n353\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.900\nBut they also have shared services.\n\n354\n00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.170\nI'm sure they have e-mail, right?\n\n355\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:42.670\nThey should have it.\n\n356\n00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.420\nAnd they also provide services to me,\nexternally, right?\n\n357\n00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.550\nI can go to an ATM.\n\n358\n00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.710\nThat's an external IT service really,\nright?\n\n359\n00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.377\nI can scan my checks and\ndeposit them with my phone, right?\n\n360\n00:18:54.377 --> 00:18:57.290\nSo, they're providing IT\nservices to external people, too,\n\n361\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.630\nand not necessarily for profit.\n\n362\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.970\nAll right?\n\n363\n00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:00.934\nSo, it applies to all, yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:03.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\ntaking a look at that aspect and\n\n365\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.460\nreminding ourselves of the focus in on\nthe customer aspect of this, are there any\n\n366\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.610\nother terms that really relate to that,\nthat idea of the customer focus?\n\n367\n00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n368\n00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.313\nIn fact, customers are only\none of the stakeholders.\n\n369\n00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:21.280\nAnd in the customer area you can actually\nbreak them down into a couple of people.\n\n370\n00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.080\nYou got customers and\nyou have users, right?\n\n371\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.560\nAnd you have suppliers.\n\n372\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.740\nIt'd be hard for\nme to imagine an IT service provider\n\n373\n00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.480\nthat doesn't somehow get support\nfrom some sort of suppliers.\n\n374\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.320\nYou mentioned you are outsourcing your\ncloud services for distribution, right.\n\n375\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.850\nI'm sure you have other suppliers.\n\n376\n00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.540\nIf it's not for your video equipment, it's\nfor your software, your laptops, right?\n\n377\n00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.530\nSo suppliers are also critical\nto a service provider.\n\n378\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.575\nSo their stakeholders must be managed.\n\n379\n00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:53.470\nI think it's interesting to discuss the\ndifference between a customer and a user.\n\n380\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:59.340\nPerhaps for ITProTV, they're almost\nalways the same, but not necessarily.\n\n381\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.220\nYou might have arrangements\nwith universities.\n\n382\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.930\nAnd you have a relationship with\nuniversities that allow you to\n\n383\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.370\nprovide content.\n\n384\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.910\nAnd the users end up being\nthe university students, right?\n\n385\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.490\nSame with internal providers.\n\n386\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.760\nI know that in my experience I was\nresponsible for the delivery of a learning\n\n387\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.860\nmanagement service,\nincluding a learning management system.\n\n388\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.110\nThe customer was the HR department.\n\n389\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.430\nThey're the ones that got\nthe funding to approve this,\n\n390\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.430\nthey managed the governance of learning,\nright?\n\n391\n00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.230\nSo they were the sponsor,\nthey were the customer.\n\n392\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.280\nBut yet\nusers was everyone in the company, right?\n\n393\n00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.800\nSo they are different stakeholders.\n\n394\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.190\nThey have different stakes in the game.\n\n395\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.630\nCustomers typically want it fast cheap,\nright?\n\n396\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.620\nUsers want it high quality.\n\n397\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.390\nThey can be mutually exclusive sometimes.\n\n398\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.410\nSo they do have different stakes in\nthe game, so it's considered that.\n\n399\n00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.440\nAnd of course, the service provider\nthemselves is a stakeholder.\n\n400\n00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.460\nWe have to take care of ourselves.\n\n401\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.860\nThe cobbler's kids also need shoes.\n\n402\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.150\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, on your slide that you see\nright there, you used the term purchase.\n\n403\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.350\nBut internally, how are these guys\npurchasers that you're talking about here?\n\n404\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe the word sponsor might\nbe a better term for internal ones.\n\n405\n00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.528\nBut there is money being spent, right?\n\n406\n00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:12.060\nSo who holds the budget in that case?\n\n407\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.350\nSo whether you're actually have\na formal charging in a profit center,\n\n408\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.900\neven internally is not the case or\n\n409\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.758\nnot relevant, the fact that you have\nthe sponsor, the customer, sometimes\n\n410\n00:21:22.758 --> 00:21:27.130\nit's referred to as the business, the ones\nthat are asking for it and sponsoring it.\n\n411\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.420\nThat's how that would be.\n\n412\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.260\nGood question.\n\n413\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry,\nwhat else do we need to take a look at?\n\n414\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.160\nAnd we've talked about customers now.\n\n415\n00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.800\nWe've also talked about the idea that\nwe can be that service provider.\n\n416\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.540\nAnd now you're gonna show us what here?\n\n417\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.960\n&gt;&gt; Three types of services.\n\n418\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds good.\n\n419\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Just manage the language here.\n\n420\n00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.030\nSupporting services, internal services,\nor external services.\n\n421\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.990\nIt's kinda just flipping the switch\na little bit on internal services versus\n\n422\n00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.740\nexternal, really dealing with,\nare you a provider of internal?\n\n423\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.770\nAre your customers inside\nyour organization or outside?\n\n424\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:03.310\nBut this idea of supporting services,\nconsider a customer facing service,\n\n425\n00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:08.420\nwhich we'll see a little bit later,\na customer facing service, such as e-mail,\n\n426\n00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.190\ndirectly consumed by the users and\nthe customer.\n\n427\n00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.550\nThey face the customers.\n\n428\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.040\nWhat does it take for email to work?\n\n429\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.610\nYou need server services,\n\n430\n00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:21.230\nyou need network services,\nyou need identity management services.\n\n431\n00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:26.025\nITIL, again,\nit's a distinction without a difference.\n\n432\n00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:28.440\nITIL would consider that\nthose supporting services,\n\n433\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.730\nthose things in the back end,\nalso elevated to the idea of service.\n\n434\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.935\nThey're not just solutions.\n\n435\n00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:35.616\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not just the server team,\n\n436\n00:22:35.616 --> 00:22:38.619\nthe network team, and\nthe identity management team doing things.\n\n437\n00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:40.336\nThey are providing service as well.\n\n438\n00:22:40.336 --> 00:22:45.014\nSo these same principles of quality and\ncontrol and continuous improvement should\n\n439\n00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:48.085\nbe alive and well for\nsupporting services as well as for\n\n440\n00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:51.380\nthose services that directly\nface the customer, okay.\n\n441\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:56.247\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, the idea here for\nus to remember from foundations then,\n\n442\n00:22:56.247 --> 00:23:00.303\nis that these services all follow\nin that same life cycle as well,\n\n443\n00:23:00.303 --> 00:23:04.028\nthat we have to be aware of and\nmake sure that we understand.\n\n444\n00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:08.126\nIf not, we're gonna fail in some part of\nunderstanding what needs to be done as\n\n445\n00:23:08.126 --> 00:23:10.000\na service to our customers.\n\n446\n00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.890\nSo, Terry,\nwe've got about five minutes left.\n\n447\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.415\nWhat are some of the things that we need\nto make sure that we jam in here before we\n\n448\n00:23:16.415 --> 00:23:17.521\nclose out our service.\n\n449\n00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:21.616\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point, well, just a quick\nreview I mentioned some other services.\n\n450\n00:23:21.616 --> 00:23:24.060\nAgain, the language is important.\n\n451\n00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.260\nCore services, enabling services,\n\n452\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.270\nenhancing services\nare important to understand.\n\n453\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.930\nThese are again words that\nwill be used on the exam so\n\n454\n00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.992\nyou need to know what they mean.\n\n455\n00:23:32.992 --> 00:23:35.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A core service as everyone is using it.\n\n456\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.494\nEnabling services is synonymous\nwith supporting services,\n\n457\n00:23:38.494 --> 00:23:40.009\nthose things in the back-end.\n\n458\n00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:42.390\nThey allow that core service to happen.\n\n459\n00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.286\nAnd then enhancing services.\n\n460\n00:23:44.286 --> 00:23:48.951\nStaying with e-mail example,\nI know when I first got e-mail years ago,\n\n461\n00:23:48.951 --> 00:23:51.598\nwe didn't have mobile e-mail, right?\n\n462\n00:23:51.598 --> 00:23:54.280\nThat was an enhancing\nservice only few people got.\n\n463\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.028\nRight, now it's a bit more ubiquitous.\n\n464\n00:23:56.028 --> 00:23:59.520\nSo enhancing services often become core.\n\n465\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.620\nThat's another example of those, right?\n\n466\n00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.260\nAnd then there's,\nremember the word utility?\n\n467\n00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.700\nIt showed up on the little\nsample quiz earlier?\n\n468\n00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.550\nUtility is fitness for purpose,\nwarranty is fit for use.\n\n469\n00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.030\nAnd warranty is the word associated with,\n\n470\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.700\nis it available when\nit's supposed to be used?\n\n471\n00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.950\nIs it available?\n\n472\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.780\nUtility is, is it worth using?\n\n473\n00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.000\nDoes it have the functionality?\n\n474\n00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.470\nDoes it make my job easier?\n\n475\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.255\nDoes it give me some outcomes?\n\n476\n00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:26.390\nThat's utility side.\n\n477\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.070\nWarranty is,\nis it even available to be used?\n\n478\n00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.710\nAgain from the foundation exam,\na couple of key words there.\n\n479\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.730\nAs a search provider, you must be able\nto provide both utility and warranty.\n\n480\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.980\nYou can image if you have a well designed\napplication, it has all the functionality\n\n481\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.718\na user could ever want, but it falls\ndown everyday, it's not very valuable.\n\n482\n00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:50.995\nIt's also possible to have\na highly available piece\n\n483\n00:24:50.995 --> 00:24:53.788\nof equipment that's not doing anything for\nanybody.\n\n484\n00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:58.173\nIt's not functional enough for anybody,\nit's a poorly designed service.\n\n485\n00:24:58.173 --> 00:25:01.385\nSo that's what that is.\n\n486\n00:25:01.385 --> 00:25:02.460\nRemember the word asset.\n\n487\n00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.585\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; You saw that one.\n\n488\n00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:07.645\nAn asset is a resource or a capability, so\nyou got this one question right, good job.\n\n489\n00:25:07.645 --> 00:25:09.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; An asset again,\n\n490\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.570\nhere's ITIL taking a word that has meaning\nand giving it very specific meaning.\n\n491\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:18.270\nDoes it say financial, does it say it has\nan asset tag on the laptop lid, right?\n\n492\n00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.120\nIt's just a resource or a capability.\n\n493\n00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.930\nCertainly, a laptop is a resource,.\n\n494\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.820\nCapability is a bit\nmore intangible though.\n\n495\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.190\nAnd these assets exist in two domains,\nthat's what I talked about.\n\n496\n00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.190\nThey exist within the service provider and\nthey exist within the customer as well.\n\n497\n00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.680\nSo customers have assets and\nIT service providers have assets.\n\n498\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.350\nAnd effectively what you're doing\nis you're adding the assets from IT\n\n499\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.380\nto the assets of the customer to\ngenerate some sort of outcome.\n\n500\n00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.890\nAs an example, I did some consulting with,\n\n501\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.810\nhappened to be an oil company,\na few weeks ago.\n\n502\n00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.280\nWhat does an oil company\nwant to do as a business?\n\n503\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.122\nThey wanna find it, they wanna extract it,\nand they wanna distribute it.\n\n504\n00:26:03.122 --> 00:26:05.640\nThat's the three major activities.\n\n505\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.390\nThat's the assets.\n\n506\n00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.415\nThey have chemical engineers,\nthey have equipment operators,\n\n507\n00:26:09.415 --> 00:26:12.116\nthat's the resource the company has,\nthe business has.\n\n508\n00:26:12.116 --> 00:26:15.180\nThey got this technology,\nI mean these resources.\n\n509\n00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.950\nThey got smart people that\nknow how to do those things.\n\n510\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.780\nWhat does IT do for them?\n\n511\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.150\nI was amazed, I mean I guess I shouldn't\nbe, I've been in IT for many years.\n\n512\n00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.620\nBut the things that IT can do for\nan oil company.\n\n513\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.410\nThey can put an instrument on the bottom\nof a drill and it can go down and\n\n514\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.680\ndiscover things and send it back.\n\n515\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.530\nSend that real time information\nback to a central repository so\n\n516\n00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.390\nit can be looked at by a chemist or by\na geophysicists or those types of folks.\n\n517\n00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.610\nSo you got the smart people,\nthe chemist, geophysicists and\n\n518\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.570\nhere is IT delivering data,\nthey can transform that into animation and\n\n519\n00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.780\nmake some wise decisions based on it.\n\n520\n00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.390\nSo again,\nIT assets being added to customer assets.\n\n521\n00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.450\nService asserts, customer assets\ntogether forming some value.\n\n522\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.540\nSo that's a good place to stop for\nnow, I think.\n\n523\n00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.470\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great, Terry.\n\n524\n00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.860\nAs we continue on, we're just showing you\nsome of the basic things that we need to\n\n525\n00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.530\nensure that we can review and\n\n526\n00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:20.180\nget ready as we head on into the idea\nof release, control, and validation.\n\n527\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.704\nReview these skills,\nmake sure you feel comfortable with them.\n\n528\n00:27:22.704 --> 00:27:27.126\nAgain, even if you have already done\nthe ITIL foundation, it's a great time for\n\n529\n00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:31.549\nyou to review that before we start on some\nnew information that we have to be able to\n\n530\n00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.850\nchew on to get ready for\nthis exam as well.\n\n531\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.770\nAnd of course,\n\n532\n00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:38.950\nTerry has also given us a few examples\nto where you also see this in real life.\n\n533\n00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:43.790\nAnd since this particular exam is focused\nin on the idea of practicality and\n\n534\n00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.210\norientation, and transitioning,\nit's a great place\n\n535\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.180\nto just start off in the right things\nwhich is always a review of foundations.\n\n536\n00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.850\nWell that's also a great place for\nus to end this episode as well.\n\n537\n00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.142\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n538\n00:27:59.142 --> 00:28:00.229\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n539\n00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:04.438\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Release, Control, and Validation.\n\n540\n00:28:05.954 --> 00:28:11.843\n[MUSIC]\n\n541\n00:28:11.843 --> 00:28:14.902\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.445\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.668\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.910\nI'm your host, Ronny Wong, and today we're\ntaking look at ITIL release, control,\n\n7\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.180\nand validation.\n\n8\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.330\nWe're specifically going to be diving\ninto, well, a little bit more review.\n\n9\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.310\nMaking sure that we understand\na bit more vocabulary and\n\n10\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.230\nsome of the different concepts that we\nneed to have solidified in our mind before\n\n11\n00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.720\nwe move into those different\nconcepts at the intermediate level.\n\n12\n00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.570\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be\nour subject matter expert himself, Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.300\nTerry Decker.\n\n14\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.620\nTerry, welcome back to the show.\n\n15\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.670\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be back.\n\n16\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.960\nAnd as Ronnie said,\nwe got just a few more concepts and words,\n\n17\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.750\nvocabulary to figure\nout before we dive in.\n\n18\n00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.150\nAnd not too much more to go on\nthis review, but let's dig in.\n\n19\n00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.880\nFirst of all, what is a process?\n\n20\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.360\nAgain, nothing magical\nabout this definition.\n\n21\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.730\nA structured set of activities.\n\n22\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.630\nThey have a very specific goal in mind,\nthey give some sort of output to\n\n23\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.880\nsome sort of stakeholder, and\nsomething gets them started.\n\n24\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520\nWe're gonna specifically be talking\nabout seven different processes\n\n25\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.240\nas we dive in to RCV in later episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.060\nAnd basically,\n\n27\n00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.590\nthat's the episode outline, is each of\nthese processes we go through, right?\n\n28\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.060\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry,\nwhen we talk about the idea of process,\n\n29\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.540\na lot of us just work through things.\n\n30\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540\nWe tend to just kinda go,\nokay, here it is.\n\n31\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.720\nAnd we might do the same\nthing one way one time,\n\n32\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.230\nthe second time I might\ndo it a different way.\n\n33\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.850\nAnd they both seem to\naccomplish the same thing.\n\n34\n00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.660\nBut when you're talking about\nin terms of a real process,\n\n35\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.900\nthough, you're actually saying that this\nkind of needs to happen uniformly, right?\n\n36\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely structured.\n\n37\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.160\nA process is defined,\nit has specific outputs in mind,\n\n38\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.785\nspecific stakeholders in mind,\nit is repeatable.\n\n39\n00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:55.150\nNow, certainly,\n\n40\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.170\nin the life cycle of a process there's\ngonna be different levels of maturity.\n\n41\n00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.290\nAnd if you go to any given process and\naudit it, it might be, well,\n\n42\n00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.670\nlet's document it, but\nwe don't really follow it, right?\n\n43\n00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.625\nYou can certainly get that.\n\n44\n00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or we follow it, but\n\n45\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.930\nwe have to kinda go around it this way,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.160\nSo that always happens.\n\n47\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.380\nSo a part of process ownership,\nwhich we'll talk a little bit later,\n\n48\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.100\nis making sure that the process is fit for\npurpose.\n\n49\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.442\nSo ITIL, effectively, in one regard you\ncould look at ITIL as a process model,\n\n50\n00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:27.826\nwhich is a great segue to the next topic,\nis that a process model,\n\n51\n00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:31.045\na process doesn't exist in a vacuum.\n\n52\n00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:33.065\nIt has to have controls around it.\n\n53\n00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:34.615\nIt has to have objectives around it.\n\n54\n00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.735\nWhat are we trying to\ndo with this process?\n\n55\n00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.695\nWhat value is it supposed\nto be delivering, right?\n\n56\n00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.889\nAnd then, if you look at\nthe lower part of this graphic,\n\n57\n00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.178\nyou see there's actually\npractitioners of the process,\n\n58\n00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:46.767\npeople that know the process and\nwhat it's supposed to be doing.\n\n59\n00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:50.892\nAnd in the middle is actually\nwhat it does, the process.\n\n60\n00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:54.232\nSomething gets it started,\nit has some sort of output, all right?\n\n61\n00:02:54.232 --> 00:02:58.642\nBut they key takeaway here is\nprocesses don't exist in a vacuum.\n\n62\n00:02:58.642 --> 00:03:03.452\nAnd the way this plays out on exam\nis it could be in the scenario,\n\n63\n00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:07.180\nin the exam, they might describe,\nyou've defined a process, but\n\n64\n00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.860\nit's not really bought into,\npeople aren't following it, right?\n\n65\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.840\nSo your point of inquiry is in\nwhy aren't people following it?\n\n66\n00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.520\nDo we need policy to make people do it,\nor is it just a broken process and\n\n67\n00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.220\ntherefore not effective, right?\n\n68\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.040\nSo again, as it plays out on a scenario,\n\n69\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.165\nyou must remember that a process does\nnot exist on an island by itself.\n\n70\n00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.220\nThere's things around it\nthat make it successful.\n\n71\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.000\nSuch as policy, such as well trained\npeople in measurement and audit.\n\n72\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.380\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry, when I take a look\nat what you're showing us here,\n\n73\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.400\nthough, on the left hand side,\nit seems to be in pretty big letters here.\n\n74\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.240\nYou gotta explain what\nthis means a little bit,\n\n75\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.730\nhow it can actually expand organizational\nand even geographical boundaries.\n\n76\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.160\nWhat are you talking about there?\n\n77\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.290\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nconsider your own process model here.\n\n78\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.920\nYou have a process by which people\ncan engage for ITProTV content.\n\n79\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.289\nAre there geographic boundaries?\n\n80\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Not that we know of.\n\n81\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Not geographic constraints, but\nthere's certainly geographic scope, right?\n\n82\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.630\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n83\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.250\n&gt;&gt; But you need to understand that\ngeography when you're providing it.\n\n84\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.750\nDo you actually serve worldwide,\nanywhere there's an Internet connection?\n\n85\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.780\nPretty much anywhere there is.\n\n86\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.080\nSo your geographic boundaries aren't so\nbuilt in, right?\n\n87\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.060\nThat's for sure.\n\n88\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.880\nAs part of your service provision,\nthough, the process of on-boarding\n\n89\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.180\nsubject matter experts,\nyou had to deal with my geography.\n\n90\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n91\n00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.130\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I don't live here\nwhere ITProTV studios are.\n\n92\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.370\nSo I had to get here, travel here.\n\n93\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.110\nSo, part of the process is engaging me.\n\n94\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.463\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; To make sure that I had accommodations,\n\n95\n00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:41.360\nto make sure that I was able\nto get here on time, etc.\n\n96\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.601\nIs part of the process model for\non-boarding subject matter expert.\n\n97\n00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.800\nSo, yeah, and\ncertain organizational boundaries.\n\n98\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.530\nI'm not an ITProTV employee.\n\n99\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.760\nSo there's a process that also is spanning\norganizational boundaries as well.\n\n100\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.930\nAs it relates to an IT service,\nyou certainly got boundaries of\n\n101\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.660\nyour customers could be\nat geographic locations.\n\n102\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.220\nYou have suppliers that\nare helping you do things, so\n\n103\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.030\nyou're crossing organizational\nboundaries there.\n\n104\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.150\nIf you're trying to manage a change, which\nwe'll talk about later on, and to get this\n\n105\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.520\nchange fully done you need some\ndevelopment resources and you outsource\n\n106\n00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.230\nthe development, obviously you're passing\norganizational boundaries there as well.\n\n107\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n108\n00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.110\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for asking.\n\n109\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.110\nAnother topic to pick up on.\n\n110\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.060\nAnother word ITIL uses is function.\n\n111\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.755\nSo we got processes which\nare a structure set of activity.\n\n112\n00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:39.050\nITIL describes 26 processes, we're talking\nabout seven of them in this course.\n\n113\n00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.795\nBut they also use the word function.\n\n114\n00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:45.200\nAnd function's very specifically used.\n\n115\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.000\nIt means the group of people that get work\ndone for the IT service provider, right?\n\n116\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.665\nThey have special skills and\nspecial tools.\n\n117\n00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:59.970\nITIL is really good at distilling\nbroad concepts into digestible bits.\n\n118\n00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.487\nSo they describe four functions,\nand only for functions.\n\n119\n00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.829\nThe service desk that single point\nof contact between the end users and\n\n120\n00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:08.309\nthe service provider.\n\n121\n00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:09.754\nIT operations.\n\n122\n00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:13.386\nThose are groups of people\nwith special skills and\n\n123\n00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:18.250\ntools that get the day to day\nbusiness of IT accomplished, right?\n\n124\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.500\nBack ups and restores.\n\n125\n00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.310\nStorage maintenance, printer maintenance,\ndata centers, fuel generators,\n\n126\n00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.420\npower conditioners, those type of things.\n\n127\n00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.480\nThe day to day grind of IT.\n\n128\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.130\nAnd then, technical management and\napplication management,\n\n129\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.210\nthose are functions that ITIL\ndescribes as being able to go deep and\n\n130\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.110\nwide into their areas of specialty.\n\n131\n00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.790\nThey have a lot in common, they just\nhave different domains of knowledge.\n\n132\n00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.677\nTechnical management\nis the infrastructure,\n\n133\n00:06:43.677 --> 00:06:44.768\nthe things in the back end.\n\n134\n00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:48.430\nServers, databases,\nmainframe computers, networks.\n\n135\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.850\nApplication management are those skill\nsets that are closer to the front\n\n136\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.110\nnear the users.\n\n137\n00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.490\nWhat applications are being used?\n\n138\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.380\nAgain, those two functions, technical\nmanagement and application management.\n\n139\n00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.720\nWhile they have different\nareas of specialty,\n\n140\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.010\nthey focus on those areas at a deep and\nwide level.\n\n141\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.530\nSo they can show up at strategic meetings.\n\n142\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.550\nThey can show up at tactical meetings.\n\n143\n00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.900\nThey can make decisions on\nwhether we should buy it or\n\n144\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.080\nexternally provide it, right?\n\n145\n00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.110\nThey help you make decisions on cost and\nrisk and value, right?\n\n146\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.560\nSo IT operations, day to day grind,\ntechnical management,\n\n147\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.520\napplication management, deep dives.\n\n148\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.510\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry, when you talk\nabout this idea of functionality,\n\n149\n00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.900\nI was reading the definition here, and I\ntend to pick things apart when I probably\n\n150\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.340\nshouldn't, but\nyou'll have to tell me or not.\n\n151\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; When you talk about this idea of\n\n152\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.350\npeople doing it, but also tools.\n\n153\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.282\nSo, for example, the idea of the service\ndesk is not really only inclusive of\n\n154\n00:07:47.282 --> 00:07:50.076\nthe person doing it, but\nalso their technical tools.\n\n155\n00:07:50.076 --> 00:07:52.039\nLike if they're carrying a laptop around,\n\n156\n00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:55.179\nthat's also part of this function\nthat we're talking about as well?\n\n157\n00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:55.751\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n158\n00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:57.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Special skills and tools.\n\n159\n00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.223\nSo obviously for\na service desk to be functional, and\n\n160\n00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:05.070\nI use the word function there, to be\nfunctional as opposed to dysfunctional.\n\n161\n00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.200\nIt would need to have\nperhaps telephone services,\n\n162\n00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.360\nit needs to have laptops perhaps.\n\n163\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.710\nIt needs to have a ticketing system,\nlog these incidents that come in.\n\n164\n00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.570\nThose types of things, so\na means of communication that's outreach.\n\n165\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.390\nMaybe the service desk is engaged through\na web interface and not the telephone.\n\n166\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.320\nThat could be a toolset.\n\n167\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.870\nMaybe the service desk is engaged\nthrough chat, various ways.\n\n168\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.910\nSo exactly, you're pointing to it,\n\n169\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.960\nvery good Ronnie, is that the service\ndesk has these people but\n\n170\n00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.580\nit's also maintenance of those tools and\nthose toolsets that make them successful.\n\n171\n00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.750\nAnd you could apply that\nto any of the functions.\n\n172\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.760\nWhat does a data center technician need\nto be successful, those types of things.\n\n173\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.292\nYep, good questions.\n\n174\n00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.670\nAll right Terry so now that we've\ntalked about just briefly the idea of\n\n175\n00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.370\nprocesses and functions, trying to make\nsure that we get our heads wrap around\n\n176\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.160\nthat as far as review before\nwe head into the intermediate.\n\n177\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.270\nWhat is another concept that\nwe need to really focus in on?\n\n178\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.060\n&gt;&gt; Well this is another one to showed up\non one of those review questions about\n\n179\n00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.180\nthe idea of RACI and you are very good to\ncome up to those responsible accountable,\n\n180\n00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.650\nconsulted, and informed.\n\n181\n00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.760\nAnd that's what it is.\n\n182\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.630\nAnd you see from the graphic here is that,\n\n183\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:15.980\na RACI Matrix if you will, allows you the\nopportunity to map roles to activities.\n\n184\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.460\nAnd describe varying degrees\nof interface with activity.\n\n185\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.600\nSo accountable, in fact I've seen it\nreferred to as ARCI instead of RACI.\n\n186\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.660\nBecause the A is kind of the boss here,\nand\n\n187\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.360\nA is accountable,\nthey don't actually do anything.\n\n188\n00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.700\nThey just make sure it gets done.\n\n189\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.970\nSo in this case, the director of\nservice management is accountable for\n\n190\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.150\nactivity one.\n\n191\n00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.080\nThey happen to be responsible for it too.\n\n192\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.450\nIf you look a bit later you'll see that\nthe Director of Service Management\n\n193\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.830\nis accountable for activity two.\n\n194\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.840\nThat would mean that the Director\nof Service Management makes sure\n\n195\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.730\nactivity two gets done.\n\n196\n00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.710\nBut they don't actually do it.\n\n197\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.980\nSo some rules of thumb about the RACI are,\n\n198\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.590\nis that you should only have\none accountable person.\n\n199\n00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.470\nI kinda learned this in CPR,\nwhen I took CPR training.\n\n200\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.373\nYou don't just call out, someone call 911.\n\n201\n00:10:05.373 --> 00:10:08.460\nYou point to someone and\nsay, Ronnie, you call 911.\n\n202\n00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.720\nSo you make someone accountable,\nthey get it done.\n\n203\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.000\nThey make sure it's done.\n\n204\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.660\nBecause an accountable person\ndoesn't actually do anything,\n\n205\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.420\nanother rule of thumb for a RACI is you\nhave to have at least one responsible for\n\n206\n00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.169\nany given activity.\n\n207\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.330\nSo if you look at this chart and\n\n208\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.470\njust imagine that these\nactivities would be named.\n\n209\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.750\nLet's say activity one is\ndefined testing strategy.\n\n210\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.840\nActivity two is write the tests.\n\n211\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.030\nActivity three could be execute tests, so\n\n212\n00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.230\nif you lay those things out\nyou can assign the roles.\n\n213\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.610\nAnd these roles could be names.\n\n214\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:50.340\nThe advantage of putting a role there, is\nif you have a shifting cast of characters,\n\n215\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.320\nyou always know what role is being played.\n\n216\n00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.970\nBut at any rate,\nif you design a RACI chart effectively,\n\n217\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.200\nit becomes a transparent\nmeans of communication.\n\n218\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.200\nIt kind of builds in some accountability.\n\n219\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.330\nIf you know you're responsible for\nsomething, and\n\n220\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.940\nyou know that everyone else knows\nyou're responsible for it, and\n\n221\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.100\nyou show up with the meeting next week and\nyou still have that R next year name.\n\n222\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.020\nJust as most organizations go around\nfind what are you working on, this\n\n223\n00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.780\nbecomes a transparent way to show what\nyou're working on and what you're up to.\n\n224\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.363\nAnd this don't exist in an island either,\n\n225\n00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:27.140\nyou can have each work team\ncould have their own RACI chart.\n\n226\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.914\nEach process could define RACI charts,\n\n227\n00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:33.023\nthat define who does what and\nwhen they do it.\n\n228\n00:11:33.023 --> 00:11:36.500\nSo it's a way of accounting for\nwho's doing what and\n\n229\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.260\nhow they relate to each other.\n\n230\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, I have a little bit of\na background in project management and\n\n231\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.160\nwe use something very similar here.\n\n232\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n233\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.640\n&gt;&gt; Is this something in ITIL where you\nhave to do something in the beginning\n\n234\n00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.980\nof the process, or is it something\nthat can be implemented later on?\n\n235\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.580\nOr does it matter?\n\n236\n00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.920\n&gt;&gt; I think the best answer to that is yes,\nyou should do it earlier than later.\n\n237\n00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n238\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.580\nreal realize it's a living document,\nit can change.\n\n239\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.790\nI think your project management\nexperience probably bears that out.\n\n240\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.090\nYou wanna know what\nactivities need to happen and\n\n241\n00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.460\nyou wanna assign resources to\nactivities as soon as possible.\n\n242\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.040\nIn the absence of doing that, you may find\nyourself without the appropriate resources\n\n243\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.200\nat the appropriate time.\n\n244\n00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.305\nSo the same kinda project management\nprinciples could apply to this.\n\n245\n00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:23.860\nWhile you're defining a process, if\nyou're thinking about defining a process,\n\n246\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.660\nyou may not know who the cast\nof characters are gonna be.\n\n247\n00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.680\nSo maybe it's okay to do\nit later in some regards.\n\n248\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.640\nBut sooner than later is better, and\n\n249\n00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.180\nrealizing it's a living document\nthat can change over time.\n\n250\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.310\nAnd that it's a communication document,\n\n251\n00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.006\nit allows people to understand,\ntransparently to all, who's doing what.\n\n252\n00:12:42.006 --> 00:12:47.780\nAll right, good questions.\n\n253\n00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.130\nBrings good concept back to processes.\n\n254\n00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:54.810\nITIL describes a role\ncalled process owner, and\n\n255\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:00.340\na process owner as the name suggests,\nowns the process.\n\n256\n00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.130\nHaving loaded up this word accountable\nin previous, we talked about the RACI.\n\n257\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.900\nThey don't actually do the process,\nbut they are accountable.\n\n258\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.540\nThey make sure it gets done.\n\n259\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.460\nThey make sure the process is defined,\n\n260\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.890\nthat the objectives of the process are\nmet, ultimately that it's fit for purpose.\n\n261\n00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.070\nSome acronyms checks here.\n\n262\n00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:23.000\nI see there's a define KPI's,\nthat's key performance indicators.\n\n263\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.490\nThese are measurements so\n\n264\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.970\na process on a what does the process\nlook like when it's successful?\n\n265\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.140\nSo consider a process\nlike change management.\n\n266\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.060\nYou can even keep it with a scope\nof technical change management.\n\n267\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.930\nWhat does a successful\nchange management process,\n\n268\n00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.260\nwhat kind of characteristics does it have?\n\n269\n00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.130\nAny idea, Ronnie?\n\n270\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.490\n&gt;&gt; It has to actually be specific.\n\n271\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.880\nWe have to be able to verify\nthat it actually has been done,\n\n272\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.850\nor isn't done successfully a lot of times.\n\n273\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.440\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, good point.\n\n274\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.370\nA good change manager process can\ndetermine whether the change was\n\n275\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.910\nsuccessful or not.\n\n276\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.440\nSo maybe you measure the percentage\nof successful changes.\n\n277\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.510\nAnd maybe you measure how many\nchanges had to be rolled back.\n\n278\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.010\nUnsuccessful changes,\nthose kind of things.\n\n279\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.597\nEven raw measurements, such as,\nvolume of changes could be meaningful.\n\n280\n00:14:12.597 --> 00:14:16.788\nJust how many changes do you have\nthis week, are you changing a lot?\n\n281\n00:14:16.788 --> 00:14:21.050\nSometimes if you go into an organization\nand see a lot of churn on changes,\n\n282\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.630\nit could mean that hm,\nyou're not very good at your requirements.\n\n283\n00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.500\nYou're not gathering\nyour requirements well.\n\n284\n00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.700\nThese kinds of measurements, while they\npoint to the health of change management,\n\n285\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.100\nthey can also give you indications of\nthe health of other processes around it.\n\n286\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.310\nWhich maybe you're not\ndiscerning processes well.\n\n287\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:41.045\nMaybe your testing process is not well\ndone, that's why things are failing.\n\n288\n00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:44.570\nSo every process should be measured and\n\n289\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.240\ncoming up with those key performance\nindicators for the process is\n\n290\n00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.000\nan activity of the process owner\nthemselves, setting the stage for success.\n\n291\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.050\nNow getting closer to\nthe ground a little bit,\n\n292\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.600\nthe process owner describing the process\nmaking sure that it's fit for\n\n293\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.540\npurpose, the process manager's actually\ngetting it done on a day to day basis,\n\n294\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.660\nresponsible for\nthe operational management.\n\n295\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.450\nSo we have accountable,\nthey're not actually doing it but\n\n296\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.480\nnow you're getting closer to\nthe ground with process manager.\n\n297\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.950\nThey're managing the day-to-day and\nthat leads to a process practitioner.\n\n298\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.100\nSomeone with the execute\nsteps within that process.\n\n299\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.000\nI wanna caution you on a little bit,\njust to make sure you understand.\n\n300\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.340\nWhat we've talked about on process owner,\nprocess manager, process practitioner.\n\n301\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.000\nThis is not describing\nan organizational hierarchy,\n\n302\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.060\nthey're simply describing roles.\n\n303\n00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.190\nAnd what I mean by that, it's possible for\n\n304\n00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.760\nprocess practitioner to\noutrank a process manager.\n\n305\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.160\nIt's possible, I mean think about\nchanged management just as an example.\n\n306\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.798\nMaybe the changed management process\nrequires senior vice president approval\n\n307\n00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:50.258\nfor some kind of change.\n\n308\n00:15:50.258 --> 00:15:53.491\nIt's such a major change that we're\nnot gonna sign this off unless we get\n\n309\n00:15:53.491 --> 00:15:55.455\nthe senior vice presidents approval on it.\n\n310\n00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.241\nSo there's a practitioner\nin practical terms.\n\n311\n00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:03.071\nThat practitioner does something within\nthe process they were approving it.\n\n312\n00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:06.172\nAnd yet the process manager could\ncertainly not be a senior vice\n\n313\n00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:07.250\npresident, right?\n\n314\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.518\nSomeone down stream, and the same thing,\n\n315\n00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.548\na process manager could\noutrank a process owner, okay?\n\n316\n00:16:12.548 --> 00:16:14.220\nIt's not hierarchical in that regard.\n\n317\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.328\nThese roles though,\nnot only by name are they important, but\n\n318\n00:16:18.328 --> 00:16:19.945\nin practice they are important.\n\n319\n00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:24.565\nIf you don't define a process owner in\nyour organization for any given of these\n\n320\n00:16:24.565 --> 00:16:28.773\nprocesses, how do you know the processes\nis gonna be fit for a purpose?\n\n321\n00:16:28.773 --> 00:16:30.597\nThat's how ITIL sets this up.\n\n322\n00:16:30.597 --> 00:16:35.670\nWithout having a person accountable for\nit, it just kinda happens, right?\n\n323\n00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.740\nAnd you're ruling by a committee.\n\n324\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.934\nITIL believes strongly and recommends\nstrongly that in terms of process,\n\n325\n00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:45.870\nyou need to have specific ownership,\na named individual, to own it.\n\n326\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.892\nThat doesn't mean a given person\ncouldn't own more than one process.\n\n327\n00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:54.272\nOr that that given person couldn't\nbe both the process owner and\n\n328\n00:16:54.272 --> 00:16:56.229\na process manager, right?\n\n329\n00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:58.440\nCuz once you own the process,\nyou could also manage it,\n\n330\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.004\nyou could even be a practitioner in it.\n\n331\n00:17:00.004 --> 00:17:04.398\nAgain, it's not in our organizational\nstructure, these are just roles that ITIL\n\n332\n00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:07.492\nrecommends should be in play\nas relate to process, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:11.067\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry when we talked\nabout that idea of process and\n\n334\n00:17:11.067 --> 00:17:15.125\nunderstanding that each particular\nprocess needs at least an owner,\n\n335\n00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:18.303\nsomebody to also to implement\na practice of it as well.\n\n336\n00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:21.850\nThat also means that we actually have\nto have some type of service involved\n\n337\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:23.930\nwith that as well, right?\n\n338\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.330\n&gt;&gt; The ultimate goal for for\n\n339\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:31.420\nITIL and IT service management is\nthe delivery of quality IT services.\n\n340\n00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.530\nHigh quality IT services.\n\n341\n00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.080\nThat accountability rests\non a very specific person.\n\n342\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.000\nIt's called the service owner.\n\n343\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.680\nAs you look at the slide here,\nthe service owner is accountable for\n\n344\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.010\nthe delivery of the IT service.\n\n345\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.298\nAgain, they are not making it,\nthey're not doing it.\n\n346\n00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.870\nBut they are accountable for\n\n347\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.600\nthe IT service delivering\nvalue to the business, right?\n\n348\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.300\nSo, to do that,\nthe service owner is gonna be aware of\n\n349\n00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.600\nthe processes that make\nthe service successful, right?\n\n350\n00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.830\nAs an example, I was the service owner for\na learning management service.\n\n351\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.610\nThe system was part of the service.\n\n352\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:12.510\nAnother part of the service was converting\nPowerPoints to e-learning, right?\n\n353\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.910\nNot necessarily a direct IT service.\n\n354\n00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.938\nWe had to get the PowerPoints in, we had\nto massage them, and send them back out.\n\n355\n00:18:20.938 --> 00:18:22.840\nSo it was really\na transactional type service,\n\n356\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.910\nas opposed to just setting up a system and\npeople use the system.\n\n357\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.283\nThis service had some transactions in it,\nright?\n\n358\n00:18:29.283 --> 00:18:34.175\nSo as a service owner, I needed to be\naware of the capabilities of that process,\n\n359\n00:18:34.175 --> 00:18:37.270\nof that particular\naspects of that service.\n\n360\n00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:41.790\nHow well were we handling that kind\nof transactional activity, right?\n\n361\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.920\nI was accountable as a service owner for\nthat service, okay?\n\n362\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nwhen we start to take a look then,\n\n363\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.140\nwhat it sounds like is that,\neven though we have processes that\n\n364\n00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.020\nwe know that need to get done and\nthat's where the process owner and\n\n365\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.150\nthe practitioner and the manager comes in,\nsaying what needs to be done.\n\n366\n00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.460\nThe service owner is ultimately who's\ngonna be responsible for ensuring that we\n\n367\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.540\ndeliver that in a high quality fashion,\nis that what we're saying?\n\n368\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.070\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what we're saying.\n\n369\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.430\nJust to be pure to the language,\ninstead of being responsible for\n\n370\n00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.060\nit, I would be pure to IT language and\nsay accountable.\n\n371\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.140\n&gt;&gt; Accountable for it, yeah.\n\n372\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.990\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, again,\nit's all about the language.\n\n373\n00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:21.410\n&gt;&gt; So this is where that racy\nchart really helps us to then\n\n374\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.180\nfind the intersection between those two.\n\n375\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n376\n00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.800\n&gt;&gt; Between accountable and responsible.\n\n377\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.870\nYep, find the intersection of those,\nthat's right.\n\n378\n00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.540\nAnd again, any given person can be\nboth accountable and responsible for\n\n379\n00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.330\nany given activity.\n\n380\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.270\nBut the service owner doesn't\nget their hands dirty that much.\n\n381\n00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.110\nThey're not doing that much but\nthey're accountable for a lot.\n\n382\n00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.050\n&gt;&gt; So as organizations continue to grow,\nas they're scalable, right?\n\n383\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.380\nI'm assuming, and this is an assumption,\n\n384\n00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.340\nis that what you just mentioned that\neven though one person can be both,\n\n385\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.570\nmore than likely, as the organization\ngrows, these two roles get separated out.\n\n386\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.410\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n387\n00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Between a process owner,\n\n388\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.930\na process manager, depending on the scale,\nneeds of the organization.\n\n389\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.660\nIn a small organization,\nyou're probably gonna wear many hats and\n\n390\n00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.910\nmany roles, right?\n\n391\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.090\nIn a larger organization,\nthere's a specialization and segmentation.\n\n392\n00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.094\nAbsolutely, yep.\n\n393\n00:20:08.094 --> 00:20:11.853\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, so what are the\nvocabulary or concepts do we need to\n\n394\n00:20:11.853 --> 00:20:15.860\nmake sure that we cement into our\nminds before we continue onward?\n\n395\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.772\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that covers the formal\npart of presenting some of these things.\n\n396\n00:20:18.772 --> 00:20:21.945\nIt kinda sets the table,\ngets us back in the flow of things.\n\n397\n00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:25.278\nI think a way to consider\nwhat's next is for\n\n398\n00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:28.900\nyou viewers to actually\nlook at the glossary.\n\n399\n00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.940\nThat's downloadable,\nI mentioned that in the overview.\n\n400\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.699\nEngage experts in our discussion\nforum if you have some questions.\n\n401\n00:20:34.699 --> 00:20:37.403\nCertainly, you can email me as well.\n\n402\n00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.784\nAnd come back,\nnext episode is gonna be looking\n\n403\n00:20:40.784 --> 00:20:45.760\nat the service transaction life\ncycle stage as a whole, right?\n\n404\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.236\nAnd then after that we're kind of setting\nthe table in that particular episode.\n\n405\n00:20:49.236 --> 00:20:51.288\nAnd we're setting the table for\n\n406\n00:20:51.288 --> 00:20:54.860\nindividual deep dives into\nthe seven processes of RCV.\n\n407\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well that looks like\nthat there's just a lot of information for\n\n408\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.620\nus to think about and review.\n\n409\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.189\nAnd if you've already taken a look at the\nITIL Foundations, make sure you go back.\n\n410\n00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:06.990\nOr excuse me,\nif you haven't taking a look at that.\n\n411\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.350\nAnd you just said, I'm gonna jump\npast Foundation cuz that sounds,\n\n412\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.680\nit doesn't sound that important.\n\n413\n00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.070\nTerry, it sounds like it's really\nimportant before we move on, right?\n\n414\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.940\n&gt;&gt; It is important.\n\n415\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.790\nAnd you could certainly self study for\nFoundation, if you wish.\n\n416\n00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:25.220\nBut there's actually a requirement\nbefore you can take the RCV exam,\n\n417\n00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.380\nyou have to have\nthe Foundation certificate.\n\n418\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.629\nSo you can take the exam, they just won't\ngive you credit for, even if you pass it.\n\n419\n00:21:31.629 --> 00:21:34.630\nThey won't give you credit for\nit unless you've also have the Foundation.\n\n420\n00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.786\nSo it is a pre-requisite,\n\n421\n00:21:35.786 --> 00:21:39.059\nan official pre-requisite that you\nhave the Foundations, but certainly,\n\n422\n00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:42.582\nacademically speaking, it would be very\ndifficult for you to move forward at these\n\n423\n00:21:42.582 --> 00:21:45.330\nimmediate levels without having,\nliterally the foundation.\n\n424\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.400\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, well, we do thank you\nso far for the review of those concepts\n\n425\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.300\nbefore we jump into some of\nthe things that we may not have\n\n426\n00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.450\na chance of understanding or trying to\ncatch up that we haven't had that review.\n\n427\n00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.100\nWe wanna make sure that you understand\nthat what we did take a look at here as\n\n428\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.460\nwe've talked about the idea of processes,\nas well as the idea of service and\n\n429\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.290\nthat key term of accountable is\nwhat we're also focusing in on.\n\n430\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:13.380\nRemember to review this as well as the\npart one of this episode for review and\n\n431\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.470\norientation.\n\n432\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.290\nAll those will give you at least\na basic review of the vocabulary\n\n433\n00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.080\nthat you need to have before we\nmove on to another episode as well.\n\n434\n00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.360\nBut until that point, this is\na great place for us to go ahead and\n\n435\n00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.020\nend this episode then.\n\n436\n00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.340\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n437\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n438\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.417\n&gt;&gt; Stay

00:00:12.396\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.370\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're diving back into ITIL release,\n\n6\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.990\ncontrol, and validation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.450\nWe're specifically going to be addressing\nan overview of service transition.\n\n8\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.120\nBecause it's important that we actually\nunderstand the whole picture that we're\n\n9\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.140\ntaking a look at.\n\n10\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.170\nAnd then we'll dive into\nsome of the specifics.\n\n11\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.570\nAnd here to help us to understand that\nbetter is gonna be Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.800\nTerry welcome back to our show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here Ronnie, and\n\n14\n00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.810\nas you said we're gonna be looking at\nthe life cycle stage at large, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.560\nThe bulk of this course is gonna\nbe diving into the processes,\n\n16\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.510\nthere's seven specific processes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.690\nBut before we do that we wanna remind\neveryone just what service transition is\n\n18\n00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.220\nabout and what it's trying to\nget done as an entire stage.\n\n19\n00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.480\nBecause six of these seven\nprocesses exist in this stage.\n\n20\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.180\nSo again what is transition trying to do?\n\n21\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.960\nA service transition\nis one of five stages.\n\n22\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.840\nYou'll remember service strategy,\nservice design, then service transition.\n\n23\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.110\nAnd service transition is trying\nto bring services to life or\n\n24\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.710\nto change existing services.\n\n25\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.510\nAnd even retire services.\n\n26\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.060\nSo service transition is\nmanaging all the activities\n\n27\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.440\nthat make that stage successful.\n\n28\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.050\nAnd then bringing a service to life and\noperations for ongoing quality and\n\n29\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.780\ndelivery to the customers.\n\n30\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.700\nSo the primary objective of\nservice transition is to make\n\n31\n00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960\nservices come to life, plan and manage\nthe risk, coordinate the resources, and\n\n32\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.309\ndo so in a repeatable fashion.\n\n33\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.980\nSo have a look here at the slide here,\n\n34\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.570\nthe scope of service transition,\nis new and change services, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.250\nIt also could be retiring\nservices as we mentioned, right?\n\n36\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.960\nYou need to allow for the innovation\nwhile reducing the risk and impact.\n\n37\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.050\nWhenever you tweak a service that already\nexists, there could be offsetting effects.\n\n38\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.160\nMaybe the customers have to be retrained.\n\n39\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.380\nThey'll want to know, hey, wait a minute,\nI thought I went here for that.\n\n40\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.920\nAnd you moved the ball on them.\n\n41\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.420\nSo managing that change so the customers\nare happy throughout the change.\n\n42\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920\nIf you're bringing a new service in, you\nneed to manage that as well, all right?\n\n43\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.312\nAnd of course,\ndecommissioning your services.\n\n44\n00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:23.730\nThe reason you managed service transition\nas a stage and provide high quality here,\n\n45\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.840\nis so you can manage change cost\neffectively and risk effectively..\n\n46\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.869\nYou mitigate the risks, you optimize\nthe risk is a term often used by ITIL.\n\n47\n00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:36.626\nMeaning some risks are worth taking but\nyou're going to take them with eyes open,\n\n48\n00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:38.760\nright, you understand\nwhat those risks are.\n\n49\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.240\nBecause change in itself means risk.\n\n50\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.900\nBut you wanna have a positive outcome.\n\n51\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.645\nYou want to lower the efforts it takes.\n\n52\n00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.880\nWhile some folks would look at\nintroducing process as bureaucracy,\n\n53\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.570\nyou need to get that right balance\nof control and effectiveness.\n\n54\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.200\nAnd that's what the business\nvalue is looking for here.\n\n55\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.110\nSo, the strategy for transition, that is\nif the transition strategy is to make\n\n56\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.080\nsure that you affect appropriate change\nat the right time, at the right cost.\n\n57\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.680\nAnd you mitigate the risks, right?\n\n58\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.030\nIt kinda depends on the size and nature of\nthe services how much risk is involved and\n\n59\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.790\nhow big it is.\n\n60\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.560\nService transition is a big topic for\nbig changes.\n\n61\n00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.940\nIt's also a small topic for\n\n62\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.780\nsmall changes, right, day to day\nchanges that happen in operations.\n\n63\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.920\nChanges of existing\nservices that are small,\n\n64\n00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.730\nchanges to existing services that are big.\n\n65\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.890\nAs an example,\nwe maintain an email service for\n\n66\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.450\nyears that the company used to work for.\n\n67\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.940\nWe went from Lotus Notes to Exchange and\nSharePoint.\n\n68\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.330\nSo whereas Lotus Notes\nhad the groupware pieces,\n\n69\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.390\nthe collaboration pieces,\nthe storage, the sharing.\n\n70\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.400\nIt also had email and calendaring.\n\n71\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.890\nMoving to a Microsoft\nenvironment was a big change.\n\n72\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.410\nNow we still had a service called Notes,\nLotus Notes, perhaps.\n\n73\n00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.450\nAnd then we had a new\nservice called Exchange.\n\n74\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.020\nWhat you call a service\nis not that important.\n\n75\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.748\nBut it was a big difference, right?\n\n76\n00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:12.120\nNow some folks say,\nwell email is just email.\n\n77\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.790\nI kind of get that on the email side,\nbut what about the collaboration side?\n\n78\n00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.286\nSharePoint is certainly a lot\ndifferent than Lotus Notes, right?\n\n79\n00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:20.520\nSo that was a big change,\n\n80\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.470\neven though we're providing\nthe same type of functionality.\n\n81\n00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.148\nThe same type of utility and we're\ngonna promise the same kind of warranty\n\n82\n00:04:27.148 --> 00:04:30.910\nthat's gonna be available 24/7,\nhigh availability.\n\n83\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.390\nIt was gonna be a big change.\n\n84\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.810\nSo not only do we have to change our staff\norientation within the service provider,\n\n85\n00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.250\nwe had to orient\nthe business users as well.\n\n86\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.030\nSo it was a big deal, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.280\nMinor changes, we add a utility\nto Outlook that allows them to\n\n88\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.050\neasily connect to Live Meeting, or\nWebEx, or some other utility, right.\n\n89\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.380\nThat's not as big a change but\nit's still something you have to manage.\n\n90\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.228\nService transition is a life cycle\nstage that deals with the complexity\n\n91\n00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:03.289\nof big changes and\nthe complexity of small changes as well.\n\n92\n00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289\n&gt;&gt; All right so Terry let's kind of talk\nabout these three concepts because we kind\n\n93\n00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:07.855\nof rifled through them pretty quickly.\n\n94\n00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.140\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; You talked about the idea of scope and\n\n95\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.680\nbusiness value,\nas well as the ideal of strategy.\n\n96\n00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.470\nNow, when we start talking\nabout the idea of scope,\n\n97\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.040\ncuz this is,\nwas a phrase that you had used,\n\n98\n00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.760\nwhich is something that we might\nwanna elaborate on just a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.567\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Coming from me,\n\n100\n00:05:21.567 --> 00:05:24.405\nsince I'm not as smart as most of the guys\nthat are probably watching this, right?\n\n101\n00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:26.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And most ladies watching this here.\n\n102\n00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.153\nThe idea of trying to retire,\nI think is what you said,\n\n103\n00:05:30.153 --> 00:05:32.276\ndiscontinuation of a service.\n\n104\n00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:36.970\nWhy does that have to be a managed\nservice transition at all?\n\n105\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.780\nWhy not just say everybody stop using it?\n\n106\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.620\nWhy not?\n\n107\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.110\n&gt;&gt; Well it's a good point.\n\n108\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.650\nFirst of all just using a facetious\nexample, I know I've done this.\n\n109\n00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.890\nI'm not sure if they're using this,\nlet's just turn it off.\n\n110\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's just turn it off and\n\n111\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.910\nsee people are screaming.\n\n112\n00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.530\nSo you gotta make sure the customers\nare indeed ready for it.\n\n113\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.370\nSo it's not just telling them,\nit's making sure they're ready for it.\n\n114\n00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.470\nSo perhaps it was, pick the service, they\nwere using that service potentially for\n\n115\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.270\nsome business outcome.\n\n116\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.860\nYou're taking that service away,\n\n117\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.890\ndo they still get the business\noutcome they're desired?\n\n118\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.040\nAnd also, reuse of capacity.\n\n119\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.400\nSo if you're taking down a service,\nthere's components of that service that\n\n120\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.340\nwere in play, people,\nresources, servers, databases.\n\n121\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.800\nCan you reuse that effectively?\n\n122\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.360\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n123\n00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.760\nyou're going to regain some capacity\nif you're taking down a service.\n\n124\n00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.700\nHow can that capacity be reused?\n\n125\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.620\nThese are intelligent questions to ask.\n\n126\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.310\nSo having an intelligent approach to\nasking those questions consistently, and\n\n127\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.710\nmethodically, is what service\ntransition would provide.\n\n128\n00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.640\n&gt;&gt; You know, the understanding\nthe scope is something that I find\n\n129\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.310\neven in project management\nthat tends to get out of hand.\n\n130\n00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.420\nWhen you're talking about that,\n\n131\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.890\nI always make an illustration that\nproject management is like a wedding.\n\n132\n00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.530\nIt always begins small, but\nit always continues to grow.\n\n133\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.250\nYou never see it shrinking.\n\n134\n00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.780\nAnd so the idea of setting a scope\nhere is that the same idea as\n\n135\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.080\nmaking sure it doesn't go beyond\nwhat we really want it to be?\n\n136\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.800\n&gt;&gt; Great example.\n\n137\n00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.990\nWhen you're defining any process, and\nwe're gonna be talking about a lot of\n\n138\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.380\nthese processes, you're gonna make\nsome decisions along the way.\n\n139\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.205\nWhat is the scope of this process?\n\n140\n00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:14.920\nSo we're talking about service\ntransition as a stage.\n\n141\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.837\nIt has scope, as well.\n\n142\n00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:21.512\nI know some organizations that\nconsider project-level changes big\n\n143\n00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:26.720\nenough that they just allow a project\nmanagement discipline to handle.\n\n144\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n145\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.420\n&gt;&gt; The details, right?\n\n146\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.165\nAnd then day to day operation of change\nmanagement is handled by other means.\n\n147\n00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:37.050\nITIL call that a change model.\n\n148\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You have a model for\n\n149\n00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.060\nhandling the big things and\n\n150\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.830\nyou have a model handling\nthe day to day things, right?\n\n151\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.355\nSo were certainly gonna get the details of\nthat type of scope analysis later on and\n\n152\n00:07:47.355 --> 00:07:49.040\nITIL is very clever at this.\n\n153\n00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.875\nIt is not a mandatory type of practice.\n\n154\n00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.334\nITIL is a best practice.\n\n155\n00:07:56.334 --> 00:07:59.134\nIt is a framework.\n\n156\n00:07:59.134 --> 00:08:03.086\nSo they expect you to adopt And\nthen adapt it to your reality and\n\n157\n00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:05.142\nget those cost effectiveness.\n\n158\n00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:08.920\nSo it's not a standard that says,\nthou shalt do this.\n\n159\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.760\nIt is a framework that says,\nthese are good ideas,\n\n160\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.930\nthis is proven to work in\na lot of organizations.\n\n161\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.610\nYou should consider this seriously and\n\n162\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.740\nthen apply that as it\nfits your organization.\n\n163\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, also moving on to\nthe concept of the idea of business value.\n\n164\n00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.071\nYou had mentioned, and\nI don't mean to downgrade any product.\n\n165\n00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:26.817\n[LAUGH] I really don't.\n\n166\n00:08:26.817 --> 00:08:29.977\nThe idea of Lotus Notes,\nas well as using Exchange and\n\n167\n00:08:29.977 --> 00:08:32.940\nmaybe Outlook at the same,\nsomething like that.\n\n168\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.838\nThe business value seems to kinda point\nat the idea that we need some metric\n\n169\n00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:39.185\nthat's involved.\n\n170\n00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:43.837\nSo if you were to try to find that,\ncuz I look at it and\n\n171\n00:08:43.837 --> 00:08:47.360\ngo, I'm doing this facetiously.\n\n172\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.430\nAn email, is an email is an email.\n\n173\n00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.300\nWell, I go, I did the same thing in Lotus\nNotes that I'm doing in Exchange now.\n\n174\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.430\nSo where's the metric that\nwe would put in there\n\n175\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.010\nin terms of the service transition and\nyou say here it is.\n\n176\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good question.\n\n177\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.780\nLet me, thanks for asking.\n\n178\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.400\nLet me clarify some boundaries here.\n\n179\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.950\nAs a whole, ITIL wants you to\nfind a strategy for the service.\n\n180\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n181\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.480\n&gt;&gt; The context of transition strategy is\n\n182\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.420\nhow do you wanna position yourself\nwith these set of processors?\n\n183\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.808\nDo you wanna be highly flexible?\n\n184\n00:09:19.808 --> 00:09:23.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Do you want to be more in control?\n\n185\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.414\nI know in some environments\nthat are highly regulated,\n\n186\n00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:30.359\nthey are little bit averse to change.\n\n187\n00:09:30.359 --> 00:09:30.883\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n188\n00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:33.941\nyou have a model that handles\nthat kind of risk aversion.\n\n189\n00:09:33.941 --> 00:09:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n190\n00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.406\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to high step environments,\nmove fast, move fast, I need it now.\n\n191\n00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:42.229\nI understand that the risks\naren't completely mitigated, but\n\n192\n00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:43.595\nlet's move forward, right.\n\n193\n00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:47.467\nDepending on the environment, you need\nto have a transition strategy that fits\n\n194\n00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:49.394\nthe movement of the business, right.\n\n195\n00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:50.235\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n196\n00:09:50.235 --> 00:09:53.434\n&gt;&gt; Some businesses are resistant\nto change, let's keep it stable,\n\n197\n00:09:53.434 --> 00:09:54.700\ndon't mess with things.\n\n198\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.040\nSome businesses wanna move more quickly.\n\n199\n00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.810\nSo your strategy for\nservice transition is to recognize that.\n\n200\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n201\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.880\n&gt;&gt; That's what this is context of that.\n\n202\n00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.710\nAs it relates to making a decision on\nwhether it's worthwhile going from Notes\n\n203\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.890\nto Exchange, again,\nno disparate marks are necessary at all.\n\n204\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.200\nI'm making a business case for\n\n205\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.850\nthat is actually something that\nhappens up in Service Strategy.\n\n206\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.692\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n207\n00:10:16.692 --> 00:10:20.106\nService Strategy is going to be\nthe life cycle stage that hones in\n\n208\n00:10:20.106 --> 00:10:24.173\non what's the value proposition of\nmaking this big change to this service.\n\n209\n00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:27.243\nWe have email,\nwhat's the business strategy gonna be?\n\n210\n00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:30.470\nAre we going to really go spend a lot\nof money making this transition?\n\n211\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.520\nHow we're gonna justify that expense?\n\n212\n00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.790\nThat happens upstairs.\n\n213\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.845\nI should say, up higher, Service Strategy.\n\n214\n00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:36.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n215\n00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo in the transition strategy itself then,\n\n216\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.300\nis really important that we tend to\nfollow what the strategy sets out.\n\n217\n00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.224\nEven if we happen to be kind of,\nI hate to put it,\n\n218\n00:10:47.224 --> 00:10:51.630\nat the lower end, at the provisioning\nend of things is very important.\n\n219\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.720\nIt's more important than me just saying,\nI don't care about implementing that way.\n\n220\n00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.790\nWe need to follow the strategy because\nit allows us to do these services and\n\n221\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.380\nprovide the value that we want, right.\n\n222\n00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n223\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:02.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n224\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.300\n&gt;&gt; So again, coming up with a transition\nstrategy that fits the business strategy.\n\n225\n00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.220\nAre you a high growth organization that's\ntrying to expand everywhere all the time?\n\n226\n00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.510\nThen you need to have a very\nnimble transition process.\n\n227\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.232\nAre you more in control, right?\n\n228\n00:11:16.232 --> 00:11:18.510\nAnd the honest answer is there's\nalways some middle ground there.\n\n229\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.140\nThat you need to be in control,\nand you need to be nimble.\n\n230\n00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.347\nBut understanding the strategy\nof transition and\n\n231\n00:11:23.347 --> 00:11:26.458\nwhat it's trying to meet is really\nmixing up with business strategy.\n\n232\n00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:27.182\nYep.\n\n233\n00:11:27.182 --> 00:11:30.445\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, it seems that,\nlike everything else in ITIL,\n\n234\n00:11:30.445 --> 00:11:33.675\nthere's a life cycle involved,\neven with the idea of transition.\n\n235\n00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:37.220\nWhat are we taking a look at when we\nstart moving into this idea of transition\n\n236\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.240\nlife cycle?\n\n237\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as you're in service transition\nthis particular stage is gonna be getting\n\n238\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.440\ninputs, and providing outputs,\nthat's one thing similar to processes.\n\n239\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.730\nSomething comes in, something goes out.\n\n240\n00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.910\nSo when you look at transition,\nwell you can look at it as a waterfall.\n\n241\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Things flow one to the other.\n\n242\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.830\nYou also need to consider\nhow integrated they are.\n\n243\n00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.430\nThey don't operate in a vacuum,\nnone of them do.\n\n244\n00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:05.810\nSo a good start, if you could look at\nthe graphic here, a good start is,\n\n245\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.700\nunderstand transition life cycle stage,\n\n246\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.170\nis what really gets them moving is\ncalled a Service Design Package.\n\n247\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.720\nThis is the primary output from\nthe stage called Service Design.\n\n248\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.470\nYou may remember that from\nyour foundations course.\n\n249\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.799\nThe Service Design Package is\nbasically all the deliverables.\n\n250\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.530\nAll the questions being asked,\n\n251\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.320\nand answered, before you decide to build\nthings and start testing things, right.\n\n252\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.130\nSo it's very similar, but not the same,\nas the software development life cycle.\n\n253\n00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.070\nDo you have any familiarity with\nthe software development life cycle?\n\n254\n00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.850\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it a couple of times, yep.\n\n255\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.790\n&gt;&gt; So there's business requirements.\n\n256\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n257\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.830\nyou convert business requirements\nto system requirements.\n\n258\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.650\nSo those things are artifacts.\n\n259\n00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.070\nThere is a business requirements document.\n\n260\n00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There's a system requirements document.\n\n261\n00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.200\nMaybe there's a design specification.\n\n262\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.490\nSo very analogous to a software\ndevelopment life cycle is\n\n263\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.520\na service development life cycle, in that\nyou're going to ask lots of questions and\n\n264\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.540\nget lots of answers before you\nactually start writing code, or\n\n265\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.770\nwriting test or executing things.\n\n266\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.375\nSo it's in Service Design that these\nquestions get asked and answered.\n\n267\n00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:13.877\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n268\n00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.969\nthe ultimate answer is\ncoming in a package.\n\n269\n00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:20.695\nSo all these artifacts, business\nrequirements, system requirements,\n\n270\n00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:24.718\ndesign specifications, process\nrequirements, process specifications, so\n\n271\n00:13:24.718 --> 00:13:27.038\nmany different deliverables\ncould come out.\n\n272\n00:13:27.038 --> 00:13:29.640\nWhat's the test strategy going to be,\nright?\n\n273\n00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.950\nWhat does success look like?\n\n274\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.830\nWhat service accepts this criteria?\n\n275\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.020\nThose things are going to be\ndefined by Service Design and\n\n276\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.790\npresented in a Service Design Package.\n\n277\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.060\nThat becomes the marching orders for\nservice transition.\n\n278\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.470\nGo do these things.\n\n279\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.320\nBuild it to these specifications.\n\n280\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.440\nMake processes to these specifications,\netc.\n\n281\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.346\nI do wanna caution you that while I use\nthe analogy of software development life\n\n282\n00:13:57.346 --> 00:14:00.860\ncycle, ITIL is not about\nsoftware development.\n\n283\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.870\nITIL is about service.\n\n284\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.864\nAnd service is necessarily\na bigger construction.\n\n285\n00:14:05.864 --> 00:14:08.790\nIt's a bigger topic.\n\n286\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, going back to your\ngraphic for just a moment and\n\n287\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.110\nthe way that it shows it,\nis it important that we understand that\n\n288\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.710\neach particular transition\nis in that stage?\n\n289\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.820\nAnd it does require what you have\nhere at the bottom, the entry and\n\n290\n00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.550\nthe exit type of criteria?\n\n291\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.\n\n292\n00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n293\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.330\n&gt;&gt; What gets it started, right?\n\n294\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.280\nWhen you consider service transition,\nin a lot of cases the trigger,\n\n295\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.830\nlet's say for a brand new service.\n\n296\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.050\nLet's do some compare and contrast.\n\n297\n00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.400\nFor a brand new service\nthat never existed.\n\n298\n00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.160\nOr for a big change to an existing\nservice like Exchange replacing Notes.\n\n299\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.100\nThat's a big change.\n\n300\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:46.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n301\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.100\n&gt;&gt; Lots of money gonna be spent,\nlots of people need to be trained.\n\n302\n00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.380\nLots of customers need to be engaged.\n\n303\n00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.970\nWhen you consider the difference\nbetween Lotus Notes and SharePoint.\n\n304\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.130\nAgain, not just Exchange.\n\n305\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.330\nThe SharePoint side.\n\n306\n00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.660\nA huge change in how we're gonna get that.\n\n307\n00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.660\nPerhaps we've gotta do\nsome data migration.\n\n308\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.550\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of things.\n\n309\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.070\nIt's a complex thing, right.\n\n310\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.854\nWhen you consider something big like that,\nthe input, the entry criteria,\n\n311\n00:15:10.854 --> 00:15:13.029\nis really from strategy\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n312\n00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:14.909\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:15:14.909 --> 00:15:15.704\nThat's just one example.\n\n314\n00:15:15.704 --> 00:15:17.234\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The input comes from above,\n\n315\n00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:18.720\nso to speak.\n\n316\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.130\nYou could also consider another example\nwhere you have an existing service,\n\n317\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.630\nlet's say you're already in SharePoint,\nyou have an existing service.\n\n318\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.750\nAnd forgive me, I probably am\nnot using the right word, but\n\n319\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.910\nI'll use the word gadget.\n\n320\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.872\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Is that what they call them?\n\n321\n00:15:29.872 --> 00:15:30.835\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n322\n00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:33.401\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's a new gadget that can\n\n323\n00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:36.630\nbe applied and\nbe put into a SharePoint page.\n\n324\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.538\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a widget or something like that?\n\n325\n00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:38.735\n&gt;&gt; A widget.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n326\n00:15:38.735 --> 00:15:39.739\n&gt;&gt; Widget, all right.\n\n327\n00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:40.466\n&gt;&gt; I think.\n[LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:15:40.466 --> 00:15:43.447\n&gt;&gt; All right, so forgive the vocabulary.\n\n329\n00:15:43.447 --> 00:15:48.075\nBut yeah, there's a new widget being\ndeveloped, right, that will allow\n\n330\n00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:53.014\npeople to have a scrolling calendar\nrolling on their SharePoint site, right.\n\n331\n00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:56.120\nIt's approved by the governing board for\n\n332\n00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.856\nSharePoint that this works,\nit's been tested.\n\n333\n00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:00.819\nYou wanna bring that to life.\n\n334\n00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:01.699\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n335\n00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:03.931\nThat's a significant change.\n\n336\n00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:04.471\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n337\n00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.810\nis not as big bringing in SharePoint and\nreplacing notes.\n\n338\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.200\nService transition therefore is in play\nin both of those types of scenarios.\n\n339\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.560\nSo the input criteria or the entry\ncriteria and exit criteria are different.\n\n340\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.570\nSo keep that in mind,\nservice transition is alive and\n\n341\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.390\nwell in the big things and\nin those kind of changes as well.\n\n342\n00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.390\nIt needed to just find the right\nprocesses and models to make that happen.\n\n343\n00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.760\nGood question, Ronnie.\n\n344\n00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look, then, at what we're\n\n345\n00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.210\ngonna be talking about here about some of\nthe preparations that we need to make for\n\n346\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.780\nservice transition to take place.\n\n347\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good point.\n\n348\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:47.400\nSo how do these requirements get\nidentified, how they get started?\n\n349\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.360\nIt can be a water cooler discussion.\n\n350\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.000\nI heard it's a very good widget\nthere's this counter thing.\n\n351\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.950\nCan we get that?\n\n352\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.706\nIt can start there, but\neventually it's gonna become formal.\n\n353\n00:16:55.706 --> 00:16:56.620\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n354\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.430\n&gt;&gt; So and again that's coming\nperhaps from operational use.\n\n355\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.480\nBut this idea for\n\n356\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.320\nthe replace Lotus Notes with Exchange in\nSharePoint, that was a strategic decision.\n\n357\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.760\nAgain just talking about\nthe different scale here, right?\n\n358\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.880\nSo depending on where you start and\nhow these things go,\n\n359\n00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.470\nyou need to have a flow of inputs and\na way to manage them.\n\n360\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.030\nAnd that's what service transition is\ntrying to define and make repeatable.\n\n361\n00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n362\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.350\nif you're sitting there at\nthe water cooler and says,\n\n363\n00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:30.210\nI wished we'd replace Lotus Notes with\nExchange, that's a big conversation.\n\n364\n00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.210\nIf you're having the same conversation\nabout that widget at the water cooler,\n\n365\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.850\nmaybe the service owner\ncan make that happen,\n\n366\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.630\nthe service owner has\nenough money to say yeah,\n\n367\n00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.750\nwe can make this happen, let's just\ngo ahead and make that happen, right?\n\n368\n00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.610\nSo, depending on where the source is,\nyou're gonna accept that input,\n\n369\n00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.770\nreview it, you gonna see if it's viable,\nyou're going to make a business case for\n\n370\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.410\ndoing it and sometimes it's easy,\nsometimes it's big.\n\n371\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.480\nBut that's what you'd do it, right?\n\n372\n00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.180\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n373\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.050\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen once you agree to move forward,\n\n374\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.250\nyou gotta do the rest,\nplanning and coordinating.\n\n375\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.180\nProject management and service\nmanagement are not the same disciplines.\n\n376\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:10.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n377\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.250\n&gt;&gt; ITIL is service management.\n\n378\n00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.910\nThere's pinbox, project manage book\nof knowledge, there's prints too.\n\n379\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.510\nThere's other disciplines that\nunderstand project management.\n\n380\n00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:25.500\nITIL understands that there's\nother disciplines that do that, so\n\n381\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.280\nthey don't go there.\n\n382\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.055\nHowever there's a process within\ntransition that allows for\n\n383\n00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:33.720\nthat handshake, right.\n\n384\n00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.020\nThere is a process within service\ndesign that allows that handshake.\n\n385\n00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.660\nSo the planning of the details\nis gonna be probably done for\n\n386\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.890\nthose big things through\na project management discipline.\n\n387\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.700\nFor adding a widget to an existing\nservice, probably not, right?\n\n388\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.170\nSo understand that service transition\nis involved, perhaps very tightly with\n\n389\n00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:59.500\na project management discipline or\nin other cases not, okay.\n\n390\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\n\n391\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:06.160\nare there any other things that we have to\nworry about that helped to support service\n\n392\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.520\ntransition that we need to make sure it's\nintegrated into our overall process here.\n\n393\n00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.090\n&gt;&gt; There are fundamental aspects and\n\n394\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.410\nyou can distill it down to four things\nthat service transition is doing.\n\n395\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.370\nService transition can provide\nadvice to other stages.\n\n396\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.940\nIt would be silly, for instance, for\nservice strategists to make a decision\n\n397\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.250\nwithout consulting services design and\ntransition people.\n\n398\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.480\nHow easy, how hard it's gonna be,\nwhat's it gonna cost?\n\n399\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.350\nSo service strategists can't really make\na wise decision without engaging people\n\n400\n00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.820\ndownstream, right.\n\n401\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.590\nSo providing advice, administration,\n\n402\n00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.610\nbeing able to administer\nchanges in a routine way.\n\n403\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.810\nStandardizing your processes in a way so\nyou don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n404\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.944\nAnd then making sure there's\nviable means of communication,\n\n405\n00:19:56.944 --> 00:20:02.328\nmethods of communication that those pipes\nare open and they're bidirectional.\n\n406\n00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:05.010\nThat you're communicating with everyone\nand they're able to communicate back.\n\n407\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.150\nAnd then as you mentioned earlier Ronnie,\nwhat about measuring?\n\n408\n00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.090\nSo, measuring progress,\nmonitoring progress and reporting on that.\n\n409\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.500\nProject management you have your\nmilestone reports, those sorts of things.\n\n410\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.550\nCertainly, if we're talking about\na big project management endeavor for\n\n411\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.450\ntransition, that is gonna be built\nin to your project management scope.\n\n412\n00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:25.990\nRight?\n\n413\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.390\nIf it's just communicating how good\nyour change management process is.\n\n414\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.280\nI once took on a service.\n\n415\n00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.715\nI worked in shared services, and\nmanaged some 38 odd services.\n\n416\n00:20:37.715 --> 00:20:44.165\nAnd I should say 30 odd services,\nnot 38 odd services, at any rate.\n\n417\n00:20:44.165 --> 00:20:46.185\nI managed several services.\n\n418\n00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:49.855\nI was bringing on a new service\nthat required 100 changes a day.\n\n419\n00:20:51.515 --> 00:20:52.980\nAnd tightly controlled changes.\n\n420\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.815\n&gt;&gt; right.\n\n421\n00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:55.795\n&gt;&gt; So while I had a process in place for\n\n422\n00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:58.943\nchange management that was pretty\neffective, I measured it, I knew that\n\n423\n00:20:58.943 --> 00:21:04.080\nI didn't have the capacity in my existing\nprocess to manage 100 processes a day.\n\n424\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.360\nSo being able to recognize it\nwas part of service design.\n\n425\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.360\nBeing able to fulfill it was part\nof ongoing progress monitoring and\n\n426\n00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.078\nreporting, right.\n\n427\n00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:15.650\nA piece of it, all right?\n\n428\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.140\nGood.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry,\n\n429\n00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.110\neven though that there's more involved\nin terms of some of the things like\n\n430\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.420\nplanning and support, We don't really\nneed to dive super in depth to it but\n\n431\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.350\nwe need to understand\na little bit about it, right?\n\n432\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nWhen you see it in a high level.\n\n433\n00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.280\nAnd again, this in broad strokes,\n\n434\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.530\nunderstand that service transition has\na stage, is engaged for big things.\n\n435\n00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.600\nIt's also engaged for\nthe not so big things.\n\n436\n00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.420\nAnd therefore,\nyou need to monitor your processes and\n\n437\n00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.210\ngovern your processes to satisfy\nboth ends of that scale, all right?\n\n438\n00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.710\nSo as we go and talk about the seven\nprocesses we're gonna talk about,\n\n439\n00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.360\nyou need to keep that in mind is\nthat these processes are gonna\n\n440\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.920\nnecessarily be engaged at those\nvarying degrees of scale.\n\n441\n00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.040\nHuge and day to day, right?\n\n442\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.820\nSo that's just setting the table that\nas we talk about these processes,\n\n443\n00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.422\nwe're talking about it with\nthose varying degrees of scale.\n\n444\n00:22:09.422 --> 00:22:13.260\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, so\nnow that we've kind of\n\n445\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.590\nstarted to see that overview of\nthe idea of service transition\n\n446\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.770\nwhere we've taken a look at some of the\ndifferent roles that we have to realize,\n\n447\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.337\nhow important strategy is as well as\nthe process of doing some of the things.\n\n448\n00:22:26.337 --> 00:22:32.057\nWe've talked about the idea of business\nvalue and scope, as well as strategy.\n\n449\n00:22:32.057 --> 00:22:33.220\nThere's a lot there for\n\n450\n00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.840\nus and it doesn't mean that we watch\njust one episode we've done enough.\n\n451\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n452\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.165\n&gt;&gt; So what were gonna do then,\n\n453\n00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:42.965\nis the next few episodes we're gonna see\nus kind of dive deeper into all these.\n\n454\n00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:47.535\nTerry, any last words before we transition\nout of our particular episode right now?\n\n455\n00:22:47.535 --> 00:22:49.479\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nperhaps I'll just give you just a,\n\n456\n00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:51.532\nif you show this slide\nhere just a little bit.\n\n457\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.320\nThis is where we're going.\n\n458\n00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.150\nThese are the seven processes that we're\ngoing to be talking about in the rest of\n\n459\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:57.855\nthe episodes.\n\n460\n00:22:57.855 --> 00:22:58.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n461\n00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:02.360\nwe've set the stage for\nsome review of the foundational topics.\n\n462\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.870\nWe have also looked and\n\n463\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.510\nreminded ourselves what service transition\nis trying to do as an entire stage.\n\n464\n00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.400\nAnd then we're going to dive\ninto these seven processes.\n\n465\n00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.030\nOf these seven, one of them happens\nto be considered operations,\n\n466\n00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.930\nthis is from service operation,\nrequest fulfillment, but\n\n467\n00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.840\nthe other six are all from\nthe service transition stage.\n\n468\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.105\nTwo of these processes were not addressed\nin service foundation, I'm sorry with\n\n469\n00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:29.780\nITIL foundation course, that is change\nevaluation and Service Validation and\n\n470\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.970\nTesting, those two processes will be\nbrand new to many viewers here, right?\n\n471\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.150\nBut that's what we're going next.\n\n472\n00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.964\nI would encourage you to consider\nsome self study, there's some\n\n473\n00:23:41.964 --> 00:23:45.500\ndirected self study, there's some\nexercises related to service transition.\n\n474\n00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.580\nI encourage you to go out and reinforce\nwhat you've learned in this episode\n\n475\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.270\nby taking a look at those exercises there,\nall right.\n\n476\n00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well that's a lot\nof information for us to consider,\n\n477\n00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.390\nso please do heed what\nTerry is telling you.\n\n478\n00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.750\nIt's not enough just to sit here and\nwatch.\n\n479\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.670\nYou do need to take some time and make\nsure you understand those processes and\n\n480\n00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.890\nget in there and\nunderstand the vocabulary,\n\n481\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.850\nas well as some of the other concepts that\nyou've learned about in this episode.\n\n482\n00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.490\nAs we get ready for the deeper dive\ninto each Windows 7 areas as well.\n\n483\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.350\nBut that's a good place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n484\n00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.880\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wang.\n\n485\n00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.320\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n486\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.347\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more ITIL\nrelease, control, and validation.\n\n487\n00:24:30.347 --> 00:24:36.694\n[MUSIC]\n\n488\n00:24:36.694 --> 00:24:39.598\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

This includes not only the culture of the process but the buy in as well as stated by Terry.  The team describes the inputs, principles and values that change management brings to the company and we begin.  They also discuss the process of change requests and the use of a system to manage these changes.  Terry makes sure to emphasize that ITIL is not proscriptive in managing changes but provides a conceptual framework for what needs to be included in it.",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.742\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:19.813\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ncontinuing on taking a look at ITIL,\n\n7\n00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:22.500\nrelease, control, and validation.\n\n8\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430\nWe're specifically entering into\nthe realm of change management.\n\n9\n00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960\nAnd here to help us out are ITIL\nexpert himself, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.210\nTerry, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.600\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here, Ronnie, and\nthanks for setting the table up.\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.870\nWe are definitely gonna head\ninto change management.\n\n13\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.440\nThis is the first of seven processes\namong the next several episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.000\nAnd let's just dig right in.\n\n15\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n\n16\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.242\nSo Terry, is it really important that we\nimplement some system in terms change?\n\n17\n00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.270\nChange happens, this is a constant\nthat we have in our life.\n\n18\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.766\nBut what it is about change management\nthat is really the most important element\n\n19\n00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.520\nfor a business to get started?\n\n20\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.400\nAnd why is that so\nessential that they set that up?\n\n21\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, change management provides\nthe process that, in a methodical way,\n\n22\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.590\ncan evaluate proposed changes to make\nsure they're gonna have intended value.\n\n23\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.980\nAnd to follow up to make sure that\nintended value is actually realized,\n\n24\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.620\nwhile mitigating risk and disruption.\n\n25\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.754\n&gt;&gt; Wow, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:23.690\n&gt;&gt; So\nbringing good change in without harm.\n\n27\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start to\ntake a look at that, we've got\n\n28\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.990\ndifferent things that we need to make sure\nthat we do cover, not only for the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.730\nBut if you haven't been involved in\nthis idea of a formalized process for\n\n30\n00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.610\nchange management,\nit might seem a little bit overwhelming.\n\n31\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.170\nBut Terry's gonna help us to\nunderstand that a bit better.\n\n32\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.968\nAnd maybe make us a little bit more\ncomfortable with that concept of change\n\n33\n00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:44.710\nmanagement.\n\n34\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.866\nTerry, you're saying that this is one\nof the larger sections that we're gonna\n\n35\n00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:48.840\nbe covering.\n\n36\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.270\nSo we do need to make sure\nthat we begin correctly.\n\n37\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.120\nSo Terry, where are we gonna start?\n\n38\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.590\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's just have a look at\nthe context change management's in.\n\n39\n00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.340\nIf you look at the slide here,\n\n40\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.090\nchange management is one of the seven\nprocesses we're going to be discussing.\n\n41\n00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.315\nAnd change management is\nthe authoritative process.\n\n42\n00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:10.834\nIt's the one that grants permissions,\ndoes review,\n\n43\n00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:15.500\ndoes triage of value and risk before\nactually engaging in any planning,\n\n44\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.573\nbuilding, developing or testing,\nand those sort of things.\n\n45\n00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:21.280\nYou could look at the rest of them.\n\n46\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.290\nService validation testing,\nrelease and deployment management,\n\n47\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.350\nrequest fulfillment, change evaluation\nare all part of the puzzle.\n\n48\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.040\nBut change management is\nactually the authoritative one,\n\n49\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.070\nthe one that does the triage.\n\n50\n00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.651\nAnd the one that shepherds these\nchanges through the process, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.586\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we look for\nthe overall purpose of this,\n\n52\n00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:46.810\nyou're gonna actually help us by showing\nus the overall official term that we're\n\n53\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.350\nreally looking for.\n\n54\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.820\nAnd then help us understand what\nterminology that we need to\n\n55\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.350\nreally focus on.\n\n56\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.530\n&gt;&gt; Well, if you look at the purpose here,\nyou say, to control, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.050\nSo that's what it's about.\n\n58\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.840\nSome folks might look at the word\ncontrol and see bureaucracy.\n\n59\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.440\nWe'll certainly try to evaluate\nthe difference between control and\n\n60\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.430\nbureaucracy as we go through this process.\n\n61\n00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520\nIt's for the life cycle of all changes,\n\n62\n00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.030\nany changes coming to the service,\nincluding the brand new service.\n\n63\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.560\nYou gotta be responsive to those requests.\n\n64\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.750\nRecord, evaluate,\n\n65\n00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.710\nkeep good records, know where you've been\nand where you're going at all times.\n\n66\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.370\nAnd change management is this process\nthat governs the recording and response.\n\n67\n00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry, before we move on\nfrom that point there, when you start to\n\n68\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.690\ntake a look, there are a couple of terms\non there that we wanted to point out.\n\n69\n00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.392\nSometimes I can't define them all,\nbut we had a couple of acronyms there.\n\n70\n00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:41.070\nCMS and CI, so\nlet's talk about those two for a moment.\n\n71\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for pointing those out, Ronnie.\n\n72\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.850\nCI is a configuration item.\n\n73\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.700\nThat's anything you want to\nkeep under change control.\n\n74\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.122\nIt could be a piece of technology,\nan application, a set of source code.\n\n75\n00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:58.810\nIt could be a document, a processed\ndocument, a service level agreement.\n\n76\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.960\nSo anything that you decided is\nimportant for you to manage a service.\n\n77\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.870\nAnd you want to keep changes for\nthat item under control would be a CI.\n\n78\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.671\nAnd those CIs are governed by a process\nwe'll talk about later called service\n\n79\n00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.510\nasset and configuration management.\n\n80\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.920\nAnd those are stored in a configuration\nmanagement system, a CMS.\n\n81\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.260\nSo thanks for pointing it out.\n\n82\n00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.380\nYou would've gotten that\nin a foundation course.\n\n83\n00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.200\nAnd it's good to do the acronym checks\nevery time, so I appreciate that, Ronnie.\n\n84\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start to\nthen continue on with this idea and\n\n85\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.500\nunderstanding, we wanna also understand\nthe scope of change management, as well.\n\n86\n00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.330\nSo Terry,\nwhen we start talking about a scope,\n\n87\n00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.770\nhelp us to define this idea of\nwhat our limitations are gonna be.\n\n88\n00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.860\n&gt;&gt; You'll recall from another\nepisode where I described it,\n\n89\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.830\nservice transition as a whole,\nas the entire stage,\n\n90\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.630\nwould be involved in big things as well\nas the day-to-day things, minor things.\n\n91\n00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.859\nSo change management has that scope,\nbig and small.\n\n92\n00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:59.567\nAnd it gets at the very\ndetailed level of managing\n\n93\n00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:02.420\nindividual configuration items, CIs.\n\n94\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.000\nSo if you want to change a policy,\nyou could consider that a CI.\n\n95\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.850\nAnd make sure it follows\na change control process.\n\n96\n00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.780\nIf you want to manage the changes\nto a server, to a database and\n\n97\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.580\nkeep them under control,\nthen those would be CIs.\n\n98\n00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.640\nThe database, the server would\nbe considered CIs, as well.\n\n99\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.810\nSo not only does it get down to\nthe detailed level of components,\n\n100\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.430\nit gets down to detailed level of other\ntypes of assets, configuration items,\n\n101\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.570\nsuch as documents, processes, etc.\n\n102\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, but\nthere does come a time\n\n103\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.310\nin which we're not really describing\nthe idea of change management anymore.\n\n104\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.700\nWe're just taking a look at\nthings that are more operational,\n\n105\n00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.440\nthings that we might not\nbe really concerned with.\n\n106\n00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.868\nSo we don't wanna break change management\nall the way down to something like\n\n107\n00:05:48.868 --> 00:05:49.820\nrepairing a printer, do we?\n\n108\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, that's a good example.\n\n109\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.329\nThere could be activities on\na day-to-day basis you might\n\n110\n00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:58.270\nnot want to put under\na strict change control.\n\n111\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.907\nGiving someone access to a server,\nadding them to Active Directory so\n\n112\n00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:03.930\nyou can have access to things.\n\n113\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.850\nSome things just need to move along.\n\n114\n00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.210\nIt's not saying there's not a process\nin place that has not been reviewed.\n\n115\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.210\nIt's just not something that has\nto go through a rigorous process.\n\n116\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.720\nThat is the challenge\nof change management.\n\n117\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.533\nGetting that balance of control and\nspeed that is necessary,\n\n118\n00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.505\ndepending on what the CI is and\nthe criticality of it is, right?\n\n119\n00:06:25.098 --> 00:06:28.056\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's talk\nabout this terms of the overall,\n\n120\n00:06:28.056 --> 00:06:32.258\nentire service life cycle, again, helping\nus to understand things that might be in\n\n121\n00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:34.440\nscope and might be out of scope then.\n\n122\n00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.689\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very good.\n\n123\n00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:38.738\nOne way to consider this is that some\nchanges have a strategic nature,\n\n124\n00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:42.160\nsome of them have a tactical nature, and\nsome may have an operational nature.\n\n125\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.290\nStrategic assets are the services,\nthemselves.\n\n126\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.180\nIt would be a strategic decision,\nfor instance,\n\n127\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.208\nas we've talked about in earlier episodes,\nif you wanted to update or\n\n128\n00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:56.750\nchange your email service\nfrom Lotus Notes to Exchange.\n\n129\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.175\nThat's a big deal, right?\n\n130\n00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:00.013\nThat's a strategic direction.\n\n131\n00:07:00.013 --> 00:07:01.990\nChange management needs to be there for\nthat.\n\n132\n00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.809\nA more tactical one might be\nwhere you're going to add some\n\n133\n00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.370\nfunctionality to SharePoint.\n\n134\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.670\nIt's already existing, people are using\nit as their service for collaboration.\n\n135\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.060\nBut you're going to tweak it somehow.\n\n136\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.020\nThat could be a tactical-level change,\n\n137\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.740\nwhere you're gonna add\nsome value to the service.\n\n138\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.360\nAnd then operationally speaking, the toner\ncartridge changes, the user access things.\n\n139\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.200\nThose types of changes on an operational\nlevel also need to be managed and\n\n140\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.250\nunderstood.\n\n141\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.780\nSo change management does operate.\n\n142\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.780\nThe big level, the small level, and\n\n143\n00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.630\nwe could break it down to strategic,\ntactical, and operational.\n\n144\n00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, now when we start to\ntake a look at this idea, again,\n\n145\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.030\nof trying to say what is actually covered,\nwe normally have to start off with,\n\n146\n00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.458\nwhat I'm taking a look at here,\nabout baselined types of service assets.\n\n147\n00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:48.724\nAnd so when we start to look at that,\n\n148\n00:07:48.724 --> 00:07:53.045\nlet's make sure that we understand\nthat as we move on through here.\n\n149\n00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:56.293\n&gt;&gt; Baselined just simply means\nyou know what you have now.\n\n150\n00:07:56.293 --> 00:08:01.838\nSo in Configuration management you\nunderstand how many servers you have.\n\n151\n00:08:01.838 --> 00:08:05.352\nSo if you have 300\nservers at patch level Z.\n\n152\n00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:06.454\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And you need to given\n\n153\n00:08:06.454 --> 00:08:09.032\nthem to patch level,\nI should have picked a different letter.\n\n154\n00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:11.060\n&gt;&gt; AA.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, AA is right.\n\n155\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.810\nYou wanna get them to patch level AA.\n\n156\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.540\nWell, you need to know the baseline\nbefore you manage that change.\n\n157\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.300\nSo the baseline could be we\nhave 300 at this patch level,\n\n158\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.860\ntherefore we need two weeks to get these\nall updated to the next patch level.\n\n159\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.880\nSo that's an idea of where you consider\nwhat your baseline is, where are you now.\n\n160\n00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.380\nIt also shows version numbers in software.\n\n161\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.590\nIf your at version 1.3,\nyou become version 1.4.\n\n162\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.440\nThat 1.3 was a baseline at some time.\n\n163\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.200\nAnd 1.4, of course,\nis a different baseline.\n\n164\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.299\nSo you can almost look at\nit as version numbers, but\n\n165\n00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:47.039\nit just really simply\nmeans where are we now,\n\n166\n00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:51.093\nwhat is our concurrent status of this CI,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n167\n00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:55.153\n&gt;&gt; So why is it so important that we note\nthe difference between even the versions,\n\n168\n00:08:55.153 --> 00:08:57.770\nsometime we can note it\nbecause of functionality.\n\n169\n00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:01.170\nBut in change management what's\nthe purpose of us saying hey,\n\n170\n00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.330\nhere's what it was versus\nhere's where it is?\n\n171\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.570\nWhat are some of the things that\nwe're trying to do when we say\n\n172\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.460\nhere's why we need to manage this change?\n\n173\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.290\nWhy is it important that I\nnote something like that?\n\n174\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.610\n&gt;&gt; We have bad memories.\n\n175\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Documenting change\n\n176\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.560\nis an important aspect of just\nhaving institutional memory.\n\n177\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.790\nSo whether you're changing a service\nlevel agreement, which is a document,\n\n178\n00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.210\nor changing a version of software,\nupgrading it,\n\n179\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.670\nor patching a server,\ngetting it to a different patch level.\n\n180\n00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.950\nHaving records of what we've done is\nimportant because we have a bad memories.\n\n181\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.540\nSo, if you say we changed that service\nlevel just last month, didn't we?\n\n182\n00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.340\nI don't know, let me look,\nthere you have it,\n\n183\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.599\nyou have a record of it that we\ndid change it just last month.\n\n184\n00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:43.500\nAnd you understand where you were before.\n\n185\n00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.620\nSo it's in keeping in baseline\nyou know what you had.\n\n186\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.232\nAnd of course,\n\n187\n00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:50.117\nthe baseline changes because your\nmoving through your change process.\n\n188\n00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:54.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Terry, and personally as\nI've helped out organizations to give\n\n189\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.829\nyou an example of where change wasn't\nreally kept as far as the records go and\n\n190\n00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:03.569\nwhere really did hurt us is that we had\nsome terminal servers that were set-up for\n\n191\n00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.200\nsome Thin clients.\n\n192\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.570\nAnd one day we came in and we're using\ndual monitors and everybody connected in\n\n193\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.210\nand that actually stretched the entire\nscreen across both of those monitors.\n\n194\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.180\nAnd we didn't know exactly\nwhat had occurred,\n\n195\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.940\nand we couldn't figure out why\nit was actually doing that.\n\n196\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.590\nAnd so\n\n197\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.700\nfinally we had to troubleshoot everything\nelse down on those terminal servers.\n\n198\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.200\nWe knew it wasn't the Thin clients.\n\n199\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.870\nBut it came down to finally the idea\nthat something had updated overnight and\n\n200\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.060\nwe didn't check the version\nnumber of what had gone on.\n\n201\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.020\nAnd then of course once you check\nthe change log on that update\n\n202\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.540\nyou realize that it actually said that it\ncould break if you're using dual monitors.\n\n203\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.690\nIt was kind of unusual,\n\n204\n00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.460\nbut it was something we should have\nactually noted that hey, we're actually\n\n205\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.120\nreleasing this particular update out into\nthe terminal servers, and we just didn't.\n\n206\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.720\nSo it really took us a long time\nto actually be able to note\n\n207\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720\nsomething like that.\n\n208\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.860\nAnd so the idea and\nthe process here of understanding this\n\n209\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.220\nmight have actually\nhelped us a lot faster.\n\n210\n00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n211\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.940\nAnd knowing that you have a standardized\nprocess that keeps the records at a known\n\n212\n00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.130\nplace, what ITIL calls that\nknown place is the CMS,\n\n213\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.780\nthe Configuration Management System.\n\n214\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.620\nSo if you do make a change to a component\nyou can go to the component and\n\n215\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.870\nsee where those changes are,\nthe change records associated with it.\n\n216\n00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.030\nThat's the scheme of things,\na great example, a technical example.\n\n217\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.690\nI'd like to expand everyone's general\nawareness of change management,\n\n218\n00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.390\nhas a larger scope beyond the technology.\n\n219\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.916\nIt could be processes as well, but\na great example of how understanding what\n\n220\n00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:32.523\nchanges have occurred can help\nyou in troubleshooting, and\n\n221\n00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:35.160\ncan help you get back up,\nand more quickly.\n\n222\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.381\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nwhere is this leading us?\n\n223\n00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.651\nSo what do we need to\ntake a look at next here?\n\n224\n00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:41.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, how does this add value, though?\n\n225\n00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.450\nWe kinda give some examples.\n\n226\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:47.225\nBut how does change\nmanagement add value to it?\n\n227\n00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:49.625\nIt does so,\nfirst of all just by standardizing it,\n\n228\n00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:51.185\nit becomes a standard way of working.\n\n229\n00:11:51.185 --> 00:11:54.705\nInstead of guessing whether that\nserver changed, or that SLA changed,\n\n230\n00:11:54.705 --> 00:11:57.835\nyou know where to go to find\nthe records of these things.\n\n231\n00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:00.900\nIt also gives you a methodical\nway to prioritize\n\n232\n00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.940\nthe various changes could\nbe under consideration.\n\n233\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.630\nWhat do you work on first?\n\n234\n00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:07.386\nIf you just happen to work on\nthe person that screams the loudest or\n\n235\n00:12:07.386 --> 00:12:12.570\nthe person that got there first you might\nnot actually be serving the business well.\n\n236\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.552\nCause it's not necessarily the loudest or\n\n237\n00:12:14.552 --> 00:12:17.490\nthe one that arrived first that\nshould be worked on first.\n\n238\n00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.590\nSo having a means of evaluating\n\n239\n00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.360\nthe potential value of the changes\nunder consideration and\n\n240\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.780\ncompared that value across the change\nlandscape, a process lets you do that.\n\n241\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.840\nIt also allows you to\nmethodically asses risk.\n\n242\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.220\nYou ask the questions,\neven including what if we don't do this?\n\n243\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.020\nIn the past when I ran\nchange management process,\n\n244\n00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.040\nthat was a key question I asked\nas a first line question.\n\n245\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.510\nIf we don't do this what happens?\n\n246\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.300\nIt's kind of like the Hippocratic\noath that doctors take.\n\n247\n00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.610\nFirst thing, do no harm.\n\n248\n00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.970\nChange management can be that governor\nthere that says wait a second,\n\n249\n00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.120\nwhy do we need to do this?\n\n250\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.800\nProve to me that it's worth the expense,\nthe time, and the risk, right?\n\n251\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, and this idea of taking\na look at that business value add,\n\n252\n00:13:04.347 --> 00:13:07.464\none of the key things that I saw\nthere as we were looking at it,\n\n253\n00:13:07.464 --> 00:13:09.290\nis that idea of risk avoidance.\n\n254\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.310\nMost of the time in an organization,\n\n255\n00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.100\nyou may have key figures that understand\nthat this is why we're keeping that.\n\n256\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.800\nBut maybe sometimes people\nthat are trying to, or\n\n257\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.970\nhaving to implement that, don't understand\nhow this helps in terms of risk.\n\n258\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.580\nSo being able to understand,\nmaybe at this point,\n\n259\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.960\nat least, the idea of what we're\ndoing when we implement a change or\n\n260\n00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.620\nwhen we choose not to implement a change\nappears I can just push it out.\n\n261\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.350\nAnd that's a kind of\nan organization I worked for,\n\n262\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.150\nthey were just like just push out\nthe change, just push out the change.\n\n263\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.600\nAnd then they said we'll deal with\nit later if it breaks something.\n\n264\n00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.170\nAnd then you have to deal with it later\nand then you have to back track so far.\n\n265\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.890\nIt's amazing cuz they don't\nknow which particular change\n\n266\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.650\nactually caused whatever issue it was so\n\n267\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.780\nyou just tend to back them out one at\na time till you go that had to be it.\n\n268\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.740\nAnd it could be several days later and\nyour productivity goes down pretty hard.\n\n269\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:57.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n270\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.350\nto reinforce some of the value statements\nthat ITIL would bring to this.\n\n271\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.690\nAnd keep in mind, ITIL as a best\npractice wasn't just theory.\n\n272\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.660\nIt's been evaluated in\norganizations of varying sizes and\n\n273\n00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.560\ncomplexity, and\nit's been determined that high performing\n\n274\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.650\norganizations have their\nchanges under control, right?\n\n275\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.399\nIt's not viewed as a bureaucratic hassle.\n\n276\n00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:26.000\nIt's used as a necessary evil if you\nwill even if it does slow things down.\n\n277\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.270\nThat's the purpose.\n\n278\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.450\nBe methodical, be reason, and obviously\nyou have to be able to be responsive,\n\n279\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.950\nyou have to deliver at\nthe appropriate speed.\n\n280\n00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.296\nBut that doesn't mean now\nwithout deliberation and\n\n281\n00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:39.960\nwithout risk assessments, right?\n\n282\n00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.490\n&gt;&gt; So if change management so\neffective, so\n\n283\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.600\nI'm gonna put you on the hot seat here,\nTerry.\n\n284\n00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; If change management is so\n\n285\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:50.850\neffective but it slows everything down,\nwhy should I just say,\n\n286\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.610\nforget it I'm just gonna implement changes\nI'm not gonna worry about this process?\n\n287\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.270\n&gt;&gt; So what happens if in your two terminal\nsituation there happened to be a document\n\n288\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.540\nsomewhere that said-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n289\n00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.940\n&gt;&gt; Right, but in the absence of that,\n\n290\n00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.370\nI remember a change that was\nnot announced, not necessarily.\n\n291\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.170\nNow the people that were\ndoing it understood it.\n\n292\n00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.300\nThey thought they did.\n\n293\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.430\nIt happened to be a network service,\na DNS.\n\n294\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.020\nHappened to be a DNS.\n\n295\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.048\nAnd whether you know what DNS is or\nnot is not critical.\n\n296\n00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:16.542\nBut a network service's operator,\n\n297\n00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:22.450\nwith the blessing of everyone on the team,\ndecided to make some DNS changes.\n\n298\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.750\nAnd it took down services for hours.\n\n299\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.710\nAnd when we begin to troubleshoot\nthose services going down\n\n300\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.780\nwe had no clue that it was\nthe DNS service, had no idea.\n\n301\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.890\nWe asked network people,\nnetwork people said it's not the network.\n\n302\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.360\nThat's what network people always say,\nright?\n\n303\n00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.830\nIts not the network.\n\n304\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.310\nIts not the application,\nthere is too many services involved.\n\n305\n00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.670\nIts not just one service,\n\n306\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.580\nis affecting everyone, its got to be\nsomehow in the infrastructure, right?\n\n307\n00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.526\nThat sort of a thing.\n\n308\n00:15:49.526 --> 00:15:52.850\nAnd without that record, without\nthe slowdown to at least put in a change\n\n309\n00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.703\nrecord that we are going to do this work,\n\n310\n00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:57.882\nwe didn't even have the first clue\nas to where to go troubleshoot it.\n\n311\n00:15:57.882 --> 00:16:01.321\nSo, we were gonna try to implement some\nimprovements in that particular case.\n\n312\n00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.830\nAs I said, we had services down for hours.\n\n313\n00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.880\nAnd the improvement we wanted to bring in\n\n314\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.340\nwas not we wanna take\ncontrol of your changes.\n\n315\n00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.390\nWe want you to do necessary changes.\n\n316\n00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.310\nIf nothing else,\nat least announce this change, and\n\n317\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.410\nput it in a place where we can go and\nlook at it.\n\n318\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.560\nAnd then we can come knock on your door\nto say, hey, did you cause us this pain?\n\n319\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.945\nInstead, we floated around in the dark,\nright?\n\n320\n00:16:22.945 --> 00:16:24.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI've seen that happen as well,\n\n321\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.890\nwhere you think,\nI'm not gonna spend six hours to do this.\n\n322\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.605\nAnd then, you realize later on,\n20 hours later,\n\n323\n00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:35.865\nthat if you would've spent the six hours\ndoing that particular process, it would\n\n324\n00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:40.083\nhave saved you the other 12 hours of time\nthat you would have down at some point.\n\n325\n00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:43.144\nSo, a lot of times, going a little\nbit slower at the beginning and\n\n326\n00:16:43.144 --> 00:16:45.094\nthinking out the process methodically,\n\n327\n00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:48.255\nmaybe really what puts us ahead in\nterms of productivity at times.\n\n328\n00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's just no question about it.\n\n329\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.570\nAnd you're right Ryan,\n\n330\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.770\nthere's no question about it that IT,\nI mean, systems are complex.\n\n331\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.750\nIT services are complex.\n\n332\n00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.940\nLittle bitty things can make\nthe whole thing fall down.\n\n333\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.520\nSo, if we're not keeping track of the\ndetails, we are just simply taking risks.\n\n334\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.710\nAnd how many risks do you wanna take?\n\n335\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.160\nHow many allergies do you wanna have,\n\n336\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.310\nbefore you realize we need\nto keep this under control?\n\n337\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.430\nSo again, in large organizations, I've\nseen this happen, where impact is huge,\n\n338\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.730\nand response to that impact is slow.\n\n339\n00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.060\nBecause it's viewed as bureaucratic,\nbut over time,\n\n340\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.960\nyou must hone your processes so\nthat they are at the right speed, right?\n\n341\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.670\nYou can't be just so cumbersome that\nit's impossible to get things done.\n\n342\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.070\nBut you also need to be deliberative,\nappropriate and keep good records.\n\n343\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Jerry,\nas we continue to move through here and\n\n344\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.060\ntalk about this idea of implementing\nchange management, you have me convinced\n\n345\n00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.560\nthat we need something like this\nin just about every organization.\n\n346\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.320\nBut people can implement it on their own,\nand\n\n347\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.450\nthink that they're doing a good job,\nbut it can be implemented poorly.\n\n348\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.360\nHow can I tell the difference between\nchange manage that's really done well,\n\n349\n00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.180\nversus change manage, they say I've\ngot change management in place, but\n\n350\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.460\nit's really kind of done a bit poorly\nhere if we were to describe it.\n\n351\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.620\n&gt;&gt; You'll recall when we talked\nabout processes in general,\n\n352\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.595\nthat they need to be measured?\n\n353\n00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:04.190\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n354\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.670\n&gt;&gt; And I think we even used\nchange management as an example.\n\n355\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.005\nWhat does successful change\nmanagement look like?\n\n356\n00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:09.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, successful change\nmanagement looks like there's not so\n\n358\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:13.520\nmany emergency changes.\n\n359\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.190\nEverything seems to be under control.\n\n360\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.350\nThere's not unauthorized changes.\n\n361\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.963\nIt's under control, and\nchanges actually provide value.\n\n362\n00:18:20.963 --> 00:18:23.786\nThat they are successful,\nthey don't have to be rolled back,\n\n363\n00:18:23.786 --> 00:18:27.324\nthat they are few that are considered\nfailures, or cause a bunch an instance.\n\n364\n00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:30.554\nYou don't roll it back, but when you\nroll it out, it causes so much pain, and\n\n365\n00:18:30.554 --> 00:18:33.650\npeople don't know where to find it,\nthey don't know how to do it.\n\n366\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.900\nIf you keep score on the quality of your\nprocesses, you're gonna be in better shape\n\n367\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.742\nto improve them, and find those\nbad areas and improve them, yep.\n\n368\n00:18:44.742 --> 00:18:47.340\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry, because of\nthe world that we live in today,\n\n369\n00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.445\nit seems like that even though this idea\nof change in management may slow down, it\n\n370\n00:18:52.445 --> 00:18:56.170\ndoesn't sound like the pressure to change\nand to be able to do thing quicker and\n\n371\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.870\nmore efficiently are what the world and\nbusinesses are demanding.\n\n372\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.870\nSo, in terms of that,\nwhat do we actually need to understand?\n\n373\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.592\nWhat types of procedures or policies are\nin place to maybe help an organization go,\n\n374\n00:19:08.592 --> 00:19:11.037\nhey look, even though you\nthink this is slowing down,\n\n375\n00:19:11.037 --> 00:19:13.233\nit's gonna really kind of\nhelp us in the future?\n\n376\n00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that one you could point\nto straight away is that you could develop\n\n377\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.193\na culture where we are gonna\nfollow the process.\n\n378\n00:19:19.193 --> 00:19:21.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And if the process is slowing you down\n\n379\n00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.880\nin meaningful ways, meaning we\nare causing pain because we are slow.\n\n380\n00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Identify that pain and speed up, right?\n\n381\n00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.300\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n382\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Improve the process,\nwhat could be better,\n\n383\n00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.050\ndo we need to meet more often, right?\n\n384\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.770\nDo we need to have different\npeople at the meeting, right?\n\n385\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.590\nAre we not able to progress this quickly\nenough, find out why and correct it,\n\n386\n00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.120\nright?\n\n387\n00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.547\nCertainly have models for\nemergency change.\n\n388\n00:19:44.547 --> 00:19:47.823\nIf there is something, it must be\ndone quickly, and without a doubt,\n\n389\n00:19:47.823 --> 00:19:51.290\nthen identify those things that\nthat must be done quickly.\n\n390\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.700\nYou could get a lot of improvement\nover standardizing changes, right?\n\n391\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:01.070\nSome changes are low risk enough,\nyou trust the implementors enough that you\n\n392\n00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:06.070\nallow them to get the change\napproved first, one time.\n\n393\n00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.232\nAnd then after that, they can just\ndo it as many times as they want.\n\n394\n00:20:08.232 --> 00:20:10.362\nThey don't have to stop for\napprovals anymore.\n\n395\n00:20:10.362 --> 00:20:12.900\nSo, there's certainly ways to speed it up.\n\n396\n00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.687\nBut it starts with the commitment through\npolicies, through your governance,\n\n397\n00:20:16.687 --> 00:20:18.424\nwe're going to control or changes.\n\n398\n00:20:18.424 --> 00:20:21.812\nYou can beat the Cowboy organization\njust changing as you wish,\n\n399\n00:20:21.812 --> 00:20:25.766\nwe're gonna keep things under control,\nand if we find issues with speed,\n\n400\n00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:29.364\nwe will seek to correct them,\nthat's really the way to go about it.\n\n401\n00:20:29.364 --> 00:20:33.573\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we move on Terry,\nagain, once we get to this point where\n\n402\n00:20:33.573 --> 00:20:37.644\nwe might have that idea and\nwe're convinced about it, and we are ready\n\n403\n00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:42.080\nto move forward then, what would be our\nnext step as we continue to see this?\n\n404\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.940\n&gt;&gt; Well first of all,\n\n405\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.620\nhow does change management\ninteract with the other processes?\n\n406\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.480\nAnd we haven't talked about any\nother processes to date today.\n\n407\n00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.280\nBut in foundation,\nwe learned of some transition processes.\n\n408\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.160\nHere's just a little quiz.\n\n409\n00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.649\nPlanning a change management should or\n\n410\n00:20:59.649 --> 00:21:02.772\nmust be done in conjunction\nwith what other processes?\n\n411\n00:21:02.772 --> 00:21:06.149\nAnd if you just want to take a guess,\nwhich two?\n\n412\n00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:07.850\nYou're gonna check two here.\n\n413\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.400\nWhat other two processes are gonna be\n\n414\n00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.140\nprobably very tightly integrated\nwith change management?\n\n415\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.060\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna assume it's going\nto be the service asset and\n\n416\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.440\nconfiguration management.\n\n417\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.940\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n418\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.870\nThat's one of them.\n\n419\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.670\n&gt;&gt; And then service continuity management,\nis possible.\n\n420\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.480\n&gt;&gt; It is possible.\n\n421\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.640\nCertainly you wanna maintain continuity.\n\n422\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.258\nService continuity is a design\nelement you try to build it in.\n\n423\n00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:37.179\nSo, the two service asset and\nconfiguration management for sure, and\n\n424\n00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:38.607\nrelease management.\n\n425\n00:21:38.607 --> 00:21:39.349\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n426\n00:21:39.349 --> 00:21:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Let me give you a clue here.\n\n427\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.050\nChange management is the accountable,\nremember how we loaded up these words,\n\n428\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.760\naccountable and responsible?\n\n429\n00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.223\nChange management is accountable for\nevery change, and\n\n430\n00:21:50.223 --> 00:21:52.178\nthe life cycle of every change.\n\n431\n00:21:52.178 --> 00:21:56.767\nIt makes sure it's evaluated, it makes\nsure that it's planned accordingly,\n\n432\n00:21:56.767 --> 00:22:00.751\nit makes sure it's tested appropriately,\ndeployed on time, etc.\n\n433\n00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:02.280\nIt is accountable.\n\n434\n00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.820\nRelease management is\nactually responsible.\n\n435\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.370\nRelease management does the planning,\ndoes the building and\n\n436\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.940\ntesting, does the deployment and\nfollows up with some review and closure.\n\n437\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.980\nSo, critical to change management\nis having a responsible arm, right,\n\n438\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.050\nnot just the authoritative arm.\n\n439\n00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.590\nAnd release management is\nthat responsible element.\n\n440\n00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:24.660\nSACM, as I call it,\nservice asset configuration management,\n\n441\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.540\nSACM, SACM is fundamental and\n\n442\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.430\nit defines all your components,\nand how they relate to each other.\n\n443\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.200\nSo, before you do a change,\nyou might look to SACM as a process\n\n444\n00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.620\nto make sure that the items that\nare there are under control, right?\n\n445\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.050\nSACM is identifying\nwhich CIs we care about.\n\n446\n00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.050\nChange management is controlling\nthe changes on those CIs we care about.\n\n447\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, so it sounds like that we're\nready to start talking about some of\n\n448\n00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.390\nthe aspects of designing for\nchange management.\n\n449\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.451\nWhat are some of the considerations or\ninputs that we really need when we start\n\n450\n00:22:57.451 --> 00:23:00.143\nthis process of designing for\nchange management?\n\n451\n00:23:00.143 --> 00:23:03.124\n&gt;&gt; So, reminding you that\nservice change management\n\n452\n00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:06.115\nis not identical to\nsolutions change management.\n\n453\n00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Certainly if you're managing\n\n454\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.950\ntechnology, there's disciplines for\n\n455\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.530\nmanaging technology and\nit does include that.\n\n456\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.069\nBut it goes beyond just technology.\n\n457\n00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.160\nService change includes things such\nas policy, process, engagements\n\n458\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.600\nwith the customer how you engage with\na customer those types of things.\n\n459\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.560\nSo, since it goes beyond just technology,\n\n460\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.450\nyou could get inputs from\nall over the place, right?\n\n461\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.780\nNot just the technology triggers.\n\n462\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.260\nCertainly, from technology vantage point.\n\n463\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.650\nThe vendor may call and say,\nyou should do this hot fix.\n\n464\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.970\nA user may ring the service desk.\n\n465\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.600\nOr 70 users may ring the service desk and\nsay, I can't find the submit button.\n\n466\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.265\nWhat happened to that button, right?\n\n467\n00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:45.985\nThose kind of things.\n\n468\n00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:50.225\nSo, it can be technical, certainly can be,\nbut it also could be process related.\n\n469\n00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:54.778\nYou recall earlier when I talked about\na service coming to me that had a 100\n\n470\n00:23:54.778 --> 00:23:57.282\nchanges a day, I need to tweek a process.\n\n471\n00:23:57.282 --> 00:23:59.190\nAnd I needed to change my actual process.\n\n472\n00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.115\nThat is under the scope of\nchange management as well.\n\n473\n00:24:02.115 --> 00:24:06.982\nSo that trigger came from a customer\nneed that needed to have that much churn\n\n474\n00:24:06.982 --> 00:24:09.080\nin change management, right?\n\n475\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.240\nSo the inputs to change management,\nhow you're going to strategize for\n\n476\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.190\nchange management are gonna be influenced\nby how fast, how much control, and\n\n477\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.840\nhow complex your environments are.\n\n478\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.000\nAnd what you decide is in scope.\n\n479\n00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.540\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry,\nif my organization let's say,\n\n480\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:32.240\nmay have some process that\nhas legal requirements on it,\n\n481\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.310\ndo I need to consider that also in\npart of the change management itself?\n\n482\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.700\nIs there a particular regulation\nthat I may have to follow?\n\n483\n00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.480\nSo, I'm not asking for\n\n484\n00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.470\nspecific regulation but is that something\nI need to consider if that happens?\n\n485\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n486\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.164\nImagine how hospitals are regulated for\nan instance and\n\n487\n00:24:50.164 --> 00:24:56.253\nmanage the IT solution that is monitoring\nthe heart rate of patients in the ICU.\n\n488\n00:24:56.253 --> 00:24:57.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n489\n00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.602\nThere's probably some critical\n\n490\n00:24:58.602 --> 00:24:59.400\nregulations-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.140\n&gt;&gt; Regarding how you control\n\n492\n00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.330\nthose systems, right?\n\n493\n00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.500\nThey go through a lot of testing.\n\n494\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.100\nThey're probably redundant,\nthose kind of things.\n\n495\n00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.120\nSo if you go about changing those systems,\n\n496\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.000\nsay you're the manufacturer\nof those systems.\n\n497\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.920\nThen you're going to be involved\nin necessary documentation,\n\n498\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.795\nproving you tested your profiles and\nthings.\n\n499\n00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:20.896\nI worked in the pharmaceutical\nindustry for many years and\n\n500\n00:25:20.896 --> 00:25:23.993\nthere were some systems\nthat we operated and\n\n501\n00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:29.616\nservices we operated that we close\nrelated to federally regulated processes.\n\n502\n00:25:29.616 --> 00:25:33.790\nSo if we wanna change any of that\nservices we had to show control.\n\n503\n00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n504\n00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.870\n&gt;&gt; So change management can be that lever\nthat shows you have things under control,\n\n505\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.950\nthat's how that kinda plays out,\nall right.\n\n506\n00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, then now the other thing\nthat I also wanted to ask about as well,\n\n507\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.620\nis that even though we can\nimplement change management,\n\n508\n00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.870\nit doesn't necessarily mean that people\nhave to do it the way that we say so.\n\n509\n00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.010\nWhat if they go,\nI know that this is what Ronnie said,\n\n510\n00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.110\nbut I'm going to do it my way.\n\n511\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.700\nDo we have to worry\nabout things like that?\n\n512\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.680\nAnd there's probably ways that we\ncan ensure that we don't allow for\n\n513\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.060\nunauthorized changes, right?\n\n514\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Well there's two things\nrelated to unauthorized change.\n\n515\n00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.539\nOne, you have to build the culture\nthat we're not going to do it.\n\n516\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.030\nBack that with policy.\n\n517\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which is even separate from\n\n518\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.940\nthe process, right?\n\n519\n00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.190\nAnd make sure the process is fit for\npurpose, right?\n\n520\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.320\nA lot of people circumvent the process\nbecause they find it's not fit for\n\n521\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.200\npurpose, right?\n\n522\n00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.410\nSo make sure, so\nanother thing is to audit, right?\n\n523\n00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:30.970\nAnd if you've got policy driving it,\nthe risk and reward factors.\n\n524\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.300\nIf there is a policy that says\nthou shalt not do and you do,\n\n525\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.680\nthen there should be some\nconsequences to it, right?\n\n526\n00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.730\nIf it's discovered,\nright that sort of thing.\n\n527\n00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I found out that what happened at\none particular place I was doing a little\n\n528\n00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.380\nbit of consulting on is that when we\nsaid here is what needs to be done and\n\n529\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.740\nthen they showed\nthe process of the change.\n\n530\n00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.970\nIt was just complex.\n\n531\n00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.050\nIt took like 25 changes.\n\n532\n00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.590\nWhen I said, why don't you all\njust do this and this instead?\n\n533\n00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.230\nAnd he's like, no, no,\nthis is what our process is.\n\n534\n00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.146\nSo I said, I don't want to mess\nwith your change of management,\n\n535\n00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:01.360\nbecause somebody did it\non purpose that way, and\n\n536\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.988\nit could be that certain things have to\nhappen as they come, a procedural step.\n\n537\n00:27:04.988 --> 00:27:08.980\nOr it's like the ball hitting the Coke\nbottle, which hits the spoon,\n\n538\n00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:10.095\nwhich does that.\n\n539\n00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:14.185\nAnd so I wasn't trying to\nundermine that strategy, but\n\n540\n00:27:14.185 --> 00:27:17.585\nI just didn't understand\nthat aspect of doing that.\n\n541\n00:27:17.585 --> 00:27:21.735\nAnd so I tried by accident to implement\nan unauthorized change that way.\n\n542\n00:27:21.735 --> 00:27:23.165\nAnd I probably shouldn't have done that.\n\n543\n00:27:23.165 --> 00:27:26.960\nBut you can kinda see where you\nreally don't understand that but\n\n544\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.780\nsomebody may have a procedure to it.\n\n545\n00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.300\nAnd having that change in management in\nplace somebody can come along and go,\n\n546\n00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.735\nno Ronnie, this is why we do it this way,\nand this is effective.\n\n547\n00:27:34.735 --> 00:27:37.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and it needs to\neffective, that's just it, Ronnie,\n\n548\n00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.100\nit needs to be effective.\n\n549\n00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.110\nIt's incumbent on the process owner to\nmake sure that the process is actually fit\n\n550\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.200\nfor purpose.\n\n551\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.600\nAnd you kind of alluded to an aspect\nwhere this looks like one change,\n\n552\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.230\nnot 25, why did you call it 25 changes?\n\n553\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.400\nThat's something change\nmanagement also needs to govern.\n\n554\n00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.540\nWhat are we gonna call a release unit?\n\n555\n00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.400\nIs it this entire service?\n\n556\n00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.460\nAnything affecting this service is\nconsidered a change for this service.\n\n557\n00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:05.652\nOr do you consider the one change or\none big change?\n\n558\n00:28:05.652 --> 00:28:09.821\n&gt;&gt; All right so now that we have\nan idea of what can happen and\n\n559\n00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:13.726\nsome of the inputs that we\nneed on designing change,\n\n560\n00:28:13.726 --> 00:28:18.518\nthe key comes in then is when\nsomebody requests a change as well,\n\n561\n00:28:18.518 --> 00:28:21.480\nand they way that we normally get them.\n\n562\n00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.800\nWorking for different sized organizations,\nI know that it's run the gamut for me.\n\n563\n00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.020\nWhereas sometimes like here at ITProTV,\nit's simple.\n\n564\n00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.340\nThere's really not,\neverybody that pretty much is on ITProTV,\n\n565\n00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.020\nwe kind of are just emailed\nhere is what needs to be done.\n\n566\n00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.980\nAnd then we make sure we document it down.\n\n567\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.180\nBut in a larger organization there was a\nticketing system and something like that.\n\n568\n00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.170\nSo let's talk about that idea\nof requesting changes and\n\n569\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.290\nwhy that's an important part\nof even change management.\n\n570\n00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.910\n&gt;&gt; Very good,\nI think that's a great example.\n\n571\n00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.540\nAs you mentioned, smaller organizations\ndon't need to necessarily have such formal\n\n572\n00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.310\nthings in place.\n\n573\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.740\nIt can be communications through email and\nthen something eventually becomes real and\n\n574\n00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.910\nactionable, that's totally legitimate.\n\n575\n00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.970\nLarger organizations probably need\na bit more defined processes and\n\n576\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.940\npoints of input, right.\n\n577\n00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.160\nAnd it depends, and again iTel is\nnot prescriptive in this regard,\n\n578\n00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.830\niTel will suggest you adapt these\nprinciples to your reality to\n\n579\n00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:19.200\norganization, and try to stay out of the\nway by providing the same kind of control.\n\n580\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.682\nSo, again we said before is it a big\nthing, is it a small thing, right?\n\n581\n00:29:24.682 --> 00:29:28.091\nAdding a widget to a SharePoint\ncan be very disruptive, so\n\n582\n00:29:28.091 --> 00:29:32.140\nit should be tested because widgets\ncan do harm as well, right.\n\n583\n00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.000\nSo you probably wanna pause on that.\n\n584\n00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.050\nChanging the standard template\nfrom the shade of orange to\n\n585\n00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.910\na different shade of orange.\n\n586\n00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.540\nNot as impactful, right?\n\n587\n00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.590\nSo understanding the differences there.\n\n588\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.620\nAnd of course replacing Lotus Notes\nwith SharePoint is huge, right?\n\n589\n00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.540\nAnd all points in between.\n\n590\n00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.600\nSo understanding that changes have\nvarying degrees of complexity and\n\n591\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.360\nadapting your change models to\nthat reality is what's important.\n\n592\n00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.670\nSo does that mean that every\nchange starts off as a project?\n\n593\n00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.760\nAbsolutely not.\n\n594\n00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.230\nAre some changes of that scope?\n\n595\n00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.090\nAbsolutely, they could be right?\n\n596\n00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.320\n&gt;&gt; So Terry in the idea of requesting for\nchange regardless of whether we're talking\n\n597\n00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.320\nabout small or large, there is supposed\nto be some type of formal way to do it.\n\n598\n00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.154\nIt's not just walk by the hall and go,\nTerry, do you mind changing this for me?\n\n599\n00:30:18.154 --> 00:30:22.552\nAnd then me walking on and you walking on,\nand 20 minutes later you forget, and\n\n600\n00:30:22.552 --> 00:30:24.410\n35 minutes later, I forget.\n\n601\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.140\nAnd then later on when a problem happens,\nnow I'm like, that's right.\n\n602\n00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.400\nI know I told Terry in\nthe hallway to make that change.\n\n603\n00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.300\nAnd I come back to Terry and Terry goes?\n\n604\n00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:34.910\nWhat?\n\n605\n00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n606\n00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.860\nSo when you talk about keeping\nrecords in change management,\n\n607\n00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.910\nyou're talking about that initiation too.\n\n608\n00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.640\nWhen do we start the change?\n\n609\n00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.450\nSo is a water cooler\nconversation sufficient?\n\n610\n00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:45.950\nNo, it's not.\n\n611\n00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.550\nThere's going to be some\nofficial record of the request.\n\n612\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.930\nAnd that's also going to be stored,\ntucked away,\n\n613\n00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.220\ninto the CMS just like the rest of\nthe milestones in that request.\n\n614\n00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.319\nYep.\n\n615\n00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:57.419\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry,\n\n616\n00:30:57.419 --> 00:31:02.048\nwhen we take a look there's a few other\nthings that we need to address here.\n\n617\n00:31:02.048 --> 00:31:05.098\nWe need to talk about\nsome types of changes and\n\n618\n00:31:05.098 --> 00:31:08.239\neven some idea of some\nremediation planning.\n\n619\n00:31:08.239 --> 00:31:12.320\nBut we are kind of heading close\nto the end of our time together.\n\n620\n00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.220\nAny last words on just\nwhat we've covered so far,\n\n621\n00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.020\nbecause I think we're just\ngoing to go on to a part two.\n\n622\n00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.520\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a great idea,\nand you're right,\n\n623\n00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.690\nI think that's a good place to\nstart the next conversation.\n\n624\n00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:25.090\nWe kind of set the table here that you\nneed to get change under control, and\n\n625\n00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.220\nthat you're going to have a mechanism\nof getting the change requests in, and\n\n626\n00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:32.490\nevaluate them, assessing risk and\nvalue and cost, right.\n\n627\n00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.560\nAnd once that's done you can\nthen proceed with the change.\n\n628\n00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.490\nBut how do we categorize these changes\nwould be a great place to start\n\n629\n00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.232\nin the next episode.\n\n630\n00:31:39.232 --> 00:31:41.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that sounds great.\n\n631\n00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.980\nThank you again Terry for helping us to\nat least get started in understanding how\n\n632\n00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.416\nimportant change management is and\nthe control of it as well.\n\n633\n00:31:48.416 --> 00:31:51.590\nAnd that means that we actually have\na lot more to cover as we start diving\n\n634\n00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.410\na little bit deeper.\n\n635\n00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.510\nSo you want to make sure that you\nstay around for that part two.\n\n636\n00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.100\nSigning off for\nITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n637\n00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n638\n00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:05.248\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore ITIL Release, Control and Validation.\n\n639\n00:32:05.248 --> 00:32:11.274\n[MUSIC]\n\n640\n00:32:11.274 --> 00:32:14.454\n&gt;&gt;

They discuss brief, as a review of the accountability of change management and the authority of change management as well.  Part of execution is to understand the types of changes and how to remediate changes too, according to the team.  Some aspects of execution involve planning and scheduling as well reviewing the changes to set the priority and urgency of the change.",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.240\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.350\nAnd today, we're taking a look at\nITIL Release, Control and Validation.\n\n8\n00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.460\nWe're specifically going into a part two\non change management, making sure that we\n\n9\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.990\nunderstand not only the importance\nof it but also some of the details.\n\n10\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.960\nAnd here to help us to continue on onward\nis going to be our ITIL expert himself,\n\n11\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.040\nMr Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.540\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n13\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.500\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.117\nAnd as you said we're going\nto look at some review here.\n\n15\n00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:40.913\nWe'll see some terminology and\n\n16\n00:00:40.913 --> 00:00:45.571\nsome concepts that we got from foundations\nreplayed here and remind ourselves just\n\n17\n00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:49.380\nwhat change management has in it's\ntoolkit to make it successful.\n\n18\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.030\nFirst of all, as a definition of\nchanges and the types of changes.\n\n19\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.340\nIf you look at the graphic here,\nyou'll see that ITIL describes three\n\n20\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.230\ntypes of change, normal,\nstandard, and emergency.\n\n21\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.610\nI want to talk a little out of order here.\n\n22\n00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.282\nEmergency changes are those changes\nthat must happen, they have to happen,\n\n23\n00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:14.916\nfor a good reason outside of\na normal change schedule, right.\n\n24\n00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.763\nIt could be that the system or\nthe service is about to fall over,\n\n25\n00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:20.750\nyou want to do some sort of\nchange to keep it from fall over.\n\n26\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.940\nIt could be the service has\nalready fallen over and\n\n27\n00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.920\nyou needed to implement something that\nbrings the service back to life, right.\n\n28\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.605\nIt could be, again, consider that\nheart monitor in the ICU unit.\n\n29\n00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You want to get there and\n\n30\n00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.188\nfix that quickly, right, so\nit could be life or limb.\n\n31\n00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:36.731\nIt could be organizational reputation,\n\n32\n00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:41.160\nit could be loss of credibility,\nit could be regulatory risk.\n\n33\n00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.812\nThere could be things that elevate\nthemselves up to an emergency that must be\n\n34\n00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:48.478\ndone before you wait for the normal\nchange cycle to come around, all right.\n\n35\n00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:51.990\nAnd then a standard change, we've got\nemergency and now we got standard.\n\n36\n00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.660\nA standard change is a change\nthat has gone through\n\n37\n00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.440\nchange management process one time for\napproval.\n\n38\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.190\nIt's been fully vetted, it is understood,\nit's generally repeatable and\n\n39\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.700\ngenerally low risk.\n\n40\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.300\nAnd then once it's approved once,\nyou don't have to go back for\n\n41\n00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.840\npermission anymore, right.\n\n42\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.970\nI'll give you an example of\nthat from my own experience.\n\n43\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.482\nWhen I used to maintain the learning\nmanagement system, the currency rates we\n\n44\n00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:18.320\nwere an international company and\nwe would maintain currency rates for\n\n45\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.370\nthe different countries that\nparticipated in learning, right.\n\n46\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.455\nAnd to go in and change those rates\nonce or twice a year we do it for\n\n47\n00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:28.398\neach of the countries,\nwas a back in change.\n\n48\n00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:32.178\nWe had to go behind the scenes, update\na value in a table in a database and\n\n49\n00:02:32.178 --> 00:02:35.090\nthat would change the currency rates,\nright.\n\n50\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.710\nSo it was generally low risk,\neasy to do, and repeatable.\n\n51\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.150\nSo we went and\ngot that approved one time, and then for\n\n52\n00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.130\nsubsequent times,\nwe didn't have to go back for permission.\n\n53\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.760\nNow we still kept records.\n\n54\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.940\nWe still tested to make\nsure it was viable.\n\n55\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.710\nWe still provided evidence that\nthe change was successful.\n\n56\n00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.200\nRight, we still had the due diligence, we\njust didn't have to go through the process\n\n57\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.890\nof approval, again,\nstreamlining the process.\n\n58\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.080\nThat's what a standard change is.\n\n59\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.920\nSo we got emergency,\n\n60\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.790\nwe got standard, now back to\nthe graphic we got a normal change.\n\n61\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.930\nA normal change is all the rest, right.\n\n62\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.890\nPerhaps this is difficult\nbecause normal and\n\n63\n00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.280\nstandard are very synonymous in some\ncontext, but they're different here.\n\n64\n00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.480\nStandard, it goes through the normal\nprocess one time, gets approved,\n\n65\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.970\niterated many times after.\n\n66\n00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.960\nEmergency, quick down and\ndirty, get it done.\n\n67\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.890\nNormal is all others.\n\n68\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.160\nNow that doesn't mean normal doesn't\nhave varying degrees of criticality,\n\n69\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.610\nurgency, and priority,\nit's just all the rest of them.\n\n70\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.334\nThat means they're go through\nthe process in complete all full,\n\n71\n00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:36.767\nall every time, right.\n\n72\n00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terri,\nwhen we start to deal with the idea of\n\n73\n00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.794\nthe different changes that\nyou have listed here,\n\n74\n00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:47.720\ndo I need to think about coming up with\na change management process for each type?\n\n75\n00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.980\nOr is this something that is just\nautomatically just going to be\n\n76\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.350\nknown as we generate a process for change?\n\n77\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.270\n&gt;&gt; It's certainly not automatic,\nand to answer your question, yes.\n\n78\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.580\nYou're going to have to come up with\nthe tactics and the procedures and\n\n79\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.000\nthe processes for\neach type of these changes.\n\n80\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.230\nAnd even a normal change,\neven the ones you categorize as normal,\n\n81\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.480\nyou're gonna come up with\ndifferent models for change.\n\n82\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.490\nWe'll talk about change\nmodels in a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.380\nBut a change model gives you the effective\nmeans to handle the different\n\n84\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.270\nkinds of changes.\n\n85\n00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.890\nFor instance, would you handle\na software installation change\n\n86\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.540\ndifferently than a server patching change?\n\n87\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.110\nPerhaps there's enough difference\nin those kinds of activities\n\n88\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.120\nthat you come up with different\nways of handling them.\n\n89\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.690\nMaybe one's a bit faster tracked,\nthe other one's a bit more deliberative.\n\n90\n00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.480\nSo you define what those are.\n\n91\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.819\nSo change management being this\nauthoritative accountable process is gonna\n\n92\n00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.020\ndo that due diligence to find out what\nchange models we need to put in place to\n\n93\n00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.370\ngovern our behaviors.\n\n94\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, when we start to\nalso think about then the idea of changes,\n\n95\n00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.470\nit looks like that we have to kind\nof juggle a lot of things here.\n\n96\n00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.650\nThe idea of the types of change,\nthe importance to make sure that we have\n\n97\n00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.210\nsome structured way to do it, but it also\nseems to include the very fact that we\n\n98\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.610\nneed to also say,\nall right what happens with changes that\n\n99\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.830\ndon't actually kind of do everything\nthat we want to do as well, right?\n\n100\n00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.990\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n101\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.335\nIf you've been in IT anytime at all,\nyou've had unsuccessful changes.\n\n102\n00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.230\nAnd unsuccessful can be defined\nin lots of ways, right.\n\n103\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.770\nIt could be that they wanted red and\nyou gave them blue, right.\n\n104\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.140\nIt could be you expect it to work and\nit didn't, it could be very bad, right?\n\n105\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.740\nSo, coming up with a plan for\n\n106\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.110\nwhat to do if the change isn't successful\nis called remediation planning, right.\n\n107\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.970\nIt's something you do before\nyour realize you need it, right.\n\n108\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.780\nIt's the what if plan.\n\n109\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.310\nWhat if this change doesn't work?\n\n110\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.550\nCome up with that plan.\n\n111\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.000\nSome people call them back out plans or\nrollback plans.\n\n112\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.060\nRemediation planning is probably\na bit better generic term because not\n\n113\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.220\nall changes can simply be rolled back or\n\n114\n00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.350\nbacked out, either because they're too\ncomplex or because they're just not steps.\n\n115\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.790\nThey're something you've done\nthat needs to change something.\n\n116\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.200\nSo before you approve a change, you need\nto evaluate their mediation plan and\n\n117\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.770\nhave it in place.\n\n118\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.170\n&gt;&gt; And Terry, I've worked in a change\nmanagement system where it not only\n\n119\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.650\nincluded the idea of the steps that\nI needed to follow in the change, but\n\n120\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.440\nalso at the bottom, before the change\ncould be submitted, I also had to include\n\n121\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.010\na back up plan with it to be submitted and\napproved before anything.\n\n122\n00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.990\nAnd so that was part of their process,\nwhich just said we're not gonna be able to\n\n123\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.220\nsubmit a change, a request,\nif you don't have a way to back out of it.\n\n124\n00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.890\nAnd so I didn't know cuz I was\nyounger a little bit then.\n\n125\n00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.820\nAnd I said, well, why do we need that,\ncuz I mean what was the purpose?\n\n126\n00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.430\nAnd finally somebody say, Ronnie,\nif you are not here to make that back out,\n\n127\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.410\ncuz you are the only one that makes\nthe change, you are not here to do it,\n\n128\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.660\nhow do we know what you did and\nhow do we know how to back out of it?\n\n129\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.010\nAnd I did not think about\nthat until that point.\n\n130\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.230\nSo, it's stuff that we\nhave to worry about.\n\n131\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.060\n&gt;&gt; And also consider again,\nthere are some changes,\n\n132\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.420\neither because of the complexity of\nthem or because of the nature of\n\n133\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.950\nwhat you're affecting on the business\nside, you can't just take it away.\n\n134\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.830\nYou have to move forward with it.\n\n135\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.960\nSo that's what our\nremediation planning is.\n\n136\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.140\nBack out is the classic example\nof remediation planning.\n\n137\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.830\nPlease keep in mind that\nnot all remediation plans\n\n138\n00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.990\nhave that option of being able\nto take something back, right.\n\n139\n00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.210\nAnd again, why you do it before hand?\n\n140\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.340\nSo you don't have to scramble around,\nhow do we repeat these things?\n\n141\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.490\nOr how do we get out of this?\n\n142\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.090\nRight.\n\n143\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, there's also several\ndifferent terms that we may actually come\n\n144\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.450\nacross because of working in different\nsectors of industry or technology.\n\n145\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.196\nBut we need to know whether\nthey're the same or not.\n\n146\n00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:44.440\nSo specifically, yes, you call it thing\nlike change, change proposal, RFCs,\n\n147\n00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.120\nchange records,\ndo they all really mean the same thing?\n\n148\n00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.350\n&gt;&gt; They do not mean the same thing.\n\n149\n00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's is very important to\n\n150\n00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.380\nunderstand that.\n\n151\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.103\nRemember you have a glossary\nthat's downloadable as well.\n\n152\n00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:55.960\nBut if you look at\nthe graphic here you can see,\n\n153\n00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.897\nkeeping straight on these\nwords is kinda hard.\n\n154\n00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:01.786\nWhat's the difference between\na request and a proposal for instance?\n\n155\n00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:04.940\nThey sound the same in English,\nthey can mean the same thing.\n\n156\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.580\nThe difference between\na change request and\n\n157\n00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.700\na change proposal, is a change\nproposal is for something big and\n\n158\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.940\nsignificant at the strategic level or even\nat the tactical level, it's something big.\n\n159\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.270\nLook at this way,\n\n160\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.530\nif you have a standing group of people\nthat regularly review changes, and\n\n161\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:31.170\nthey get a request for\nchange that's in their normal duties.\n\n162\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.680\nThey may realize, well now,\nthis is a big one.\n\n163\n00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.960\nThis is too big,\nthis is beyond my pay grade, so to speak.\n\n164\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.340\nThis is going to require significant\ninvestment or significant business change.\n\n165\n00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.060\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea,\nI just can't act on it.\n\n166\n00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.240\nSo they send it upstairs, so to speak.\n\n167\n00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.890\nThey'll send it back to service strategy\nand say look, here is an opportunity.\n\n168\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.440\nHere is an opportunity to\nmake a big difference.\n\n169\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.170\nWhy don't you vet this out more fully\nin terms of business investment,\n\n170\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.750\nimpact analysis, etc.\n\n171\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.670\nGet the business buying in, etc.\n\n172\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.150\nSo then the output becomes\na change proposal.\n\n173\n00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.710\nIt's for something big.\n\n174\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:12.590\nSo a request for change is probably gonna\nbe for those normal, standard changes.\n\n175\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.420\nA change proposal is probably gonna be for\nthe big things,\n\n176\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.978\nthe ones that are probably\nproject-driven okay?\n\n177\n00:09:17.978 --> 00:09:19.744\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n178\n00:09:19.744 --> 00:09:25.100\nAll right, we also wanna take a look then\nat a moment here on the idea of models and\n\n179\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.610\nworkflows, as well.\n\n180\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.170\nVery easy at times to think that\neverything will work just because you\n\n181\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.280\nlearned about it in one company,\nthat can take over another company, but\n\n182\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.830\nyou might find out something that,\neven though you know it one way,\n\n183\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.690\nanother company tells you\nsomething different, but\n\n184\n00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.960\nthere are some generic models that we\ncan follow that might help us out.\n\n185\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.280\nSo Terry, when we start to talk\nabout that, this is kind of one of\n\n186\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.900\nthe great things about ITEL is because\nit can kind of follow along and\n\n187\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.640\ngive you at least those basic principles.\n\n188\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.490\n&gt;&gt; Indeed.\n\n189\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.190\nSo, the idea of a model, a change\nmodel is, the idea is that you come up\n\n190\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.390\nwith some predefined ways to handle\nparticular kinds of changes.\n\n191\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.700\nAs we talked about just briefly before,\nperhaps the way you wanna\n\n192\n00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.670\nhandle a server patch change, when you're\naffecting 300 servers over the weekend.\n\n193\n00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.410\nYou might wanna handle that differently\nthan you wanna handle a software\n\n194\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.060\ninstallation, right, for an individual.\n\n195\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.410\nSo you have a change model,\n\n196\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.340\none that describes how you do\nserver patching over the weekend,\n\n197\n00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.940\nanother one of how you fulfill\nrequests for software installations.\n\n198\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.010\nMaybe even under that regime for\nsoftware installations,\n\n199\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.020\nyou might even have a different model for\n\n200\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.790\nhow you handle executive requests versus\nemployee request, those kinds of things.\n\n201\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.690\nSo a change model generically\nis simply the predefined steps.\n\n202\n00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.420\nThe who, what, when, where, and\n\n203\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.030\nhow a particular type of change\nshould be governed, right?\n\n204\n00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n205\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.750\n&gt;&gt; Whose gonna be in play?\n\n206\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.650\nWhat are the escalation points?\n\n207\n00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.110\nWhat are the timings, etc.?\n\n208\n00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.280\nAnd again,\ndifferent types of changes come in there.\n\n209\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.940\nSo maybe you handle a document change\ndifferently than you handle a technical\n\n210\n00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.745\nchange, etc.\n\n211\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:57.290\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\n\n212\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.920\nin that idea of taking\na look at that model and\n\n213\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.255\nthose processes, and what you talked about\nis normally is included in those models,\n\n214\n00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:06.780\nit's really essential that\nwe take that to heart.\n\n215\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.740\nJust like what you were mentioning in a\nprevious episode, ITEL's not telling you,\n\n216\n00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.232\nuse this system, right?\n\n217\n00:11:12.232 --> 00:11:16.270\nThey're essentially saying that this is\nwhat normally is going to be involved\n\n218\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.590\nif you want some type of model or\nprocess to kind of come forward and\n\n219\n00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.260\nbe something that you want to kind\nof live by and be governed by.\n\n220\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.530\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we understand that.\n\n221\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.984\nSo don't think ITEL's saying,\n\n222\n00:11:27.984 --> 00:11:32.950\nhere's the system you better use, it is\nabout the principle nature in itself.\n\n223\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.750\nSo, Terry going on from here,\nwhat do we need to think about next then?\n\n224\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, this following graphic\nkind of shows you the scale of it.\n\n225\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.035\nI don't wanna invite you to\nread the four point font here.\n\n226\n00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:45.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But please have a look at the graphic\n\n227\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.050\nat a high level.\n\n228\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.300\nAnd I wanna point out\njust a few things here.\n\n229\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.950\nChange management activities will\nnecessarily flow along certain milestones.\n\n230\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.770\nIt's gonna be initiated,\na change gonna be initiated.\n\n231\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.590\nIt's going to be evaluated for\nits value statements, you know,\n\n232\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.280\nwhat is the value of this\nchange versus risk, right?\n\n233\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.690\nIt's gonna be passed to another process,\nrelease and deployment management,\n\n234\n00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:14.550\nto determine the planning and scope and\nsize, and packaging of the changes, right?\n\n235\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.920\nSo you'll see as you go through that\nthat there's various milestones.\n\n236\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.730\nThese milestones should be recorded.\n\n237\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.550\nThey become part of the record themselves.\n\n238\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.840\nIt's not just a single\ndocument requesting something.\n\n239\n00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.815\nIt is a document,\n\n240\n00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:29.900\nit's a change of a document that's\ngoing through, I should say,\n\n241\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.500\nit's a document of a change that's going\nthrough different stages of approval.\n\n242\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.670\nThe approval of it being planned.\n\n243\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.480\nThe approval for\nit to actually be built and tested.\n\n244\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.050\nThe approval for it to be deployed,\nare all milestones.\n\n245\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.920\nEach one of those milestones\nshould be recorded along the way.\n\n246\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.790\nSo, it's not just the fact that you record\nthe change and then some time later say,\n\n247\n00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.800\nit's done.\n\n248\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.130\nYou're actually recording\nthe milestones along the way.\n\n249\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.010\nThat's what this graphic points\nout in some level of detail.\n\n250\n00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.420\nBut understanding the big picture\nhere is what's important.\n\n251\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.900\nChange management is going to govern the\nprocess by which a change is identified,\n\n252\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.900\nand as it progresses\nthrough those milestones.\n\n253\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.530\n&gt;&gt; So when we talk about, then, the\nbeginning of change management, then and\n\n254\n00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.570\nwhat those processes are to do so.\n\n255\n00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.090\nWe start to take a look at the ideas of\nlogging and some other things, don't we?\n\n256\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.080\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n257\n00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.640\nKeeping records is what you're doing.\n\n258\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.340\nYou're keeping a record of\nthis change that goes through.\n\n259\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.680\nAd nauseum, perhaps.\n\n260\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.310\nThis is the part that folks\nlook at as bureaucracy.\n\n261\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.970\nWhy do I have to document this change?\n\n262\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.800\nI just told you at the water cooler,\nright?\n\n263\n00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.840\nNow if a customer is asking you something,\n\n264\n00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.230\nyou probably don't want to burden the\ncustomer with the formalization process.\n\n265\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.900\nSo you'll do it on their behalf.\n\n266\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.550\nBut you need to put in writing, put it in\na document, put it in a system somehow.\n\n267\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.360\nArticulate in no uncertain\nterms what is being requested.\n\n268\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.930\nAnd again, as I mentioned before,\n\n269\n00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:54.280\nat what point in the scale is\nit falling on these milestones?\n\n270\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.730\nSo as you look at your logging,\nyour reviewing, you're going through\n\n271\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.640\nthe various milestones and\nyou're keeping score, along the way.\n\n272\n00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.620\nHow long did it stay in the queue\nbetween request and fulfillment?\n\n273\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n274\n00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.050\n&gt;&gt; How long did it stay in the queue\nbetween planning and deployment, right?\n\n275\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.860\nYou could also keep up\nwith those time scales.\n\n276\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.390\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, having worked for, same\norganization, but having worked at another\n\n277\n00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.490\ntime, there were some times where just\nthroughout the year where you would get\n\n278\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:27.320\na tremendous amount of changes and\nnot every single change needed to be done.\n\n279\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.180\nBut is there,\ndo we need to actually process that like,\n\n280\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.500\nthere's a process to say that this is\nokay to do, or this is okay not to do?\n\n281\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.600\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n282\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.260\nChange models will help with that.\n\n283\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.010\nRemember we talked about a model giving\nyou the who, what, when, where, and why?\n\n284\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.370\nHaving change models defined is\ngonna be a good first step in\n\n285\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.459\nunderstanding how you're gonna progress.\n\n286\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.690\nI operated a change management\nboard that reviewed the changes for\n\n287\n00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.570\nlike, 28 different services.\n\n288\n00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.260\nAnd we did have those that\nwe could easily approve.\n\n289\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.240\nIf it was a break fix thing, meaning\nyou're fixing something that's broken.\n\n290\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.110\nThat's in our remit.\n\n291\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.300\nGet it fixed.\n\n292\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.690\nIf the color is supposed to be red and\nits blue, yeah, fix it.\n\n293\n00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.130\nIf it was an enhancement request that\ncost less than some dollar amount,\n\n294\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.730\nwe also had authority to approve those,\nright?\n\n295\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.305\nAgain, your change models\nare gonna describe that.\n\n296\n00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:21.715\nAnd then if it went above that, then\nthere was another change model that says,\n\n297\n00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:23.805\nhere's how you handle those changes,\nright?\n\n298\n00:15:23.805 --> 00:15:25.565\nSo that's the nature of the beast.\n\n299\n00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:28.715\nAnd Change Management as a process\nis answering those kind of\n\n300\n00:15:28.715 --> 00:15:29.615\ngood questions, Ronnie.\n\n301\n00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:33.135\nIt's putting them down, so\neveryone understands them.\n\n302\n00:15:33.135 --> 00:15:33.885\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n303\n00:15:33.885 --> 00:15:37.305\n&gt;&gt; So once you actually have something and\nyou realize, like you said,\n\n304\n00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:39.240\nyou're part of a Change Management board.\n\n305\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.470\nAnd you just say, rejected.\n\n306\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:42.490\nI've had this happen to me.\n\n307\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.900\nIt was actually handed back to me,\nand said rejected.\n\n308\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.830\nOkay.\nAnd I hate to say,\n\n309\n00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.162\nthat was kind of fucked because I said,\nthis change really need to be done-\n\n310\n00:15:50.162 --> 00:15:50.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.569\n&gt;&gt; And then it took me a day or\n\n312\n00:15:52.569 --> 00:15:56.651\ntwo before I could get back to ask,\nwhat had happened?\n\n313\n00:15:56.651 --> 00:15:58.425\nAnd they had just forgotten\nto write the reason for it.\n\n314\n00:15:58.425 --> 00:15:59.562\n&gt;&gt; They did forget.\n\n315\n00:15:59.562 --> 00:16:02.197\n&gt;&gt; And once they actually\nwrote the reason for it, Or\n\n316\n00:16:02.197 --> 00:16:03.970\nthey told me what the reason was.\n\n317\n00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.683\nAnd it was just another change was\nhappening on the day that I had submitted\n\n318\n00:16:06.683 --> 00:16:07.510\nthe request for it.\n\n319\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And they didn't wanna deal with\n\n320\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.410\nthe two changes.\n\n321\n00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.370\nBut forgetting that,\nthat's pretty important, isn't it?\n\n322\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n323\n00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.340\nChange management should also\nunderstand that exit, right?\n\n324\n00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.290\nIf we are going to reject this,\nthere needs to be good reasons behind it.\n\n325\n00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.410\nIf it was a date thing,\nI wouldn't even say rejected,\n\n326\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.380\nI would keep it under review.\n\n327\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.270\nI wouldn't even go to the point of\nrejecting, cuz if all you're rejecting is\n\n328\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:35.080\nthe requested date and not the change,\nthen why start over again.\n\n329\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.620\nSo again, different ways to define it,\n\n330\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.480\ndifferent ways to define\nthese kinds of things.\n\n331\n00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.910\nBut this analysis and\nreview should include\n\n332\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.800\nthe ways you interface back with\nthe requester all the way through that.\n\n333\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.590\nCuz at a given time you have to\ngo back to that requester and\n\n334\n00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.485\ntell them what's going on.\n\n335\n00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:53.770\n&gt;&gt; And it ended up where the person\nthat I have finally talked to and\n\n336\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.220\njust said,\njust submit it with the different date.\n\n337\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.870\nAnd I guess it was because we really did\nto have so many different changes that\n\n338\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.830\nwere being submitted at point,\nthey couldn't just say were gonna keep it.\n\n339\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.070\nThey just went ahead and just rejected\neverybody else that had changes that day.\n\n340\n00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.611\nBecause whatever change that was going on,\nthey didn't tell me.\n\n341\n00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.687\nIt was apparently that important that they\njust took everybody off that schedule.\n\n342\n00:17:12.687 --> 00:17:13.542\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:17:13.542 --> 00:17:15.306\n&gt;&gt; And again, I understand that challenge,\n\n344\n00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:15.895\nI totally do.\n\n345\n00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:18.650\nAnd the way, I have faced similar changes.\n\n346\n00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.926\nWhat we built into our change models,\nall the change models,\n\n347\n00:17:21.926 --> 00:17:24.071\nwas you can put a date that you desire it.\n\n348\n00:17:24.071 --> 00:17:26.067\nWe'll get back with you\nwith the real answer.\n\n349\n00:17:26.067 --> 00:17:27.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, right.\n\n350\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.470\n&gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we\nreject it because of the date.\n\n351\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.560\nWe did not reject changes\nbased on the date.\n\n352\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.173\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n353\n00:17:33.173 --> 00:17:33.863\n&gt;&gt; Ever.\n\n354\n00:17:33.863 --> 00:17:34.717\nThere would be other reasons.\n\n355\n00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:36.449\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It is just a matter of timing,\n\n356\n00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:39.449\nwell you might not get it in March,\nit might be March 2012.\n\n357\n00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:41.754\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; 2018, 2020.\n\n358\n00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n359\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.930\n&gt;&gt; But you will get it, right?\n\n360\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.700\nSo different ways to handle it,\nand your model should define that.\n\n361\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n362\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:48.820\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n363\n00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.145\n&gt;&gt; All right so let's talk about this idea\nalso in change management, you've got 7\n\n364\n00:17:53.145 --> 00:17:58.460\nR's that we want to talk about here And\nthe alliteration is actually there for\n\n365\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.680\na good reason, I'm assuming,\nsince you kind of emphasized this.\n\n366\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, I appreciate the 7 R's.\n\n367\n00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:05.940\nFirst of all, there's too many R's.\n\n368\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n\n369\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.820\n&gt;&gt; Seven, any kind of mnemonic device\nthat has any more than these kind\n\n370\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.800\nof things has gotta be questionable.\n\n371\n00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.660\nBut let me just give you an over.\n\n372\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.427\nMemorizing these 7 R's and 25 cents will\nget you a bad cup of coffee on exam day.\n\n373\n00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:20.967\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; That's all,\n\n374\n00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:21.927\nyou're not gonna get anything out of this,\nreally.\n\n375\n00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:22.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But,\n\n376\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.470\nI really like it in terms of review,\nif you build these into your model.\n\n377\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.790\nSo when you try to get reflective,\nand you're going back and\n\n378\n00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.400\nyou're trying to design some\nchange management processes.\n\n379\n00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.720\nWhen you get to the assess and\n\n380\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.300\nevaluate, these are the questions\nyou're gonna answer.\n\n381\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.810\nSo getting this for the exam,\nnot that meaningful for you.\n\n382\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It really isn't.\n\n383\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.880\nBut understanding that,\nI will go through these.\n\n384\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.620\nI think it's important to understand just\nhow the scope of assessment evaluation is,\n\n385\n00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.610\nnot just looking at the technical\nnature of the change.\n\n386\n00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.630\nIt's not just looking at\nthe cost of the change.\n\n387\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.170\nIt's looking at who raised it.\n\n388\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.920\nAre they important enough\nthat we must say yes?\n\n389\n00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.130\nIf you have enough critical customers\nof your service that says I want,\n\n390\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.650\nyou're gonna pay a bit more attention\nto those than to an employee that says,\n\n391\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.055\nwouldn't it be nice, right.\n\n392\n00:19:12.055 --> 00:19:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's just a little\n\n393\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.930\nbit different, right.\n\n394\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.920\nSo understanding who\nraised it's important and\n\n395\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.680\nwhat value's gonna be delivered from it,\nthe reason why you want this change.\n\n396\n00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.280\nIs that a valid reason, right?\n\n397\n00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.820\nWhat are we gonna get in return,\nwhat are the risks, of course?\n\n398\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.620\nWhat's it gonna take?\n\n399\n00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.870\nHow much money, how many people, ect.\n\n400\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.510\nAnd who can do it?\n\n401\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.660\nDo I have to outsource it?\n\n402\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.601\nDo I have the skill\nsets inside to do this?\n\n403\n00:19:34.601 --> 00:19:36.788\nAnd then ongoing communications and\n\n404\n00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:40.270\nhow this change is interacting\nwith other changes.\n\n405\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.190\nYou said you were ejected on one\nbecause another change could\n\n406\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.570\nbe potentially conflicting.\n\n407\n00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.020\nThat's obviously something\nyou have to consider for\n\n408\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.690\nevery change you want to consider.\n\n409\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Again, memorizing these 7 R's,\n\n410\n00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.300\nI'm not encouraging you to do so.\n\n411\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.040\nUnderstanding that there's a lot of\nfactors in your assessment evaluation.\n\n412\n00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.480\n&gt;&gt; Now, speaking of that, since you've\nkind of dealt with the idea of the change.\n\n413\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.690\nWell, I've never been on the change board,\nbut you have.\n\n414\n00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.950\nWhen it comes down to\nunderstanding the risk of this.\n\n415\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.262\nThere could be so\nmany diversities in terms of the risk for\n\n416\n00:20:08.262 --> 00:20:12.747\none particular change where it might\ninfluence three or four departments and\n\n417\n00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:15.036\nanother one might only influence two.\n\n418\n00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:19.640\nHow do you take that into account\nas far as the risk of this change?\n\n419\n00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.750\nIf you realize that this one change might\naffect seven different departments.\n\n420\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.800\nVersus this one where it\nalmost seems as important but\n\n421\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.760\nit may only affect one department.\n\n422\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.340\nIs that something you have to consider\nwhen you're on a change board?\n\n423\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Good call, and yes it is.\n\n424\n00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.390\nAnd I appreciate how you\ntalked about departments.\n\n425\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.480\nYou didn't talk about\njust technical things.\n\n426\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.430\nRight, you can look at technical risk.\n\n427\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.020\nAnd make a good guess that\nthis is a pretty simple thing.\n\n428\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.810\nI know John, he's a good developer,\nor whatever.\n\n429\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.110\nYou know these folks, you know they\ncan do this, it's relatively simple.\n\n430\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.720\nAnd you can look at it technically and\nsay low risk.\n\n431\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.900\nAnd if you just take that assessment and\nthen you roll it out.\n\n432\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.530\nWhile it was technically easy and\n\n433\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.040\nlow risk,\nyou affected seven different departments.\n\n434\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; They're screaming come Monday morning.\n\n435\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.160\nYou implement it on Saturday.\n\n436\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.348\nWhat did you do?\n\n437\n00:21:04.348 --> 00:21:05.170\nWhat did you do?\n\n438\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.180\nI can't believe you didn't\ntell us about that.\n\n439\n00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.940\nSo, that's good insights, Ronnie, is that\nwhen you talk about change management,\n\n440\n00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.560\nyou're not just talking about technology.\n\n441\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.670\nAnd risk is not just technical risk.\n\n442\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.880\nIt's business risk.\n\n443\n00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.850\nWhat's the risk of not training people?\n\n444\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.650\nWhat's the risk of not having\nuser acceptance testing?\n\n445\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.380\nWhat's the risk of not getting service\nacceptance criteria understood?\n\n446\n00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.890\nThose are risks involved, and\nyou should evaluate those early and often.\n\n447\n00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.600\nGood.\n\n448\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.560\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Good insights.\n\n449\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and so, yeah.\n\n450\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.826\nThere's just a lot of\nthese things where I said,\n\n451\n00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:41.330\nI think I learned about these in\nthe fashion that I was actually on the end\n\n452\n00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.685\nthat never got the change\ndone that I wanted to.\n\n453\n00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:45.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time,\n\n454\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.820\nI could see why it was done.\n\n455\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.360\nBut as you continue to talk about\nthis idea of assessment and\n\n456\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.880\nevaluating whether or\nnot a change can be done.\n\n457\n00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.560\nWe really do have to continue on, because\nthere's more to this than just that idea\n\n458\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.730\nof the 7 R's where you talk about this.\n\n459\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.490\nYou also talk about the idea\nof accountability as well, and\n\n460\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.490\nhow things are carried out.\n\n461\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.440\nSo let's talk about that\nidea of accountability and\n\n462\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.160\nimpact to resources a little bit more.\n\n463\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.320\n&gt;&gt; Good point, the overarching value\n\n464\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.415\nof change management is to make\nsure you can deliver value.\n\n465\n00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.850\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You're not just changing for\n\n466\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.940\nthe sake of change, right?\n\n467\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:25.810\nSo the person that has their finger on\nthe pulse of value of their service most,\n\n468\n00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.310\nand is most accountable,\nis the service owner.\n\n469\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:34.790\nSo while the change management process is\ngoverning, is providing structures and\n\n470\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:41.560\nprocess of resistance if you will or\nslow downs.\n\n471\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.620\nThe service owner is the one\nthat is accountable for\n\n472\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.530\nthe quality of their service.\n\n473\n00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.680\nSo they have their finger on the pulse.\n\n474\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.520\nThey're gonna be involved\nin approving changes.\n\n475\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.130\nThe service owner's gonna somehow be\nrepresented through this process.\n\n476\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.630\nNo change should happen to a service\nwithout the service owner's awareness,\n\n477\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.060\nbasically, cuz they're\nultimately accountable for it.\n\n478\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.760\nSo as you get the change advisory\nboard together, that's the group\n\n479\n00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.100\nof people that get together to approve\nchanges, the service will be represented.\n\n480\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.220\nThe service owner's gonna be there.\n\n481\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.710\nThe change manager is gonna\nbe chairing that meeting and\n\n482\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:18.030\nmaking sure it progresses methodically and\nquickly enough.\n\n483\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.240\nBut the service owner is gonna\nbe represented and weighing in.\n\n484\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:25.380\n&gt;&gt; Alright, now the other things that\nwe also need to address is things like.\n\n485\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.290\nLet me make sure I'm actually\non the right page here,\n\n486\n00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.050\ntaking a look at things like priority.\n\n487\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.770\nWhat is the difference, you mentioned\na couple of concepts called impact and\n\n488\n00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.270\nurgency.\n\n489\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.760\nWhat are those primary differences there?\n\n490\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.960\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting.\n\n491\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:46.060\nPriority is at the intersection\nof impact and urgency.\n\n492\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.390\nHow fast it needs to be done and\nwhat's going to be delivered,\n\n493\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:51.380\nbecause you're doing it.\n\n494\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.740\nIt's at the intersection of it.\n\n495\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.211\nSo, if you have something that's\ngoing to be of significant impact.\n\n496\n00:23:55.211 --> 00:23:58.981\nLet's say it's a major change or\nyou're plugging a security risk,\n\n497\n00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:00.809\nyou're doing a security patch.\n\n498\n00:24:00.809 --> 00:24:01.648\nRight.\n\n499\n00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:04.700\nMost folks consider those necessary\nenough that we gotta get them done at\n\n500\n00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.090\na timely fashion.\n\n501\n00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.620\nSo, the risk assessment there\nis we are having a big risk.\n\n502\n00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.470\nSo the impact of not doing\nthis change is big, right?\n\n503\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.520\nThe urgency, well,\nwe can be methodical about this.\n\n504\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.470\nWe don't have to do it\njust as it's announced,\n\n505\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.180\nwe can do it three weeks from now.\n\n506\n00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.740\nSo while the impact is potentially high,\nthe urgency could be lower, right?\n\n507\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.690\nAnd again, at that intersection,\nyou get priority, all right, good.\n\n508\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.640\n&gt;&gt; The other thing of course then, is\nalong with this idea of taking a look at\n\n509\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.000\nthe change management, we've already\nalluded with this several times but\n\n510\n00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.980\nwe really do need to make the impact\nof why it's important that we plan or\n\n511\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.520\nspace these things out and schedule them.\n\n512\n00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.140\nI know that there are some\npeople like this and\n\n513\n00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.520\nI've seen this happen just on\nan individual server basis where,\n\n514\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:59.170\nI tended to roll out one particular update\nat a time, see what the effects are and\n\n515\n00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.630\nthen move on from there if\neverything was fine and stable.\n\n516\n00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.933\nBut I've also had other people who and\njust said, I'm just gonna click and\n\n517\n00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:08.170\ncheck all of these.\n\n518\n00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.920\nAnd it might work sometimes, but\n\n519\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.460\nthere are a lot of times where\nthey were just backing out of\n\n520\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.910\nall of those updates that they had just\ndone, and then had to do it again.\n\n521\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.220\nSo why is scheduling going to help\nus out with something like that?\n\n522\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.892\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you a couple\nof examples here.\n\n523\n00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:24.860\nSome things need to be probably fixed or\nchanged a bit more quickly.\n\n524\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.830\nSo if there's something broken,\nit needs to be fixed.\n\n525\n00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.245\nYou're probably gonna be\na bit quicker about those.\n\n526\n00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you're simply changing the color,\n\n527\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.280\nthat burnt orange wasn't quite right for\nthe customer.\n\n528\n00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.475\nYou want to change the interface, those\nsorts of things, that's not as urgent.\n\n529\n00:25:37.475 --> 00:25:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And it's also a change of\n\n530\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.248\nthat can be grouped with other changes\nperhaps for functionality purposes, right?\n\n531\n00:25:44.248 --> 00:25:48.490\nIf you wanna do a full rewrite of\nthe interface, rearrange the menus and\n\n532\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.660\nthings like that,\nthat needs to take some time.\n\n533\n00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.397\nIt's not necessarily broken,\nit just could be better, right?\n\n534\n00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.390\nSo, planning and\n\n535\n00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:59.970\nscheduling is an activity that's actually\ndone by releasing employment management.\n\n536\n00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.040\nChange management is going to authorize\nthat activity and the details of that\n\n537\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.720\nactivity are gonna be done there,\nwhich we'll talk about in detail later on.\n\n538\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.980\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n539\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry,\n\n540\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.020\nwe've really got a couple\nof minutes left overall.\n\n541\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.510\nAnd there's still a lot for\n\n542\n00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:20.130\nus to actually cover when we start to\ntake a look at this idea of change.\n\n543\n00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.280\nWe haven't even gotten to the idea\nof authorizing change yet.\n\n544\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.543\nDo we want to go ahead and introduce that\nfor the next or do you wanna hold off?\n\n545\n00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.021\n&gt;&gt; I think we can briefly\ndismiss a few things here.\n\n546\n00:26:28.021 --> 00:26:29.158\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sounds great.\n\n547\n00:26:29.158 --> 00:26:32.140\n&gt;&gt; Change management, if you will,\nand I'll tidy this up.\n\n548\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.830\nChange management, as I mentioned before,\nis the authoritative,\n\n549\n00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.700\nthe accountable process.\n\n550\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Releasing deployment is the execution\n\n551\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.350\nstage, the ones that are responsible for\nit.\n\n552\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.865\nWhat change management does, is authorize\nvarious phases of release in deployment.\n\n553\n00:26:46.865 --> 00:26:47.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n554\n00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.430\n&gt;&gt; They authorize the planning and\nscheduling.\n\n555\n00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.150\nRelease and deployment does it.\n\n556\n00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.380\nThey do the planning and scheduling.\n\n557\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.870\nThey might group five break fix\nchanges for delivery in six weeks.\n\n558\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.370\nThese enhancements are going\nto come in 12 weeks.\n\n559\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.400\nThey'll make that decision in planning and\nscheduling.\n\n560\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.690\nThat goes back up to the change\nadvisory board, who then says okay,\n\n561\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.650\nI like your plan for the break fix and\nfor the enhancements.\n\n562\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.560\nI approve the next step.\n\n563\n00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; The next step is building and testing.\n\n564\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:16.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n565\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.260\n&gt;&gt; After building and testing,\nit goes to deployment.\n\n566\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.230\nAfter deployment it goes to review and\nclose.\n\n567\n00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.000\nChange is authorized in\neach one of those faces.\n\n568\n00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n569\n00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.900\n&gt;&gt; Release and deployment is executing.\n\n570\n00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.630\nAnd that tied this up change management.\n\n571\n00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.920\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n572\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.550\nWell, again Terry does a lot of\nmaterials for us to kind of chew on and\n\n573\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.680\nthen think about.\n\n574\n00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.680\nIf this is your first, then we're all\nkind of a bit more of a deep dive instead\n\n575\n00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.365\nof us just saying, change management,\nthere has to be a process to it.\n\n576\n00:27:45.365 --> 00:27:47.740\nWell you've actually heard\nall the terminology,\n\n577\n00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.250\nyou've actually been introduced to\nall of those different concepts and\n\n578\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.470\nthese are very important concepts as\nyou're preparing not only for itell,\n\n579\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.820\nbut actual change management roles that\nyou may actually be involved in as well.\n\n580\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.720\nBut we do need to make sure\n\n581\n00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.170\nwe pay attention to\nthe terminology that Terry used.\n\n582\n00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:05.500\nAnd also, some of those particular\nprocesses that he's been talking about.\n\n583\n00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.420\nAnd those stages as well, it's gonna help\nyou out as you get ready for that exam.\n\n584\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.900\nWell, Terry, thank you again for\nyour help in helping us well.\n\n585\n00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.960\nAnd it looks like we're actually going\nto be doing a bit more on some change\n\n586\n00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.330\nmanagement, as well.\n\n587\n00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.880\nSo that means we are assuring\nin to our part three.\n\n588\n00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.320\nBut until that point, we're signing off.\n\n589\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.575\nFor IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n590\n00:28:26.575 --> 00:28:27.600\n&gt;&gt; And I am Terry Decker.\n\n591\n00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.883\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore itell release control and validation.\n\n592\n00:28:32.883 --> 00:28:38.912\n[MUSIC]\n\n593\n00:28:38.912 --> 00:28:42.085\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.432 --> 00:00:15.580\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.641\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n6\n00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.558\nwe're continuing on taking a look at\nITIL release, control, and validation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:25.310\nWe're specifically into part\nthree of change management, and\n\n8\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.512\nwe need to continue on to\nfinish out this entire topic.\n\n9\n00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:33.269\nAnd here to help us out is our subject\nmatter expert, the ITIL expert himself,\n\n10\n00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:34.510\nMr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.920\nTerry, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.460\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.770\nGood to be back, and\n\n14\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.890\nas we continue to chew on this subject\ncalled change management, we're going to\n\n15\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.500\nnow move forward to looking at what does\nsuccess look like in change management?\n\n16\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.470\nVery specifically,\n\n17\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.340\nhow would you go about measuring\nchange management toward good ends?\n\n18\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.200\nSo beginning here with the graphic,\ncritical success factors and\n\n19\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.120\nkey performance indicators.\n\n20\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260\nThese things are common words\nin link segment environments.\n\n21\n00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.560\nCritical success factors\nare often rendered in words.\n\n22\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.680\nAnd key performance indicators\nare always rendered in numbers.\n\n23\n00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.180\nThis is where you get to the measurements,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.260\nSo if you need to be good, what does good\nlook like as critical success factors?\n\n25\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.510\nKey performance indicator's the actual\nmeasurements that point to that.\n\n26\n00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.290\nAs with any objective,\nthe key performance indicators,\n\n27\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.600\nobjectives, they should be smart.\n\n28\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.420\nThis is fairly common across\nthe industries in various disciplines,\n\n29\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560\nspecific, measurable, achievable,\nrelevant, and time bound.\n\n30\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.070\nSuch is the case for the CSFs and\nKPIs for change management.\n\n31\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.560\nSo let's have a look,\njust have a look at these.\n\n32\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.300\nWhat does success look like?\n\n33\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.200\nAgain, if you look at the critical\nsuccess factors here,\n\n34\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.290\nyou'll see them rendered in a broad topic.\n\n35\n00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.360\nResponding to business and IT requests for\n\n36\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.560\nchange that will align services and\nmaximize value.\n\n37\n00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.513\nThat's a very sweeping statement,\nresponding to business and IT requests.\n\n38\n00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:00.579\nSo what could be some KPIs?\n\n39\n00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.220\nCould be reduction of\nthe backlog of change.\n\n40\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.590\nYou could measure that by how many change\nrequests you get a month as a percentage\n\n41\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.060\nof how much you actually implement\neach month, as an example, right?\n\n42\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.366\nOr maybe the timeframe is a week,\nor maybe the timeframe is a day, or\n\n43\n00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.340\na quarter, right?\n\n44\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.410\nBut you're actually gonna show\nsome sort of percentage there.\n\n45\n00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.999\nAn increase in accuracy estimates,\nin other words, you've predicted or\n\n46\n00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.639\nyou've promised something to be delivered\non the second week of every month.\n\n47\n00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.363\nYou are late on 5% of\nyour changes perhaps,\n\n48\n00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:35.676\nyou're not delivering as promised,\nright, of your time estimates.\n\n49\n00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:36.632\nAnd then of course,\n\n50\n00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:40.960\nyou could just do satisfaction surveys\nwith your customers and keep score there.\n\n51\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.580\nAs you can see with the other ones,\noptimizing overall business risk,\n\n52\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.750\nensure all changes to CIs\nare recorded in the CMS.\n\n53\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.220\nYou can see the idea here is to make sure\nyou're moving in the right direction.\n\n54\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.210\nSome of them, high level,\nsome are underground.\n\n55\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.740\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n56\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Terry,\nwhen we start to take a look at this,\n\n57\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.000\nthat KPI there on increasing\nthe stakeholder satisfaction surveys.\n\n58\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.460\nI hate to say this, I don't like surveys\nmyself, and so, I kind of think that they\n\n59\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.791\nget skewed at times when somebody has\na bad day, and I just say, all right, here\n\n60\n00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:13.341\nit is, I need to contact all my customers\nand see how the customer satisfaction is.\n\n61\n00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:17.848\nAnd I always think that that may be\na good indicator, but may not, but here,\n\n62\n00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:21.229\nas far as what you're talking\nabout as a success factor,\n\n63\n00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.130\nit is one of the key\nindicators we need to rely on?\n\n64\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.920\nOr is this one of recommended?\n\n65\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Recommended,\nnone of these are prescriptive for you.\n\n66\n00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.850\nPlease keep that in mind.\n\n67\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.370\nThese are as much examples\nas they are to get your\n\n68\n00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.570\nmind going in the right direction,\nas they are anything else.\n\n69\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.100\nI think the balance of KPIs is important.\n\n70\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.900\nIf you just chase technical metrics,\nyou won't have the full picture.\n\n71\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.460\nIf you just chase time and\nquality metrics,\n\n72\n00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.970\nyou won't necessarily\nhave the full picture.\n\n73\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.730\nYou might have nice pretty green metrics,\n\n74\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.070\nwhat I mean by green is\nyou're meeting the targets.\n\n75\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.690\nBut still have a dissatisfied customer,\nright?\n\n76\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.940\nSo unless you have some sort\nof balance in your metrics,\n\n77\n00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.320\nyou could be losing sight of\nsome key performance indicators.\n\n78\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.100\nThat's really what this is pointing to.\n\n79\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.360\nNot prescriptive at all, not intended to\nbe prescriptive, these are examples of it.\n\n80\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.070\nAnd it's those ideas, it's also important\nto review what change management is about.\n\n81\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.082\nDelivering responsively, right, and\nresponsibly the risk piece of it,\n\n82\n00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:20.510\nand also make sure that you're\nkeeping good records, right?\n\n83\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.400\nSo if you just look at\nthe critical success factors,\n\n84\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.630\nyou're getting a solid review of\nthe remit of change management.\n\n85\n00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.590\nWe gotta be responsive to requests.\n\n86\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.126\nYou gotta manage risks, and you gotta\nkeep good score, keep good records.\n\n87\n00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:32.364\nThat's really what it points down to.\n\n88\n00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:36.620\nAnd it's a great way to summarize\nthis entire slide, right?\n\n89\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.621\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, the other thing that we\nalso have here is you talk about the idea\n\n90\n00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:42.414\nof overall business risk here, and\n\n91\n00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:46.144\nthere is a few different things that\nyou talk about in terms of reduction.\n\n92\n00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:48.724\nAnd everything that's\nabout reduction here,\n\n93\n00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:53.043\nand it kind of seems like that the idea of\nchange management, its goal seems to be\n\n94\n00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.640\nmore of reducing the number of incidents,\nis that all we're really talking about?\n\n95\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Actually, that's absolutely it.\n\n96\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.200\nIf you can link, everyone knows,\nI know I shouldn't say everyone.\n\n97\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.900\nIt's pretty common that\nas you release something.\n\n98\n00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.550\nIf you cause pain, right, in other words,\nthe service desk gets a bunch of calls,\n\n99\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.680\nright, then there's going\nto be some incidents.\n\n100\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.350\nSo if you connect the dots between the\nchange you implemented and the number of\n\n101\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.270\nincidents, then obviously, reducing\nincidents is gonna be a good target.\n\n102\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.896\nIf you can connect those\ndots successfully,\n\n103\n00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.878\nthen you could also have a target for\nimprovement.\n\n104\n00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:35.430\nAbsolutely there, so emergency changes,\ngenerally speaking, are not a good thing.\n\n105\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.890\nYou have an unstable environment.\n\n106\n00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.360\nThey are a necessary evil, but\nyou should try to reduce that number.\n\n107\n00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.680\nThe same with unauthorized changes,\n\n108\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.540\nI think the real challenge of\nunauthorized changes is detecting them.\n\n109\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.760\nHow can you detect them so successfully\nthat you actually count them, right?\n\n110\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.472\nA good cowboy knows how to cover\nhis tracks, so to speak, but still,\n\n111\n00:05:54.472 --> 00:05:56.000\nthat's important.\n\n112\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.230\nIf you have it as a goal,\nthen it should be zero.\n\n113\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.740\nWe wanna have zero unauthorized changes,\nright?\n\n114\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.620\nAnd then of course, the change related\nto service disruptions, etc, yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.920\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, as we look at this idea and\n\n116\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.590\nthese ways that we can measure it,\nwe know not everything is perfect.\n\n117\n00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.120\nIt'd be nice to say ideally,\n\n118\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.190\nwe get 100% participation in\nterms of things like surveys.\n\n119\n00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.440\nWe also have people that\nhonestly answer us,\n\n120\n00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.530\nor we have people that always\ndo exactly what they want to.\n\n121\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.730\nBut there are some challenges that we have\nto overcome, just in the human factor.\n\n122\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.130\nBut there's other challenges that\nwe need to overcome too, right?\n\n123\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.320\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and actually, the word\nchallenge is a loaded word, right?\n\n124\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.597\nThey load every word up.\n\n125\n00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:39.415\nI like this one though,\nthis was pretty clever,\n\n126\n00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:43.000\na challenge is a risk that has\na 100% chance of happening.\n\n127\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.340\nIt means you're going to face this.\n\n128\n00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.840\nSo in change management,\n\n129\n00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.550\nthe challenge is of change management,\nyou're gonna face, and you've asked so\n\n130\n00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.620\nmany questions, Ronnie,\nyou're gonna face these challenges.\n\n131\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.785\nWhat if people don't follow it?\n\n132\n00:06:56.785 --> 00:06:59.739\nSo you need policy and backup,\nyou need backup and good policy.\n\n133\n00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.881\nWhat if it's bureaucratic and\ntime wasting?\n\n134\n00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.358\nWhat if it's not fit for purpose, right?\n\n135\n00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:07.049\nThese are real challenges, and again,\n\n136\n00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:10.182\nyou've asked good questions that kind\nof point to the challenges of trying\n\n137\n00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:13.020\nto articulate an effective\nchange management process.\n\n138\n00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.735\nAnd the articulation of it and the follow\nthrough on it is not an easy task.\n\n139\n00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:19.610\nITIL doesn't pretend that it is.\n\n140\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.450\nBut again, it's not something that's\njust been invented as a theory.\n\n141\n00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.850\nThis has been practiced.\n\n142\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.250\nIt's been evaluated and having\nan effective change management process is\n\n143\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.470\nvital to the success of your organization.\n\n144\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:36.560\nIn fact, I've seen some outside of ITIL,\nI've heard of\n\n145\n00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.620\nthe iron core of incident management,\nproblem management, and change management.\n\n146\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.899\nIf you get those things figured out early,\nthey're going to lead you to the other\n\n147\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.470\nwater you need to drink in\nservice management as well.\n\n148\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:54.541\nIf you get those things well done, you\nwill find yourself on a good path, right?\n\n149\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.670\nAnd chain management service\nis one of those iron core.\n\n150\n00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthat sounds like a great idea.\n\n151\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.240\nNow, along with that then,\nif we can manage this and\n\n152\n00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.440\nwe're actually reducing kinda some of\nthe incidences and the problems that we're\n\n153\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.400\nfacing in terms of changes, we still have\nto deal with a lot of risks, though.\n\n154\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.610\nSo it seems like that almost,\nas I'm looking at a list that you actually\n\n155\n00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.620\nprovided here, the more that it seems\nlike that we are managing the risk,\n\n156\n00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.950\nthe more challenges it looks like we face.\n\n157\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.685\nThere's, what, eight or ten of these\nthings here, that we're taking a look at.\n\n158\n00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:26.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just have a brief look\nat this slide here on risks.\n\n159\n00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:27.805\nIt's kinda interesting here, you're right.\n\n160\n00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:28.931\nThere are more risks than\nthere are challenges.\n\n161\n00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:29.866\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.155\n&gt;&gt; It's very interesting.\n\n163\n00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:35.005\nAs you look at this, what it really\nboils down to is committment, right?\n\n164\n00:08:35.005 --> 00:08:35.975\nI like this first one.\n\n165\n00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:39.550\nThe risk that the business won't care\nabout your change management process.\n\n166\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.400\nI understand your cab meets once a month,\nI want change now, right?\n\n167\n00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.630\nThat sort of thing, right?\n\n168\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.460\nSo they're actually getting in, and\nthat's who your boss is, eventually,\n\n169\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.110\nis the business.\n\n170\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.480\nThat's your customer,\nyou gotta satisfy them.\n\n171\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.751\nSo getting their commitment to your change\nmanagement process is also gonna be\n\n172\n00:08:54.751 --> 00:08:56.842\nsomething that's gonna\nbe difficult to manage.\n\n173\n00:08:56.842 --> 00:08:59.310\nAnd you're gonna face that one, right?\n\n174\n00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.550\nIf the staff doesn't follow through, if\nyou just easily circumvent the processes,\n\n175\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.500\nyou're gonna lose control, right?\n\n176\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.060\nSo it's definitely in play.\n\n177\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.120\nAnd not having a process that's fit for\npurpose is definitely a risk.\n\n178\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.934\nBecause if it's not fit for\npurpose, people will circumvent it,\n\n179\n00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:17.102\nabsolutely, yep.\n\n180\n00:09:17.102 --> 00:09:19.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, realizing that and\n\n181\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.840\nrealizing that we do have\nthose risks that are in place.\n\n182\n00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.550\nAnd they all seem to be against us, what\ncan we do now to really help us to improve\n\n183\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.250\nthe idea of reducing those risks or\n\n184\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.060\nthe change one needs to be done\nto the way it needs to happen?\n\n185\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:40.150\n&gt;&gt; Well, a big proponent of managing\nchange is actually managing behavioral\n\n186\n00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.330\nchanges, not just putting a process on\nthe wall and see if it sticks, right?\n\n187\n00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.950\nYou need to manage organizational change.\n\n188\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.334\nIf you want to evolve as an organization,\nyou need to have a cultural change.\n\n189\n00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:54.850\nAnd change is gonna happen fairly\nregularly in most organizations.\n\n190\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.760\nSo as you look at it,\nwhat change management is,\n\n191\n00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.900\nand ITIL is not organizational change,\nthough.\n\n192\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.900\nIt's managing a change to services.\n\n193\n00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.730\nIf you need to change behaviors,\nif you need to change the behaviors of\n\n194\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.990\nthe organization at large, you need to\nlook a little bit different places.\n\n195\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.730\nAnd ITIL points to those places,\nthey just don't preach them as heavily.\n\n196\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.080\nOrganizational change, Cotter's eight\nsteps, John P Cotter wrote these down.\n\n197\n00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.250\nYou can see a reference\nto it on the slide here.\n\n198\n00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.780\nOrganizational change and stakeholder\nmanagement is a different topic, right?\n\n199\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.900\nIf you want to, for instance,\n\n200\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.550\nif you want to totally revolutionize\nthe way you deliver services,\n\n201\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.140\nyou're probably gonna have to face\nthe demon called organizational change.\n\n202\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.590\nYou're going to be restructuring people.\n\n203\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.360\nYou're gonna be changing their behaviors.\n\n204\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.480\nAnd people resist that, right?\n\n205\n00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.540\nSo coming up with a model for\n\n206\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.105\norganizational change is\nnot what ITIL is about.\n\n207\n00:10:49.105 --> 00:10:50.305\nIt's not about that,\n\n208\n00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:54.025\nit's about service change,\norganizational change is a bigger topic.\n\n209\n00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:57.100\nAnd John Cotter can provide you\na lot of information there.\n\n210\n00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.841\n&gt;&gt; And most recently,\n\n211\n00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:00.381\nI've also been reading just a couple\nof books on change management.\n\n212\n00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:04.225\nJust to change myself, but actually it\nwas kind of neat where they were talking\n\n213\n00:11:04.225 --> 00:11:08.365\nabout the idea that organizational\nchange really happens from the top down.\n\n214\n00:11:08.365 --> 00:11:11.240\nThat if you start showing them,\nyou start implementing that,\n\n215\n00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.110\nthat you're willing to live that model and\n\n216\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.940\nthat life of change, other people see\nthat, they'll start buying into it.\n\n217\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.960\nAnd even if you start changing\nthe smallest thing, and\n\n218\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.680\nonce they accept that small change,\nthen bigger changes can come along.\n\n219\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.050\n&gt;&gt; Agreed.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the same thing with\n\n220\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.670\nchange management.\n\n221\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.120\nIf you're not used to having this and\nnow somebody introduces a new system and\n\n222\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.360\nthey just tell you you're gonna use it and\n\n223\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.960\nyou better use it,\nyou might have a chance of using it.\n\n224\n00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.890\nBut if you can actually show or\nsomebody can show your entire\n\n225\n00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.109\norganization where it's beneficial, you'll\nprobably see more of that buy in, and\n\n226\n00:11:41.109 --> 00:11:44.130\nthen the entire change will\ncontinue to take place.\n\n227\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.195\nSo let's talk about some of the characters\nthen that are involved as far as roles\n\n228\n00:11:48.195 --> 00:11:50.331\ninvolved in terms of change management.\n\n229\n00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:53.879\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great way to finish up\nthis topic on change management because if\n\n230\n00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.942\nyou were just to take these last\ncouple of slides, if we were talking\n\n231\n00:11:56.942 --> 00:12:01.000\nabout operational value here,\nnot just getting ready for an exam, right?\n\n232\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.910\nIf you're wanna go back to the office and\nsay, where do I begin?\n\n233\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.859\nYou can begin by identifying key roles.\n\n234\n00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:10.856\nAnd then, again, this does not mean an\norganizational chart, it just means naming\n\n235\n00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:14.270\nsomeone to take on this responsibility,\nright, or accountability.\n\n236\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.820\nAnd here are some of those key roles,\nand fairly intuitive,\n\n237\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.230\nwe talked about these generically\na little bit earlier.\n\n238\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.607\nWe talked about a process\non a process manager,\n\n239\n00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:27.759\nname a change management process owner,\ngive someone that identity and\n\n240\n00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:32.169\nmake it sure that everyone knows,\nand empower them, right?\n\n241\n00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:36.980\nEmpower them to generate processes that\nwill make sense for the organization,\n\n242\n00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.520\nright?\n\n243\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.078\nOf course, you need a process manager,\nsomeone to lead these through.\n\n244\n00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:46.646\nA little acronym check here, you got plan\nsupport tools to maintain the CS and\n\n245\n00:12:46.646 --> 00:12:53.010\nPSO chain schedule, and projected service\noutages is the little acronym check there.\n\n246\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.760\nIdentifying who can educiate changes and\ngiving them some blessing and\n\n247\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.010\nsome direction, and of course,\nthe people are gonna be practicing it.\n\n248\n00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.820\nSo, as you begin to define your process,\nyou start here.\n\n249\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.844\nNaming these roles and finding out who\nare these people because they become\n\n250\n00:13:06.844 --> 00:13:09.320\nthe stakeholders in\nthe process straight away.\n\n251\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.690\nThey become the stakeholders.\n\n252\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.840\nAnd if you start listening them and start\ndesigning your process with their goals in\n\n253\n00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.340\nmind, you're gonna have more success,\nright?\n\n254\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.690\nAnd then other groups of people, these are\npeople individually, and other groups of\n\n255\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.080\npeople as you can see on the next slide,\nis this idea of change authority.\n\n256\n00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.626\nWhat group of people, what person or\ngroups of people do you collate?\n\n257\n00:13:32.626 --> 00:13:36.960\nPut them together to say they have\nthe authority to make change happen.\n\n258\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.910\nRight, the change authority is embodied\nin a meeting called a CAB meeting,\n\n259\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.490\na change advisory board\nthat meets regularly.\n\n260\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.419\nSo you also define your\nmembership in these CAB meetings,\n\n261\n00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:50.048\nthese change advisory boards.\n\n262\n00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:53.973\nAre you gonna have representation\nfrom the business, from the service,\n\n263\n00:13:53.973 --> 00:13:56.770\nfrom the technical teams,\nfrom the process teams?\n\n264\n00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.935\nWho are you gonna include as\nmembers of the CAB, right?\n\n265\n00:14:00.935 --> 00:14:05.059\nAnd then of course, naming a CAB\nchair who's going to lead this chair,\n\n266\n00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:07.700\nthis meeting,\nis gonna be a change manager.\n\n267\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.620\nAnd giving that person in power\nempowerment to move this process forward.\n\n268\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.960\nThat's a start.\n\n269\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are so many different\nthings that you can actually learn here,\n\n270\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.550\nbut the idea and key, notice that at the\nend as we start taking a look at the roles\n\n271\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.690\nand responsibilities, is assigning\nthem to the right people as well.\n\n272\n00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.700\nYou can assign these particular\nroles to people that you know, but\n\n273\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:34.980\nyou need to make sure that you do have\nthe process in hand to know exactly who\n\n274\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.150\nyou want to actually take\non these roles as well.\n\n275\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.140\nIt doesn't do you any good to assign this\nto somebody that you know that's never\n\n276\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.390\ngonna carry through.\n\n277\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.390\nThat would be terrible for\nyou to actually think about.\n\n278\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.400\nBut this doesn't come\nunderneath the prescription,\n\n279\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.995\njust like what Terry\nwas talking about here.\n\n280\n00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:51.413\nITIL is not trying to say,\nhere is the system,\n\n281\n00:14:51.413 --> 00:14:53.528\nhere's the exact person that you need.\n\n282\n00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:56.331\nThey're just trying to let you know\nthat there's a need as far as change\n\n283\n00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:57.380\nmanagement.\n\n284\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.520\nSo remember that what\nwe've taken a look at so\n\n285\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.700\nfar in this episode is we've talked\nabout the idea of those success factors,\n\n286\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.960\nright, the critical success factors,\nas well as the KPIs.\n\n287\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.210\nWe've mentioned this,\nhow we can actually improve, and\n\n288\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.840\ntalked about the challenges and risks.\n\n289\n00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.250\nMake sure you pay attention to terminology\nthere, and understand that terminology.\n\n290\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.875\nAnd even some of the people\nthat are gonna be involved as\n\n291\n00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:23.770\nthe primary stakeholders that\nwe have in change management.\n\n292\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:28.460\nNow remember that this is part three,\nright, of the entire little mini series\n\n293\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.300\nthat we have here on the ITIL release,\ncontrol, and validation.\n\n294\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.410\nAnd that means you wanna make sure\nthat you review all of them as well.\n\n295\n00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.190\nBecause there's so much terminology\nthat you have to worry about and\n\n296\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.340\nhave to learn, it's a great chance for\n\n297\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.808\nyou to kind of stop at the end of\nthis episode and take some time.\n\n298\n00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:49.697\nAnd make sure that these concepts not\nonly seem logical, but makes sense and\n\n299\n00:15:49.697 --> 00:15:51.770\nreview those episodes as well.\n\n300\n00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.531\nSo Terry, any kind of last words for\nthis episode,\n\n301\n00:15:56.531 --> 00:16:02.861\nas somebody is saying hey,\nI think I'm getting ready for the exam.\n\n302\n00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:06.964\nWhat do I need to focus in on\nin these particular lessons, and\n\n303\n00:16:06.964 --> 00:16:10.750\nwhat's the best kinda method\nto attack that focus?\n\n304\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.\n\n305\n00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.360\nA couple of things, one,\nyou can reinforce this learning.\n\n306\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.086\nThere is a specific exercise related to\nthis, there's a case study that you can\n\n307\n00:16:19.086 --> 00:16:22.909\ndownload and exercises and\nquestions based on that case study.\n\n308\n00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:27.529\nSo it really does marks you through the\nrationale, you have to apply the learning,\n\n309\n00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:30.247\nwhich is gonna be\nan important learning aspect.\n\n310\n00:16:30.247 --> 00:16:34.985\nThis exam is not just about\nregurgitating information, memorization.\n\n311\n00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:36.515\nYou need to apply learning.\n\n312\n00:16:36.515 --> 00:16:39.986\nSo if you look at the case study in the\ncorresponding exercises, you get a lot.\n\n313\n00:16:39.986 --> 00:16:43.080\nAnd the next one up for this one happens\nto be called organizational change.\n\n314\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's directed self study related to\n\n315\n00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:48.765\nthat, there's a hand out related to that,\na good place to go, right?\n\n316\n00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:52.325\nSo among these things that can be\ndownloaded are these good exercises,\n\n317\n00:16:52.325 --> 00:16:56.890\nI'll highlight them at the end of each\nsegment and get you on the right track.\n\n318\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:02.840\nAnother important tool in the tool kit is\nyour practice exams, those sample papers.\n\n319\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.740\nWe'll give some good detail\non that in the overview.\n\n320\n00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you again,\nTerry, for helping us to kinda round out\n\n321\n00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.130\nthat process for change management and\nunderstand that a little bit better.\n\n322\n00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.300\nAnd thank you also for joining us today.\n\n323\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.300\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n324\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.590\n&gt;&gt;

They begin by emphasizing the purpose of SACM and what some of the objectives to implementing a SACM system.  Terry also helps us to understand where to get started and that it’s first steps begin with policies that help to enforce the process.   The team also helps to define some of the configuration items that ITIL defines so that we’re ready for the exam too!",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:15.553\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another\ngreat episode here, on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:17.195\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:22.340\nAnd today we're taking a look at ITIL\nrelease, control, and validation.\n\n8\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.732\nWe're specifically diving into\nthe world of service assets and\n\n9\n00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:27.314\nconfiguration management.\n\n10\n00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:30.560\nAnd here to help us out is our\nITIL expert, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.586\nTerry, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:32.960\n&gt;&gt; Good to be back, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.180\nAnd we got a lot to cover\nhere with this topic.\n\n14\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.000\nIt's a big topic.\n\n15\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.350\nIt's an important topic.\n\n16\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.284\nService asset configuration management\nis a foundational process of doing\n\n17\n00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:43.831\nthis right is not easy.\n\n18\n00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:46.130\nBut doing it right is very important.\n\n19\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.620\nIt serves so\nmany other purposes in other processes.\n\n20\n00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.130\nGetting this right can be\nvery transformational.\n\n21\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.170\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, it seems like that when we\nstart talking about the idea of assets,\n\n22\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.390\nand, of course, of configuration.\n\n23\n00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.615\nEvery little asset, apparently, seems to\nneed some type of configuration when we\n\n24\n00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.720\nenter it into the services\nthat we need to.\n\n25\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.410\nSo the idea of starting off correctly is\nprobably just as key as anything else.\n\n26\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.840\nInstead of trying to fix it along the way,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.769\n&gt;&gt; That's right, this is very likely gonna\nbe a process that's always evolving.\n\n28\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.578\nYou might expand the scope of\nwhat you're going to consider to\n\n29\n00:01:23.578 --> 00:01:25.331\nbe under control over time.\n\n30\n00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:29.913\nAnd it's always a moving landscape,\nassets, CIs, you'll remember that word,\n\n31\n00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:32.220\nconfiguration item from before.\n\n32\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.530\nA configuration item can be so\nmany different things.\n\n33\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.562\nAnd they're added all the time.\n\n34\n00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.800\nThey're removed all the time.\n\n35\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.750\nSo staying on top of\nthis is also a discipline\n\n36\n00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.520\nthat is going to evolve over time,\nas well.\n\n37\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.872\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, let's go ahead and\nthen jump into the idea, the purpose.\n\n38\n00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:51.113\nAnd what is our overall goal that we wanna\nachieve through the ideas that we're\n\n39\n00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:52.023\ntalking about.\n\n40\n00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:56.031\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, let's distinguish\nthe two big words in this title,\n\n41\n00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:58.630\nservice asset and\nconfiguration management.\n\n42\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.570\nSo the asset, itself, again, we talked\nearlier about a configuration item.\n\n43\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.970\nThat's anything you care about that lets\nyou deliver the service more effectively.\n\n44\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.980\nSo that could be a server,\na database, an application.\n\n45\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.210\nThat certainly underpins lots of services.\n\n46\n00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.763\nBut also could be documents like\nprocess documents, control documents,\n\n47\n00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:25.290\ninterface documents with the customer,\ninterfaces with the customer itself.\n\n48\n00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.070\nSo because there's so many things,\nsince the scope is so\n\n49\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.220\nlarge, one of the first things\nyou need to do is understand,\n\n50\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.230\nwhat are you gonna consider an asset\nthat you're going to keep under control?\n\n51\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.300\nAnd then, of course, the configuration\npart is understanding the relationships\n\n52\n00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.830\namong those assets,\nhow they relate to each other.\n\n53\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.720\nAnd the configuration of those and\n\n54\n00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.139\nthe sets of attributes that make\nup those assets, themselves.\n\n55\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nmoving into that idea of purpose.\n\n56\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.966\nLike anything else that you've told us,\nITIL apparently has a loaded definition or\n\n57\n00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.770\na loaded purpose for\nthis idea, too, right?\n\n58\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.660\n&gt;&gt; Sure, if you take a look at the slide,\nwe could look at the specific activities\n\n59\n00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.650\nof what I call SACM, service asset and\nconfiguration management.\n\n60\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.200\nIn the red chevrons, there at the bottom,\nyou'll see the six major processes, or\n\n61\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.140\nactivities, I should say, underneath SACM.\n\n62\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.310\nFirst, identifying what your CIs are,\nwhat you wanna keep under control.\n\n63\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.799\nThen, building in the control mechanisms,\nhow are you gonna control these?\n\n64\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.640\nAnd understand and record these things.\n\n65\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.450\nPut them in a database or\nmultiple databases.\n\n66\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.940\nIn fact,\nit'll probably cross multiple databases.\n\n67\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.197\nReport on these, know how many you have.\n\n68\n00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:37.030\nKnow the volume and\ntheir configuration data.\n\n69\n00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750\nAudit the process as well\nas the items themselves.\n\n70\n00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.536\nDo you have dead servers that\nhaven't been accounted for?\n\n71\n00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:44.710\nWhat do I mean by dead servers?\n\n72\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.330\nThey were actually retired six years ago,\nbut they're still in your system.\n\n73\n00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.550\nAnd not marked is retired, so you're\nstill putting them on patch schedules.\n\n74\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.905\nYou're still, perhaps,\nmanaging them as a financial asset.\n\n75\n00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:55.980\nThose types of things.\n\n76\n00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.968\nSo regular audits are gonna be important.\n\n77\n00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:02.455\nAnd then auditing the process, are people\nfollowing through on the process, itself?\n\n78\n00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:05.628\nAnd then, of course, verifying that\neverything is as it should be,\n\n79\n00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:07.185\ndoes it match reality?\n\n80\n00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:11.789\nWe'll look at these six processes,\nthese six activities as we go through.\n\n81\n00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.606\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nunderneath that where you have the idea of\n\n82\n00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:17.791\nthe objectives of what we're normally\ntrying to accomplish with SACM,\n\n83\n00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.111\nlike you were talking about.\n\n84\n00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.527\nIs there any one of these that's\nactually more important than the other?\n\n85\n00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:26.413\nWhen you start to take a look, such as\nensuring that they're just identified,\n\n86\n00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:29.313\nis that more important than\nknowing what the controls are,\n\n87\n00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:31.530\nwhat the configurations\nare on these items?\n\n88\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Not necessarily that\nsimple of an answer.\n\n89\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.760\nIt's a great question, but\nthere's no real simple answer to this.\n\n90\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.380\nI've worked in large organizations\nwhere it was a significant activity\n\n91\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.570\njust to know how many servers we had and\nwhat patch level they were on.\n\n92\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.450\nWhat databases were installed on them?\n\n93\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.230\nWhat applications were installed on them?\n\n94\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.530\nGetting those relationships right.\n\n95\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.400\nAnd getting it so that that information\nis visible to the right people, right,\n\n96\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.418\nat the right time is a challenge.\n\n97\n00:04:58.418 --> 00:05:01.135\nIf you wanna throw on top of\nthat the other types of CIs.\n\n98\n00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:06.048\nSuch as documents, your service level\nagreements, the documents specifications,\n\n99\n00:05:06.048 --> 00:05:09.967\nI'm sorry, the design specifications,\nbusiness requirements.\n\n100\n00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:14.740\nAll those other things that are in\ncontrol, are they in sufficient control?\n\n101\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.710\nYou might analyze that they are and\nleave them out of scope for SACM.\n\n102\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.599\nBecause you trust that they are in scope.\n\n103\n00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.591\nI think the important answer to your\nquestion here, which is a great question,\n\n104\n00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:25.870\nis go in with eyes open.\n\n105\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.660\nIf you don't have control\nover these things,\n\n106\n00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.490\nyou need to wrestle\ncontrol over these things.\n\n107\n00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.310\nAnd understand that without\ncontrol of your items,\n\n108\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.530\nwithout understanding of what you have,\nit's gonna be hard to manage them.\n\n109\n00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.546\nSo it starts with\nunderstanding what you have.\n\n110\n00:05:40.546 --> 00:05:43.004\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nhow wide of the controls and\n\n111\n00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:47.580\nasset management are we really talking\nabout, in terms of the scope of SACM.\n\n112\n00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.160\nWhat are we really looking at here?\n\n113\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Again, it's gonna be defined\nby the organization just how\n\n114\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.360\nbig they wanna make this.\n\n115\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.750\nBut the scope is huge.\n\n116\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.150\nAnd you should consider,\nat least exam takers should consider,\n\n117\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.920\nthat the scope is huge.\n\n118\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.016\nI usually describe the CMS,\n\n119\n00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:05.043\nthe configuration management system,\nas a big boat.\n\n120\n00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:07.610\nAnd there's lots of containers\non this boat, right?\n\n121\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.474\nYou could have attributes such as users,\nI'm sorry, a CI such as users.\n\n122\n00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:18.275\nYou probably don't think as people as\nassets, but they certainly are, right?\n\n123\n00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:22.620\nThere're certainly attributes of these\nusers that are important for you to track.\n\n124\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.910\nWhat department they belong to?\n\n125\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.660\nWhat's their usage characteristics,\nperhaps, right?\n\n126\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.580\nSo having that data available to\nyou can help you manage the service\n\n127\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.220\nmore effectively.\n\n128\n00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.320\nEven the numbers of users\nyou have could be something.\n\n129\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.612\nNow, do you keep the same\nassets in the same database?\n\n130\n00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:42.050\nOr do you divide and conquer those?\n\n131\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.220\nWould you put employee data in the same\ndatabase as you had put server data or\n\n132\n00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.390\ndatabase data?\n\n133\n00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.440\nPerhaps not.\n\n134\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.048\nSo ITIL describes the CMS as the big boat.\n\n135\n00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:58.130\nAnd then CMDBs, these containers\non top of that boat, if you will.\n\n136\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.280\nAnd these CMDBs are configuration\nmanagement databases.\n\n137\n00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.580\nUnique, discrete databases with different\ntypes of assets being stored in them.\n\n138\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.968\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, it sounds like that\nyou also have, since there's so\n\n139\n00:07:08.968 --> 00:07:10.726\nmany elements involved in this,\n\n140\n00:07:10.726 --> 00:07:15.120\nthat there may be a difference between\na configuration item and a service asset.\n\n141\n00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.726\nOr they may be the same thing?\n\n142\n00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Good question, and not necessarily.\n\n143\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.025\nAgain, if you look at the graphic here,\n\n144\n00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:22.390\nthere's some text giving\nit some treatment here.\n\n145\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.130\nThat service assets certainly\nneed to be managed.\n\n146\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.260\nBut not every asset raises to\nthe attention of a CI, right?\n\n147\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.350\nAgain, this is organizationally defined.\n\n148\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.340\nWhat are you gonna try to control and\nconquer, right?\n\n149\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.960\nSo not every CI is a financial asset,\nright?\n\n150\n00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.570\nSo it is a distinction.\n\n151\n00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.390\nIt's called service asset and\nconfiguration management.\n\n152\n00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.170\nBy definition though, when you decide\nthat you're going to manage it,\n\n153\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.335\nit becomes a CI, a configuration item.\n\n154\n00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:52.315\nThat it is under your control.\n\n155\n00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:56.715\nAn example I mentioned before,\nin the universive of documents,\n\n156\n00:07:56.715 --> 00:08:01.200\nyou might not wanna keep them\nFormally under your sackem process.\n\n157\n00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.570\nYou might want let a document\nmanagement regime handle those.\n\n158\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.390\nOr you look at it, and\nsee that they're generally under control,\n\n159\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.510\nand don't want to go there,\nbecause you have bigger fish to fry.\n\n160\n00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.500\nYou need to get the relationships between\nyour servers and your databases and\n\n161\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.590\napplications figured out.\n\n162\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.710\nAnd how those roll up to services, right?\n\n163\n00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:24.840\nSo, as you approach this task\nof defining what the CI is,\n\n164\n00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.560\nyou're also gonna be faced with\nthe challenge of how can we possibly\n\n165\n00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.100\ncontrol it, and there's gonna be\nsome compromises along the way.\n\n166\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we start, let's\ntake a look at the individual components,\n\n167\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.230\nwhat you're talking about here.\n\n168\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:42.332\nWhat I actually see on some of the notes\nthat you provided here, is the idea that\n\n169\n00:08:42.332 --> 00:08:48.543\nasset management itself needs to go across\nthe entire life cycle of that asset.\n\n170\n00:08:48.543 --> 00:08:52.271\nSo Terry, why is that something\nthat's really important?\n\n171\n00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:57.750\nAt the end of something, that I'm using as\na service, and I just stopped using it.\n\n172\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.280\nWhy don't I just leave it alone and\nnot worry about it?\n\n173\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, I kinda gave you an example\na little while ago about that.\n\n174\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.500\nLet's consider the server as an asset\nthat helps you deliver a service.\n\n175\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.980\nSo you have a server.\n\n176\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.350\nThe server has a life cycle, you want to\ncontrol it as it comes in to management.\n\n177\n00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:13.575\nYou understand its attributes,\n\n178\n00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:19.160\nyou understand its patch level, perhaps\nits CPU strength, its memory, right?\n\n179\n00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.260\nIts capabilities, you want to somehow\nunderstand how it is configured.\n\n180\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.370\nSo, there you have the asset,\nthat's one thing you're managing, and\n\n181\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.618\nyou have its configuration,\nanother thing you're managing,\n\n182\n00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:32.860\nif you install more memory,\nif you upgrade it, give it a new patch.\n\n183\n00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.370\nInstall an operating system on it.\n\n184\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.270\nThose types of things would be important\nconfiguration data if you wanna keep up,\n\n185\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.040\nthat you are hosting 20 web\napplication on that server.\n\n186\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.660\nAgain, another layer of configuration\nis the application it itself, and\n\n187\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.600\nthe relationship to that server.\n\n188\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.380\nSo, if you consider that you're\ngonna replace that server,\n\n189\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.660\nit's end of life for it.\n\n190\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.010\nIt's a 2003 server, and you're gonna just\ncompletely upgrade that infrastructure,\n\n191\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.360\ntake out all the 2003 servers, and\n\n192\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.460\nbring in 2012 servers, let's say,\nthat's your situation.\n\n193\n00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.620\nObviously, that also needs\nto be under control.\n\n194\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.360\nWe talked about change control earlier.\n\n195\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.630\nCertainly change management's gonna\nbe involved in this activity,\n\n196\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.480\ncontrolling these assets.\n\n197\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.910\nBut as you get rid of the 2003 servers,\n\n198\n00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.000\nthat's an important thing to note,\nthey're gone.\n\n199\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.960\nThey're no longer to be managed,\nor are they gonna be re-used?\n\n200\n00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.080\nMaybe they become work machines for\nthe development team.\n\n201\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.630\nSo they can still be used there, right?\n\n202\n00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.480\nSo, understanding what these servers,\nin this case,\n\n203\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.710\nprovide to the organization\nis gonna change over time.\n\n204\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.410\nIf you don't keep up with those\nchanges and manage it effectively,\n\n205\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.085\nyou end up with assets just laying\naround with no supporting data.\n\n206\n00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:46.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Now, I've seen that actually\nhappen before too, Terry, where I go and\n\n207\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.530\npull off some information that I was\nsupposed to be looking out to configure,\n\n208\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.650\nlet's say a remote desktop server,\nor terminal server.\n\n209\n00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.230\nAnd I find out something, that that\nserver is no longer in existence.\n\n210\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.700\nSo, I actually had the documentation, but\n\n211\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.370\nthe very fact is the server\nwas just not there any more.\n\n212\n00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.080\nAnd so, I really had old documentation\nthat really didn't fit what was actually\n\n213\n00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.310\nin use at the point.\n\n214\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.020\nSo, that particular type of documentation\nmeans that there has to be kind of not\n\n215\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.940\nonly the management, but\nthe idea of weeding it out as well, so\n\n216\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.800\nthat we're only working\nwith effective material.\n\n217\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.253\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so not only do you need to\nmanage the server as a CI, as you just\n\n218\n00:11:23.253 --> 00:11:28.021\ngave a greater point, that document was\na CI because it became less useful.\n\n219\n00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.446\nWhat did you have to do in that case,\nRonnie?\n\n220\n00:11:29.446 --> 00:11:32.960\nYou had to chase down some folks and\nmaybe get some anecdotal information.\n\n221\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.635\nYeah, I think we upgraded\nthat two years ago.\n\n222\n00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:35.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, those kind of things.\n\n223\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.300\nI think it's now this server, right?\n\n224\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.695\nSo, you're chasing the information.\n\n225\n00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:42.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, do that at scale, and\n\n226\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.890\nyou're talking about a lot of confusion,\nright?\n\n227\n00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.010\nOne at a time, not so much.\n\n228\n00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.140\nBut you do that at a scale,\nyou can see that the importance of SACUM\n\n229\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.590\nis to get control of these assets, so that\nyou can manage the changes throughout.\n\n230\n00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.500\nSo, if you're gonna take a server out,\n\n231\n00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.690\ncan you relate it to\nthe documents that it's cited in?\n\n232\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.980\nThat it's used in, and then go and\nupdate those documents as well.\n\n233\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.790\nIt's a tough deal.\n\n234\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's no doubt that it\nseems like that that more that we start\n\n235\n00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.940\nto dive a little bit deeper into it, the\nmore that we realize that there has to be,\n\n236\n00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.710\nthat not only is the process\na little bit confusing at times.\n\n237\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.210\nCuz if you're just starting,\nif you're like me,\n\n238\n00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.530\nyou started off with a small company, and\nwas just yeah, of course we changed that.\n\n239\n00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.290\nWe update it when this happens,\nand there is no tracking of it.\n\n240\n00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.520\nThen you have to go and\nchase down the information.\n\n241\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.350\nBut really, the entire process,\nas long as it takes.\n\n242\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.440\nOr maybe, as short as it takes.\n\n243\n00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.020\nIt really does bring an overall\nvalue to the company, doesn't it?\n\n244\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and again,\n\n245\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.850\nthis value is going to depend somewhat\non the scale of your organization.\n\n246\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.280\nIf you are a large organization,\nlittle things like that add up big,\n\n247\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.310\nand cost lots of money.\n\n248\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.990\nYou're chasing information down.\n\n249\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.130\nBut even if you're in a small\norganization, such delays could be\n\n250\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.920\ncritical, and certainly could\neffect customer satisfaction.\n\n251\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.410\nIf you're trying to configure the next\nbest video display, and you can't find\n\n252\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.640\nthe right underlying technology,\nor it's documented incorrectly,\n\n253\n00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.650\nthen you've wasted a day of development,\nperhaps chasing that down, etc.\n\n254\n00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.650\nSo, the importance of this whole exercise,\nand this whole understanding of\n\n255\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:14.290\nIs to really focus on what value we're\ngonna be driving toward the customer.\n\n256\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.410\nAnd that's a good list.\n\n257\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.170\nWe'll look at the next slide here.\n\n258\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.360\nWhat does this mean for\nthe business that you can do this well?\n\n259\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.200\nRight, effectively,\nit's just about traceability.\n\n260\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.000\nKnowing what you have,\nknowing what it costs.\n\n261\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.820\nYou can roll this information up if\nyou have a service called email.\n\n262\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.690\nAnd you have a general understanding is\nkinda complex that's one thing, right?\n\n263\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.500\nBut if you have a configuration management\nsystem that allows you to see that\n\n264\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.585\nemail has 12 servers underneath it,\nthat it's supports and\n\n265\n00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:48.215\nutilizes identity management heavily,\nand understand how that uses of your\n\n266\n00:13:48.215 --> 00:13:51.385\nidentity management service and\nhow it relates to that.\n\n267\n00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:54.795\nPerhaps there's web accelerators in\nfront of your web hosted emails,\n\n268\n00:13:54.795 --> 00:13:56.215\nthose types of things.\n\n269\n00:13:56.215 --> 00:14:00.855\nUnderstanding the neck complexity, and\nlinking that to operational data sis.\n\n270\n00:14:00.855 --> 00:14:04.900\nHow many incidents did this service\nhave last week, or last month?\n\n271\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.510\nHow many incidents did it have\nthroughout the year, right?\n\n272\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.520\nSo, if you can link this information\nthrough your CMS, it starts with having\n\n273\n00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.060\nan understanding of what services are and\nwhat's underneath them, right?\n\n274\n00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.318\nAnd that is very powerful\ninformation to have.\n\n275\n00:14:18.318 --> 00:14:21.551\n&gt;&gt; Terry, it sounds like that the,\none of the goals overall for this,\n\n276\n00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:25.037\nis to be able to have the information\nat the timely manner that we need it.\n\n277\n00:14:25.037 --> 00:14:25.542\nAnd so,\n\n278\n00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:30.900\ndoes this always require some type of\ncentralized storage of that information?\n\n279\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.510\nOr, like you said, we can use email.\n\n280\n00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.540\nBut it seems like that sometimes,\neven email threads get a little bit lost.\n\n281\n00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you're gonna have\nto control this through a CMS.\n\n282\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.890\nAnd I used the word\nsystem in this context,\n\n283\n00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.809\nconfiguration management\nsystem in the classic sense.\n\n284\n00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:47.930\nLots of things working together for\na common output, right?\n\n285\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.396\nThat's what I mean by system here.\n\n286\n00:14:49.396 --> 00:14:53.771\nIt would be difficult for\nme to imagine to a single monolithic CMS\n\n287\n00:14:53.771 --> 00:14:57.263\nthat contains all the attributes for\nall your CIs.\n\n288\n00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:00.250\nJust consider the diversity\nof the CIs themselves, right?\n\n289\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.910\nAn employee could be considered a CI,\na document could be considered a CI.\n\n290\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.940\nA server, a database,\ninterfaces, how the customer\n\n291\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.570\ninterfaces with the service through\nsome sort of application perhaps.\n\n292\n00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.220\nSo, applications are CIs, and they're\nall interrelated to each other, right?\n\n293\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.140\nSo, it's a very complex system.\n\n294\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.270\nSo, I think when you consider\nthe system in this case,\n\n295\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.240\nyou're gonna see\na federated model of data.\n\n296\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.700\nThere's gonna be multiple CMDBs,\nconfiguration management databases,\n\n297\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.050\nthat make this work.\n\n298\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:33.940\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if that's true, if where\nwe have to kinda really make everything\n\n299\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.290\ngel together, that means that we also\nneed to then establish some way, some\n\n300\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.020\nsystem in hand to do that or some policy\nthat we need to combine together, right?\n\n301\n00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.540\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n302\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.026\nWe talked about earlier in this course\nthat the importance of governance\n\n303\n00:15:49.026 --> 00:15:52.639\nis going to play out through\nall these I-Tell processes.\n\n304\n00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:56.062\nTo have a process stand up\non its own is not likely.\n\n305\n00:15:56.062 --> 00:15:58.949\nYou're probably gonna have to\nhave policy that bolsters that.\n\n306\n00:15:58.949 --> 00:16:01.361\nThe thou shalts, right?\n\n307\n00:16:01.361 --> 00:16:02.809\nThou shalt follow this process.\n\n308\n00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:05.819\nWhen a new server is purchased,\nthe attributes for\n\n309\n00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:09.370\nthat server will be loaded into the CMDB,\nright?\n\n310\n00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.830\nWhen it is configured,\nthe configuration management record for\n\n311\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.550\nthat server will be changed, right?\n\n312\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.150\nWhen you update a document,\nit will be managed this way, etc.\n\n313\n00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.790\nSo policies are gonna underpin and\nbolster these processes.\n\n314\n00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.430\nAnd without governance and without\nthe culture of following procedures and\n\n315\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.212\nfollowing policies, it will fall over.\n\n316\n00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:31.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\n\n317\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.130\nhow do we begin with this idea of trying\nto establish those policies that we need?\n\n318\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.741\n&gt;&gt; Well, again,\n\n319\n00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:39.710\nit does start with understanding\nwhat you wanna control, right?\n\n320\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.780\nIt includes the definition of the process.\n\n321\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.688\nIt includes the definition\nof the policies.\n\n322\n00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:48.944\nThe training of that, the enablement of\nwise people, right, to know how to use it.\n\n323\n00:16:48.944 --> 00:16:51.895\nThese systems, the configuration\nmanagement system could be complex.\n\n324\n00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:56.085\nI know the ones I've seen are not\nnecessarily the most intuitive, right, so\n\n325\n00:16:56.085 --> 00:17:00.341\nyou're gonna have to bolster your policies\nand your processes with effective\n\n326\n00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:05.280\ntraining, with effective upkeep,\nand ongoing verification and audit.\n\n327\n00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, some of the other principles\nthat I also wanna point out is you also\n\n328\n00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:15.540\ncall out the idea here of automation to\nreduce errors as well as part of this.\n\n329\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.280\nAnd so, part of this idea of setting that\npolicy up is actually saying on a policy\n\n330\n00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.690\nto reduce errors,\nwhat automation can we put in there?\n\n331\n00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n332\n00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.308\nAs you define this process,\nyou're gonna come up with models,\n\n333\n00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:31.236\nconfiguration models for how you're gonna\nhandle certain type of assets, right?\n\n334\n00:17:31.236 --> 00:17:33.890\nYou're gonna handle servers\ndifferently than people,\n\n335\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.555\npeople different than documents.\n\n336\n00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:39.895\nSo these models, you might remember\nthat word model from previous episodes.\n\n337\n00:17:39.895 --> 00:17:44.315\nA model is a predefined step for handling\na particular type of activity, right?\n\n338\n00:17:44.315 --> 00:17:46.155\nAnd for configuration models,\nit would be for\n\n339\n00:17:46.155 --> 00:17:48.605\nhandling a particular type of assets,\nright?\n\n340\n00:17:48.605 --> 00:17:49.855\nSo policies will help that.\n\n341\n00:17:49.855 --> 00:17:53.465\nAnd if you consider that there\nare many automation tools available\n\n342\n00:17:53.465 --> 00:17:58.015\nthat will basically scan your network\nenvironment and find all the switches,\n\n343\n00:17:58.015 --> 00:18:01.320\nfind all the routers,\nidentify them, right?\n\n344\n00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.741\nSo there's those kind of capabilities,\nand you can go dive deeper into that,\n\n345\n00:18:03.741 --> 00:18:05.183\nyou can get the physical layer,\nget servers.\n\n346\n00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:09.063\nYou can even get down to the application\nlayer that you know this server is a web\n\n347\n00:18:09.063 --> 00:18:12.980\nserver, it has five web applications\non it, and that sort of thing.\n\n348\n00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.548\nSo automated discovery of\na technical detail is very powerful,\n\n349\n00:18:16.548 --> 00:18:20.323\nand it can help you audit against\nthe reality of the configuration.\n\n350\n00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:24.436\nSo if you think you have 500 servers,\nand you do a scan and\n\n351\n00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.587\nfind out you have 650, hm.\n\n352\n00:18:26.587 --> 00:18:30.013\nSomething may be wrong with my\nconfiguration management system,\n\n353\n00:18:30.013 --> 00:18:30.632\nall right.\n\n354\n00:18:30.632 --> 00:18:35.536\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, let's talk about\nthis idea of integration a little bit\n\n355\n00:18:35.536 --> 00:18:40.675\nbecause it seems like I may have the idea\ndown that I know that I need to integrate.\n\n356\n00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:44.884\nBut is there something that ITIL can help\nus with that says that there's a model for\n\n357\n00:18:44.884 --> 00:18:47.822\nsomething like the configuration\nintegration of this?\n\n358\n00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:50.125\n&gt;&gt; Not specifically.\n\n359\n00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:54.790\nITIL is positioning itself as being\na best practice across multiple sizes of\n\n360\n00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.750\norganizations, multiple\ntypes of organizations.\n\n361\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.860\nYou could be an organization, for\n\n362\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.070\ninstance, that outsources all of your IT,\nso\n\n363\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:05.190\nhow much is your configuration management\ngonna be involved, there is a lot less.\n\n364\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.830\nYou still need to have\nconfiguration management in place,\n\n365\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.140\neven if you outsource everything.\n\n366\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.930\nObviously, your suppliers, in that case,\nare gonna have the heavier lifting of\n\n367\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.390\nunderstanding what servers they have and\nwhatnot.\n\n368\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.780\nBut at least you're gonna manage the\ninterface CIs back to your organization.\n\n369\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.010\nSo the answer to your question,\nRonnie, it just depends,\n\n370\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.190\nright, on how big an organization you are,\nhow much control you need to exert.\n\n371\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.907\nIn the lack of this control, though,\n\n372\n00:19:27.907 --> 00:19:30.598\nyou're missing opportunities\nto create business value.\n\n373\n00:19:30.598 --> 00:19:37.140\nJust imagine change management,\nyou think you wanna change an application.\n\n374\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.856\nOr you, I'm sorry, let me flip that,\nyou want to change a server.\n\n375\n00:19:39.856 --> 00:19:44.596\nWouldn't it be good to know that\nthat server is actually hosting\n\n376\n00:19:44.596 --> 00:19:46.840\nseven web applications?\n\n377\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.740\nAnd notify those application\nowners that hey,\n\n378\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.270\nI'm gonna be taking this server down, so\nthen those application owners say yep,\n\n379\n00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.460\nthat's gonna be affecting the sales\nbusiness unit, it's gonna be\n\n380\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.710\naffecting the manufacturing business unit,\nI need to communicate with them.\n\n381\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.220\nSo as you're planning this change, you\ncan look at your configuration data and\n\n382\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.330\nsay hm,\nchanging this server could have impact.\n\n383\n00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.457\nIt's kind of foundational,\nfundamental, otherwise,\n\n384\n00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:11.536\nyou're just operating in the blind,\nall right, okay.\n\n385\n00:20:11.536 --> 00:20:15.241\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, because of all\nthose different types of configuration\n\n386\n00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:18.270\nitems that are available,\nwe need to understand some of them.\n\n387\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.856\nBecause even though we might have listed a\nfew examples, there might be more that we\n\n388\n00:20:21.856 --> 00:20:24.740\njust don't understand,\nespecially from the ITIL perspective.\n\n389\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.650\nSo help us out there, Terry.\n\n390\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do want to certainly\nreinforce that you might have an idea.\n\n391\n00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.870\nI know my own, just let me perhaps\ncarry my own baggage here.\n\n392\n00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.730\nMy own narrow scope for configuration\nmanagement started off being servers,\n\n393\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.560\ndatabases, applications, right?\n\n394\n00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.080\nAnd maybe another little layer on top of\nthat was what service do these servers,\n\n395\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.830\napplications, and databases support?\n\n396\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.550\nWhat service do they support?\n\n397\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.860\nBut that was about it in my narrow scope.\n\n398\n00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.072\nBut if you look at the slide here, you'll\nsee that actually ITIL has a construction\n\n399\n00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:55.673\nof what a CI might be that's rather large,\nright?\n\n400\n00:20:55.673 --> 00:20:57.290\nIt's a lot bigger than that.\n\n401\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.890\nSo certainly as you're taking your exam,\nyou need to understand it's a big scope.\n\n402\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.152\nAnd I think, as you take this information\nback to work and try to figure out what\n\n403\n00:21:05.152 --> 00:21:09.675\noperation you're gonna do with this,\nstart off understanding it's a big scope,\n\n404\n00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:13.511\nand then focus on those things that\nyou need to shore up first, right?\n\n405\n00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:16.760\nBut you can see here,\nthere's service lifecycle CIs.\n\n406\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.190\nThese things that deal\nwith service strategy,\n\n407\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.090\nwhat business cases are out there?\n\n408\n00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.720\nWhat portfolios have been designed?\n\n409\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.590\nWhat service models exist?\n\n410\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.097\nThe service CIs themselves you just see.\n\n411\n00:21:30.097 --> 00:21:33.736\nInternal CIs, project deliverables,\nproject plans,\n\n412\n00:21:33.736 --> 00:21:35.890\nyou see how wide the scope is?\n\n413\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.070\nIt's very broad.\n\n414\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.780\nAnd to think that you're ever gonna\nget control over all this all the time\n\n415\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.970\nmay be a bit of a pipe dream.\n\n416\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.290\nI certainly understand it.\n\n417\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.270\nBut as you approach your challenge\nof how we're gonna identify,\n\n418\n00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.310\nif you just go in with eyes\nopen saying you know what,\n\n419\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.590\nI'm not gonna focus on project management\ndeliverables, I trust my PMO office,\n\n420\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.700\nI trust them,\nthey got this under control, right?\n\n421\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.350\nAnd I'm gonna believe that until\nproven otherwise, basically.\n\n422\n00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.940\nIT's got a lot of things to keep up with\nas an organization, and as a service\n\n423\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.100\nprovider, you're probably going to work\nmore on your external, internal, and\n\n424\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:16.550\ninterface CIs then at first to get those,\nwhat's directly under your control,\n\n425\n00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.470\nand then work toward\nthe higher levels later on.\n\n426\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.959\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, when you start to take a look\nat that where you start showing some of\n\n427\n00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:28.449\nthese other ones here, what is then\nthe difference between this idea of that\n\n428\n00:22:28.449 --> 00:22:33.020\ninterface CI and such as the external or\ninternal ones that you're talking about?\n\n429\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:39.600\n&gt;&gt; Classic example, how does a service\nprovide interface with end users?\n\n430\n00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.110\nA classic is through a service desk.\n\n431\n00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.043\nWhat interfaces does a service desk have?\n\n432\n00:22:44.043 --> 00:22:46.139\nRight, they perhaps have a web interface.\n\n433\n00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:49.390\nMaybe it's a telephone,\nright, maybe it's a chat.\n\n434\n00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.090\nMaybe there's a self help\napplication that people go to and\n\n435\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.710\nfind their own answers to things, right?\n\n436\n00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.322\nAll those are interfaces\nwith the customers.\n\n437\n00:22:58.322 --> 00:23:00.176\nSo you could look at them as applications,\n\n438\n00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:03.610\nyou can look at what telephone is\nnot really an application, is it?\n\n439\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.110\nBut if you're going to change\nyour phone numbers, right,\n\n440\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.600\nthat's a CI that's worthy of announcing,\nright?\n\n441\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.000\nOr that's a change that's worthy of\nannouncing, those kind of things.\n\n442\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.340\nSo when you consider interface CIs,\n\n443\n00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:19.410\nyou're considering those interfaces\nwith your external customers.\n\n444\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.830\nOr your internal customers,\nas well as perhaps suppliers, right?\n\n445\n00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.512\nSo how do you interface\nwith your suppliers?\n\n446\n00:23:26.512 --> 00:23:31.331\nThat could be contracts,\nit could be documents, lots of ways.\n\n447\n00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:36.248\n&gt;&gt; Right, all right, Terry, well, there's\na lot more to actually cover when we start\n\n448\n00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:40.290\ntaking a look at service assets and\nconfiguration management.\n\n449\n00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.810\nBut this is a great place for\nus to go ahead and also end this episode.\n\n450\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.340\nWe're coming back for more, but it's\na good logical point for us, and, also,\n\n451\n00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.130\na good point for\n\n452\n00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.550\nyou just to stop and configure\njust a few things as you move on.\n\n453\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:57.230\nAnd because we're just kind of really\njust scratching the surface so\n\n454\n00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.600\nfar, and so Terry, any last words\nbefore we close out of this episode?\n\n455\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think if you'd like to\nreinforce the learning that we've just\n\n456\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.690\nhad, you consider taking a look at\nthe case study that you can download.\n\n457\n00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:10.740\nThere's specific activity I can\nshow you here on the slide here.\n\n458\n00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.000\nBasically, it's asking you to look at\nthe case study and dig into it, and\n\n459\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.278\nthen apply it.\n\n460\n00:24:16.278 --> 00:24:18.246\nAnother option is for you is to pause and\n\n461\n00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:21.058\nreflect on what would you do\nback at the office, right?\n\n462\n00:24:21.058 --> 00:24:24.660\nWhere would you begin the attack?\n\n463\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.970\nOr what do you need to shore up?\n\n464\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.990\nPerhaps we've expanded your\nperceptions of what Sacum is about.\n\n465\n00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.040\nYou can also go to the discussion forum\nand ask some good questions there.\n\n466\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry,\nwell, thank you again for\n\n467\n00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.508\nhelping us to understand\nthat a little bit more.\n\n468\n00:24:40.508 --> 00:24:44.020\nWe're still gonna continue on into\na part two, but at this point,\n\n469\n00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.020\nwe're going to sign off.\n\n470\n00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.778\nSo, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n471\n00:24:48.778 --> 00:24:50.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n472\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.457\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more ITIL\nrelease, control, and validation.\n\n473\n00:24:53.457 --> 00:25:02.001\n[MUSIC]\n\n474\n00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.355\n&gt;&gt;

They discuss the need to using a Configuration Management System with assets and configuration items as our main interface with the data from multiple systems holding asset and configuration information.  Along with this, they also take a look at the use of software and controlling software through the DML, the definitive media library.  These are foundational items needed for activities normally performed during the SACM process!",

Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.080\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we'll\ntake a look at ITIL, release, control and\n\n6\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.220\nvalidation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.650\nWe're specifically diving in to a part\ntwo on the idea here of service,\n\n8\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.400\nassets and configuration management and\n\n9\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.340\nwe're gonna actually be taking\nlook at a little bit more.\n\n10\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.390\nWe learned about the purpose of it the\nlast time, talked about the importance of\n\n11\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750\nit but this time we're actually\ngonna learn a little bit more and\n\n12\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.837\nhere to help us out is our ITIL expert Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.610\nTerry Deckert, Terry,\nwelcome back to the studios.\n\n14\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.820\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here, Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700\nAnd as Ronnie said,\nwe're gonna dive a little bit deeper.\n\n16\n00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.640\nRather than look at the big picture\nof what should be under control, or\n\n17\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990\nwhat could be under control,\nwe're gonna look at some techniques for\n\n18\n00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.090\nhow you go about getting it under control.\n\n19\n00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.500\nIt's starts with a configuration\nmanagement system.\n\n20\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990\nHave a look here at the slide.\n\n21\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.430\nA CMS, I'll use the abbreviation here,\nConfiguration Management System,\n\n22\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.290\nis holding all the information\nabout all your CEIs, all your CEIs.\n\n23\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.165\nWhen we consider the scope could\nbe documents, servers, databases,\n\n24\n00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.275\nchances are these aren't gonna\nbe stored in a single database,\n\n25\n00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:17.135\nthey're gonna be spread out\nacross multiple databases, right?\n\n26\n00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:22.355\nSo this base data is gonna come from those\nCMDBs, configuration management databases,\n\n27\n00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:26.117\nto form a bigger federated model of data,\nvery likely.\n\n28\n00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:30.771\nYou can't possibly keep all this in one\nsock, it's gonna be divided up, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:35.584\nas you look at the next slide here, you\ncould see just how complex that might be.\n\n30\n00:01:35.584 --> 00:01:41.689\nAnd note in this graphic that the CMDBs,\ncould be multiple locations for\n\n31\n00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.140\nthose, and these CMDBs are disks\nwhere the data is, right.\n\n32\n00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.120\nYou somehow got to role that together\nin some sort of federated model.\n\n33\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.740\nSo that you can have\nthe integration layer right.\n\n34\n00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.690\nYou're going to be linking\nthis information to\n\n35\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.350\nthe corresponding incidents.\n\n36\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.350\nProblems, changes, right, so\nyou have those databases as well, and\n\n37\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.210\nthis all rolls up, hopefully into some\nsort of presentation layers [LAUGHS] So,\n\n38\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.410\nits actually useable.\n\n39\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.140\nHaving all that data and not be able to\nuse it would be a waste of time actually.\n\n40\n00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.120\nSo you gonna have to present this\ndata in a meaningful ways so.\n\n41\n00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.908\nThat knowledge extraction layer,\n\n42\n00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:22.670\nbuilding up your, engineering your queries\nto bring this information to life.\n\n43\n00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.620\nAnd just take a look, I mean there's lots\nof sources of data here being rolled up\n\n44\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.575\ninto the CMS and rolling that up\nis not a trivial matter, right?\n\n45\n00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:33.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So to go out and\n\n46\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.890\nbuy a system that promises to do this is\nprobably a little bit of folly in that.\n\n47\n00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.130\nBecause there's gonna be some post\npurchase integration issues or\n\n48\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.320\nengineering of reports as\nyou go about that as well.\n\n49\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.710\nAs you take this topic to an exam,\n\n50\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.210\nplease keep in mind you're not\ngonna have to design a CMS.\n\n51\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.140\nThat's not what ITIL is\ngoing to ask you to do.\n\n52\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.670\nThey will be looking for\nsome key reminders\n\n53\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.070\nof that they should be integrated, that\nthey should have a presentation layer but\n\n54\n00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.800\nthey're not gonna ask you to design a CMS.\n\n55\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.020\nDon't worry about that piece but\n\n56\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.700\nunderstanding the value of getting\nthis items under control and\n\n57\n00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.310\nhaving them presented in meaningful\nways is what the goal is.\n\n58\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.410\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, even though I\nsee a lot of information there,\n\n59\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.700\nwhat about the idea of some type\nof software asset that we may have\n\n60\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.760\nthat contains information?\n\n61\n00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.876\n&gt;&gt; Software is a very special asset.\n\n62\n00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:29.830\nIt's really where people start using\nsystems and services, is through software.\n\n63\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.609\nAnd as you present your services to end\nusers, chances are end users are going to\n\n64\n00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.640\nbe interacting with some sort of\napplication or piece of software.\n\n65\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.200\nSo they have special controls.\n\n66\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.430\nITIL give special note to\nthe controlling of software assets.\n\n67\n00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.830\nIf you look at the graphic\nhere I think you'll find\n\n68\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.400\nsome curious things that's\nkind of cute about this.\n\n69\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.040\nFirst of all controlling software\nassets back in the day was actually\n\n70\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.480\nphysically going to a cabinet.\n\n71\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.530\nIf you wanted to build\nout a bunch of laptops or\n\n72\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.510\na bunch of desktop computers, you went to\nthe cabinet and you got out the floppies.\n\n73\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.120\nAnd, one after the other, you put them in.\n\n74\n00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.050\nSo you see that little cabinet in\nthe graphic there actually has some\n\n75\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.535\nfloppy disks in there and\nsome tape drives.\n\n76\n00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:16.640\nRonnie what do you suppose those\nboxes are at the top of that cabinet?\n\n77\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.998\nDo you have any idea what those could be?\n\n78\n00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:21.760\n&gt;&gt; I really do not know what\nthey possibly could be here.\n\n79\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.410\nI was trying to think about it\nas I was looking at the idea of\n\n80\n00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.400\nphysical CIs configuration items.\n\n81\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.720\nLike I can understand the floppy,\nI understand the idea of optical media at\n\n82\n00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.420\ntimes, yeah,\nas far as boxes go I'm kind of at a loss.\n\n83\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.305\n&gt;&gt; I was at a loss myself.\n\n84\n00:04:35.305 --> 00:04:37.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I had a student one time probably\n\n85\n00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.080\npointed out, and\nI think she might have been right,\n\n86\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.190\nthat those are boxes full of punch cards.\n\n87\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.110\nLike Fortran cards where you go and\n\n88\n00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.380\nplug them in and configure your mainframe\ncomputers with a bunch of punch cards.\n\n89\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.630\nSo that's just how old this idea is.\n\n90\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.850\nAnd I think just the idea of\nhaving a physical cabinet with\n\n91\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.560\nphysical media in it is kind of old now,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.200\nBut the concept of having a known good\nlocation where known good software is,\n\n93\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.232\nis still alive and well.\n\n94\n00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:04.100\nAnd ITIL calls that\nthe definitive media library.\n\n95\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.360\nAnd it is important construction, it is\nwhere you control your software assets\n\n96\n00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.720\nthe known good source of your software.\n\n97\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.240\nAnd the control documentation and\nperhaps if it's purchased software,\n\n98\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.630\nlicensing documentation cuz you also\nhave to keep that under control.\n\n99\n00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.390\nSo keep in mind that\nthe definitive media library,\n\n100\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.020\nyou learned about it in foundation,\nis still alive and well.\n\n101\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.870\nIt's a very special\nconfiguration database.\n\n102\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.370\nIt's a very special configuration item\nwhen you consider software assets.\n\n103\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, before we move on from here,\nyou also have there,\n\n104\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.470\nin the lower left-hand corner of that,\nwhere you talk about naming conventions.\n\n105\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.750\nHow important is the idea\nof a naming convention?\n\n106\n00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.860\nAnd less contrast it like,\nsmall versus as your organization grows.\n\n107\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.060\n&gt;&gt; Knowing what you want\nto call your access.\n\n108\n00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.840\nNow this software media library,\n\n109\n00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.940\nthe definitive media library I should say,\nis also for homegrown software.\n\n110\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.730\nNot just the things you purchased.\n\n111\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.120\nSo naming and\nversioning are closely related.\n\n112\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.170\nIf you name a piece of software.\n\n113\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.000\nWe had, for instance, this may sound\nkind of silly, we named our homegrown\n\n114\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.610\nCMS Pandora which is very confusing\nwith a very popular music service.\n\n115\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n116\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.850\nSo that really confused a lot of people.\n\n117\n00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.510\nThey thought where they could go\ndownload Pandora when actually they're\n\n118\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.090\ndownloading our CMS app, right?\n\n119\n00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.630\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.500\nSo naming conventiona can be important.\n\n121\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.250\nIt was a cute name, it had great\ngraphics and everything like that.\n\n122\n00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.100\nSo coming up with names\nis one part branding,\n\n123\n00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.120\nit's also one part just accountability,\nunderstanding what you and what you don't.\n\n124\n00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.340\nClosely related to that\nis your version controls.\n\n125\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.280\nAnd the DML, the Definitive Media Library\nis going to manage that for\n\n126\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.910\nyou in electronic formats more\nthan a physical format now.\n\n127\n00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.370\nAnd of course, SACEM as a process\nis going to enable that as well.\n\n128\n00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.240\nAnd we found out that in\nthe early days of ITPROTV, Terry.\n\n129\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.180\nThat we kind of named things whatever we\nwanted to at the very beginning when we\n\n130\n00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.960\nwere building up just our content library.\n\n131\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.250\nBut then, after a while, we found\nthat some of the shows that we did.\n\n132\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.940\nThey had so many overlapping topics.\n\n133\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.110\nThat was difficult to confuse them,\nwhen all of a sudden you'd go to one show,\n\n134\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.590\nyou'd see almost the same name.\n\n135\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.490\nBecause you didn't think about it.\n\n136\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.430\nAnd now when you tried to\ndo some editing with that,\n\n137\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.330\nyou were like,\nwhich one are we really talking about?\n\n138\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.860\nAnd I can see that with something like\nthe Definitive Media Library, where I say,\n\n139\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.220\nTerry, go and get me this cuz I need it.\n\n140\n00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.150\nAnd now you go and look and\nthere's five shelves.\n\n141\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.310\nAnd you see the same exact name\nacross four of those shelves.\n\n142\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n143\n00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.130\n&gt;&gt; And so, the idea of actually\nkeeping something distinct and\n\n144\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.910\nsomething that's uniform\nmight actually be helpful for\n\n145\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.240\nsomebody to find the right\ninformation in a timely manner.\n\n146\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.930\n&gt;&gt; So, again, consider that sachem\nis a process is just gonna be\n\n147\n00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.350\nthe governing process over\nhow you go about that.\n\n148\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.650\nIt's going to, with eyes wide open,\nsay, you know what,\n\n149\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.630\nwe gotta be careful about\nhow we name things.\n\n150\n00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.610\nSo, it could be as simple as you check to\nsee if the name is already being used,\n\n151\n00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.190\nyou see if it's unique enough.\n\n152\n00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.870\nRight.\nAnd for a large scale organization,\n\n153\n00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.620\nyou might even have a set of approvals for\nwhat names can be brought on.\n\n154\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.912\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right so Terry, understanding\nthat we definitely know that there's gonna\n\n155\n00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:08.871\nbe some type of management system for\nthe data that we have.\n\n156\n00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:12.540\nAnd also that we need to make sure\nthat we put some consideration in for\n\n157\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.470\nsoftware assets,\nWhat is it that we really need to do?\n\n158\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.410\nWhat are some of the specific activities\nthat we really need to focus on to help us\n\n159\n00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.000\nto ensure that we can accomplish this.\n\n160\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, ITIL makes this,\nagain, fairly simple in concept.\n\n161\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.440\nIt's difficult to execute.\n\n162\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.830\nI got to say it's not\na trivial matter doing this.\n\n163\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.960\nBut if you have a look\nat the graphic here.\n\n164\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.360\nThe activities that Sachem recommends or\nthat ITIL recommends that Sachem\n\n165\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.440\ncan take care is that you come up with the\nability to manage and plan these things.\n\n166\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.690\nThat starts with identification.\n\n167\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.450\nYou gotta understand\nwhat you want to manage.\n\n168\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.230\nManaging and\nplanning you configuration identification,\n\n169\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:52.150\nhow are you going to version things, name\nthem as we talked about just now Ronnie.\n\n170\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.579\nComing up with how you're\ngonna control them.\n\n171\n00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:58.387\nChange management is the primary\nmechanism within ITIL framework,\n\n172\n00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:00.100\nof controlling these assets.\n\n173\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.930\nIf you're gonna change them,\nthey come under change control, right.\n\n174\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.410\nSo change management is the mechanism.\n\n175\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.910\nSo in that regard, ITIL's kind of already\nanswered the question, how are you gonna\n\n176\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.520\ncontrol these configuration items is gonna\nbe through things in changed management.\n\n177\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.470\nAnd then gets status reporting,\nright, this is so important for\n\n178\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.080\nso many different activities,\nas an example.\n\n179\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.776\nYou know that there's a major patch\ncoming out for Microsoft Server 2012.\n\n180\n00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:31.270\nCan you easily discern how many\nMicrosoft Server 2012 instances you have.\n\n181\n00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:36.308\nRight, CMS can do that for you and Sachem\ncan govern that CMS that configuration\n\n182\n00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:39.413\nmanagement system so you can get\na good answer to that question.\n\n183\n00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:42.192\nYou might find that the scope\nis on you know we only have 50,\n\n184\n00:09:42.192 --> 00:09:44.548\nwe might have 300 again\ndepending on the scale.\n\n185\n00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:49.351\nBut just how valuable that information\nis can't be overstated you know what\n\n186\n00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:52.664\nlevel of work you have,\nyou know what you need to do.\n\n187\n00:09:52.664 --> 00:09:56.637\nAnd you have a repository of information\ninstantly at your fingertips,\n\n188\n00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:58.209\nis what the goal is, right?\n\n189\n00:09:58.209 --> 00:10:02.310\nAnd then of course, verification and\naudit is another topic, another activity.\n\n190\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.890\nGoing, following through with\nyour configuration data and\n\n191\n00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.210\ncomparing it to your\ndata to known reality.\n\n192\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.040\nDo you really have 300\nservers at patch level z?\n\n193\n00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.590\nVerify that through some\nsort of automated discovery.\n\n194\n00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.690\n&gt;&gt; Alright, so Terry, as we continue\nto move through this process and\n\n195\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.550\nunderstanding that there are certain\nactivities that are related.\n\n196\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.107\nPlanning out, then the idea of using\na system like this and trying to get\n\n197\n00:10:28.107 --> 00:10:32.106\nit up and running seems to be one of the\nmost important elements that we can have.\n\n198\n00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:35.150\nWe don't wanna just throw it in there and\ngo use it, figure it out, right?\n\n199\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's not a trivial matter.\n\n200\n00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.430\nBut managing these assets requires you\nfirst to identify what you wanna manage,\n\n201\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.850\nand then enabling the management\nof it through a proper tool set.\n\n202\n00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.510\nAn integrated tool set, one that can link\nthe information across different CMDBs.\n\n203\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.950\nYou gotta start with a game plan that\nsuggests first, what do we wanna control,\n\n204\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.330\nand then, start looking at,\nonce you have that process understood,\n\n205\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.990\nthen looking at the tool sets\nare gonna let you make that happen.\n\n206\n00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.490\nYeah.\n\n207\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.610\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n208\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:10.200\nThe other thing that we also want to take\na look at then is to take some time and\n\n209\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.090\ntalk about the idea of\nidentification then,\n\n210\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.290\nand defining the CI's that we need to.\n\n211\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.480\nSo, let's go ahead and do that Terry.\n\n212\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean,\nwe talked about it briefly earlier.\n\n213\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:27.110\nIf you want to tackle this, a necessary\nevil is what do you want to tackle?\n\n214\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.298\nThe universe,\nthe superset is large, right?\n\n215\n00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:35.516\nWhen you consider that you might want\nto keep up with employee data, right?\n\n216\n00:11:35.516 --> 00:11:37.190\nHR may be handling that for you already.\n\n217\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.120\nYou know what department people belong to.\n\n218\n00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.620\nAgain, think about this.\n\n219\n00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:49.170\nCould an IT service be more effectively\nmanaged if you had user data available?\n\n220\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.900\nI know when I managed a learning\nmanagement system It was important for\n\n221\n00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.300\nus to know what business\nunit people belong to.\n\n222\n00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.550\nSo we could divide all the students up\ninto the appropriate business learning\n\n223\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.410\nplans, right?\n\n224\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.180\nBecause it's each business unit\nhad unique learning plans.\n\n225\n00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.640\nSo that was valuable information\nthat helped us automate some\n\n226\n00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.120\npart of our service.\n\n227\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.040\nSo we wanted good HR data.\n\n228\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.310\nDid we manage that data,\nwe did not manage that data.\n\n229\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.114\nWe count on HR manage it and\n\n230\n00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:23.050\nwhat we needed to manage was the migration\nof that data into our system, right.\n\n231\n00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.500\nThat's what SACHEM is about.\n\n232\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.760\nIf you need this data it doesn't\nnecessarily mean you're controlling all of\n\n233\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.070\nit but you certainly are managing it and\ngetting it presented in the right way.\n\n234\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.510\n&gt;&gt; And you also end up taking looked in,\nonce again when we talk about the labeling\n\n235\n00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.310\nand then the roles and\nresponsibility for each of these.\n\n236\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.685\nIt's really an important aspect that\nwe go ahead and define that out.\n\n237\n00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:47.790\nTo actually know who is gonna be\nresponsible for managing the data as well.\n\n238\n00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.702\nSo when we start to take a look then,\nat what level then, okay,\n\n239\n00:12:52.702 --> 00:12:57.970\ndo we stop to and say, hey,\nwe're not managing that part of it.\n\n240\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.000\nWe're only managing this part of it.\n\n241\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.270\n&gt;&gt; There's no prescribed\nway here to do this.\n\n242\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.060\nI think I mention perhaps\nwhat's an intuitive thing for\n\n243\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.160\nmost folks is that IT departments\ndon't maintain HR data, right?\n\n244\n00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.360\nThey typically don't,\nright, they need to use it.\n\n245\n00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.710\nMaybe this is with an active directory.\n\n246\n00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.055\nMaybe a lot of this data is within\nsomething IT does control, right?\n\n247\n00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:22.260\nAnd you have access to that data.\n\n248\n00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.133\nSo in some regards active directory\nmight be considered a CMDB in ITIL\n\n249\n00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:27.479\ndefinitions, right.\n\n250\n00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:30.577\nEven the data that's about documents,\n\n251\n00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:35.052\nmaybe the documents are stored\nin a document repository.\n\n252\n00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:38.098\nMaybe have a good solid\ndocument management systems and\n\n253\n00:13:38.098 --> 00:13:39.912\nthey control documents well, so\n\n254\n00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:44.780\nyou don't have to go define that\nbecause it's already there, right?\n\n255\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.096\nThat's the nature of this beast,\nis understanding what you have control of,\n\n256\n00:13:48.096 --> 00:13:49.554\nwhat you don't have control of and\n\n257\n00:13:49.554 --> 00:13:52.236\ncertainly tackling the ones you\ndon't have control of first.\n\n258\n00:13:52.236 --> 00:13:55.408\n&gt;&gt; All right we already mentioned\nnaming a couple of times but\n\n259\n00:13:55.408 --> 00:13:59.380\nyou also have something that seems\nto be a little bit separate here.\n\n260\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.730\nSo I want you to help me distinguish this,\nTerry.\n\n261\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.270\nYou talk about naming but\n\n262\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.410\nthen you also have a note here\nthat talks about labelling.\n\n263\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.520\nWhat's the difference here?\n\n264\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.560\nAnd why are we kind of\nmaking that differentiation?\n\n265\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good point.\n\n266\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.510\nSome of the assets that you want\nto manage are physical assets.\n\n267\n00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, certainly have\n\n268\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.300\ncommitment with naming all\nyour assets is important.\n\n269\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.330\nHaving a naming convention.\n\n270\n00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.170\nAnd versioning is closely related to that.\n\n271\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But, some of these assets are actually\n\n272\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.950\nphysical assets, like laptops or servers.\n\n273\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.130\nRack systems and those kind of things.\n\n274\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.790\nPutting tags, or putting labels,\non those physical assets\n\n275\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.220\nis very helpful to the people that\nare practicing and using those things.\n\n276\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.130\nIf I go to my configuration\nmanagement system and\n\n277\n00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:44.740\nlook up a rack that has\na faulty power supply.\n\n278\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.700\nI look up the data, it says, okay, it's\nin data centre B, it's rack number 23.\n\n279\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.820\nI look at all that in my data and\nthen I go over to the data center,\n\n280\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.040\nit would be nice to see a rack\nwith a label on that says 23.\n\n281\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.930\nSo, labelling can help with that\nphysical management of these assets.\n\n282\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.890\nYou can have a physical reminder and\n\n283\n00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.691\na physical cue as to what actually\nthe data is in the back end, right.\n\n284\n00:15:06.691 --> 00:15:08.099\n&gt;&gt; All right, also,\n\n285\n00:15:08.099 --> 00:15:14.331\nthe idea of labelling may help us in terms\nof inventory control as well, right?\n\n286\n00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.326\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n287\n00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:19.620\nThis particular aspect\nhas grown to be even\n\n288\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.720\nelectronic where you can do barcode\nscans and those kinds of things, and\n\n289\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.520\nyou'll see perhaps an asset tag\non the top of a laptop right?\n\n290\n00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.200\nBeing able to come in to the, we had\nthese kiosks at the place I used to work.\n\n291\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.180\nWe had these kiosks, I'd bring my laptop.\n\n292\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.780\nThe service technician\nscanned that bar code, and\n\n293\n00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.940\nit instantly brought him\nall the configuration data.\n\n294\n00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.900\nHe knew what operating system I had, what\nbuild number I had, that sort of thing.\n\n295\n00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.160\nSo this can be very powerful, right?\n\n296\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.271\nThese physical assets being\nlabeled like that, yep.\n\n297\n00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:51.076\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwhen we start to take a look then, Terry,\n\n298\n00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.936\nat everything that we talked about.\n\n299\n00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:56.578\nWe've talked basically about the need for\nputting together and\n\n300\n00:15:56.578 --> 00:16:00.086\nunderstanding the control\nthrough that management system,\n\n301\n00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:02.389\nthe configuration management system.\n\n302\n00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:05.654\nWe also of course then took\na look at some of the models and\n\n303\n00:16:05.654 --> 00:16:07.812\nthe activities that we need as well.\n\n304\n00:16:07.812 --> 00:16:10.653\nUnderstanding that we also need to treat\nsoftware a little bit differently.\n\n305\n00:16:10.653 --> 00:16:14.418\nAnd then some of the labeling, and\nthe naming seems to becoming more and\n\n306\n00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:18.530\nmore important, especially with all\nthe assets that we have to track.\n\n307\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.120\nIn a small business,\nit may be enough where Terry,\n\n308\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.720\nyou might be able to keep all of\nit in your head, but I know for\n\n309\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.120\nme I might be able to keep two things,\nand then I'm done.\n\n310\n00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.600\nBut having the labeling, having the naming\nconvention there may actually help out and\n\n311\n00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.080\nestablish that, and even after, long after\nexcuse me, that you may not even work for\n\n312\n00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.240\nthat company anymore.\n\n313\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.850\nIt might help them out as well.\n\n314\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.790\nSo provide even continuity\nafter your particular time\n\n315\n00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.790\nserving that company, right?\n\n316\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.250\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\n\n317\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:50.010\nit provides a baseline of configuration\ndata that can be used after I'm gone.\n\n318\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.340\nIt can be simple.\n\n319\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.770\nIf you're in a small organization, it\ncould be a spreadsheet with multiple tabs.\n\n320\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.980\nIt does not have to be complicated if\nyou don't have a complex environment.\n\n321\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.000\nObviously with scale a larger\norganizations with 300 servers,\n\n322\n00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.755\n3000 servers, those kind of things.\n\n323\n00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:05.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about,\n\n324\n00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.890\nsomething you need really to take hold\nof and get a control of it, yeah.\n\n325\n00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.740\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry,\nwell thank you again for\n\n326\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:17.580\nhelping us to kinda start to form up some\nof the activities that we need to do.\n\n327\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.390\nSome of the concepts that we'd really\nneed to focus in on that help to\n\n328\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.180\nplant that concept down and\nbe able to use it within our organization.\n\n329\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.300\nBut at this point we've got\nactually another part to go, but\n\n330\n00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.350\nlogically we're gonna save that for\na part three is what we're gonna do here.\n\n331\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.680\nSo we're going to sign off then.\n\n332\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.370\nFor IT Pro TV I've been\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n333\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.134\n&gt;&gt;

This is important concept to know not only who but the scope of the change according to the team.  Terry also helps us to take at controls that need to be in place for the release to happen.  Part of the best practices with SACM is also accounting and reporting along with verification and auditing, says Terry.   They end with a brief overall review of the major concepts of SACM.",

Glad to be here Ronnie,\nand as you suggest,\n\n12\n00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:35.409\nwe're gonna dive a little bit deeper.\n\n13\n00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:40.816\nWe're gonna be looking in this episode at\nhow we control our configuration items,\n\n14\n00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:43.120\nand all these assets that we have.\n\n15\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.710\nWe'll start with a little graphic\nhere that describes this concept of\n\n16\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.800\na release unit.\n\n17\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.040\nAnd it's really kind of simple, it's just\nwhere do you want to exert control, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.740\nIn this particular graphic,\nI'll just walk down one of the trees here.\n\n19\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.830\nIf you look at system one,\nsystem one, let's give it a name.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.190\nWe'll call it, payroll system, right?\n\n21\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.630\nGot the payroll system.\n\n22\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.660\nIt's broken down into\na couple different suites.\n\n23\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.200\nOne suite is for project, kind of cost and\npayroll related projects.\n\n24\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.610\nThe other one is for hourly employees,\non the shop floor kinda thing, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.710\nSo, two different suites of applications,\nunderneath those are programs,\n\n26\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.060\nunderneath the programs\nthemselves are some modules.\n\n27\n00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.840\nThrough your release policy,\n\n28\n00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.520\nyou will determine where\ndo you wanna exert control?\n\n29\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.460\nAnd it's not necessarily a monolithic\ndecision that will always\n\n30\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.990\nbe controlled in one spot.\n\n31\n00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.600\nYou might allow some changes to\nhappen at the module level, and\n\n32\n00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.190\nhave change management involved at that\nlevel, or you might say, you know what?\n\n33\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.520\nThe lowest unit we're going to go down\nthis tree is at the program level.\n\n34\n00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.270\nThat's where we're gonna exert\ncontrol is one thing, right?\n\n35\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.740\nSo that program could change, and\nobviously, according to this tree,\n\n36\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.490\nprogram 211 is only affecting suite 1-2,\nright?\n\n37\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.210\nSo, in that particular example,\n\n38\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.120\nyou could exert control either at\nprogram level or at the suite level.\n\n39\n00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.410\nThere might be some changes where\nyou're upgrading everything.\n\n40\n00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.270\nYou're upgrading the payroll\nsystem at large, so\n\n41\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.190\nyou wanna exert control at the system\nlevel, such as a System 1, right?\n\n42\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.710\nSo, making these decisions about units\n\n43\n00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.610\nis not saying that you're locked\nin to only controlling unit,\n\n44\n00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.200\na particular level, is just defining that\nthis is the levels that we will control.\n\n45\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, that idea of trying to\nmake sure we define them is really so\n\n46\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.780\nthat when we document that control out,\nwe can say exactly where it happened.\n\n47\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.740\nAnd then we can see who's responsible for\nit, and we don't have to really\n\n48\n00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.040\nworry about were you supposed to do it,\nwere you not supposed to do it?\n\n49\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790\nWho's actually there, and what particular\nlevel it's at without affecting everybody\n\n50\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.793\nelse when we need it to?\n\n51\n00:02:51.793 --> 00:02:53.875\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, exactly right.\n\n52\n00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:58.070\nSo, it's a delineation of accountability,\nis what it is.\n\n53\n00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.230\nIt's identifying what units are in play,\nand who is accountable for them.\n\n54\n00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I see that this actually,\nthis is the first time where I see\n\n55\n00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.840\nthe term release, we've been talking\nthrough a lot of the entire series, and\n\n56\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.730\neven though the title of the entire show\nis on release, control, and validation.\n\n57\n00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.450\nTerry, this is the first time we've\nactually used release in what\n\n58\n00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.180\nwe've seen so far.\n\n59\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great observation, Ronnie.\n\n60\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.400\nRelease and\n\n61\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.350\ncontrol is really about identifying\nwhat you need to have under control.\n\n62\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.940\nThat's what the CIs are about.\n\n63\n00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.190\nWe talk very briefly in change management,\nthat change management was authoritative,\n\n64\n00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.460\nand release management was execution,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.230\nSo, identifying your release units is\nidentifying those points of control.\n\n66\n00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.660\nCertainly, release to the point management\nis where the changes are actually\n\n67\n00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.770\nexecuted and get built and\ndeployed and tested, right?\n\n68\n00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what are some of the\nother things that we have to worry about\n\n69\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.330\nwhen we start talking about that idea of\nwhere that control accountability is?\n\n70\n00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.690\nI know that I can point somebody out,\nbut there's gotta be some documentation.\n\n71\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.550\nOr something else that we need to\nactually take a look at when we start\n\n72\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.670\nmanaging this stuff.\n\n73\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.370\nWell, understanding what your CIs are and\n\n74\n00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.610\nkeeping under control is about process and\npolicy, right?\n\n75\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.930\nBut there's other tricks you\ncan use to help with this.\n\n76\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.240\nMaking sure you can account for\nthese assets.\n\n77\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.840\nAgain, controlling them is also managing\nthe changes and the expectations of work.\n\n78\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.960\nAn example I mentioned earlier was if you\nget a notice that you should be patching\n\n79\n00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.640\nyour Windows 2012 servers,\nwouldn't it be nice if you could just\n\n80\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.410\nknow how many they are, where they are,\nwhat rack systems they're in, etc.\n\n81\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.050\nSo, you are definitely going to eventually\nget to a change and control that change,\n\n82\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.660\nbut actually controlling these items.\n\n83\n00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.650\nSo, if someone were to actually\ntake a server out of a rack and\n\n84\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.980\nput them in some other rack,\nthat's the physical change.\n\n85\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.500\nThey better be coming over to this CMS and\nmaking some updates, right?\n\n86\n00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.970\nSo, again, that's what\nthe process is trying to govern.\n\n87\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.990\nThat's what the policies\nare trying to govern.\n\n88\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.500\nHaving some sort of mechanism to\nfollow up on that movement of devices\n\n89\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.550\nEither by doing some automated discovery,\ndoing audits, etc,\n\n90\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.920\nwould be important aspect\nof control as well.\n\n91\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.650\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry you also mentioned a little\nbit here in your notes about the idea\n\n92\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.910\nof DML integrity.\n\n93\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.432\nWhat do you mean by that,\n\n94\n00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:17.785\nwhen you start to talk about this\nidea in your configuration controls?\n\n95\n00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.189\nWell, integrity in your DML.\n\n96\n00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.730\nRemember, the library is\nthe known good source of software.\n\n97\n00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.450\nYou can have multiple versions,\nand I mean, if you want to,\n\n98\n00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.310\nagain, this is mostly electronic now.\n\n99\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.018\nBut if you want to control\ndesk top builds, for instance,\n\n100\n00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:36.633\nwhat version of the browser should\nbe on that particular build, right,\n\n101\n00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:41.176\nthat's a standard you determine\nthrough your released policies, and\n\n102\n00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:44.073\nyour desktop management policies, right?\n\n103\n00:05:44.073 --> 00:05:48.403\nIf you then want to change that browser,\nor someone does change the browser, and\n\n104\n00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:52.369\nthey're unable to use one of your\napplications in your company, right?\n\n105\n00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:56.509\nThen you can at least come back to your\npolicy that says we're not supporting that\n\n106\n00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.691\nbrowser yet, right, we need to\ngo back to the previous version.\n\n107\n00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:01.624\nWe can help you with that sort of thing.\n\n108\n00:06:01.624 --> 00:06:05.829\nSo, known good sources of software,\neven if there's multiple versions of them,\n\n109\n00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.314\nare also part of a configuration\nmanagement system that allows you to\n\n110\n00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:12.096\nunderstand how they interact\nwith each other as well.\n\n111\n00:06:12.096 --> 00:06:16.612\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Steve, how important\nis it then as we continue to now see\n\n112\n00:06:16.612 --> 00:06:20.329\nthe execution part and\nsome of the things that are going on?\n\n113\n00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.004\nThat we take a look at the idea\nof providing a little bit more\n\n114\n00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:28.129\nstatus accounting and\nreporting here for historical purposes.\n\n115\n00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:29.259\nHow important is that?\n\n116\n00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're getting a little\nmore into the details here, right?\n\n117\n00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:39.487\nWhen you consider what kind of data\nyou need to keep about your assets,\n\n118\n00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:43.647\nright now or is it fully functional and\n\n119\n00:06:43.647 --> 00:06:48.660\nsupporting 17 applications, right?\n\n120\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.480\nThere is a difference between\nbringing your server in and\n\n121\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.900\nhaving it in some stage of accounting.\n\n122\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.420\nOr some stage status,\nI should say, some status.\n\n123\n00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.712\nIt could be a development server,\nit could be a production server,\n\n124\n00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.740\none used to serve production applications.\n\n125\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.568\nSo, having these status indicators\nas part of your data set is gonna\n\n126\n00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:08.852\nbe an important part.\n\n127\n00:07:08.852 --> 00:07:09.587\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n128\n00:07:09.587 --> 00:07:10.975\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n129\n00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:14.251\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\nthe other part of it is also for\n\n130\n00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:17.280\nthe idea of traceability and visibility.\n\n131\n00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.920\nEven though I know,\nlet's say what you talked about.\n\n132\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.720\nThere comes a point when there's\n300 servers or 3,000 servers.\n\n133\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.350\nWhy is it so important that I\ncontract every single one and\n\n134\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.340\nnot just a block of them at a time?\n\n135\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Well, good question.\n\n136\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.588\nI think I'll change that a little bit and\ngo towards applications.\n\n137\n00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:36.096\n&gt;&gt; Yep, sure.\n\n138\n00:07:36.096 --> 00:07:37.690\n&gt;&gt; I remember a challenge\nwe faced one time.\n\n139\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.020\nHow many applications do\nwe have was the question?\n\n140\n00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.290\nThere was an idea that we\ncould simplify our landscape\n\n141\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.830\nif we understood what our landscape was.\n\n142\n00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.000\nSo, the question came from on high,\nhow many applications we have.\n\n143\n00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.030\nWe couldn't believe how hard it\nwas to answer that quick question.\n\n144\n00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.860\nWe had to say define application.\n\n145\n00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.516\n&gt;&gt; I mean, that was one,\n\n147\n00:07:58.516 --> 00:07:59.709\nit was an application, it did.\n\n148\n00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:02.943\nSo, we got a little bit further with that,\nand says well,\n\n149\n00:08:02.943 --> 00:08:06.914\nwe define an application as being\nan application that An end user uses.\n\n150\n00:08:06.914 --> 00:08:10.730\nSo if it's something that's IT for IT,\nwe're not gonna call that an application.\n\n151\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.060\nWe're gonna call that a tool.\n\n152\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now we got a definition here.\n\n153\n00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Tools, applications, right?\n\n154\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.260\nThat gave us some extra\ninformation about it.\n\n155\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.250\nTrying to do, then we also wanna know,\nafter the next question was asked,\n\n156\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.300\nwhat business purpose does\nthis application serve?\n\n157\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.270\nIs it for finance?\n\n158\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.180\nIs it for HR?\n\n159\n00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.120\nIs it for sales?\n\n160\n00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.940\nIs it for manufacturing R&amp;D?\n\n161\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.690\nWhat purpose does it serve?\n\n162\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.200\nBasically, what it's trying to do.\n\n163\n00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.600\nIt's trying to rationalize\nyour application landscape.\n\n164\n00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.780\nAnd we couldn't even answer the question\nat first, what's an application?\n\n165\n00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.490\nSo when you talk about status\ntraceability and visibility.\n\n166\n00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.710\nYou're really talking about understanding\nthroughout this infrastructure,\n\n167\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.900\nthis landscape of all your CI's.\n\n168\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.030\nHow they are going interrelate\nwith each other and what are they,\n\n169\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.323\nwhat do they do for us?\n\n170\n00:08:55.323 --> 00:08:59.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwith your personal experience in\n\n171\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.550\ndoing something like this and you working\nwith the configuration management systems.\n\n172\n00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.850\nThe reporting tools that\nare available in there.\n\n173\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.610\nHave you found them to\nbe fairly intuitive?\n\n174\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.280\nThis is just kind of a side question.\n\n175\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.590\nOr does it seem to be\njust a bear to work with?\n\n176\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.967\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in between.\n\n177\n00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:17.325\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n178\n00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:19.380\n{LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you go out and\n\n179\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.750\npurchase a suite of\nservice management tools.\n\n180\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n181\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.290\n&gt;&gt; They will promise built in reports.\n\n182\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n183\n00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.620\n&gt;&gt; And those reports will have value,\nI'll give you that.\n\n184\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.390\nI would find it very difficult to imagine\na situation where you wouldn't need\n\n185\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.260\nadditional reporting.\n\n186\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n187\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.760\n&gt;&gt; So having a layer of presentation and a\nlayer of reporting that you're gonna have\n\n188\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.852\nto be responsible for and engineer,\nis probably gonna be a likely step.\n\n189\n00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:44.647\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n190\n00:09:44.647 --> 00:09:47.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nbecause the canned reports they come with.\n\n191\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.370\nI think what you'll distinguish\nwhen you look at your tool sets\n\n192\n00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.840\nis that you'll distinguish those that\nallow to have an open data model\n\n193\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.290\nas opposed to proprietary data sets.\n\n194\n00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:59.730\nIt needs to be an open data model, so\nyou can engineer your own reports and\n\n195\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.590\ndo what you want.\n\n196\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.150\nMany of these suites have\na reporting engine on top of them,\n\n197\n00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.020\nallow you to drag and drop,\nquery by example type situations, so\n\n198\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.000\nyou kinda build your own reports.\n\n199\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n200\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nagain you gotta be smart to do that.\n\n201\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That means you gonna have to engineer\n\n202\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.460\nunderstanding of data modules, ecetera\nunderneath it to pull the right fields and\n\n203\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.720\nget throughout your information.\n\n204\n00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.440\nAnd of course you can also design\nreports that are so cumbersome and\n\n205\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.931\ncomplex that they bring the system down or\ndegrade your performance.\n\n206\n00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:28.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n207\n00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.610\nanother consideration when you consider\nthat is having a different data set for\n\n208\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.300\nreporting than for live data.\n\n209\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n210\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:40.430\nSo just sometimes, I know that I work\nwith databases more than anything else.\n\n211\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.870\nAnd even though there were reporting\nengines that were in them,\n\n212\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.410\nwhere you could try to design it.\n\n213\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.938\nIt was so cumbersome to work with,\n\n214\n00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:49.488\nthat it was very difficult to pull out\na report that you thought that you needed.\n\n215\n00:10:49.488 --> 00:10:52.720\nYou'd come close, but you would\nnever get exactly what you needed.\n\n216\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.170\nAnd then we also had to purchase a third\n\n217\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.680\nparty piece of software to essentially\ndesign the reports that we needed to.\n\n218\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.244\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And so sometimes you do see that, and\n\n219\n00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:05.955\nso reporting is one of the most essential\nelements, because we find out something\n\n220\n00:11:05.955 --> 00:11:10.328\nwith even with the idea of asset\nmanagement and configuration management,\n\n221\n00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:14.850\nis that a good report will help people\ngive better value to the business.\n\n222\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.030\nBut as well, allow them to\nmake better business decision.\n\n223\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to upgrade servers or not?\n\n224\n00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.150\nAnd we might be able to pull\nthat out if we're still running\n\n225\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.570\nhardware from ten years ago.\n\n226\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.220\nTerry might say,\n\n227\n00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.270\n'hey, let me run this report to show\nhow many servers were running from\n\n228\n00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.020\nten years ago and here's the life cycle\nprocess, that it's a three year server.\n\n229\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.450\nWe're still running it, now,\n\n230\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.310\nten years later, that it might\nbe time that we replace those.\n\n231\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.610\nSo, having good reporting in these\nthings seems to be a key aspect.\n\n232\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.480\nAnd I think that ITIL's emphasizing that,\nright?\n\n233\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n234\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.900\nAnd while they're not prescribing\nwhat tool you go buy,\n\n235\n00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.880\nthey're certainly going to say that you\nhave to have good management information\n\n236\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.980\ncoming out of these, so\nit's going to be a necessary effort.\n\n237\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.650\nRelated to that is, do you want to\nhave a centralized reporting service?\n\n238\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.870\nDo you want to have\nthe ability to centralize this.\n\n239\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.190\nOr are you going to gain more\nscale if you decentralize and\n\n240\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.080\nenable others to build their own reports,\nright?\n\n241\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.920\nSo that's a key decision factor too.\n\n242\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.630\nHow much you want to\ncontrol this reporting,\n\n243\n00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.610\nhow much you want to liberalize it and\nallow people to design their own.\n\n244\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.840\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nAs our CMS continues to grow in\n\n245\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.530\nnumber of assets and\nthe configuration items that we need.\n\n246\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.650\nThere has to be this unusual type\nof convergence that has to happen,\n\n247\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.430\nwhere we know that all\nthe data is good in it.\n\n248\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:40.060\nSo, Terry, lead us through the idea of,\na little bit, about how we can audit and\n\n249\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.930\nthe idea of verification.\n\n250\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n251\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.290\nAnd again not a trivial matter.\n\n252\n00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.630\nIt's not easy to do this, but\n\n253\n00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.200\nit's vitally important that you have\nyour data represented accurately.\n\n254\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.840\nI mean your physical assets do exist.\n\n255\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.200\nIs server, is one server in rack 23?\n\n256\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.698\nIs it physically actually in rack 23?\n\n257\n00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:05.090\nIf you regularly find that\nyou go to rack 23 and\n\n258\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.150\nfind the wrong server,\nthen obviously you've got some disconnect.\n\n259\n00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.540\nSo there could be some anecdotal\nevidence that your data's not correct.\n\n260\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.730\nI know where we discovered\nin my own experience,\n\n261\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.710\nwhen we were considering\nconsolidating data centers.\n\n262\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n263\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.670\n&gt;&gt; We wanted to move many,\n\n264\n00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.300\nmany servers from disparate data\ncenters into one single data center.\n\n265\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.290\nThat effort required us to\ndo physical verifications\n\n266\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.160\nbecause we could not trust our data.\n\n267\n00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.380\nAt some point in the process,\nwe said, time out.\n\n268\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.390\nDon't even worry about that.\n\n269\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.030\nWe can't plan based on\nthose erroneous data.\n\n270\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.230\nLet's go to the data center and\ndo some counts.\n\n271\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.330\nAnd people had their laptops, and\n\n272\n00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.910\nthey were putting things in spreadsheets,\nright?\n\n273\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.240\nThat's because our data got out of whack.\n\n274\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.270\nSo keeping this under control.\n\n275\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.150\nOnce you get it under control.\n\n276\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.470\nIt's gonna be easier to keep under\ncontrol, if you have a verification and\n\n277\n00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.900\naudit mechanism.\n\n278\n00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.500\nA key component to this would\nbe automated discovery.\n\n279\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.840\nIf you can identify these\npoints on your network,\n\n280\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.410\nall the devices that are attached to the\nnetwork, all the servers that are there,\n\n281\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:18.970\nwhat services they provide electronically\nand store that in a database.\n\n282\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.110\nYou now have something to\ncompare what you think you have,\n\n283\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.220\nto the reality that was\ndiscovered on the network.\n\n284\n00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.710\nAnd there's nothing to say that at some\npoint in time you may also have to get\n\n285\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.260\nthat clipboard out and go to the data\ncenter and say, this is labeled wrong.\n\n286\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We don't have it right.\n\n287\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:40.510\n&gt;&gt; So, how important is it, Terry,\nthat when we start to get the data and\n\n288\n00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.330\nit starts to grow in this way,\n\n289\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.910\nthat we do some type of regular\nscheduled type of auditing?\n\n290\n00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.350\nOr do we just do it when you have realized\nthat there is just one that is wrong.\n\n291\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.819\n&gt;&gt; I think you have answered\nthe question within the question.\n\n292\n00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:55.170\nIs that if you wait until you need it,\n\n293\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.860\nyour just too late, like I said when we\nwere going to consolidate our data base,\n\n294\n00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.400\nour data centers, we realized we\ncouldn't trust the data and we did,\n\n295\n00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.210\nwe had a big time out and it was,\nit was laptops, I said clipboard,\n\n296\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.380\nit was laptops in the data centers going\nin and counting servers on the rack.\n\n297\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n298\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.850\n&gt;&gt; Connecting to them and saying,\nyep, Windows 10 or Windows 2012,\n\n299\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.910\nwhatever it might have been, right?\n\n300\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.900\nThose kinda things.\n\n301\n00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.530\nWe were physically doing that.\n\n302\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.720\nWe had some anecdotal data.\n\n303\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.430\nThe guy that happened to manage the Unix\nservers had some good spreadsheets.\n\n304\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.510\nHe didn't like the CMS.\n\n305\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.515\nIt was counterintuitive.\n\n306\n00:15:25.515 --> 00:15:26.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He had\n\n307\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.695\nreally good spreadsheets that he trusted.\n\n308\n00:15:27.695 --> 00:15:28.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n309\n00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.100\n&gt;&gt; And he never used the CMS.\n\n310\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.260\nSo you have two data sets.\n\n311\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.220\nOne's gonna be out of whack,\nor both are gonna be out,\n\n312\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.560\nthey're not gonna be in sync.\n\n313\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.365\nSo that's what you wanna avoid.\n\n314\n00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You wanna try to build a configuration\n\n315\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.660\nmanagement system and a service asset\nconfiguration management process,\n\n316\n00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.820\nthat keeps this data accurate,\nmore so than not.\n\n317\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, that'll be the last example.\n\n318\n00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.200\nJust kind of hit your nerve with me,\ncuz I see that happen all the time.\n\n319\n00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.580\nAt least I did.\n\n320\n00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.022\nAnd I don't know.\n\n321\n00:15:58.022 --> 00:16:00.822\nWe've talked about it in\nan earlier episode where we said,\n\n322\n00:16:00.822 --> 00:16:04.351\nit's really the organizational change\nthat helps that person that said,\n\n323\n00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:06.834\nI'm not gonna trust the system\nthat we set in place.\n\n324\n00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:10.282\nTo kind of help that but how do we\nreally convince that one individual?\n\n325\n00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:12.490\nCuz we can have 99 out of 100 followed.\n\n326\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.520\nBut in you're example, right?\n\n327\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.560\nThat one guy can tell you.\n\n328\n00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.000\nMine's right and here it is.\n\n329\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.650\nEverybody will say no.\n\n330\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.320\nThe CMS is right.\n\n331\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.660\nSo, how do you know which\nset are you gonna end up\n\n332\n00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.810\ntrusting in this particular aspect?\n\n333\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.480\nExcept by manually having to go there and\nfigure it out.\n\n334\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.090\n&gt;&gt; And that could be the way\nyou have to manual it.\n\n335\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:30.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that I think you're just\n\n336\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.090\npointing to it, Ron, is that if you\ndrift away from this discipline, and\n\n337\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.125\nit's fairly difficult to\nkeep this discipline.\n\n338\n00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nBut if you drift away, the more you drift,\n\n339\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.160\nthe more manual intervention you're\ngonna have to have later on.\n\n340\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.670\nAnd that's what you're trying to avoid,\nright?\n\n341\n00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.930\nYou want tokeep this under control.\n\n342\n00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.710\nIt affects so many different things.\n\n343\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.100\nIf you want to roll up cost information.\n\n344\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n345\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.160\n&gt;&gt; And you say, how many servers are being\nutilized by the learning management\n\n346\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.050\nsystem, and it comes back 380.\n\n347\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.398\nThe service manager says,\nthere's no way we have 380 servers.\n\n348\n00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:04.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n349\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.860\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n\n350\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.190\nWell that's what the CMS says.\n\n351\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:07.730\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n352\n00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.745\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nyou now you have to go and look.\n\n353\n00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:11.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What do we have, so yeah,\n\n354\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.900\nthose were retired long ago,\nthose are actually development boxes,\n\n355\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.190\nthey aren't serving the service.\n\n356\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Those kind of things, right?\n\n357\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.970\nWhy are we doing this\nwould be the question,\n\n358\n00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.290\nwhy do we even have this over here if\nwe're not going to use it appropriately.\n\n359\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.470\nSo policy, discipline, right?\n\n360\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.870\nSlaps on the hand,\ncollective behaviors in the organization,\n\n361\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.150\nit needs to become a culture that\nwe're going to pay attention to it.\n\n362\n00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.080\nI've even seen some organizations\nwhere they essentially control it.\n\n363\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:35.900\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n364\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.520\n&gt;&gt; Because people go into the system\n\n365\n00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.800\nnot knowing how the system is supposed\nto be used and they put in bad data.\n\n366\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n367\n00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.100\nSo tell what you're trying to do,\nI'll do it for you and\n\n368\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.240\nthey had a little team of\npeople that managed it.\n\n369\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.620\nThey also manage reporting\nbecause they didn't want to\n\n370\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.730\nconfuse the reporting landscape too much.\n\n371\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.869\nI don't know how scalable that is.\n\n372\n00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:55.490\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nI doubt that this scale with larger\n\n373\n00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.530\norganization but\nI have organization since at this day.\n\n374\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.400\nYou know what, we'll control this stuff.\n\n375\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.410\nYou wanna put a server in I got it for\nyou, send me the specs.\n\n376\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.300\nI'll enter it.\n\n377\n00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.350\nRight?\nYou need report?\n\n378\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.164\nI got a report for you.\n\n379\n00:18:05.164 --> 00:18:05.690\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n380\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.630\nAnd I can see where some software\nlike that is incredibly helpful,\n\n381\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.530\nnot mentioning any one in particular.\n\n382\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.400\nBut where they required you to touching\nmake sure that these particular fields\n\n383\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.190\nare actually filled in before you\ncan even enter that record in, so\n\n384\n00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.400\nsome type of data validation and\njust making sure.\n\n385\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.901\nBecause if you're like me, sometimes like,\n\n386\n00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:27.160\nit's just enough that they know that\nthere's a server there, a click and you\n\n387\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.060\nenter it in and the rest of the data that\nreally could be searchable is not there.\n\n388\n00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.400\nAnd so you might have one, two,\nmaybe ten or fifteen records after a year,\n\n389\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.890\nwhere you know that's a record\nof something that's there,\n\n390\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.680\nbut you can't really find out because\nyou have no ability to grab that data.\n\n391\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.310\nAnd pull it in.\n\n392\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.750\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n393\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:48.900\nthis idea of keeping that entire database\nwith the audit system that's in place\n\n394\n00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.380\nof today is probably something that\nwe really want to focus in on.\n\n395\n00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.680\nEspecially if we haven't\nbeen doing auditing at all.\n\n396\n00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.015\n&gt;&gt; If you want to tackle\nthe task of sack '.\n\n397\n00:18:58.015 --> 00:18:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n398\n00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.360\n&gt;&gt; If you want to tackle that.\n\n399\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.620\nAnd you ignore verification and audit.\n\n400\n00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.195\nThen your attack might be successful for\na day.\n\n401\n00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:08.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Basically coz\nwithout verification audit\n\n402\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.220\nit's gonna start drifting away, yeah.\n\n403\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.350\nAll right, so Terry we've covered a lot\nof information on service asset and\n\n404\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.420\nconfiguration management.\n\n405\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.400\nSo I think it's a good place for\nus to start just reviewing some of\n\n406\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.340\nthose concepts over the little three\nepisode series that we've been doing.\n\n407\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n408\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.790\nWe'll step back a little bit and\nlook at the process as a whole and\n\n409\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.780\nremind ourselves just\nhow this thing works.\n\n410\n00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.480\nFirst of all, we'll look at some,\nhow it gets started, what inputs and\n\n411\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.230\noutputs it has.\n\n412\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.850\nIf you look at the graphic here,\nsome text here.\n\n413\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.500\nTriggers, inputs, and outputs.\n\n414\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.410\nWhat gets Sackam engaged, or\nwhen do you engage with Sackem?\n\n415\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.370\nYou're going to engage with\nSackam if you change the CI.\n\n416\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:50.957\n&gt;&gt; So if you're going to change something,\nyou're going to be touching the CMS,\n\n417\n00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:52.518\nright, that's way to look at it.\n\n418\n00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:54.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nYou're going to be updating data.\n\n419\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:00.050\nEven if it's a simple up version,\nyou're going from 1.1 to 1.2.\n\n420\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.550\nYou're changing something,\nyou're gonna go to sack them.\n\n421\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.950\nIt could be because new servers arrived.\n\n422\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.360\nSo it's not really a change,\nit's something new.\n\n423\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.300\nRight, you're bringing in new equipment.\n\n424\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.170\nThose types of things.\n\n425\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.850\nThis also starts when you consider\nthe scope of CI's could be documents,\n\n426\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.330\nnot just servers.\n\n427\n00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:25.010\nRight, there could be a service charger,\na service access plan, developed.\n\n428\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.740\nSo new things are being generated at\nthe strategic level,at the design level,\n\n429\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.915\nthat's an entry point in the sackem.\n\n430\n00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:35.340\nSackem is foundational, it is used\nthrough out all life cycle stages.\n\n431\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.620\nWell it is defined till\nservice transition.\n\n432\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.460\nIt is used to get all the stages, yep.\n\n433\n00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.390\nSo clearly as an example,\nhow sackem engaged another stages and\n\n434\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.910\nwith other processes, change management\nthey go like this, they are together\n\n435\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.350\nall the time but financial\nmanagement before where you can have\n\n436\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.130\nall your components identified\nunderneath the service,\n\n437\n00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.780\nyou have an idea of what that\nservice is costing, for instance.\n\n438\n00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.410\nIncluding the CMS supporting the\nidentification of incidents, problems, and\n\n439\n00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.780\nchanges associated with those component,\nso it's a very big piece there.\n\n440\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.660\nIf you wanna plan continuity management.\n\n441\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.180\nService continuity dealing\nwith single points of failure.\n\n442\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.230\nAgain, you could look at this CMS data.\n\n443\n00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.860\nAnd say well we only have one server here,\nthis looks like a weak spot, right?\n\n444\n00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.260\nOr we only have one switch in that\nparticular network environment.\n\n445\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.370\nWhat kind of redundancy do we\nhave there on our network?\n\n446\n00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.490\nThose sorts of things.\n\n447\n00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:36.780\nSo, again, tapping into this data\nof all your assets, is a valuable\n\n448\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.760\ncapability used by all kinds of processes\nthroughout all the stages of life cycle.\n\n449\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.060\nTerry, there's some other aspects\nthat we have to consider,\n\n450\n00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.480\neven though we might not\nhave talked about it.\n\n451\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.850\nIt seems logical, but what happens then,\nif we centralize everything,\n\n452\n00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.950\nand all of a sudden we go there\none day and the data's gone?\n\n453\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.158\nWhat do we have to do,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n454\n00:21:56.158 --> 00:21:56.968\n&gt;&gt; To help us to prevent\n\n455\n00:21:56.968 --> 00:21:58.480\nsomething like that?\n\n456\n00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.330\n&gt;&gt; Well ITEL doesn't necessarily\nteach good practices for\n\n457\n00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.510\nhow to manage data and keep it up.\n\n458\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:07.670\nI mean you certainly aware of it ITEL is\na service management discipline not a data\n\n459\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.200\nmanagement discipline but\n\n460\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.230\ncertainly I'm about to explain\ninformation to a sad story.\n\n461\n00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.670\nBut we had a data center melt down.\n\n462\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.025\nIronically in the winter time.\n\n463\n00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:20.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because the power failure\n\n464\n00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:25.102\ncaused by the ice storm took out the air\nconditioning units in the data center, and\n\n465\n00:22:25.102 --> 00:22:27.520\nobviously one of the things we\nactually did was open windows.\n\n466\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.070\nWe opened windows to help\nkeep things cool for a while.\n\n467\n00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.550\nBut what we discovered in\nour CMS implementation\n\n468\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.590\nwas that was the only\nplace we had on CMS data.\n\n469\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.590\nSo the data center was melting down and\n\n470\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.940\nthe people said,\nwhat applications are effective?\n\n471\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.430\nWell let me go, I can't go see,\nI can't go to the CMS and\n\n472\n00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:51.200\nfind out what's resume effective because\nthat's the only known active live place,\n\n473\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.020\nwe had data other places but\nwe didn't have access to right away.\n\n474\n00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.530\nSo, again, this is critical data.\n\n475\n00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.570\nIt could be critical at any given time.\n\n476\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.770\nSo it should be highly redundant, highly\navailable, and build it accordingly.\n\n477\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So the idea of establishing a good\n\n478\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.750\npolicy, as being part of that service\nasset and configuration management,\n\n479\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.853\nabout backing up the data would\nalso be essential here to them.\n\n480\n00:23:13.853 --> 00:23:14.550\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]-\n\n481\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.250\n&gt;&gt; And again, the standard practice\n\n482\n00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.590\nabout what is vital\n&gt;&gt; And if you wanna consider it vital,\n\n483\n00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.730\nif you wanna consider the CMS vital,\nyou wouldn't be mistaken.\n\n484\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.640\nIt is vital data, at any given time.\n\n485\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.950\nIt can be for so many different people for\nso many different purposes.\n\n486\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.550\nLike I said, we had a data center\nmeltdown, it would be nice to have that\n\n487\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.280\nconfiguration data at our fingertips and\nwe didn't have it.\n\n488\n00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so lets now talk about\nthe idea of some metrics as well.\n\n489\n00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.770\nWe already mentioned them but\nhelp us to understand.\n\n490\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.690\nWhen we start using our sackem and\n\n491\n00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.350\neverything is in place\nhow do I know that it's\n\n492\n00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.610\neffectively working the way that it needs\nto and what can we take a look at help us.\n\n493\n00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n494\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.380\nAs with all the processes for\nITEL, you should identify\n\n495\n00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.780\ncritical success factors for those\nprocesses and key performance indicators.\n\n496\n00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.240\nAnd, as Ronnie suggested,\nthat means measuring.\n\n497\n00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.207\nWhen you consider sackem,\n\n498\n00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:07.178\nsome baseline measurements are do\nyou have your things identified.\n\n499\n00:24:07.178 --> 00:24:07.770\nRight?\n\n500\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.561\nDo you understand what you wanna control?\n\n501\n00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:13.580\nSo that's one element, and\nare they accurate, right?\n\n502\n00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.458\nSo that's what verification audit comes\nin so you can have some KPIs related to\n\n503\n00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:20.720\naccuracy, you have some KPIs\nrelated to identification.\n\n504\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.680\nIf you look the graphic here\nyou can see some of these.\n\n505\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.660\nSome of the critical assess factors as\nyou'll see there on the left column,\n\n506\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.340\nAccounting for and\n\n507\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.050\nprotecting integrity, support processes\nthrough accurate information.\n\n508\n00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:33.410\nSo we're doing some accuracy things,\nand establishing and\n\n509\n00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.340\nmaintain the accurate, another\naccuracy measurement or an indicator.\n\n510\n00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.720\nSo if you look at the KPIs,\nimproved accuracy in budgets, right,\n\n511\n00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.180\nimproved cost accounting for\nservices, right?\n\n512\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:52.470\nAgain, if one service is linked to\nall the components underneath it, and\n\n513\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.950\nall the incidents and problems, you can\nroll up cost analysis for your services.\n\n514\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:02.940\nSo the CMS supports so many things that\nyou could measure the business output.\n\n515\n00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.831\nCan you quantify the cost of a service,\nnumbers of services with\n\n516\n00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:12.374\naccurate cost estimates,\nthose sorts of things, right?\n\n517\n00:25:12.374 --> 00:25:15.002\nSee some of the examples there,\nas well, okay?\n\n518\n00:25:15.002 --> 00:25:19.404\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, the other concept that\nwe also went over a little bit earlier in\n\n519\n00:25:19.404 --> 00:25:22.427\nour series here is the idea\nof too loaded terms, okay,\n\n520\n00:25:22.427 --> 00:25:24.565\nwhich are challenges and risks.\n\n521\n00:25:24.565 --> 00:25:28.835\nRemind us of why they're loaded, and\nthen also take us through some of these.\n\n522\n00:25:28.835 --> 00:25:29.875\n&gt;&gt; I like how they loaded up.\n\n523\n00:25:29.875 --> 00:25:33.350\nA challenge is a risk that\nhas 100% chance of happening.\n\n524\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In other words,\n\n525\n00:25:33.915 --> 00:25:35.145\nyou're going to face this.\n\n526\n00:25:35.145 --> 00:25:36.215\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I think in\n\n527\n00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:38.185\nour discussion we talked about this,\nRonnie.\n\n528\n00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:39.459\nThis is not a trivial matter.\n\n529\n00:25:39.459 --> 00:25:40.115\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n530\n00:25:40.115 --> 00:25:40.675\nRight?\n\n531\n00:25:40.675 --> 00:25:44.605\n&gt;&gt; Getting the discipline, and getting\neveryone trained for that discipline,\n\n532\n00:25:44.605 --> 00:25:49.210\nand keeping that discipline,\nit's a tough one to get, it really is.\n\n533\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.078\nI can't overstate just\nhow difficult this is.\n\n534\n00:25:52.078 --> 00:25:56.450\nTherefore, you're gonna have to be\ninvolved with strong policies, management\n\n535\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:26:01.510\nbacking, thorough accounting,\nand auditing as well.\n\n536\n00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.010\nSo, the challenge that you see here,\n\n537\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.970\npersuading technical support staff that\nthey're supposed to do this, right?\n\n538\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.870\nAttracting and funding this big process,\nmake sure you get that right.\n\n539\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:17.050\nAnd understand that data is not the goal.\n\n540\n00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:24.090\nYou can collect data all day,\nit's making this data useable.\n\n541\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.180\nThe risk as you see here,\n\n542\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.720\nconsidering SACM be technically focused,\ndegradation of accuracy, etc., you're\n\n543\n00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.070\ngonna drift away because these CIs change\nall the time, it's gonna be easy to drift.\n\n544\n00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.270\nSo the risk you're gonna maintain,\nor gonna have pretty much in play at\n\n545\n00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.090\nall time, is that you're\ndrifting too far from reality.\n\n546\n00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.609\nAnd when you really need good data,\nit's not available for you.\n\n547\n00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.213\n&gt;&gt; Now the next to those last two, where\nyou talk about setting the scope too wide\n\n548\n00:26:49.213 --> 00:26:51.530\ninstead of setting the scope too narrow.\n\n549\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.770\nNow you can help us out with this.\n\n550\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:58.356\nSometimes we think that we've done it\nexactly perfectly and all of a sudden, we\n\n551\n00:26:58.356 --> 00:27:03.146\nstart to see that we're now carrying a lot\nof data, but we never run a report against\n\n552\n00:27:03.146 --> 00:27:07.940\nthem, or we actually have everything that\nwe believe that we want and then somebody\n\n553\n00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:13.030\nelse, the decision maker comes along and\nsays, Ronnie, why isn't this included in?\n\n554\n00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.540\nHow do we balance that kind of stuff\nout to help us a little bit more?\n\n555\n00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.834\n&gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna have to build in\nsome flexibility, you can't be monolithic,\n\n556\n00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:24.764\ndictatorial about this process because\nit's gonna have to evolve to focus on\n\n557\n00:27:24.764 --> 00:27:25.441\nyour needs.\n\n558\n00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:29.503\nWhen you consider the initial scope, maybe\nyou're only gonna focus on infrastructure,\n\n559\n00:27:29.503 --> 00:27:31.760\nlet's take care of\nthe network infrastructure.\n\n560\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.330\nThe network is so vital, let's make\nsure we have that figured out, right?\n\n561\n00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.210\nSo maybe you start there and\nthen you expand to servers and\n\n562\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.570\ndatabases and to applications,\nand then you expand to services.\n\n563\n00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.630\nSo I think you consider this an evolution,\nand\n\n564\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.564\nthat you work in gradual, continual ways.\n\n565\n00:27:48.564 --> 00:27:50.540\nITIL is big on this,\n\n566\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.150\nthat you can just solve all the problems\nall at the same time, right?\n\n567\n00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.480\nFocus on those critical things first,\nget some improvement, and\n\n568\n00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.950\nkeep moving toward nirvana.\n\n569\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.400\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n570\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.130\nNow, let's also emphasize another point\nhere that ITIL considers very important,\n\n571\n00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.560\nthe idea that this\nconfiguration management\n\n572\n00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.620\nhappens underneath the idea\nof service operations.\n\n573\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.193\nWhy is that something that I've got to\nmake sure that I understand in my head\n\n574\n00:28:16.193 --> 00:28:18.650\ninstead of something like\na solution of that sort?\n\n575\n00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWell, service operations is the life cycle\n\n576\n00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.860\nstage where configuration items\nactually do their work, right?\n\n577\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.120\nThey get their work done.\n\n578\n00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.470\nAnd when you're talking about\na process being executed, or\n\n579\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.550\na server being utilized, or a database\nbeing queried, or an application being\n\n580\n00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:39.950\nused, whatever the CI might be, it's\nin operations that it actually happens.\n\n581\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.020\nAnd things break, so\n\n582\n00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:47.190\njust imagine that service desk call that\nsays, I can't use the application, right?\n\n583\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.170\nA troubleshooting effort could then ensue,\nand says, well, what server is that on?\n\n584\n00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.230\nYeah, they're patching the server,\n\n585\n00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.670\nthat explains that, or,\nwe're not sure why that's going on.\n\n586\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.310\nDeep dive for it,\nmaybe it's a database issue.\n\n587\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.970\nSo having this configuration\ndata available for\n\n588\n00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.850\noperational use is also critical.\n\n589\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.600\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n590\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.450\nWell, Terry, again, thank you for helping\nus at least to review those concepts as\n\n591\n00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:13.070\nwell as the idea of talking about\nthe release and being able to understand\n\n592\n00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:18.330\nexecution of items within our service\nasset and control management as well.\n\n593\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.980\nBefore we close out of this episode and\nthis kind of little miniseries that we've\n\n594\n00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:27.150\ncreated here, any last words of wisdom\nthat somebody is preparing for this exam?\n\n595\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:30.060\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll give you some\nrecommendations for some self study.\n\n596\n00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.750\nIf you look at the graphic here you'll\nsee there's one called SACM Roles.\n\n597\n00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.550\nThis is a downloadable exercise.\n\n598\n00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:40.560\nDownload that role, the suggestion there,\nit'll take you about 30 minutes, and\n\n599\n00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.990\nit gets your head around who's doing\nwhat and why they're doing it, and\n\n600\n00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.840\nremind you of that.\n\n601\n00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.760\nAnd as always, being able to go back\nto the past exams and the case study\n\n602\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.799\nto see how this applies is also a great\nplace to reinforce this learning.\n\n603\n00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well, that sounds\ngreat for us as we take a look here.\n\n604\n00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.921\nWe've now finished another one of this\nprocess in terms of ITIL: Release,\n\n605\n00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:01.383\nControl, and Validation.\n\n606\n00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:05.015\nAnd you wanna make sure that you do\ngo back and practice these things.\n\n607\n00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:07.345\nIt's not enough that you've\njust watched the videos.\n\n608\n00:30:07.345 --> 00:30:10.485\nI know I'd love to be able to say\nthat osmosis happens that way and\n\n609\n00:30:10.485 --> 00:30:12.845\nthat we can remember\neverything that was happening.\n\n610\n00:30:12.845 --> 00:30:17.425\nBut it does take some time to apply and\nto think about these concepts.\n\n611\n00:30:17.425 --> 00:30:21.105\nSo make sure you go back and\ndo those practice things as well,\n\n612\n00:30:21.105 --> 00:30:24.595\nthe practice tests as well as the idea\nof working through those scenarios.\n\n613\n00:30:24.595 --> 00:30:26.508\nIt's really gonna help you as\nyou get ready for the exam.\n\n614\n00:30:26.508 --> 00:30:29.880\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n615\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.292\nSigning off for the ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n616\n00:30:33.292 --> 00:30:34.490\n&gt;&gt;

They a look at the purpose of service validation and testing as a way of instilling confidence in the provider’s service.  The goal is to provide the better service to the customer by using testing models to eliminate pain points of service, according to the team.  Terry also emphasizes the key drivers to this process is the establishment and enforcement of good policies.  They also briefly introduce testing models and understanding the perspective of service customer.  They end with a brief look at continual service improvement as well.",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.730\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today we'll\ntake a look at ITIL release control and\n\n6\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.790\nvalidation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.820\nWe're specifically diving in to the realm\nof service validation and testing.\n\n8\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.680\nAnd here to help us to understand\nthat concept a bit more\n\n9\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.500\nis gonna be our ITEL expert himself,\nMr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.570\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.701\n&gt;&gt; Good to be back, and\ngood to keep diving in here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:39.860\nThis is a really interesting\nprocess in its evolution, actually.\n\n13\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.830\nService validation and\n\n14\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.511\ntesting once was just an activity\nwithin release and deployment, right.\n\n15\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.252\nIt's been elevated to it's own process,\nit's just that important and\n\n16\n00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:55.581\nI think that's neat to how it's grown\nto be recognized as standing alone.\n\n17\n00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:01.439\nAs with all these processes they\nare designed to be repeatable and\n\n18\n00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.820\ncontinually improved, right.\n\n19\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.640\nSo that's why service validation and\n\n20\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.880\ntesting has raised itself\nup to be a process in and\n\n21\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.420\nof itself, is because this activity does\nneed to be something you just get good at.\n\n22\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.970\nSo you don't have to reinvent\nthe wheel every time, right.\n\n23\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.080\nSo the primary purpose of\nservice validation testing,\n\n24\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.970\nas the name suggests, is that you're\nvalidating that the service is going to be\n\n25\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.080\ndelivered as promised, right.\n\n26\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.430\nAnd it's the testing that\nprovides you that validation.\n\n27\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.468\nIf you are used to the software\ndevelopment life cycle you're certainly\n\n28\n00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:35.867\nused to testing cycles.\n\n29\n00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:40.490\nThat's relevant here because a solution is\nvery likely gonna be part of the service.\n\n30\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.130\nBut I also want you to expand your\nconceptual awareness of this topic to\n\n31\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.935\ninclude that it's not just solutions that\nare being tested, it's the entire service.\n\n32\n00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.385\nAnd when you consider that,\n\n33\n00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.255\nthen you've got to consider things such as\nhuman capabilities and human capacities,\n\n34\n00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:58.085\nnot just system capabilities and\nsystem capacities.\n\n35\n00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:03.425\nSo that's where we're going to\ntake a look at these things.\n\n36\n00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.795\nAs we continue down this path then, we're\ngoing to be looking how it applies to not\n\n37\n00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:13.530\njust those things that are technical in\nnature, but also process capabilities.\n\n38\n00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280\nThe ability of the service to\nbe consumed by the customer.\n\n39\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.910\nSo we're talking about customer's\ncapacity to take on the new service.\n\n40\n00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.020\nYour service could fail for\n\n41\n00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.360\nlots of reasons, understanding what makes\nit successful and validating that those\n\n42\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.220\nthings are in place is what service\nvalidation and testing is about.\n\n43\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.234\n&gt;&gt; All right so Terry,\nwhen we start talking about those ideas,\n\n44\n00:02:33.234 --> 00:02:37.120\nlet's separate out those two concepts\ncuz to me it sounds the same.\n\n45\n00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.929\nValidation and testing, I mean,\nwhy is that separated out,\n\n46\n00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.208\nit seems like it should be one thing.\n\n47\n00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:47.933\n&gt;&gt; Yeah good point, I think the nature\nof the two words there, validation and\n\n48\n00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:52.958\ntesting, those two activities, is that\ntesting, certainly, is in the realm\n\n49\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.910\nof things where you go to specific\nthings and you evaluate the outputs.\n\n50\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.300\nSystem testing is a classic, right?\n\n51\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.870\nPerformance testing is a classic, right?\n\n52\n00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.320\nUser acceptance testing that they\nactually like what they're seeing in\n\n53\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.640\nterms of functionality.\n\n54\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.060\nThose are kinda classic tests but\nhow do you test that training was done?\n\n55\n00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.690\nRight, so\nthat's when we talk about validation.\n\n56\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.170\nIf one of the risk mitigation factors for\nsuccess is, make sure people are trained,\n\n57\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.290\nthen service validation can just simply be\na check box, people were trained right.\n\n58\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.260\nThat sort of thing.\n\n59\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.320\nIf a process needed to be updated, right,\n\n60\n00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.730\nthen your validating the process\nis fit for purpose, right.\n\n61\n00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.377\nSo, there's subtle differences expressed\nbetween the word validation and testing.\n\n62\n00:03:37.377 --> 00:03:43.890\nBut validation has a wider construction\nperhaps than testing that's more classic.\n\n63\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.740\n&gt;&gt; And the idea that we tend to see, and\nI think it's terms that you mentioned\n\n64\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.820\nnightell is that the service needs to\nbe fit for purpose and fit for use.\n\n65\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.630\nAnd so those concepts are really what were\ntrying to understand right now Is that any\n\n66\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.660\nservice that we provide for our customers,\nthat we wanna make sure that that happens.\n\n67\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.726\nBecause the overall goal and nature is to\nprovide a better product then something\n\n68\n00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:11.256\nthat they deem valuable to the business,\nright?\n\n69\n00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:15.613\n&gt;&gt; Exactly another way to consider this\ntoo is that your service is promising\n\n70\n00:04:15.613 --> 00:04:17.100\nsomething to the users.\n\n71\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.230\nYou mentioned utility and warranty.\n\n72\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.550\nThe utility side of this is they're able\nto do something differently than they were\n\n73\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.720\ndoing it before.\n\n74\n00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.540\nPerhaps they're doing\nsomething more quickly.\n\n75\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.160\nSo service validation could be measuring\nthe speed on the business side right,\n\n76\n00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.260\nare you actually doing it more quickly,\nright.\n\n77\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.720\nWe promise you functionality, we did you\nUAT testing, user acceptance testing.\n\n78\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.760\nIt looked like that's going to be the\ncase, but you could use service validation\n\n79\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.710\nto say yes in fact it is moving\nthe needle in the right direction.\n\n80\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.685\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's discuss some of\nthose different business values that is\n\n81\n00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:50.674\nessentially adds for us here,\n\n82\n00:04:50.674 --> 00:04:54.361\nwhen we put this into the service\nthat we're providing.\n\n83\n00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:59.222\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd think I'd ask the viewers\nhere to raise your hand if you've ever put\n\n84\n00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:03.303\nsomething in production that\nwasn't quite ready for prime time.\n\n85\n00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:07.727\nMost people raise your hand you could\nalso notice situations where we\n\n86\n00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:12.440\ntested it right I've heard that before\ntoo we tested it and it worked, right.\n\n87\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.281\nThen you go do deeper dive and realize\nwell, yeah the test was successful but\n\n88\n00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:20.303\nyou've tested it in an environment that\nwasn't a reasonable enough replica of\n\n89\n00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:21.828\nproduction, right?\n\n90\n00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:25.470\nSo, again, service validation testing\nwould take that learning moment and\n\n91\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.640\ntry to make some improvements.\n\n92\n00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.650\nThat's why it is elevated to a process.\n\n93\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.520\nYou have accountability for this, and\n\n94\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.440\nyou have ongoing improvement\nof this activity, right?\n\n95\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.337\nPutting out something that's not ready for\nprime time costs money.\n\n96\n00:05:39.337 --> 00:05:44.132\nThere are many studies that suggest\nthat fixing something after it's\n\n97\n00:05:44.132 --> 00:05:48.204\nlaunched is more expensive\nthan testing it before launch.\n\n98\n00:05:48.204 --> 00:05:50.070\nPlenty of studies that suggest that.\n\n99\n00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.390\nAnd that's not counting\nthe loss of reputation,\n\n100\n00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.150\nthe loss of good relationships with\nyour customers who are now upset right?\n\n101\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.600\nYou might lose business\nbecause of it right?\n\n102\n00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.938\nSo having a valid way to approach\nvalidation is really what SVT is about,\n\n103\n00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:09.503\nservice validation and testing and\nmaking sure its continually improved.\n\n104\n00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:14.714\nSo that customers gain faith, increase\ntheir faith in you as a provider and\n\n105\n00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:16.960\ncontinue to come back for more.\n\n106\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.880\n&gt;&gt; I think the ITIL word that you\nkind of used is the term confidence.\n\n107\n00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.710\nIs what it provides for\nthe customer as a value.\n\n108\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.820\nBut in that same sense then\nwhere does this come in?\n\n109\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.102\nIs this a guarantee of\nthe service being true or\n\n110\n00:06:30.102 --> 00:06:33.478\nare we talking about\nsomething less than that?\n\n111\n00:06:33.478 --> 00:06:35.777\n&gt;&gt; Does IT guarantee anything?\n\n112\n00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.541\nThese are complex systems.\n\n113\n00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.720\nI wouldn't come down to it, so no.\n\n114\n00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.160\nIt's not really a guarantee.\n\n115\n00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.476\nIt's assurance,\nIt's building confidence, and\n\n116\n00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:48.019\nyou could also identify\nthrough service validation and\n\n117\n00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:52.850\ntesting, you could also identify\nwith eyes open those risks, right?\n\n118\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.170\nSo you promising that it's gonna be\nhighly effective for 5,000 users.\n\n119\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.090\nYou do your testing and realize,\nthat after about 4,000,\n\n120\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.850\nit starts to tail off a little bit.\n\n121\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.870\nIs it time to reinvest and regroup, and\ngo back to strategy and get more money?\n\n122\n00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.270\nOr is it time to recognize the risk and\njust see, can we maintain and\n\n123\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.180\nsustain this?\n\n124\n00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.100\nAt least your eyes are open.\n\n125\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.602\nTo the reality that maybe\n5,000 was an over reach.\n\n126\n00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you resetting expectations,\n\n127\n00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:22.610\nre engaging with the businesses and saying\nhere's the reality of the situation.\n\n128\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.910\nWe're gonna launch it, we recommend\nlaunching because we're gonna be able to\n\n129\n00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.840\nget some value out of it,\nand then we're gonna work on\n\n130\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.310\ngetting those extra 1,000 users in the\nperformance up for those after the fact.\n\n131\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.799\nSo, even if you don't fix it.\n\n132\n00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:35.427\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; At least you have eyes open\n\n133\n00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:36.742\nof what's gonna happen, and\n\n134\n00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:40.500\ndon't just kind of turn a blind eye\nto the fact that the test failed.\n\n135\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.287\n&gt;&gt; Well Terry,\n\n136\n00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:45.515\nas business is sometimes resistant\nto the idea of change that we have.\n\n137\n00:07:45.515 --> 00:07:49.514\nAnd now you're saying that, hey here's\nanother process that you need to\n\n138\n00:07:49.514 --> 00:07:53.912\nimplement Ronnie, into your business here\nto make sure everything is going on.\n\n139\n00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:58.829\nWhat are some of the things that we can do\nto help maybe enforce that concept again?\n\n140\n00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.697\nWell, again, there's plenty of,\n\n141\n00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:04.618\nif you wanna find a Gartner group study\nthat says fixing things after launch is\n\n142\n00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:08.220\nmore expensive than getting them\nright before launch, right?\n\n143\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.990\nYou could certainly look at that.\n\n144\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.370\nI think, depending on\nthe business model you have, and\n\n145\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.980\nhow you provide services, it could be\nthat you're losing customers because you\n\n146\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.100\ndeploy things that aren't fully vetted,\nare not fully validated and tested, right?\n\n147\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.440\nI realize it costs time,\nit costs money to do it beforehand,\n\n148\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.890\neveryone understands that.\n\n149\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.390\nAnd it's project budgets or projects are\nnearing their end and your still trying to\n\n150\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.000\nget the functionality built, sometimes\ntesting just gets pushed aside, right?\n\n151\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.380\nThere's dangers in that obviously.\n\n152\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.010\nService validation and\ntesting is a discipline.\n\n153\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.846\nNot just in it's a culture,\nit's not just a process.\n\n154\n00:08:44.846 --> 00:08:49.390\nSo you're at the back this up with\nsome solid policies, good governance\n\n155\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.850\nbehind this and say, nope we will\nnot launch without verified testing.\n\n156\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.130\nAnd if the test doesn't pass,\nthat doesn't mean we won't launch.\n\n157\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.300\nIt just means we'll launch\nwith our eyes open.\n\n158\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:08:59.800\nRight?\n&gt;&gt;

Mm-hm.\n\n173\n00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:32.402\nRight.\n\n174\n00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Show us what your test strategy is,\nand then we will approve the project.\n\n175\n00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.690\nSo even the PMO, the Project Management\nOffice, could build in some safeguards to\n\n176\n00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.990\nsay a project will not be approved unless\nthere's a test strategy that's been\n\n177\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.170\napproved with the appropriate\nstakeholders, as an example.\n\n178\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.490\nSo you could drive it through\nproject management policy.\n\n179\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.580\nYou could drive it through just\nan overarching service quality policy.\n\n180\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.390\nWe will not launch without testing.\n\n181\n00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.540\nWe will never do that.\n\n182\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.680\nAnd then back these policies\nwith consequences, right?\n\n183\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.180\nThe consequences could be positive, right?\n\n184\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.730\nThe consequences of having a policy like\nthis could mean you invest more in testing\n\n185\n00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:09.690\nsystems.\n\n186\n00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.090\nI remember we chased the problem of our\n\n187\n00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.890\ntest environment not being an accurate\nreplica of our production environment.\n\n188\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.900\nThat's a very tough thing to maintain.\n\n189\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.270\nSo developing and\ninvesting in that type of technology,\n\n190\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:28.560\nmaybe virtual servers or virtualization\ncould help streamline the costs there.\n\n191\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.570\nSo again, having a discipline in place and\n\n192\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:36.570\nhaving a culture in place is\nnecessary to make this process work.\n\n193\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n194\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.400\nAll right, so now that we understand\nthat that policy is really what,\n\n195\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.510\nagain, seems to drive every process\nthat we've talked about so far, and\n\n196\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.145\nseems to drive this one as well, what are\nwe looking at when you start talking about\n\n197\n00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:49.930\nthe test model that we're\nactually speaking of here?\n\n198\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, test models.\n\n199\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.380\nYou've heard the word before.\n\n200\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.010\nWe've talked about change models before,\nwhere you have a pre-defined step for\n\n201\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.730\nhandling particular kind of changes?\n\n202\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.200\nWell come up with test models.\n\n203\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.850\nSo you don't have to reinvent\nthe wheel every time.\n\n204\n00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.120\nFor instance,\nhow are you going to test server patches?\n\n205\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.840\nHow are you going to\ntest data based upgrades?\n\n206\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.320\nThat's a bit bigger than a patch, right?\n\n207\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.060\nHow are you gonna test browser upgrades?\n\n208\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.450\nRight?\nSo again different models for\n\n209\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.200\ndifferent kind of changes, right?\n\n210\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.340\nSo you might come up with the strategy for\nhow you gonna handle browser or\n\n211\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.360\nupgrades by making sure\nthat a subset of all\n\n212\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.273\nthe application landscape is tested\nagainst the new browser version, right?\n\n213\n00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:31.560\nAnd that is a policy put in place and\n\n214\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.677\nyou enable that through a test molicies\nyourself gonna do this, right?\n\n215\n00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:38.620\nSo this word model is used\nthroughout ITIL to describe\n\n216\n00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.290\na pre-defined way to do something to\nhandle a particular type of something.\n\n217\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.100\nSo you can just take the word\nsomething and put it into that model.\n\n218\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.030\nChange model, request model.\n\n219\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.310\nYou can also use the word test\nmodel to come up with pre-defined\n\n220\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.750\nways that you're gonna\nhandle certain kinda tests.\n\n221\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.680\n&gt;&gt; Now when we start\ntaking look at testing,\n\n222\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.370\nhow important is this how I'm I gonna say.\n\n223\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.450\nHow important is ut\n\n224\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.600\nthat's what I should say,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n225\n00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay about the prospective of testing?\n\n226\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.070\nI know that what we've done in ItProTV\n\n227\n00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.940\nis not only to work on like the web\napplication, but then we realize\n\n228\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.600\nthat our membership was also demanding\nlike an apron of phone of some sort.\n\n229\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.390\nAnd so, even though we thought we\nknew what we wanted in the features,\n\n230\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.420\none of the most important aspects\nof it is that we actually did some\n\n231\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.780\nuser experience type of testing as well.\n\n232\n00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good call.\n\n233\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.820\n&gt;&gt; So what is the key there when we\nstart talking about the idea of testing.\n\n234\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.110\nIs it always just from my perspective or\ndo I need to consider everything else?\n\n235\n00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, I think you kinda answered\nthe question within the question,\n\n236\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.970\nin that there are different\nstakeholders' in the game, right?\n\n237\n00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.860\nIf you want to consider functionality or\nsomething that you wanna test.\n\n238\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.760\nHow the applications flows.\n\n239\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.500\nYou better get users involve\nbecause the software designer,\n\n240\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.970\nhe may have great ideas or she may have\ngreat ideas for how it should flow, but\n\n241\n00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.980\nthe business has ideas too for\nhow does she flow.\n\n242\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.710\nAnd you dive to consider what\nthe business wants, right?\n\n243\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.110\nSo, get the users involved.\n\n244\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.400\nThis not necessary easy.\n\n245\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.340\nWell you should get them involved in\nthat functionality side of things.\n\n246\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.830\nAnd then when you consider suppliers,\n\n247\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.560\nI mean you're gonna get\nthings from suppliers.\n\n248\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.430\nWhat testing do they have in mind?\n\n249\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:15.140\nIs their software rated at a level\nthat 5,000 people can use it, right?\n\n250\n00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.310\nIs it enterprise ready?\n\n251\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.810\nIs it only for smaller groups, right?\n\n252\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.240\nSo you've gotta work about\ntesting your suppliers too,\n\n253\n00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.740\nand check out their disciplines too.\n\n254\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.510\nEnd users, customers, the practitioners,\n\n255\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.250\nthe support staff is gonna\nhave to use this technology.\n\n256\n00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.710\nThey need to be, also, validated in\ntheir environment, right, as well.\n\n257\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.100\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe other thing that can also happen is,\n\n258\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.410\nespecially during this testing, is that\nyou might find out something very helpful.\n\n259\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.980\nIn which whatever you're testing\nit works well in one instance, but\n\n260\n00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.750\nnot in another instance.\n\n261\n00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.320\nSo may actually cause us to think\nabout some design changes, right?\n\n262\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.070\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n263\n00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.280\nWhen you consider that what you're trying\nto validate is not just the solution, but\n\n264\n00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.160\nyou're trying to validate a service,\n\n265\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.940\nby the time that gets translated\nfrom service strategy.\n\n266\n00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.310\nThrough service design and you're here\nin transition, testing something.\n\n267\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.540\nWe might actually be\ntesting the wrong thing or\n\n268\n00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.760\nnot the right impactful things, right?\n\n269\n00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.830\nSo regular communications back\namong these stakeholder groups\n\n270\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.640\nis gonna be critical in validating\nyour validation, right?\n\n271\n00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.260\nAre we testing the right things?\n\n272\n00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.370\nThis really comes to this idea\nof what success looks like.\n\n273\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.210\nService acceptance criteria is one of\nthe things that service validation and\n\n274\n00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.980\ntesting should be marching toward.\n\n275\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.990\nWhat does success look like?\n\n276\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.190\nDoes success look like all\nusers have been trained.\n\n277\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.260\nAll users, all UAT is passed.\n\n278\n00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.940\nUser acceptance testing has passed.\n\n279\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.850\nAll performance testings have passed.\n\n280\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.190\nIf that's what success looks like.\n\n281\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.600\nIf that's the success criteria,\nwrite it down.\n\n282\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.900\nCheck box, right?\n\n283\n00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.920\nClick them off.\n\n284\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.905\nAnd server valuation testing,\nwill then follow up with that.\n\n285\n00:14:51.905 --> 00:14:53.439\nYup.\n\n286\n00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:54.630\n&gt;&gt; Hi.\n\n287\n00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.850\nThe other thing that we also\nwant to consider, of course,\n\n288\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.760\nthen is some of the things that requires\nus not only to think about what we want,\n\n289\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.610\nbut the overall idea that business and\ncustomers, they have their perspective.\n\n290\n00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:11.530\nSo when we focus in on them and here it\nis, I'm providing the service, how do I\n\n291\n00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:17.330\nknow at what particular point that I'm\nbeing effective in my testing for them.\n\n292\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.385\n&gt;&gt; I think there's a couple\npoints of testing.\n\n293\n00:15:20.385 --> 00:15:22.160\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You're talking about utility and\n\n294\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.350\nwarranty earlier.\n\n295\n00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.140\nCertainly you wanna look\nat the functionality.\n\n296\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.840\nGet them involved in UAT,\nuser acceptance testing.\n\n297\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.740\nThey come and actually use the system\nbefore it launches, and make suggestions.\n\n298\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.730\nThey are involved earlier in requirements.\n\n299\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.790\nThey should be involved if\nyou're considered an Agile\n\n300\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.700\ndevelopment environment.\n\n301\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.441\nThey're also involved iteratively\nthroughout that process,\n\n302\n00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:44.514\nwhich is great, right?\n\n303\n00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:46.628\nThat is a method of validation as well,\n\n304\n00:15:46.628 --> 00:15:49.777\nis getting them involved all\nthe way through the process.\n\n305\n00:15:49.777 --> 00:15:53.938\nAnd then when it comes time to actually\nexecute on the tests There should be fewer\n\n306\n00:15:53.938 --> 00:15:54.631\nsurprises.\n\n307\n00:15:54.631 --> 00:15:58.980\nManaging those expectations of\nthe customer and the user is critical.\n\n308\n00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.520\nAnd also understand that the customer and\n\n309\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.420\nusers aren't the exact\nsame stakeholder groups.\n\n310\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:09.270\nUsers want high degree of functionality,\ncustomers probably want a high degree of\n\n311\n00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.920\nscalability and cost savings,\nand those types of things.\n\n312\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.650\nSo you're gonna have to manage those\ndevils in separate buckets while also\n\n313\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.136\nproviding holistic solution, yeah.\n\n314\n00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:23.010\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna assume this cuz\nwe've already talked about it.\n\n315\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.822\nBut just to make the point emphasis here,\n\n316\n00:16:24.822 --> 00:16:29.670\nthere is no real prescribed testing\nmethod that ITIL is recommending, but\n\n317\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.380\nthey're just saying, we need to make sure\nthat we include this idea of testing.\n\n318\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.956\nSo when we start to do this, one of the\nthings that you do point out is the idea\n\n319\n00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.678\nof simulating the environment\nthat things might be used in.\n\n320\n00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:46.729\nIs that an ITIL way of saying\nthat it has to be that way, or\n\n321\n00:16:46.729 --> 00:16:50.600\nare we just trying to\ngloss over something?\n\n322\n00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.850\n&gt;&gt; There is no have to in ITIL, we'll\nsay that, there's no have to in ITIL.\n\n323\n00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.860\nBut I think the best way to answer\nyour question is to validate a service\n\n324\n00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.790\nis not the same as validating a solution.\n\n325\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n326\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.870\n&gt;&gt; Testing a solution, testing a service,\nuse the verbs as you wish.\n\n327\n00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.000\nA service has a lot more moving parts\n\n328\n00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.690\nto consider-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n329\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.100\n&gt;&gt; Than the solution does.\n\n330\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.475\nSo having an holistic approach to\nservice validation is necessarily\n\n331\n00:17:16.475 --> 00:17:20.940\ngonna involve you, and understanding,\nare you delivering value as a service?\n\n332\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.170\nSo to get to the crux of your question,\nthe best opportunity\n\n333\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:31.650\nto validate the service is, are you\nmoving the needle for the business?\n\n334\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.980\nSo service validation can actually\nhappen after launch as well.\n\n335\n00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.820\nIf you've promised the users\nthey can do something faster,\n\n336\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.610\nmeasure speed before, implement\nthe services and measure speed after.\n\n337\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.540\nCertainly have some intermediate\nsteps of testing and\n\n338\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.560\nvalidation that you're anticipating\nthis is gonna be faster.\n\n339\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.745\nTry to simulate that as best you can.\n\n340\n00:17:50.745 --> 00:17:53.320\nBut there's nothing that says,\nyou can't evaluate this later.\n\n341\n00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.570\nIn fact, we'll talk about change\nevaluation in another episode,\n\n342\n00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.980\na separate process that\ndives into the details,\n\n343\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.310\nare we moving the needle\nin the right direction?\n\n344\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:07.047\n&gt;&gt; Now, Terry, I've learned something\nafter a while in a decade, plus in IT,\n\n345\n00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:13.246\nthat solutions that worked five years ago\nare no longer solutions that work today.\n\n346\n00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:17.945\nSo if I bring out an old\ntest from five years ago,\n\n347\n00:18:17.945 --> 00:18:21.008\nand I go, is this acceptable?\n\n348\n00:18:21.008 --> 00:18:24.411\nWhat do I have to do to ensure\nsomething like that is?\n\n349\n00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:27.708\nCuz, I might find out something that\nwhat was acceptable five years ago,\n\n350\n00:18:27.708 --> 00:18:30.170\nlike I said,\nreally we would kind of laugh at it today.\n\n351\n00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.327\n&gt;&gt; Part of testing, we'll get some\ndetails in this, part of testing and\n\n352\n00:18:33.327 --> 00:18:36.912\nvalidation is making sure you understand\nthe environment you're testing in,\n\n353\n00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:40.750\nand if that is changing, then obviously\nyour test gonna have to change.\n\n354\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.720\nI think what ITIL introduces as\na general lay of the land and\n\n355\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.550\ntest models gives you the high level\nof what we should be doing and\n\n356\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:53.140\nhow we go about it and then the devil's\nin the details of actual test cases.\n\n357\n00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.040\nYou need to certainly verify your tests\nare valid before you launch them.\n\n358\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.500\nAnd if the environment have changed so\nmuch,\n\n359\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500\nif the parameters aren't the same,\nif the environments aren't the same,\n\n360\n00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.700\nthen your test cases\nare gonna have to be updated.\n\n361\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I started to see\nthis every once in a while you do,\n\n362\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:11.240\nyou think that you're doing well because\ntime passes so quickly sometimes.\n\n363\n00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.910\nAnd you pull this thing out and\nyou go, we can't even use that anymore.\n\n364\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.600\nAnd now you realize that you're behind\nthe eight ball on the test itself.\n\n365\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.280\nAnd so a lot of times, in evaluating\nthose tests that we have to run,\n\n366\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.170\nwe always have to think about what\nit is we're doing right then or\n\n367\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.840\neven in the near future, right?\n\n368\n00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:33.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and to be clear about this\nin ITIL terms, in service design you're\n\n369\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.530\ngonna ask these questions, what test are\nwe gonna need, are they available, right?\n\n370\n00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.142\nAnd if you give that a short answer, say\nyeah, they're available, only to find that\n\n371\n00:19:42.142 --> 00:19:45.967\nthey're not accurate later on, then you're\nnot answering that question well, right?\n\n372\n00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:49.235\nService design wants to,\nagain, a higher stage or\n\n373\n00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:53.750\na precursor to service transition,\nnot higher necessarily.\n\n374\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.090\nBut in service design,\nyou're asking the question,\n\n375\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.810\ndo we have the test cases available,\ntest strategy available?\n\n376\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.190\nYou're gonna answer that question and\n\n377\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.680\nthen when it comes to transition\nyou're simply executing.\n\n378\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.740\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n379\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.800\nAll right, Terry, so\nnow that we've talked about the idea and\n\n380\n00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.110\nhow important it is that we have\nthe concepts of service testing and\n\n381\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:19.020\nvalidation in hand here, we need to talk\na little bit about service operations and\n\n382\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.170\nthe idea of continuous\nservice improvement.\n\n383\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.210\nWhat do we need to understand there?\n\n384\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, one thing you're trying\nto validate in service validation,\n\n385\n00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.037\nis operations gonna be ready for\nthis, right?\n\n386\n00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.768\nSo do you have the right skill sets?\n\n387\n00:20:31.768 --> 00:20:34.420\nAnd again, this could be, the validation\ncould be, are you training people?\n\n388\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.970\nAnd maybe it's just a check box.\n\n389\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.820\nWe trained the service desk staff,\n\n390\n00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.450\nwe trained second-level support,\nthose sorts of things, right?\n\n391\n00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.100\nThat's the validation part of that.\n\n392\n00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.840\nYou're looking at operations saying,\nare they ready for this, right?\n\n393\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.400\nAnd readiness could be training, readiness\ncould be numbers of people, right?\n\n394\n00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.940\nIt could be the number of resources.\n\n395\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.550\nDo they have the right skill sets?\n\n396\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.210\nDo they have the right tool sets?\n\n397\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.590\nDo we need new measurement tools for\n\n398\n00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.900\nthem to use to make sure\nwere measuring success?\n\n399\n00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.631\nKeep in mind,\nthe same example I used earlier,\n\n400\n00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:09.073\nif you're promising the customers\nare gonna be able to do something faster,\n\n401\n00:21:09.073 --> 00:21:12.784\ndo you have the means to measure\nspeed on the other side, right?\n\n402\n00:21:12.784 --> 00:21:14.072\nThat’s a method.\n\n403\n00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:17.096\nYou're gonna have to have that in place\nbecause you're not gonna be able to\n\n404\n00:21:17.096 --> 00:21:20.458\nvalidate the quality of the service after\nit's launched unless you have those kind\n\n405\n00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:21.580\nof measurements in place.\n\n406\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.070\nSo that's another thing operational\npeople are gonna be involved in.\n\n407\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.740\nIs documentation complete,\nare measurement methods in place, etc.\n\n408\n00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.459\nAnd then adding to that,\nanother life cycle stage,\n\n409\n00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:35.475\ncontinual service improvement, they need\nto be aware a new service is coming and\n\n410\n00:21:35.475 --> 00:21:37.935\nbringing in their scope of management.\n\n411\n00:21:37.935 --> 00:21:42.465\nAnd also, obviously be ready to come\nback into service foundation testing and\n\n412\n00:21:42.465 --> 00:21:43.655\napprove their process itself.\n\n413\n00:21:44.815 --> 00:21:45.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n414\n00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.785\nThere's a lot of concepts here,\njust right at the beginning.\n\n415\n00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:53.040\nWe start taking a look at this idea\nof the testing and the validation.\n\n416\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.540\nAnd so we wanna make sure that we\nwrap our heads around this, so\n\n417\n00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.910\nit's a great place for\nus to also take a break in this episode.\n\n418\n00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:00.630\nBut before we do,\n\n419\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.520\nwhat are some final concepts that\nwe need to learn or need to review?\n\n420\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it'd be good to\nreinforce the ideas of levels of testing.\n\n421\n00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.380\nYou can test at different levels.\n\n422\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.580\nIt could be highly invasive, if you will,\nwith the customers or lighter touch.\n\n423\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.190\nDo you wanna test at the service level or\n\n424\n00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.680\nat the component level and\nall points in between?\n\n425\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.410\nYes, those are the different levels\nof testing you wanna be considering.\n\n426\n00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.667\nSo taking a pause and looking at\nthose levels of testing could be in.\n\n427\n00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:31.840\nThere's a good exercise for it,\nit's called Levels of Testing.\n\n428\n00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.430\nAnd it's one of the handouts\nyou can download and\n\n429\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.870\nuse there, a great place to\nreinforce some of this learning.\n\n430\n00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, Terry again, thank you\nfor helping us to at least understand that\n\n431\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.880\nthis is something we are going to\nhave to dive a little bit deeper on.\n\n432\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.790\nBut we're gonna ask you bring that back\nin a part two, and thank you also for\n\n433\n00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:56.640\njoining us as we continue on through the\nITIL: Release, Control, and Validation.\n\n434\n00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.470\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n435\n00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.460\n&gt;&gt;

The team points out how validation and testing is adding controls that will be helpful in management, function and business value to the service provided.  SV&T helps in management by providing the steps needed to insure that we provide proper testing, according to the guys.  They emphasize that the result is a better product that functions well at the level we indicated and of course makes the product a valuable tool for the provider and a valued service for the customer.",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:15.690\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here IT PRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.060\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.280\nAnd today we're taking a look at ITIL\nrelease, control and validation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.360\nWe're specifically diving into a part two\non service validation and testing and\n\n8\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.910\nhere to help us is our ITIL\nexpert himself, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.280\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.500\n&gt;&gt; Good to be here Ronnie as always and as\nyou suggested, we're gonna dive a little\n\n11\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.030\ndeeper we've looked at service\nvalidation and testing as a whole and\n\n12\n00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.510\nnow we're gonna look into the individual\nactivities inside that process.\n\n13\n00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.140\nAnd to guide us through this, I'm gonna\nhave a graphic on the screen here to kinda\n\n14\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.330\nshow them in context,\nas we talk about each one.\n\n15\n00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.000\nFirst of all, obviously, the biggest\nrectangle there is the entire process and\n\n16\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.990\nthe scope that it covers, and\nthen in those individual boxes,\n\n17\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.720\nwe will take those one at a time.\n\n18\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.730\nStarting with planning and designing\nyour tests, actually coming up with your\n\n19\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.090\nstrategy for just what the design\nof these tests is gonna look like.\n\n20\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.980\nAnd remember, we're taking about\nservice testing and validation,\n\n21\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.310\nnot just solutions.\n\n22\n00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.910\nSo you might have to\nthink outside the box,\n\n23\n00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.930\nyour normal box of just\ntesting systems and\n\n24\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.350\nsoftware and look at testing the entire\nservice and validating the entire service.\n\n25\n00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.510\nSo process could be in scope, etc.\n\n26\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.950\nWhich means that design tests,\n\n27\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.850\nthat design task, could be a lot\nbroader than what you're used to.\n\n28\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.630\nBut after you've planned and designed it,\nyou gotta make sure you're gonna verify\n\n29\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.780\nwith the various stakeholders\nthat this is the right approach.\n\n30\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.860\nSo you verify that test design and\n\n31\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.040\nyou also dive into see if\nthere generally gonna work.\n\n32\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.010\nI remember, I've done some validation\ntests in the past where I get a test case,\n\n33\n00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.520\nI go to try to see of it's even going\nto work and it's not even close, right?\n\n34\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.550\nIt's got the wrong server or different\nnames in it or the wrong order of steps\n\n35\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.860\nand those kind of things and then it goes\nback to the drawing board for rewriting.\n\n36\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.790\nSo you're doing that extra little step\nthere after you plan to design the test,\n\n37\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.900\nyou're gonna verify the tests\nare actually fit for purpose, right?\n\n38\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.660\nThen you need to prepare\nthe test environment.\n\n39\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.320\nThese preparations should\nbe as part of the design.\n\n40\n00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.140\nSo if you need to have\na certain user identity or\n\n41\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.000\na certain screen in the application\nare ready for it, then\n\n42\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.070\nyou need to make sure the environment's\nready for those kinds of things.\n\n43\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.010\nThe parameters that need to be added\n\n44\n00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.460\nas the test is executed also\nneeds to be defined, and\n\n45\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.270\nyou're gonna set up that environment\naccordingly, get the right servers,\n\n46\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.790\nget the right systems, get the right\npeople, get them motivated there, right?\n\n47\n00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.340\nAnd then when you got those things,\n\n48\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.840\nthose first three steps are really\njust getting preparation.\n\n49\n00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.870\nNow you talk about execution, right?\n\n50\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.640\nPerform the tests, and\nas you're performing these,\n\n51\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.930\nyou might have incidents.\n\n52\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.740\nYou might have issues that\nweren't quite perfect.\n\n53\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.608\nThat might mean a failure,\nit might not mean a failure.\n\n54\n00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:56.903\nSo that's truly what this exit\ncriteria part means, evaluate,\n\n55\n00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:59.530\nexit criteria and report.\n\n56\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.470\nIf it's a small deviation, perhaps\nthere was a result that wasn't exactly\n\n57\n00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.690\nas intended but still acceptable,\nthen maybe you consider to pass a test,\n\n58\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.680\nthe test actually passed or\nit could be the opposite.\n\n59\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.290\nIt could be such a deviation that you\nneed to say nope, this test failed.\n\n60\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.410\nAnd what do you do with it?\n\n61\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.000\nThat's what this exit criteria means.\n\n62\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.950\nWhen are we gonna be done with this test?\n\n63\n00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.330\nYou report back, maybe you gotta go\nback to another step to redesign.\n\n64\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.194\nMaybe you gotta go back and say,\nyou know what, this is not working.\n\n65\n00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:32.186\nWe gotta redesign the service,\nnot just this exam or\n\n66\n00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.024\nthis test I should say, right?\n\n67\n00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:39.500\nAnd then as you approach the end,\nyou need to tidy up.\n\n68\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.620\nAll of these tests you might have\nexecuted, some passed, some failed,\n\n69\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.710\nsome did.\n\n70\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.940\nWell some were designed well,\nsome weren't.\n\n71\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.500\nSo your cleanup and closure is\nreally about getting all your test\n\n72\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.640\nenvironments back to where they should be,\n\n73\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.690\ngetting your test cases back to where\nthey're supposed to be, and rinsing and\n\n74\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.460\nrepeating for the next round of testing\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry,\n\n75\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.550\nbefore we move on from this\nparticular point here,\n\n76\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.060\nwhat is this upper right hand arrow\nthat talks about the change evaluation?\n\n77\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.786\nSo I understand the process where we\nmight, as we continue to move forward from\n\n78\n00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:15.455\nplanning and designing there, to verify,\nand then realizing you might have\n\n79\n00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.670\nto come back again to that if\nit doesn't work successfully.\n\n80\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.440\nBut what is that, there seems to be\nan out arrow out of the entire process.\n\n81\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.030\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n82\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.850\nI think we'll just draw our attention\nto the top of this graphic in general,\n\n83\n00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.720\non the left and on the right.\n\n84\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.750\nFirst of all, talk about this output.\n\n85\n00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Change evaluation is a process,\na formal process,\n\n87\n00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.370\nwe're gonna talk about later on.\n\n88\n00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.090\nBut, in some,\nwhat change evaluation is doing is\n\n89\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.690\nevaluating whether what you agreed to\ndeliver is actually being delivered.\n\n90\n00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.210\nService validation and\ntesting obviously is a piece of that.\n\n91\n00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.240\nIf you've done performance testing,\nfor instance and\n\n92\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.510\npromised that the service Could\nsupport 5,000 simultaneous users,\n\n93\n00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.990\nthe test results would be\npart of that evaluation.\n\n94\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.650\nSaying 'yeah, we passed all of\nour tests or we didn't, right?\n\n95\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.425\nThat's an output.\n\n96\n00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.700\nTo change evaluation these test\nresults are gonna be part of that.\n\n97\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.550\nIf you look at the inputs, then,\nif you go back to the graphic and\n\n98\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.710\nlook at the input side of this,\non the graphic itself,\n\n99\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.460\nit talks about authorize changes,\nimpact and resource assessments, right,\n\n100\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.330\ncuz something's gonna trigger\nthis process getting started.\n\n101\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.260\nAnd the starting of this\nprocess is either a big thing,\n\n102\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.730\nlike a big strategy,\na new service is coming your way.\n\n103\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.000\nSo service design package\nto be part of it, or\n\n104\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.620\nit could be more of\nthe run of the mill thing.\n\n105\n00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.150\nYou're tweaking an existing\nservices with minor changes, or\n\n106\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.880\nstandardized changes, right?\n\n107\n00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.270\nSo the inputs and\noutputs are certainly part of this.\n\n108\n00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.890\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, as we go through and start\nseeing this process here, is it important,\n\n109\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.880\nand this comes from your experience\nmore than just the ITIL concept here.\n\n110\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.870\nIs it important that we complete\nthe entire test itself?\n\n111\n00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.410\nIn other words, have it written out, and\nplanned out before we go through, or there\n\n112\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.990\nsometimes, where you just know a portion\nof it and then from that point you go,\n\n113\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.776\nokay I know what I need to do next,\nand try to design from there.\n\n114\n00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:06.520\nSo, in other words, do I need to have\neverything set in stone first or\n\n115\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.080\ncan I design that along\nthe way as things change?\n\n116\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.818\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly it's going to depend\non the urgency of your actions,\n\n117\n00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:14.953\nhow much re-deliberation you can do.\n\n118\n00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:19.453\nI'll say this, is that at some point\nin the change management process and\n\n119\n00:06:19.453 --> 00:06:21.630\nthis change being brought to life,\n\n120\n00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.530\nyou're going to determine what is\nthe strategy of the testing is, right?\n\n121\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.670\nIf you have to tweak the test cases\nalong the way, you're just basically,\n\n122\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.190\nif you look at the graphic again,\nyou're just gonna be in plan and design,\n\n123\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.570\nverify test iteratively.\n\n124\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.350\nAnd that's totally legitimate\nthat those go back and forth.\n\n125\n00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.760\nSo this is not necessarily your linear,\n\n126\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.420\ngoing all the way through in\nchronological order in lock step.\n\n127\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.380\nThere could be a lot of\nvariation among these steps and\n\n128\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.305\nbe iterative in that regard.\n\n129\n00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:48.584\nGood question Ronny.\n\n130\n00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.217\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nthere's a lot there,\n\n131\n00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:56.050\nwhen we start taking look at this idea\nof service validation and testing.\n\n132\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.710\nBut with all these many concepts\nthat we have, I think it's time for\n\n133\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.830\nus to make sure that we go back and\nrecover\n\n134\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.201\nsome of the different things that we\nhaven't,previous start ups like this one.\n\n135\n00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So let's go and start there.\n\n136\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.220\n&gt;&gt; Very good, and again, probably what\nwe'll look at as we've done in previous\n\n137\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.830\nprocess discussions is we talk\nabout what gets them started and\n\n138\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.290\nwhat value to the brand or\nwhat out push do they have?\n\n139\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.330\nAnd again if you look at the graphic here,\nyou'll see that what gets these started,\n\n140\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.140\nwhat gets the service validation\ntesting process started\n\n141\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.070\nis some sort of release plan, a test plan,\nor even a quality assurance plan\n\n142\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.230\nthat's dictated by other quality\nmeasures within the organization, right?\n\n143\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.220\nThe nature of trigger's gonna be\nbuild into the release policy.\n\n144\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.010\nWhen testing is required, and\nwhen is it optional, right?\n\n145\n00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.120\nBut certainly the release plan\nis going to kick it off, right?\n\n146\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.440\nAnd then you look at the inputs.\n\n147\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.785\nSo that gets us started with the inputs.\n\n148\n00:07:48.785 --> 00:07:51.408\nYou're gonna be service design packages.\n\n149\n00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:54.232\nBut this is the service charge at\nthe very beginning of a service.\n\n150\n00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:57.292\nThe portfolio changes,\nchanges to any CI that's in scope,\n\n151\n00:07:57.292 --> 00:08:01.552\nis going to trigger this off Release and\ndeployment plans, as we mentioned before,\n\n152\n00:08:01.552 --> 00:08:03.419\nrelease plans are gonna be in there.\n\n153\n00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.352\nAnd then understanding\nyour acceptance criteria.\n\n154\n00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.850\nWhat does acceptance look like?\n\n155\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.080\nWhat does success look like?\n\n156\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.950\nSo that's a document.\n\n157\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.940\nIt could be that performance tests\nhave to pass, UAT has to pass, and\n\n158\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.690\nthose things are all listed in\nservice acceptance criteria.\n\n159\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.842\nThat's gonna be primary\nguide to what testing and\n\n160\n00:08:20.842 --> 00:08:22.502\nvalidation you're gonna need to do.\n\n161\n00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.401\nRight.\n\n162\n00:08:25.028 --> 00:08:29.298\n&gt;&gt; So in the end, once we actually have,\nwhat triggered us to be able to do that,\n\n163\n00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:33.968\nwhat we actually basing this of, what are\nthe results that were normally looking for\n\n164\n00:08:33.968 --> 00:08:35.460\nin terms of output?\n\n165\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.240\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly your looking at the test\ncases them selves a test strategy\n\n166\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.950\ndocument, a test case and test reports,\nthat's the three big ones.\n\n167\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.830\nTest strategy leading to test\nplans those are verified,\n\n168\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.420\ntest cases actually executed and\nthen the reports against those tests.\n\n169\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.950\nDid they pass, did they fail?\n\n170\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.050\nWhat deviations were in there?\n\n171\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.850\nWere they significant, were they not?\n\n172\n00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.450\nAnd then some sort of improvement\nidea is probably going to come\n\n173\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.350\nforth as well because maybe\nnot everything is perfect.\n\n174\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.450\nMaybe it's improving the testing regime,\nmaybe it's improving the design regime.\n\n175\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.630\nSo feedback to the other processes and\n\n176\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.940\nto the other life cycle stages\nis also another output.\n\n177\n00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\ngoing back to the idea of ITIL and\n\n178\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.380\ntalking about it not prescriptive,\nbut providing the framework.\n\n179\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.660\nWhat we're not looking for\n\n180\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.060\nis a testing concept that ensures\nwe get the result that we want to.\n\n181\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.560\nWhat we're really looking for is actually\nsomething that says that we're going to\n\n182\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.400\nverify that this service is actually\nthe value that we need it to be.\n\n183\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.970\nAnd so that we can provide\nthat better service, right?\n\n184\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n185\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.440\nService validation and\nchange evaluation are closely related.\n\n186\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.450\nSo when you consider the test that\nvalidate that you're marching in the right\n\n187\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:54.450\ndirection with the service and\nyou're proving it with the actual test and\n\n188\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.160\ndata, that's gonna feed your\nchange evaluation process,\n\n189\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.920\nwhich we'll talk about in another episode.\n\n190\n00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.650\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n191\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:03.690\nSo along with that then, what are some of\nthe other things that we need to consider\n\n192\n00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.860\nwhen we start taking along\nthe entire life cycle of this?\n\n193\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, first of all it's gonna be a real\nchallenge to keep this information.\n\n194\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.040\nAll these processes head up,\nall these processes have data.\n\n195\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.040\nAll these processes have measurement,\nremember every process should be measured.\n\n196\n00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.650\nSo the nature of managing your information\nrelated to testing, is keeping up\n\n197\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.200\nwith reasonable scripts, reasonable test\nscripts in test cases are very valuable.\n\n198\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.640\nJust as an example, if you have a set\nof basic functionality tests that\n\n199\n00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.840\nprove that the application is meeting some\nbasic guideline, then as you continue to\n\n200\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.435\noperate that service to make minor tweaks,\nyou can dust those test cases off and\n\n201\n00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:47.270\nre-execute them to see if functionality\nis still behaving like it should be.\n\n202\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.050\nRight, so building these processes so\n\n203\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.600\nthat they're reusable and building\nthe artifacts the test cases in scripts so\n\n204\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.660\nthat they're reusable,\nis a big part of information management.\n\n205\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.710\nAnother key thing here,\nis we can automate.\n\n206\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.360\nThink about automated testing.\n\n207\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.700\nYou can certainly design test scripts.\n\n208\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.260\nThat can make testing a lot more\nefficient, a lot more reusable,\n\n209\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.390\nless error prone, etc.\n\n210\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.270\nSo, automation,\nkeeping up with the datasets, and\n\n211\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.790\nmarching toward continual\nimprovement through measurement.\n\n212\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.080\n&gt;&gt; The idea of automating really\ndoes sound like a good type of\n\n213\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.340\ncomponent to include in the idea testing\nbecause it ensures that it doesn't depend\n\n214\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.420\non your memory or my memory to make\nsure that the testing process goes on.\n\n215\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.710\nBut if I can actually run the script or\nif I can include some automation,\n\n216\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.270\nI'm just saying, it just needs to run,\nand if we can validate or\n\n217\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.210\nverify that all those steps are in there,\nwe're good, right?\n\n218\n00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.480\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, developing this discipline\nand this skill set can be time consuming.\n\n219\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.170\nActually executing tests\ncan be time consuming.\n\n220\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.100\nSo coming up with tool sets that make this\neasier to turn the crank each time you\n\n221\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.650\nneed them, such as automation,\nis a big boon.\n\n222\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's go onto the idea of measurement or\n\n223\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.640\nsome type of metric then, and\ntalk about the critical success factors,\n\n224\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.400\nas well as the idea of our\nkey performance indicators.\n\n225\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Good call.\n\n226\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:11.830\nAnd you may see a pattern here as we\npresent these processes, as we always\n\n227\n00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.880\ncome back to What does success look like\nfor this process, not just the service.\n\n228\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.460\nAnd that boils down to measurement.\n\n229\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.030\nUnderstanding what's critical for\n\n230\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.080\nthis process to be successful,\ncritical success factors.\n\n231\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.275\nAnd finding specific measurements,\n\n232\n00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.970\nkey performance indicators,\nthat indicate those.\n\n233\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.050\nSo if you look at the screen here you can\nsee some examples related to The testing,\n\n234\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.950\ntesting and validation.\n\n235\n00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.337\nObviously having understanding of\ndifferent stakeholders involved in their\n\n236\n00:12:41.337 --> 00:12:45.127\nperspectives, so you gonna an increase\nin roles and responsibilities,\n\n237\n00:12:45.127 --> 00:12:47.953\nyour gonna have more\ninvolvement with the customers.\n\n238\n00:12:47.953 --> 00:12:52.525\nSo, perhaps it's just percentage of\nservices that pass user acceptance\n\n239\n00:12:52.525 --> 00:12:57.670\ntesting, or that meet service acceptance\ncriteria, those types of things.\n\n240\n00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.350\nThe second one,\nencourage a risk management culture.\n\n241\n00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.440\nSo, identify number of risks,\nnumber of risks [INAUDIBLE].\n\n242\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.180\nSo have a formal process for\nhave you do this.\n\n243\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.421\nTesting and\nvalidation can point to weaknesses.\n\n244\n00:13:10.421 --> 00:13:14.343\nIt doesn't necessarily mean failure,\nit just means weaknesses,\n\n245\n00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:17.090\nwhich of course is\nan opportunity to improve.\n\n246\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.940\n&gt;&gt; I like how it says it there\nin the second one where it talks\n\n247\n00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.330\nabout the risk managed culture\nwhere information is shared.\n\n248\n00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.780\nA lot of times it's very easy to have the\ninformation not shared out to the right\n\n249\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.240\npeople that need it, so that we actually\ndon't get the consistency that we want or\n\n250\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.600\nthe service that we want in the very end.\n\n251\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.530\nSo the idea of sharing this\ninformation is kind of a key aspect\n\n252\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.000\nalso of the testing, right?\n\n253\n00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.300\n&gt;&gt; It is and\nlet me reinforce another aspect of that.\n\n254\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.160\nI appreciate you focusing on that one.\n\n255\n00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.050\nAgain, Ronnie's pointing to the last\ncouple of things related to risk.\n\n256\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.180\nIncrease in number of risks\nthat are on the risks register.\n\n257\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.680\nWhat that means is basically\na percentage of things.\n\n258\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.790\nSo if you encounter a failure and\nit was for\n\n259\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.470\na failure where the risk was known,\nbut not identified.\n\n260\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:02.870\nRight?\nThen an opportunity for\n\n261\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.390\nimprovement is well,\nat least if we would've known it.\n\n262\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.020\nSo again, failing tests that can be bad.\n\n263\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.330\nHaving tests that don't\nshow complete passing,\n\n264\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.070\nokay you still might want to launch but\nnow you've identified a risk.\n\n265\n00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.278\nBe transparent about it.\n\n266\n00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:19.260\nTesting and validation,\nservice validation and\n\n267\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:24.550\ntesting brings transparency to the reality\nof the viability of the service.\n\n268\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.680\n&gt;&gt; And there's no doubt that the idea\nhere is very clear that we need to have\n\n269\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.610\nall the data in front of us if we're gonna\nactually make very good decisions as well.\n\n270\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.710\nWhat about some of the ideas here,\nin a business sense,\n\n271\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.370\nof balancing the cost of the test\nas well as its effectiveness?\n\n272\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.100\nWhat do we need to think about there?\n\n273\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.070\n&gt;&gt; Good question,\nyou brought up automation.\n\n274\n00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:48.590\nThat's not necessarily\nan inexpensive option.\n\n275\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.720\nIt gives you some scale.\n\n276\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.120\nVirtualization, not\nnecessarily inexpensive but\n\n277\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.470\nalso makes it easier to replicate\nyour production environment and\n\n278\n00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:02.410\nmake it a more reasonable\nreplica in testing, right?\n\n279\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:08.800\nSo, having the ability to quickly\ndo that and to easily adjust your\n\n280\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.300\nstrategies toward the appropriate cost is\nwhat you can do if you get good at this.\n\n281\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.860\nBeing good at a process means you\nunderstand what the process costs.\n\n282\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.850\nUnderstanding what the process\ncosts makes wiser decisions easier\n\n283\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.700\nat the strategic level.\n\n284\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.710\n&gt;&gt; All right now putting back\non your hat from experience\n\n285\n00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.510\nhere,\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about the idea of\n\n286\n00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.340\nrisk a little bit, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.660\nThere are some organizations in which\nthey're gonna be risk aggressive.\n\n288\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.760\nSome are gonna be risk averse.\n\n289\n00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.520\nSome may be risk neutral.\n\n290\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:43.000\nHow does this really impact the idea\nof the way that the testing might\n\n291\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.230\nbe influenced in terms of\nwhat needs to be done?\n\n292\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.920\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI've certainly seen it play both ways.\n\n293\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.990\nI've seen, in the same organization,\nthe culture of risk management.\n\n294\n00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.492\nRisk averse, risk aggressive,\nI appreciate those terms.\n\n295\n00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:59.298\nI've seen it play out in both ways\nwhere we made a lot of change in\n\n296\n00:15:59.298 --> 00:16:03.210\na short amount of time when\nwe got risk aggressive.\n\n297\n00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:07.529\nSo if that is the value you're chasing A\nlot of change in the short amount of time\n\n298\n00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:10.800\nand you're willing to be in the motor,\nputting out fires,\n\n299\n00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.197\nbecause you're not completely managing\nall the risk before you realize them.\n\n300\n00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:18.190\nThen that can be acceptable.\n\n301\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:24.030\nObviously the other way is more\ncontrolled and more risk averse, meaning\n\n302\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:29.020\nyou're going to be more concerned about\nvalidating and testing as you go through.\n\n303\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.550\nUltimately it's gonna be the decision\nof you as you face your business.\n\n304\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.990\nWhat must you do?\n\n305\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.050\nIn most cases it's gonna\nhave to be a balance.\n\n306\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.780\nAll right,\nthere is no right answer to that.\n\n307\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.604\nI can't imagine an organization\nthat just issues all testing,\n\n308\n00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:43.869\nit doesn't make any sense.\n\n309\n00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; To me personally.\n\n310\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.540\nRight.\n\n311\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.480\nAlthough I've seen some development\nshops just roll things out, and\n\n312\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.870\nwe do pick up the pieces\non the other side.\n\n313\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.120\nI've seen that happen.\n\n314\n00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.636\nAnd it's painful.\n\n315\n00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:59.270\n&gt;&gt; So in the ITIL framework, they don't\nseem to align themselves up with any one\n\n316\n00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.930\nparticular type of risk manager, whether\nit's risk averse or risk aggressive.\n\n317\n00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.860\nThey just say just make sure it's\ndone in the way that it needs to, or\n\n318\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.389\nthey tend to be more risk averse.\n\n319\n00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:15.080\nITIL is certainly creating a framework,\nor proposing a framework control.\n\n320\n00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.686\nAnd that the IT organizations\nthat understand and\n\n321\n00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:21.789\nexert control at the right levels are more\nsuccessful than those than don't.\n\n322\n00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:24.265\nI think the best takeaway form this is,\n\n323\n00:17:24.265 --> 00:17:27.193\nwhat keeps every service\nprovider honest is,\n\n324\n00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:32.940\nare you delivering value at the right time\nto the right customers at the right costs?\n\n325\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.800\nRight, if you can do that and\n\n326\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.270\nbe risk aggressive, congratulations,\nthat's really good.\n\n327\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.480\nIf the business is behind it.\n\n328\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.800\nBut if you're working in a hospital, your\nIT organization is supporting a hospital,\n\n329\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.340\nchances are you're gonna be\na bit more controlled, right?\n\n330\n00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.660\nYou're gonna need to be that way.\n\n331\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.910\nIf you're an innovative location\nI understand, from reading\n\n332\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:58.120\nvarious stories and newspaper articles\nthat Google is moves forward a lot, right?\n\n333\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.350\nAmazon, web services moves forward a lot,\ntakes lots of risks.\n\n334\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.360\nBut I also know that just from experience\nthat they also have very stable systems.\n\n335\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.790\nThey have higher reliability,\nthey build those things in.\n\n336\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.539\nSo I have a feeling that even for\n\n337\n00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:13.175\nthose aggressive companies that\ncan afford to be innovative and\n\n338\n00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:17.164\nwanna press the envelope all the time,\nthat they also have controls.\n\n339\n00:18:17.164 --> 00:18:21.467\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's talk once again\nabout this term that keeps appearing or\n\n340\n00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.956\nthese two terms that\nkeep appearing over and\n\n341\n00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:28.200\nover in every one of our process here\nare the challenges and the risks.\n\n342\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.240\nSo with service validation and\n\n343\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.180\ntesting, what are the challenges that\nwe're really having to deal with here?\n\n344\n00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.610\n&gt;&gt; Well you, kind of,\npointed some already.\n\n345\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.550\nDo you slow this down?\n\n346\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.250\nHow much money is the right\nmoney to spend on testing?\n\n347\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:42.800\nRight?\n\n348\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.720\nThose are challenges.\n\n349\n00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.580\nThose are, again, a challenge as they\nrisk, it has a 100% chance of happening.\n\n350\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.180\nYou're gonna face this challenge\nof answering the question,\n\n351\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.600\nhow much money should I spend on testing?\n\n352\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.240\nPerformance testing and load testing,\nclassically very expensive, right?\n\n353\n00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.430\nAlso very valuable.\n\n354\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.660\nSo you're having some risks here.\n\n355\n00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:06.110\nDo we take the vendors' word for it that\nthis can really scale to 5,000 users?\n\n356\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.915\nThe vendor says it can go that way, right?\n\n357\n00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:11.395\nSo let's just take that\ngood word from our vendor.\n\n358\n00:19:11.395 --> 00:19:15.025\nTake a chance, not pay for\nperformance testing right.\n\n359\n00:19:15.025 --> 00:19:17.715\n&gt;&gt; Get bit by that snake a couple\nof times and then maybe say well,\n\n360\n00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:19.125\nI guess I'm not gonna trust the vendors.\n\n361\n00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:22.585\nI'm gonna have some sort of\nregime to take care of that.\n\n362\n00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:26.035\nI wish there was an easy,\npinpoint answer every time.\n\n363\n00:19:26.035 --> 00:19:27.305\nBut it always just depends.\n\n364\n00:19:27.305 --> 00:19:32.660\nAnd test takers, as you're taking your\nexams, you're going to get an idea\n\n365\n00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:38.360\nfrom within the scenario, whether it's\nrisk averse or risk aggressive, right?\n\n366\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.290\nA high growth organization wants to move\nforward fast, has limited resources in\n\n367\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.719\nterms of funds, may be less robust in\ntheir test service validation and testing.\n\n368\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.620\nITIL is going to have a predisposition for\nimplementing this process, and\n\n369\n00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.570\nmaking sure you have control.\n\n370\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nlet's head into that area of risk again.\n\n371\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.320\nAnd talk about it in contrast with the\nchallenges that we're taking a look at.\n\n372\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think one of the risks\nyou'll have is you don't have\n\n373\n00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.555\nthe right stakeholder involvement.\n\n374\n00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n375\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.210\n&gt;&gt; If you say.\n\n376\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.590\nAnd take a good guess that\nthe functionality, the service is\n\n377\n00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.870\nmeeting the requirements of the business\nbut don't do user acceptance testing.\n\n378\n00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.335\nThen you're risking,\n\n379\n00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:24.596\ndelivering something to the customer\nthat they don't really like.\n\n380\n00:20:24.596 --> 00:20:26.240\nBut it is, it's time consuming.\n\n381\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.258\nThe business doesn't typically wanna\nbe bothered with IT things, right?\n\n382\n00:20:29.258 --> 00:20:32.160\nThey don't wanna be bothered with the fact\nthat they've got to bring some sort of\n\n383\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.240\nrepresentative to the UAT meetings.\n\n384\n00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.500\nAgree to the test scripts.\n\n385\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.862\nAnd be there for\nthe execution of the test.\n\n386\n00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:41.890\nSo, making sure you have the right\nstakeholders is gonna certainly be a risk.\n\n387\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.934\nAnd not having enough resources\nto manage through your testing,\n\n388\n00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:46.810\nnot funding it appropriately.\n\n389\n00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.600\nNot having enough time.\n\n390\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.040\nCountless times I've seen projects\ntoward the end having to focus on,\n\n391\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.610\nall man power on delivering on time and\non budget and\n\n392\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.340\nthe compromise is we\ndon't have time to test.\n\n393\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.950\nThat's an unfortunate occurrence.\n\n394\n00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.120\nI understand the reality of it.\n\n395\n00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.770\nITIL would certainly say, you got to\nimprove it enough that you don't,\n\n396\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:11.700\nget front load the testing requirements so\nmuch, that it's not a surprise.\n\n397\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.380\n&gt;&gt; So in this aspect of talking\nabout the idea of risk,\n\n398\n00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:20.350\neven in the testing part of it, would\nthere, I don't know if ITIL would ever,\n\n399\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.480\nset, you say they are not prescript on,\nI shouldn't bring it on that way.\n\n400\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.030\nBut with something like doing\nthe iterative approach,\n\n401\n00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.640\nlike agile be helpful if you were\ntalking about managing risk like that?\n\n402\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.065\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I'm not gonna make any\nrecommendations about Agile or Waterfall.\n\n403\n00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:34.665\nITIL certainly doesn't go there.\n\n404\n00:21:34.665 --> 00:21:37.370\nITIL has an arm's length\nrelationship with it.\n\n405\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.790\nI can only offer my personal opinion\non it, and ITIL expert opinion.\n\n406\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:45.080\nCertainly Agile has advantages over\nregular customer involvement as you go\n\n407\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.340\nalong, delivering value sooner than later,\nright, I appreciate that approach.\n\n408\n00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.780\nI've never really seen a pure Agile\napproach, right, I've never really seen\n\n409\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.420\nthat happen, I understand the promise\nof it, and could recommend it.\n\n410\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.940\nHow that interacts with service validation\ntesting obviously is pretty significant.\n\n411\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:07.528\nSo if you are used to a waterfall\nformat of delivery and\n\n412\n00:22:07.528 --> 00:22:10.641\nyou're developing in an Agile environment,\n\n413\n00:22:10.641 --> 00:22:14.898\nobviously your service validation\ntests will have to keep up.\n\n414\n00:22:14.898 --> 00:22:19.459\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what are the, when we\nstarted talking about the overall idea of\n\n415\n00:22:19.459 --> 00:22:21.790\neverything that we've talked about.\n\n416\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.740\nIn release, control, and validation.\n\n417\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.820\nYou always emphasize that someone\nis gonna be the process owner.\n\n418\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.730\nSo in the idea of service validation and\ntesting and the process owner,\n\n419\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.510\nwhat are the responsibilities that\nwe're really looking at here?\n\n420\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, the over-arching theme here is,\nas you said Ronnie,\n\n421\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.230\nevery process should have an owner that's\naccountable for the value of that process.\n\n422\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.170\nThe quality of that process,\nmaking sure it's fit for purpose.\n\n423\n00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.500\nThe service foundation and\n\n424\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.100\ntesting process owner is necessarily\na quality management type of person.\n\n425\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.960\nAnd they're gonna make sure that\nthe right T's are crossed and\n\n426\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.640\nthe right I's are dotted as relates\nto testing strategy, test cases.\n\n427\n00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.990\nThe technology behind it all that makes\nit [INAUDIBLE] that makes it easier,\n\n428\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.820\nforecasting the appropriate\nlevels of involvement, etc,.\n\n429\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.740\nSo the process owner's\ngotta lot of stake in this.\n\n430\n00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.227\n&gt;&gt; All right, along with that,\nwe know that in small organizations,\n\n431\n00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:15.620\na lot of times things\nare going to be combined.\n\n432\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.350\nYou're gonna wear multiple hats.\n\n433\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:23.478\nBut one thing you do emphasize is\nthe idea of the process manager.\n\n434\n00:23:23.478 --> 00:23:25.883\nSo I'm making sure I'm saying it right, so\n\n435\n00:23:25.883 --> 00:23:29.140\nwe got to do process owner\nto process manager here.\n\n436\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:32.640\nBut you're actually saying that maybe\nprocess manager and another term,\n\n437\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.340\nthe release and deploy manager, these\nare probably not supposed to be combined.\n\n438\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.080\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nthe idea of keeping separate roles, right.\n\n439\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.220\nYou may have learned this from\nsoftware development life cycle.\n\n440\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.260\nThe person that develops\nit doesn't test it, right?\n\n441\n00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.290\nJust the same way when you're\nwriting a college paper.\n\n442\n00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.460\nSomeone else proofreads it, right?\n\n443\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.370\nBecause you will just glide right past the\nsame errors you made every time, right?\n\n444\n00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.664\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it's the same concept in place here.\n\n445\n00:23:59.664 --> 00:24:03.561\nTo have good validation, you need to\nseparate the testing environment.\n\n446\n00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:05.078\nForm the testing activity,\n\n447\n00:24:05.078 --> 00:24:08.754\nfrom the activity that people\nare doing in building and developing.\n\n448\n00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:12.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, the other thing that\nwe talk about is the manager,\n\n449\n00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.650\nthe idea drill a little bit here.\n\n450\n00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.830\nWhat is the role of\nthe practitioner in this sense?\n\n451\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Practitioners as it\nis with other processes,\n\n452\n00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.438\na practitioner is someone that is\nexecuting something in the process.\n\n453\n00:24:24.438 --> 00:24:25.800\nAs it relates to validation and\n\n454\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.340\ntesting, these could be the people that\nare actually executing the test, right?\n\n455\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.960\nShowing the reports,\ndealing with the evidence gathering for\n\n456\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.100\nthe test and making the reports available.\n\n457\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.490\n&gt;&gt; And you also mention now,\nyou talked about analysis here.\n\n458\n00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.260\nThat the very fact that even the\npractitioner here might do a little bit\n\n459\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.290\nof analysis.\n\n460\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.920\nEssentially helping us to interpret\nthe data a little bit more as well and so\n\n461\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.370\nall this is part of what we end up\nseeing in that service validation and\n\n462\n00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.590\ntesting as well.\n\n463\n00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.375\nSo Terry, having talked about all this,\n\n464\n00:24:57.375 --> 00:25:00.288\nit seemed like it's one of the most\nimportant things that we can do.\n\n465\n00:25:00.288 --> 00:25:03.680\nWhen we are getting ready to provide\na service to some customer is to validate\n\n466\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.278\nthat something is actually\ngoing to be worth their while.\n\n467\n00:25:06.278 --> 00:25:10.871\nAnd something that should be a good\nproduct that we actually end up being able\n\n468\n00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:12.750\nto provide for someone.\n\n469\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:17.290\nBut any last words on the idea here\nof service validation and testing?\n\n470\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.800\n&gt;&gt; I think I'd leave the viewers with\nsome options for how you can go in and\n\n471\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.280\nsolidify this knowledge.\n\n472\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.706\nAgain, the practice exams\nare available to you for\n\n473\n00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:27.197\ndownload are a great place\nto get ready for the exam.\n\n474\n00:25:27.197 --> 00:25:31.980\nAnd there'll be one or two questions on\nservice validation and testing for sure.\n\n475\n00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.250\nSo, hone in on those sample questions and\nyou'll get a good idea.\n\n476\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.160\nNot only what's in the test maker's mind,\nbut the type of approach you can take.\n\n477\n00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.030\nThere's a case study available for\nyou, that also and some exercises.\n\n478\n00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.450\nI'll show you here on the screen for\n\n479\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:50.820\nself study, you can look at the case\nstudy and develop a test model.\n\n480\n00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.520\nRemember a test model is how would you go\nabout testing particular areas, right?\n\n481\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.441\nYou maybe having a test model for\nservers is different than test models for\n\n482\n00:25:58.441 --> 00:25:59.370\napplications.\n\n483\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.908\nThere's difference for\ntest models for processes, right?\n\n484\n00:26:01.908 --> 00:26:05.430\nSo it gives you an opportunity to walk\nthrough then step through the paces\n\n485\n00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.320\nof actually taking knowledge and\napplying it to a specific case study.\n\n486\n00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.259\nAnd then finally, the option to go to\nthe discussion forum and ask questions and\n\n487\n00:26:14.259 --> 00:26:18.921\nget feedback from other experts and\nother students, it's a great place.\n\n488\n00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:23.258\n&gt;&gt; All right, now when we took a look at\nthat last slide there was one bullet point\n\n489\n00:26:23.258 --> 00:26:25.210\nwhere I wasn't exactly sure.\n\n490\n00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.690\nYou say work quickly and make assumptions\nwhen we're dealing with this,\n\n491\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.240\nwhy would you even put that on it?\n\n492\n00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Let me be very clear about this,\nthat is a recommendation for\n\n493\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.790\nhow do you go about studying,\n\n494\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.340\nnot how you go about implementing\n[INAUDIBLE], just to be very clear, right?\n\n495\n00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.510\nDon't work clear to make assumptions,\n\n496\n00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:47.050\nit's not an ITIL principle,\n[LAUGH] thanks for noticing.\n\n497\n00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:47.787\n&gt;&gt; I just thought it was funny.\n\n498\n00:26:47.787 --> 00:26:51.065\nI was like well,\nwe talked about testing and doing this,\n\n499\n00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:52.880\nwanting to make assumptions.\n\n500\n00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.200\n&gt;&gt; That's a study methodology.\n\n501\n00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.680\nThat's an exercise in methodology,\nnot an ITIL methodology.\n\n502\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.278\nVery good.\n&gt;&gt; Well, you had to try and do something.\n\n503\n00:27:00.278 --> 00:27:01.173\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n504\n00:27:01.173 --> 00:27:05.150\n&gt;&gt; Overall, though, do remember,\ndo take the opportunity in time.\n\n505\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.500\nTo make sure you go back and\n\n506\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.400\nreview the lessons that we\nhave been talking bout here.\n\n507\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.680\nTerry and myself and\n\n508\n00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.746\nmake sure you understand how important\nthat this process really is.\n\n509\n00:27:13.746 --> 00:27:16.990\nTaking a bit of time and\nunderstanding it and\n\n510\n00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:20.050\nmaking sure that in practice\nis getting implemented.\n\n511\n00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.560\nBefore it comes down to the customer\ninteraction with the service that\n\n512\n00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.510\nyou're having is gonna save you time and\nmoney overall in the very end result.\n\n513\n00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.550\nWhereas unless you're like\nwhat Terry was talking about,\n\n514\n00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.760\nyou're willing to do triage.\n\n515\n00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.940\nYou're willing to constantly\nput out fires afterwards,\n\n516\n00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.297\nthis is probably one of the best steps and\none of the best processes that you can\n\n517\n00:27:40.297 --> 00:27:44.540\ntake to ensure that your company is\ngonna provide the best possible service.\n\n518\n00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.850\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode in.\n\n519\n00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.170\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n520\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n521\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.073\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore ITIL release, control and validation.\n\n522\n00:27:55.073 --> 00:28:02.770\n[MUSIC]\n\n523\n00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.673\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

This goes beyond authorization into managing the execution of solutions, changes and elements we introduce into our IT environment, according to Terry.  They describe the nature, scope of the process as well as it’s business value to the customer and provider.  Terry also briefly describes the importance of policies to help with the process management.  They also define some terminology that is common in the realm of deployment management.",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.060\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're gonna be getting into ITIL release,\n\n6\n00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.670\ncontrol, and validation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.740\nWe're specifically going into the idea\nhere, of taking a look at release and\n\n8\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.690\ndeployment management and here to help\nus is our ITIL expert Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.170\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.554\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here and as we continue our\njourney we're getting a little bit closer\n\n11\n00:00:34.554 --> 00:00:37.683\nto the release part of things,\nwe've talked about change management,\n\n12\n00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.246\nwe've talked about service validation\ntesting and configuration management.\n\n13\n00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:44.575\nBut now we need to take a look\nat actually getting things done,\n\n14\n00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:47.980\ngetting things out to the environment\nit's intended to be in.\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.132\nTo start, what I actually do a little\ncompare and contrast though.\n\n16\n00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:56.398\nIf you look at the graphic here, comparing\nchange management from release and\n\n17\n00:00:56.398 --> 00:01:01.262\ndeployment and while a lot of process\nhave you know a start, an ending and\n\n18\n00:01:01.262 --> 00:01:03.640\nit just passes on to another one.\n\n19\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.900\nThe relationship between change and\nrelease is rather iterative it goes back\n\n20\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.860\nand forth at the varying stages\nin the lifecycle of a change.\n\n21\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.270\nSo as you see across the top\nthere with change management,\n\n22\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.350\nthey're doing the authorization.\n\n23\n00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.130\nSo one way to describe this is change\nmanagement is accountable and release and\n\n24\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.990\ndeployment management is responsible.\n\n25\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.490\nOr change is authoritative and\nrelease and deployment is executive.\n\n26\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.870\nThey get things done,\nthey execute on things.\n\n27\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.970\nAnd it does so, again, iteratively.\n\n28\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.250\nThese four stages or four phases of\na release you'll see going across there,\n\n29\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130\nwe'll talk in detail a bit later.\n\n30\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.930\nBut each one of those milestones,\nthe planning milestone, the building and\n\n31\n00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.220\ntesting milestone, the deployment\nmilestone, and the release and\n\n32\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.660\nclose milestones, each of those are saying\nhello back to change management,\n\n33\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.760\ngetting their approval to carry on there.\n\n34\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.556\nSo release and deployment,\nexecution change management authorization.\n\n35\n00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:02.131\n&gt;&gt; All right, so help us Terry,\n\n36\n00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:06.210\nwith the idea of the over all purpose\nwe know that change authorize it.\n\n37\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.906\nWe know the idea of executing it,\nbut why is this something that\n\n38\n00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:14.254\nwe really need understand in terms of\nthe process of managing this thing.\n\n39\n00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:18.240\n&gt;&gt; Once upon a time, the answer to\nthe question on a foundation exam.\n\n40\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.810\nWhat is the purpose of release management?\n\n41\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.299\nThe answer was to make\nsure that business and\n\n42\n00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.930\ntechnical factors are considered together.\n\n43\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n44\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n45\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.750\nAnd I think it's a great definition.\n\n46\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.770\nIt's not longer the official definition\nunder purpose of release management, but\n\n47\n00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.950\nit is a telling one.\n\n48\n00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.870\nIs that again, we're talking about service\nreleases, not just solution releases.\n\n49\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.140\nSo when you talk about\nreleasing a service,\n\n50\n00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.110\nyou're talking about all\nthe things that a service brings.\n\n51\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.670\nWe've reinforced this theme throughout.\n\n52\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.920\nA service is something\nbigger than a solution.\n\n53\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.970\nIt has processes.\n\n54\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.300\nIt has interfaces.\n\n55\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.800\nIt has policies.\n\n56\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.770\nAny of these artifacts or\nthese CIs could be the scope.\n\n57\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.890\nSo In a nutshell, what release and deploy\nmanagement is trying to do is to bring\n\n58\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.720\nchanges into the live environment\nsafely and predictably.\n\n59\n00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.610\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo\n\n60\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.330\nthe changes that we're talking about\nsometimes, may involve of course\n\n61\n00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.320\njust minor change that we've taken\na look at such as a version updating but\n\n62\n00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.070\nit could also include in the idea of\na new service that we might bring in.\n\n63\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.326\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it can be for\nthe big project level things.\n\n64\n00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:27.190\nI remember, we talked about change\nmanagement in the previous episodes.\n\n65\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.480\nChange management is for a minor change,\n\n66\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.280\nyou're changing the button\nfrom blue to red,\n\n67\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.870\nyou're doing a version upgrade of a piece\nof software or it could be for big things.\n\n68\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.550\nYou're bringing a whole new service in.\n\n69\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.324\nYou're replacing [INAUDIBLE]\nnotes with Exchange right?\n\n70\n00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:43.820\nThat's a big change.\n\n71\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.760\nSo, change management has in\nscope the big things, therefore,\n\n72\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.430\nreleasing deployment management\nhas it's scope the big things.\n\n73\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.315\nChange management has in scope\nthe small things as does release and\n\n74\n00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.120\ndeployment management.\n\n75\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.600\n&gt;&gt; Like everything else in ITIL,\nsome of the vocabulary may be loaded.\n\n76\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.320\nIs deployment at this point a loaded\nterm that we need to worry about?\n\n77\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.297\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's got synonyms.\n\n78\n00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:06.800\nI don't know how loaded it is,\nbut it certainly has synonyms.\n\n79\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.872\nImplementation, right?\n\n80\n00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:08.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n81\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.530\n&gt;&gt; Is another word.\n\n82\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.050\nLaunch, right?\n\n83\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.380\nDifferent words are used.\n\n84\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.090\nITIL certainly uses the word deployment\nto mean it's coming into life.\n\n85\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.560\nRight, it's no longer theory anymore, it's\nno longer just an idea, if you're actually\n\n86\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.180\nbringing it to life and it's going\nto be operational for people to use.\n\n87\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.760\n&gt;&gt; Now, in my experience in terms of\nworking as an assistant administrator,\n\n88\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.794\ndeployment of operating systems was very\nimportant in what I had done in the past.\n\n89\n00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:39.556\nAnd one of the things I always had to\nworry about was how was this going to play\n\n90\n00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:42.430\nin with existing services\nthat were available.\n\n91\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.189\nAnd so whenever we also talked\nabout that idea of deployment,\n\n92\n00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.661\nit was not only the notion of\nintroducing something new,\n\n93\n00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:53.229\nlike when we went from XP to\nWindows Vista or to Windows 7.\n\n94\n00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.763\nBut actually making sure that the XP\nmachines were still operational as well as\n\n95\n00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:58.550\nWindows 7.\n\n96\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.830\n&gt;&gt; And so in terms of deployment,\nthat's what I was thinking about this.\n\n97\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.120\nWe're really introducing\nmaybe even a new product but\n\n98\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.230\nmaking sure also the existing\none is still operating.\n\n99\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Good call.\n\n100\n00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.700\nYou are bringing things\nin to the environment.\n\n101\n00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.260\nWhat does the environment mean,\nit means lots of things.\n\n102\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.470\nMaybe you're replacing something at large.\n\n103\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.330\nMaybe it's going to be something added\nto the environment as opposed to\n\n104\n00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.300\nreplacing the environment.\n\n105\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.330\nAll those are factors\nthat must be considered.\n\n106\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.107\nAnd release and\n\n107\n00:05:23.107 --> 00:05:27.736\ndeployment management is where a bulk of\nthe on the ground consideration happens.\n\n108\n00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:31.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, so help us to describe the\nscope then when we start talking about,\n\n109\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.810\nwe know there's going\nto be technical scopes.\n\n110\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.370\nBut what would we really talk about\nin the overall process of this?\n\n111\n00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, again talking about big\nthings, talking about small things.\n\n112\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.580\nTalking about technical things,\ntalking about documents.\n\n113\n00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.830\nYou recall when we were learning\nabout change management and\n\n114\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.820\nwhen we were learning about service\nasset configuration management.\n\n115\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.670\nWe went to the trouble of defining\nwhat a configuration item was.\n\n116\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.564\nAnd a CI is any asset that you care about,\n\n117\n00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:59.870\nthat helps you manage your service, and\nyou want to keep that asset under control,\n\n118\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.540\nwhich means it's a broad construct,\nit's a broad concept in Itel terminology.\n\n119\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.230\nSo, if you want to change an item of code,\nif you want to change a server,\n\n120\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.040\nif you want to change\nan entire application, right?\n\n121\n00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.440\nWe talked about release units.\n\n122\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.930\nWe'll talk about that again momentarily.\n\n123\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.970\nThis item that you're\nchanging is in scope.\n\n124\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.610\nIt could be a physical asset.\n\n125\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.323\nIt could be a document.\n\n126\n00:06:20.323 --> 00:06:22.550\nIt could be a process, etc.\n\n127\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.680\n&gt;&gt; Does that even go into\nthe realm of virtual assets?\n\n128\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.180\nEspecially today, since we're in\nthe virtual machine type of environment.\n\n129\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Of course it's an aspect\nthat has to be governed.\n\n130\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.240\nHow you account for these virtual aspects,\neven how you account for\n\n131\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.360\nthings that are outside\nof your control somewhat.\n\n132\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.086\nThe service that might be provided\nto you by a third-party supplier.\n\n133\n00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.910\nWe talk about cloud computing or\nsoftware as a service.\n\n134\n00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.470\nYou have a concern about how\nthose things are managed.\n\n135\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.900\nYou don't control them directly, but\nyou certainly have interfaces with those.\n\n136\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.270\nSo, we're also talking about those\ninterfaced components, as well.\n\n137\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.945\n&gt;&gt; Well, since ITIL really also focuses in\non the idea of services bringing some type\n\n138\n00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:01.556\nof value.\n\n139\n00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:05.135\nWhat is the overall business value that\nwe're expecting from the idea here of\n\n140\n00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:06.910\nrelease and deployment management?\n\n141\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.080\n&gt;&gt; In the absences of having a process for\nmethodically.\n\n142\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.480\nAnd in a controlled way bringing change\ninto life, you are living at risk.\n\n143\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.210\nSo one business value is\nyou're bringing change\n\n144\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.960\nwith a minimal amount of\ndisruption as possible right.\n\n145\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.410\nYou're not causing harm.\n\n146\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.820\nAgain consider the Hippocratic\noath that doctors take.\n\n147\n00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.880\nFirst thing do no harm,\nlet's make sure we're adding value to it.\n\n148\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.950\nGetting good at this means you can do so\nquickly nimbly and cost effectively.\n\n149\n00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.269\nSo if you get good at your regimented\napproach of release and deployment\n\n150\n00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:44.551\nmanagement, you can be more responsive to\nthe business as their business change.\n\n151\n00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:48.236\nCuz the business has never static,\nit rarely stays in one place,\n\n152\n00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:49.643\nthe business is moving.\n\n153\n00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:52.377\nTherefore the IT service provider\nneeds to be moving as well.\n\n154\n00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.596\nRelease and deployment management,\nif you're good at it,\n\n155\n00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:58.813\nyou can be as nimble as the business\nwants to be Alright, so,\n\n156\n00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:03.042\nas we started seeing the other process\nthat really what tends to drive them seems\n\n157\n00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.960\nto be policies that we have in place\nas we start implementing them.\n\n158\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.890\nIs the same through gonna be true\nhere in terms of the deployment.\n\n159\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Well that's good, Ronnie.\n\n160\n00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.370\nI think what you're seeing,\nthe recurring pattern here,\n\n161\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.532\nis that every process doesn't\nstand on an island all by itself.\n\n162\n00:08:16.532 --> 00:08:20.270\nNot only they integrate with each other,\nbut they're bolstered by policy, right?\n\n163\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.940\nYou need to have appropriate governance\nin place to make sure that these\n\n164\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.370\nprocesses have merit and meet, right both.\n\n165\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.980\nSo, basically what you're doing with\nthe release and deployment policy\n\n166\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.850\nis just reenforcing the idea that we're\ngoing to follow methodical approach.\n\n167\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.260\nWe need to be agile while also\nmaintaining stability, right?\n\n168\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.690\nAnd getting that right balance.\n\n169\n00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.350\nSo policies going to be in\ngendering that principle and\n\n170\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.340\nenforcing that principle through out this\nprocess which is the point management.\n\n171\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.300\nAnd it's probably something you're gonna\nset at the overall service provider.\n\n172\n00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.900\nNot per service.\n\n173\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.920\nYou're gonna have policies\nthat affect everyone.\n\n174\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.080\nAnd maybe as things like,\nhow often do you release?\n\n175\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.290\nJust managing the workforce.\n\n176\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.130\nDo you jump everytime the customer\nsays I want something?\n\n177\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.690\nOr do you try to channel those\nrequest into digestible bits overtime?\n\n178\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.990\nFor instances having eight releases\na year, four releases a year.\n\n179\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.460\nThree of which are minor, one is major.\n\n180\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.040\nThat's the kind of thing policy\nkinda set in place, right?\n\n181\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.509\nAnd to have a standard approach\nto doing this across the service\n\n182\n00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:22.720\norganization just that\nexpectation of how the customer\n\n183\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.730\nshould engage with the service\nprovider for ongoing improvements.\n\n184\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, along with them,\nthat raises a logical question for us.\n\n185\n00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.910\nSince we've been talking\nabout change management and\n\n186\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.050\nreally the idea of providing the services\nthat we've been talking along,\n\n187\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.900\nthey do seem to indicate that,\nwe're adding something new,\n\n188\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.660\nwe're changing something in the process,\nwe're doing a lot of things.\n\n189\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.630\nBut not every change is designed\nto always help us to do that, but\n\n190\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.600\nthen when we implement changes in that\nenvironment, it could change everything,\n\n191\n00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.840\nand sometimes we just\nneed it to be stable.\n\n192\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.560\nSo is it here in the policy that we\nwould say one of the top considerations\n\n193\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.330\nis about that idea of stability.\n\n194\n00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.260\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nrecall we just discussed in a previous\n\n195\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.530\nepisode service foundation and testing,\nif you have a solid testing regime\n\n196\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.160\nthat supports your release and\ndeployment management regime.\n\n197\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160\nThen they'll work very closely together.\n\n198\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.990\nOne of the phases of release and\ndeployment is testing.\n\n199\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.070\nThat's a handover to another process.\n\n200\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo you're definitely showing,\n\n201\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.230\nrelease policy can say, we will release\nnothing without tests, for instance.\n\n202\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.690\nIt's not defining the test,\n\n203\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.390\nit's not talking about how\nrobust the test has to be.\n\n204\n00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.658\nIt's just saying carte blanche we will\nnot release anything unless it's tested,\n\n205\n00:10:30.658 --> 00:10:31.515\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n206\n00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.660\n&gt;&gt; And then you can manage\nback steps instead of by rule.\n\n207\n00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.642\n&gt;&gt; Well that seems to be logical, so\nTerry help us to get started here.\n\n208\n00:10:38.642 --> 00:10:42.080\nWe wanna talk about some of\nthe basic terminology here.\n\n209\n00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.090\nSo start us off with the idea what you\ncall a release unit and help us out.\n\n210\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we first saw this we were\ntalking about configuration management.\n\n211\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.670\nWe were talking about\npoints of accountability.\n\n212\n00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.800\nWhat can be changed, and who are you\ngonna put in charge of that change?\n\n213\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.770\nWe broke down a system into interfaces,\ninto programs,\n\n214\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.070\ninto modules you may recall.\n\n215\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.420\nDetermining these release\nunits is basically,\n\n216\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.100\nis fundamentally just determining\na point of accountability.\n\n217\n00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.570\nSo let's take an application for instance.\n\n218\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.590\nLet's take email as an example.\n\n219\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.480\nEmail as a service,\n\n220\n00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.430\nhas underneath it servers that need to\noperate, databases that need to operate.\n\n221\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.000\nIdentity management services and\nsystems that need to operate,\n\n222\n00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.600\ncuz people need to log in and\nget access to their email.\n\n223\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.290\nSo there' lots of under\nimpending parts here, and\n\n224\n00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.940\neach one of those could be\na considerable release unit.\n\n225\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.540\nRight?\n\n226\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.100\nOr do you get down to the module level,\nif you're talking about software?\n\n227\n00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.870\nDo you get all the way\ndown to the module level?\n\n228\n00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.699\nAgain this is the decision\nyou make at [INAUDIBLE]\n\n229\n00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:45.596\nservice configuration management.\n\n230\n00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:46.280\nRelease and\n\n231\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.020\ndeployment management is going to be\ndeployed at those points of interest.\n\n232\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.110\nDoes that make sense?\n\n233\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.020\n&gt;&gt; It sure does.\n\n234\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.550\nThe idea of actually making sure that we\nunderstand where that's actually done and\n\n235\n00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.810\nthe scope of that is done is kind\nof key because we don't wanna be so\n\n236\n00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.160\ngeneralized that we're not exactly\nsure where it's implemented.\n\n237\n00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.060\nBut we want the idea of control to\nbe in place and understand that too.\n\n238\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.990\nNow the other thing that we might\nhave is where you have what's called\n\n239\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.830\na release package.\n\n240\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.910\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n241\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.080\nA release package.\n\n242\n00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.440\nLet me just paint a little picture for\nyou here.\n\n243\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.940\nLet's say in change management,\n\n244\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.990\nremember that process has\na Change Advisory Board, and that CAB,\n\n245\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.830\nChange Advisory Board, gets ten requests\nfor changes in a particular change cycle.\n\n246\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.200\nMaybe 12, a full dozen,\nwe'll call it a full dozen changes.\n\n247\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.460\nThey look at it and say well, these two\nare pipe dreams, never gonna happen,\n\n248\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.230\nwe reject those right now, right?\n\n249\n00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:40.460\nTen are possible, change management's\nsaying, they just want more information.\n\n250\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.710\nSo change management authorizes,\nagain passes down to release and\n\n251\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.440\ndeployment, plan this out for us.\n\n252\n00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:51.190\nWhat do these ten changes look like in\nterms of complexity, risk, cost, etc.\n\n253\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.800\nAll these management then determines\nthat let's say five of these ten\n\n254\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.340\nare actually enhancements and\nthey fall into that model.\n\n255\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.602\nThese other five are break fixed things\nand they fall into that kinda model,\n\n256\n00:13:03.602 --> 00:13:04.140\nright?\n\n257\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.560\nSo, now all these management\nhas defined two packages,\n\n258\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.010\neach with five changes, right?\n\n259\n00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:15.150\nNow for the rest, the life cycle of that\npackage lifecycle of individual changes,\n\n260\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.734\nyou now have a different\ndiscrete thing to manage.\n\n261\n00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:23.770\nIt happens to be a changed, it happens to\nbe a package that has five changes in it.\n\n262\n00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.360\nRight?\nSo,\n\n263\n00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.070\nthat goes back up to change management,\nit says,\n\n264\n00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.460\nwe like this plan, implement the plan.\n\n265\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.650\nWe authorized the building and\ntesting, right?\n\n266\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.190\nSo another iteration of that package.\n\n267\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.950\nSo these packages\nare discrete collections of\n\n268\n00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.400\nmultiple units if you will being changed.\n\n269\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.330\nAnd they're tested together.\n\n270\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.790\nI'll give you an example of why you\nconsider the package as a discrete unit.\n\n271\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.080\nYou may have experienced in your\nown operations at some point.\n\n272\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.040\nHave you ever tested one\nchange successfully?\n\n273\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.300\nImplement another change,\ntest it, it's also successful.\n\n274\n00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:07.420\nNot realizing that the second change\nbroke something in the first one.\n\n275\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:07.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n276\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.510\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n277\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.150\nThat happens.\n\n278\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That happens,\n\n279\n00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.780\nso that's why is introducing\nthis idea of a package.\n\n280\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.810\nIt's a discreet collection of things,\nof changes, right, and\n\n281\n00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.170\nthat package is tested as a whole,\nnot as individual pieces, right?\n\n282\n00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.460\nConstituent parts.\n\n283\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.280\nSo recent Deployment Management\nis responsible for\n\n284\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.190\nthe integrity of these packages.\n\n285\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.000\nSo if later on in the development\nof this they realize\n\n286\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.630\none of these changes is too complex or\nit's not gonna be viable,\n\n287\n00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.760\nthen they may remove it from the package,\nright?\n\n288\n00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.550\nAnd then re-scope it back to\nchange management saying,\n\n289\n00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.560\ninstead of having five changes,\nthis pack is gonna have four.\n\n290\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.030\nDo you approve it in that way?\n\n291\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.280\nRight?\nAgain, going back and\n\n292\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.830\ngetting authorization for\nthe change management,\n\n293\n00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.150\nfolks, to make sure it's viable.\n\n294\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, so as we start to take a\nlook then at the idea of trying to deploy\n\n295\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.570\nanything in terms of a service.\n\n296\n00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.880\nWhat are some of the considerations and\n\n297\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.665\noptions that we need to\nthink about when we do this?\n\n298\n00:15:06.665 --> 00:15:10.380\nCuz sometimes you might say we need\nto phase this change in over time,\n\n299\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.900\nor we can release everything at one time.\n\n300\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.200\nWhat are we taking a look\nat here in considerations?\n\n301\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question and\n\n302\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.020\nlet's have a look at the graphic\nhere to kinda explain it, this is\n\n303\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.670\nbrings to the words to us, and also gives\nus some pretty pictures to look at.\n\n304\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.180\nBig Bang simply means you roll it\nout to everybody at the same time.\n\n305\n00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.650\nEveryone gets the same\nchange at the same time.\n\n306\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.870\nWhen, as an example, we were implementing\nthe big change from Lotus Notes\n\n307\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.945\nto exchange, we decided the Big Bang\napproach was not gonna be the approach.\n\n308\n00:15:38.945 --> 00:15:41.305\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At first.\n\n309\n00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:42.030\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.965\n&gt;&gt; So we only rolled out\nexchange to part of the users.\n\n311\n00:15:45.965 --> 00:15:49.308\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're doing about 10,000 users a week,\n\n312\n00:15:49.308 --> 00:15:49.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n313\n00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.337\n&gt;&gt; Week on week, until over two or three\nmonths, we got everyone deployed, right?\n\n314\n00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:57.719\nThe problem with that is you're\nmaintaining two systems for a while.\n\n315\n00:15:57.719 --> 00:15:59.881\nWe had noticed no exchange for awhile.\n\n316\n00:15:59.881 --> 00:16:03.970\nSo we had to manage That complication,\nright?\n\n317\n00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:08.580\nThe advantage however was, one, just\nthe work load of getting everything up.\n\n318\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.890\nThat's a lot of work to do for some folks.\n\n319\n00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.790\nThe training aspects of it,\nbringing people slowly along.\n\n320\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.310\nYou could also use this\nas a way to kinda test.\n\n321\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.520\nYou put it out, you learn some lessons, so\n\n322\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.720\nthat the next phase doesn't\nhave as many problems.\n\n323\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.100\nAnd then the third phase is even better,\nand by the time you roll this out,\n\n324\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.280\nyou're mitigating your risks\nacross different phases that way.\n\n325\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.130\nSo, again, iTel is not making\na recommendation for which to use.\n\n326\n00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.010\nOne is got some advantages over the other,\nin some cases.\n\n327\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.310\nThe other one has\nadvantages in other cases.\n\n328\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.030\nPhased is risk averse.\n\n329\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.252\nBig Bang is let's get this thing done\ncould be very efficient all right.\n\n330\n00:16:46.252 --> 00:16:49.535\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terri also on your slide\nthere, we've got an acronym check.\n\n331\n00:16:49.535 --> 00:16:52.117\n&gt;&gt; Good. Good call. &gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So\ngo ahead and do that all right,\n\n332\n00:16:52.117 --> 00:16:55.009\nso pattern of business activity,\nhelp us to define that.\n\n333\n00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:59.736\n&gt;&gt; Sure, generically speaking, a pattern\nof business activity is understanding how\n\n334\n00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:03.250\nthe customers use this\nparticular service and when.\n\n335\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.550\nSome classic examples are, for\ninstance, financial reporting happens\n\n336\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.180\nin most organizations in the United States\nanyway, at the end of the month, right?\n\n337\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.390\nThere's gonna be some financial form, and\n\n338\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.420\nI believe it's a government\nregulation that they're doing so.\n\n339\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.510\nMonthly reporting for\na publicly traded company.\n\n340\n00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.510\nRight, so therefore, there's a very\nspecific pattern to business activity.\n\n341\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.960\nThe financial applications are heavily\nimpacted at the end of the month.\n\n342\n00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.360\nSo you might wanna avoid deploying\nsomething new at the end of the month,\n\n343\n00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:29.873\nright?\n\n344\n00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:32.170\nYou might wanna have change freezes,\nright?\n\n345\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.970\nSo you're not changing anything at\nparticular critical periods, right?\n\n346\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.290\nSo patterns of business\nactivity If you discern those,\n\n347\n00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.360\ngives you some intelligence\non your deployment strategy.\n\n348\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, along with that, though,\nthere's a couple of other terms and\n\n349\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.810\na nice little graphic that you have.\n\n350\n00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.300\nWhen we talk about Push and Pull.\n\n351\n00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.540\nNow I've seen these options such as\nin an app on a phone before, but\n\n352\n00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.480\nwhat are we talking about\nin terms of a service here?\n\n353\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.265\n&gt;&gt; Well, good point.\n\n354\n00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:58.256\nAgain if you show the graphic here.\n\n355\n00:17:58.256 --> 00:18:02.784\nI think what we're talking about here\nis your nature of, If basically,\n\n356\n00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:04.910\nsoftware deployment.\n\n357\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.790\nCan someone decide to\ninstall it as they wish?\n\n358\n00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:09.840\nThat's the pull.\n\n359\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.920\nOr do you push it onto the desktop?\n\n360\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.080\nThat's the classic example.\n\n361\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.335\nWhile we talk about service versus\nsolutions, solutions are part of service.\n\n362\n00:18:20.335 --> 00:18:21.060\nIt's a super set.\n\n363\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.065\nSo it can still apply there.\n\n364\n00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:27.557\nBut we had examples where\neven services themselves\n\n365\n00:18:27.557 --> 00:18:31.213\nprocess in particular process could be,\n\n366\n00:18:31.213 --> 00:18:37.205\nyou can continue to use your current\nprocess but this is the new one.\n\n367\n00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:39.199\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right when you're ready you can\n\n368\n00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:43.166\nstart using this process so it wasn't\neven a solution it was process right.\n\n369\n00:18:43.166 --> 00:18:47.833\nFor instance we had a process by\nwhich you could get your PowerPoint\n\n370\n00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:50.928\npresentations converted to e-learning.\n\n371\n00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:54.365\nThere was an existing process a lot\nof people liked and wanted to use but\n\n372\n00:18:54.365 --> 00:18:56.950\nwe introduced the new automated one right?\n\n373\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.940\nWe offered both so that was a pull,\npush type situation.\n\n374\n00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.930\nAt some point you might decide to for\ninterim periods you allow for\n\n375\n00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:11.290\na pull and not push it to everybody, but\nthen put a line in the sand somewhere,\n\n376\n00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.590\nyou can use both services up\nuntil March of next year.\n\n377\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.250\nBut after March,\neveryone must use this, right?\n\n378\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.210\nSo then it becomes a push.\n\n379\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.314\nAgain, a deployment strategy\nyou could consider.\n\n380\n00:19:21.314 --> 00:19:28.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and another deployment strategy,\nit sounds logical when I read it here.\n\n381\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.170\nThe idea of automation versus manual.\n\n382\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.760\nIs it exactly like it sounds?\n\n383\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n384\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n385\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.770\n&gt;&gt; You can automate it or\nyou can make it manual.\n\n386\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.670\nTypically for software distributions,\nwe're not talking really about service\n\n387\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.650\ndistribution here, but\nsoftware distribution.\n\n388\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:46.366\nHow are you going to automate the\ndeployment of software obviously is a lot\n\n389\n00:19:46.366 --> 00:19:47.592\nmore functional.\n\n390\n00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:51.344\nYou get reporting built in less\nerror-free, or is it gonna be going and\n\n391\n00:19:51.344 --> 00:19:55.236\ngrabbing someone's laptop, bringing it in,\nand doing it one at a time?\n\n392\n00:19:55.236 --> 00:20:00.500\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, are there any models that\nwe can kinda point to to help us out?\n\n393\n00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.910\nOr are we just kinda saying,\nall right, we've got a process, and\n\n394\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.140\nthat's pretty much it?\n\n395\n00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.610\n&gt;&gt; Good point, as we've discussed,\nwe've got test models,\n\n396\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.760\nwe have change models,\nlater on we'll talk about request models.\n\n397\n00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.330\nThis idea of models simply means\nyou're predicting the types of\n\n398\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.620\nactivities that need to happen for\ngiven types of releases.\n\n399\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.170\nPerhaps you have,\nwant to develop a model for\n\n400\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.450\nhow you handle enhancements,\nversus break fix.\n\n401\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.880\nSo you have an enhancement release model.\n\n402\n00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.090\nYou would have a break fix release model.\n\n403\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.900\nMaybe you only handle server patching.\n\n404\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.840\nThose types of changes\nin a particular way.\n\n405\n00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.570\nSo server patching model, etc.\n\n406\n00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.170\nMaybe you have an idea for\nhow project size releases are happening,\n\n407\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:46.370\nversus the small ones, and you govern\nthem accordingly, through these models.\n\n408\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.530\n&gt;&gt; Well Terry, that's sounds\nlike a lot of information again,\n\n409\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.020\nthat we can take a look at and\nwe can think about.\n\n410\n00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.710\nRemember that what we also saw here,\nin this particular episode,\n\n411\n00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.720\nis that Terry also explained to us the\ndifference between the idea of change and\n\n412\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.690\nof course, the release and deployment.\n\n413\n00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.050\nIn the change management, that's\nwhere we get the authorization from.\n\n414\n00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.820\nAnd inside of the release and deployment,\nthat's where we also see the execution.\n\n415\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.790\nHe also took us through some of\nthe different terminology and\n\n416\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.310\nalso showed you in the process that\nwe're pretty much seeing the same\n\n417\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.790\nthings that we're taking a look at.\n\n418\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.040\nThe idea of its purpose as well\nas understanding scope and\n\n419\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.410\neven some of the processes and\nthe models there that we're talking about.\n\n420\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.600\nIt doesn't seem to be too much different,\nbut it is an important aspect that we\n\n421\n00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.870\nneed to consider, especially as our\norganization continues to grow.\n\n422\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.270\nSo Terry, any last words?\n\n423\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.480\nWe've got more to do, but at the same\ntime this looks like a good place for\n\n424\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.183\nus to stop.\n\n425\n00:21:38.183 --> 00:21:38.857\n&gt;&gt; I agree, and\n\n426\n00:21:38.857 --> 00:21:42.963\nas we'll get back into this in subsequent\nepisodes we'll look at the details of\n\n427\n00:21:42.963 --> 00:21:46.660\nrelease deployment management and\nsome of the processes inside of it.\n\n428\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.120\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to go ahead and\n\n429\n00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.390\nend this episode and we'll be heading into\na part two but thank you for joining us.\n\n430\n00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.816\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Ronny Wong.\n\n431\n00:21:56.816 --> 00:21:57.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n432\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.586\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned for more ITIL,\nrelease, control, and validation.\n\n433\n00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:08.772\n[MUSIC]\n\n434\n00:22:08.772 --> 00:22:10.685\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.793\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.840\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ntaking a look at ITIL release control and\n\n6\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.030\nvalidation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.860\nWe're specifically moving into the realm\nof release and deployment management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.560\nAnd here to help us is our ITIL expert,\nMr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.010\nTerry, welcome back to our show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.930\n&gt;&gt; Again, as always, happy to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.502\nWhat we're looking at in this episode is\nwe're looking a little bit deeper into\n\n12\n00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.668\nthe activities and the phases of\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n13\n00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:42.995\nWe kinda set the table about what it is at\nlarge in the earlier episode this we're\n\n14\n00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:43.972\ngonna dive deep.\n\n15\n00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:47.490\nIf you ever look at the graphic here,\nyou'll see that there's four phases.\n\n16\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.970\nAgain, for the exam you'll have\nto memorize this phases but\n\n17\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.334\nunderstanding it is going through\nthis with change management.\n\n18\n00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.920\nIn fact change management approves.\n\n19\n00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.840\nThe activities and\nwhich one of these phases going back.\n\n20\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840\nSo the actual probe of four\ndoing the planning and\n\n21\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.100\nonce the plan is completed, that goes back\nup and reviewed by change management.\n\n22\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.660\nChange management looks up,\nit says yep, great plan and\n\n23\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.540\nthen authorizes the next phase.\n\n24\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.710\nOn and on, right?\n\n25\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.100\nSo these are iterative they go back and\nforth between change management and\n\n26\n00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.300\nwe're gonna look at each of these in turn,\nbeginning with the planning piece.\n\n27\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.640\nSo lots of activities in planning.\n\n28\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.340\nYou can see kind of a laundry list\nhere of the pieces of planning and\n\n29\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.220\nit's not a walk in the park,\nit's not just technical\n\n30\n00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.230\nissues it's managing the business\nside of things as well.\n\n31\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.800\nSo as you look at this planed\nyour certainly looking at\n\n32\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.230\nthe planning documents itself.\n\n33\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.820\nMaking sure you can provide something\nto change managements that is\n\n34\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.950\nsuccinct accurate and complete, right?\n\n35\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.000\nWhich is not necessarily easy to do,\nsuccinct and\n\n36\n00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.130\ncomplete an interesting balance but your\ngonna provide something back to change\n\n37\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.290\nmanagement and say, here's what we\nproposed to do by when, by whom, right?\n\n38\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.070\nYou're also going to include in that plan\nwhat the pass and fail criteria look like.\n\n39\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.000\nWhat does success look like?\n\n40\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.270\nAnd the correlater to that,\nwhat does failure look like?\n\n41\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.840\nIs it failed tests?\n\n42\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.557\nIs it the failure to do\nappropriate training, right?\n\n43\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.856\nMaybe you won't consider it ready\nto go until training is complete.\n\n44\n00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:19.850\nRemediation planning, back-out testing.\n\n45\n00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.110\nAll those pieces, the building and\ntesting, how you going test it, right?\n\n46\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.450\nHow are they gonna be packaged?\n\n47\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.490\nThose elements of the release are also.\n\n48\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.990\nAgain, in the planning phase giving\nback the change man obsess with like\n\n49\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.860\nwhat you're doing here, right?\n\n50\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.930\nSo what kind of appointments\ngonna be involved,\n\n51\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.950\nwhat kind of training, logistics.\n\n52\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.085\nWho gonna be involved?\n\n53\n00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:41.980\nAre they gonna be pilots, right?\n\n54\n00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.620\nA phased approach, a big bang approach.\n\n55\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.600\nAll of those questions answered in\na succinct form back to change management,\n\n56\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.830\nsay yep,\nwe like what you're doing with these.\n\n57\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.230\nNow while it sounds complex, remember\nearlier we talked about having models?\n\n58\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.140\nCertainly having release models\nis gonna make this streamlined.\n\n59\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.590\nYou're not gonna have to\nreinvent the wheel every time.\n\n60\n00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.520\nFor instance,\nyou might have a regular model for\n\n61\n00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.490\nhow you handle break,\nfix things that cost less than $5,000.\n\n62\n00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.960\nJust as example, right?\n\n63\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.580\nSo if you have that model already defined,\nthen when these kind of changes come,\n\n64\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.300\nthe release and deployment management\nteam knows exactly what to do with them.\n\n65\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.470\nHow to package them, how to collate them\nwith test plans, test strategies, etc.\n\n66\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.660\nSo you need not be real complicated\nwith this particular aspect, right?\n\n67\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.750\nLet's have a look at that list again.\n\n68\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.880\nThe last bullet there,\none I haven't focused on in detail\n\n69\n00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.600\nis about the financial piece and\nthe commercial planning.\n\n70\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.230\nWhat's it gonna take to get this done?\n\n71\n00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.850\nDo we have to engage a supplier, right?\n\n72\n00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.390\nAnd therefore get a contract signed.\n\n73\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.100\nWhat's it gonna cost, right?\n\n74\n00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.640\nSo even these financial\nelements are involved.\n\n75\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.590\nSo if you recall that the scope of\nchange management can be big and\n\n76\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.950\nthe scope of change\nmanagement gonna be small.\n\n77\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.370\nObviously when you consider the financial\ncommercial planning aspect of any\n\n78\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.250\ngiven change.\n\n79\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.980\nThe big changes are gonna require\na lot more do diligence determine\n\n80\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.650\njust what average this gonna be.\n\n81\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.540\nSo again let's explode out even\nbigger you're considering it\n\n82\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.340\na service strategy level, a new service.\n\n83\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.580\nYou want a new service to come to life.\n\n84\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.340\nYou're going to provide a change proposal.\n\n85\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.340\nYou might remember that word from earlier.\n\n86\n00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.610\nA change proposal is something big and\nyou wanna propose this change.\n\n87\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.310\nIt comes down to these disciplinarians.\n\n88\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.850\nThese people in change management and\n\n89\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.690\nrelease deployment management to look at\nthat proposal and come up with the viable\n\n90\n00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.030\nplan, which includes costing,\nrisk mitigation, testing strategy, etc.\n\n91\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.980\nSo not only are these processes not\noperating in a vacuum, they're integrated.\n\n92\n00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.950\nThese stages are also integrated\nthroughout the processes, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.340\nSo that's the release employment\nplanning piece of it.\n\n94\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.532\nQuite a bit the handle there\nI think you'd agree, right?\n\n95\n00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:55.416\nSo moving ahead then we get\nto building and testing.\n\n96\n00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:59.542\nYou've set the plan back up to change they\nlike how you've packaged these things.\n\n97\n00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:01.984\nYou got different packages for\ndifferent releases and\n\n98\n00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:05.126\nthey like it they approve them then\nyou have to get around to building.\n\n99\n00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:11.219\nNotice the term build, ITIL has an arm's\nlength relationship with development.\n\n100\n00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.003\nThey realize, ITIL writers realize\nthat development happens, but\n\n101\n00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.749\nthis is not a development best practice,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:23.437\nThey expect to take fully developed code\nand build it, put it together, right?\n\n103\n00:05:23.437 --> 00:05:28.456\nNot each component, not the modules,\nnot those source code artifacts but\n\n104\n00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:33.320\nentire digestible pieces of software\nthat they could then build.\n\n105\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.010\nSo you could look at it in one\nlevel as taking a server and\n\n106\n00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.930\ninstalling, configuring it,\ninstalling software, configuring it.\n\n107\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.400\nThat's what building means.\n\n108\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.070\nSo it's not really development, right?\n\n109\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.990\nAnd then testing is also part of this.\n\n110\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.450\nRemember when we learned earlier\nabout a released package,\n\n111\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.960\na discrete collection of changes that\nare tested and considered together.\n\n112\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.680\nSo these would be built and\ntested together as a package, right?\n\n113\n00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.273\nAnd then of course you get to build and\ntest,\n\n114\n00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:03.760\nand you should know the results\nup to change management.\n\n115\n00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.460\nHere's what we built, here is how we\ntested it and they give their blessing for\n\n116\n00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.620\nthe next phase, which is deployment.\n\n117\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.070\nSaying we like what you did there,\nyep, move forward.\n\n118\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.930\nReinforce something though,\nat any one of these points,\n\n119\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.250\nthe change manager could say,\nno, not good enough and say redo.\n\n120\n00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.460\nLet's test that again, or let's take that\nparticular change out of the package,\n\n121\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.070\ncuz that's the problematic one, and\n\n122\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.610\ngo forward with this package with only\nfour changes in it and not five, right?\n\n123\n00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.380\nThere can be a lot of iterations here,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.940\nBut eventually you're going to\nget the deployment ready, right?\n\n125\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.950\nYou get that permission,\nyou get the environment ready to go, and\n\n126\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.970\nyou pick a date.\n\n127\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.080\nYou get the users involved if\nyou need to get them involved.\n\n128\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.260\nYou get the various teams coordinated.\n\n129\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.850\nYou've done your training.\n\n130\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.960\nYou've done your appropriate\nstakeholder management, right?\n\n131\n00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.900\nAnd now you're moving forward\nwith those plans, right?\n\n132\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.180\nSo deployment of a service could mean\nsomething that takes over two or\n\n133\n00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.802\nthree months.\n\n134\n00:06:58.802 --> 00:07:01.590\nYou consider the deployment\nof an application,\n\n135\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.260\nyou might do that over the weekend.\n\n136\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.418\nBut the deployment of a service could mean\nwe're gonna train people first, right?\n\n137\n00:07:07.418 --> 00:07:10.630\nAnd they wanna give them a little bit of\nthe functionality and they wanna give them\n\n138\n00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.270\nthe rest of this functionality after some\nadditional training, that sort of thing.\n\n139\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:21.895\nSo again these are big ideas and small\nideas all wrapped into one concept, okay?\n\n140\n00:07:21.895 --> 00:07:26.733\nSo then you deploy and\nyou transfer this into operations.\n\n141\n00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:29.430\nPerhaps you have an early Support period.\n\n142\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.350\nEarly life support.\n\n143\n00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.780\nSometimes called a warranty period,\nI've heard it called that.\n\n144\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.710\nIt's an opportunity for the project to\nstay engaged to make sure that everything\n\n145\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.730\nis just fine before they walk away and\nthe project is over, right?\n\n146\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.290\nSo having specific service\nacceptance criteria built in to\n\n147\n00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.000\nyour deployment plans,\nwith solid validation and\n\n148\n00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.270\ntesting, will ultimately lead you\nto a point of closure that says\n\n149\n00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.000\nwe delivered this as we're supposed\nto deliver it, project done.\n\n150\n00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.699\nNow it's time for review and close, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.300\nso when you consider reviewing and\nclosing, that's tidying everything up.\n\n152\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.170\nIt's getting your records in line,\nit's showing the success and\n\n153\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.865\nfailures, it's identifying the risks\nthat were identified through employment.\n\n154\n00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:17.810\nMaybe there is some additional\nproblems that still need to be solved,\n\n155\n00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.810\nmaybe there was some cost\nsavings that could be recouped,\n\n156\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.400\nmaybe there was some cost overruns\nAn opportunity for improvements.\n\n157\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.020\nSo review and\n\n158\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.790\nclosure here is going to play in well\ninto a change evaluation as well, right?\n\n159\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:37.570\nSo review and closure is a key aspect and\nit is formal, right?\n\n160\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.108\nIt's not something that you just make up\nat the end, you actually got through it,\n\n161\n00:08:41.108 --> 00:08:42.450\ntied it up.\n\n162\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.830\nMake your recommendations for improvements\nfor the next one and carry on, right?\n\n163\n00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.650\nQuite a bit of information there,\nwould you say?\n\n164\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.400\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that as you take\na look at those four different phases,\n\n165\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.390\nit's very important that we\nunderstand those four phases.\n\n166\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.950\nAnd that we need to carry through,\n\n167\n00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.164\nespecially in terms of\ndeployment management.\n\n168\n00:09:01.164 --> 00:09:06.130\nIt's hard when you think about it from how\nbig something could have actually get but\n\n169\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.700\nby breaking it down to the four different\nphases that Terry has talked about\n\n170\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.015\nit really does help us to make a little\nbit more manageable, a bit more logical.\n\n171\n00:09:14.015 --> 00:09:18.310\nIn that way we know that we can\nfocus in a little bit of time and\n\n172\n00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.280\ntry to swallow the whole thing.\n\n173\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.670\nSo at this point Terry when we start\nto think about ideas like this, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.790\nWe do need to take a little bit of time,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.320\nTo just make sure that we\ndive just the information.\n\n176\n00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.940\nSo what else can we do to help them\nmake sure we cement everything down?\n\n177\n00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.520\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\nI think to reinforce these concepts and\n\n178\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.950\nbefore we bring on some more learning,\nI think it would be a good opportunity for\n\n179\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.380\nyou to go and\nreinforce through a self-study effort.\n\n180\n00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.744\nThere is a good handout related to release\nand deployment for planning and preparing.\n\n181\n00:09:46.744 --> 00:09:51.683\nIf you look at the graphic here you\ncan see this particular references to\n\n182\n00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.011\nfigure 4.25.\n\n183\n00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:56.890\nYour handouts that you can download\nreinforce this idea of how do you plan\n\n184\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.170\na deployment, right?\n\n185\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.100\nSo you can do that, so\nlook forward to that good study.\n\n186\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.480\nWhen we come back, we'll, as you get\nback onto the horse here, though,\n\n187\n00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.510\nI'd like to talk about some of the big\npicture things again, if I could.\n\n188\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.860\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that sounds like\na great point for us to go ahead and\n\n189\n00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.570\ntake a short break here.\n\n190\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.610\nAnd we're gonna actually\nintroduce a part three,\n\n191\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.110\nthen into the idea here of release and\ndeployment management.\n\n192\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.200\nBut until that point we're\ngoing to go ahead and sign off.\n\n193\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.710\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n194\n00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n195\n00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.614\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL Release, Control, and

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.390\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nyou're watching ITIL Release Control and\n\n7\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.490\nValidation.\n\n8\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.541\nWe're specifically diving into a part\nthree on release in deployment management,\n\n9\n00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.905\nand here to help us understand a little\nbit more and review some of these\n\n10\n00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:33.175\nconcepts, is gonna be, of course,\nour ITIL master himself, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:34.530\nTerry, welcome back to our show.\n\n12\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.082\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:36.740\nI'm glad to be here, and as you suggest,\n\n14\n00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.620\nwe're going to tidy up this topic\non release and deploy management.\n\n15\n00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.080\nWe're going to look at going back up, we\ngot into the details a little bit there,\n\n16\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.872\nnow we're going to come back up and\nlook at the big picture of release and\n\n17\n00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:47.620\ndeployment management,\nas we've done before.\n\n18\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.830\nAnd we'll begin that by talking about\nthe triggers inputs and outputs.\n\n19\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.070\nSo, if you'll look at the graphic here,\nyou can see some of these playing out.\n\n20\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.800\nFairly familiar too, I do believe,\nauthorization through RFCs, request for\n\n21\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.613\nchange, the service packages,\nthe service design packages,\n\n22\n00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.017\nthese other stages of the life\ncycle have deliverables.\n\n23\n00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:10.362\nThat means something to the planning\neffort, that release and\n\n24\n00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.505\ndeployment management would\nhave to be involved in.\n\n25\n00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:15.945\nService design's gonna come up with\ntesting strategies, for instance.\n\n26\n00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:18.055\nRelease and deployment management's\ngonna be concerned about that.\n\n27\n00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.817\nSo, these design stages and strategy\nstages, will have outputs that are gonna\n\n28\n00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.241\nbe relevant to the planning\naspects of any given change.\n\n29\n00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.273\nAgain, when you consider the release\ndeployment management is considered with\n\n30\n00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:32.530\nthe big things, as well as the day-to-day\nthings, or smaller things.\n\n31\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.420\nThen you can see why other stages of\nthe life cycle are to be involved,\n\n32\n00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.440\nincluding operations folks and\nthe rest of transition.\n\n33\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.870\nAnd, Ronnie-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n34\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Test you a little bit here.\n\n35\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; From what we've learned so\n\n36\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.740\nfar among the many episodes,\ncan you name two or three processes that\n\n37\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.490\nyou know release and deployment management\nis going to have interact with?\n\n38\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, from a few episodes that\nwe have done together now, Terry.\n\n39\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.530\nI believe that as we've watched\nthe ideas here of release and\n\n40\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.380\ndeployment management, we've interacted\nwith the change management process,\n\n41\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.350\nitself, as being one for\nthe authorization.\n\n42\n00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.580\nAnd we also talked a little bit\nabout using the service asset and\n\n43\n00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.750\nconfiguration management, as well.\n\n44\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.060\nAnd then, even possibly, since we\nhave been talking about it, as well.\n\n45\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.350\nThe idea of service validation and\ntesting.\n\n46\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.430\n&gt;&gt; Good call, good memory.\n\n47\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.158\nYou're not just a pretty face.\n\n48\n00:02:21.158 --> 00:02:23.489\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, as you look at these-\n\n49\n00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.698\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Never.\n\n50\n00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:26.916\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, consider what he said.\n\n51\n00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.410\nHe said change management.\n\n52\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.670\nSACM, Service Asset\nConfiguration Management, and\n\n53\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.710\nservice validation and testing.\n\n54\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.720\nAnd let's just remind ourselves.\n\n55\n00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.920\nRemember, change management and\n\n56\n00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.280\ndeployment management are actually tightly\nintegrated, because they're iterative,\n\n57\n00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.170\nin fact, through change management\nauthorizing each of those four phases.\n\n58\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.790\nPlanning, building and testing,\ndeployment, and review and close, right?\n\n59\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.680\nAnd then, when we consider service asset\nconfiguration management actually touching\n\n60\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.480\nthe components that are being changed,\n\n61\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.520\nreduce employing management is\ngonna be doing that touching.\n\n62\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.890\nIt's gonna be making changes to the very\nCIs that SACM hopes to keep under control.\n\n63\n00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.760\nSo, obviously some integration there,\nbecause\n\n64\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.680\nrelease deployment management is going to\nbe updating the definitive media library.\n\n65\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.220\nThat's gonna be updating\nthe configuration records.\n\n66\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.700\nObviously, a lot of interaction there.\n\n67\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.660\nAnd then, of course, service validation\ntesting, as Ronnie pointed out.\n\n68\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.780\nService validation testing,\nthe process we just discussed,\n\n69\n00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.290\nis the testing part of releasing\nto employment management.\n\n70\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.560\nSo, one of the phases of releasing\nemployment is building and testing, so\n\n71\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.070\nthat testing piece is actually being\npassed over to another process.\n\n72\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.360\nA lot of integration here.\n\n73\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.090\nSo, not just integration among the various\nstages, but tight integration among\n\n74\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.150\nthe processes themselves need\nto be engineered to the design.\n\n75\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.846\n&gt;&gt; With that amount of integration,\nand that amount of information that\n\n76\n00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:44.494\nneeds to be handled,\nhow are we gonna keep up with everything?\n\n77\n00:03:44.494 --> 00:03:45.460\n&gt;&gt; A good question.\n\n78\n00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.800\nInformation management in this\nscope is a tremendous challenge.\n\n79\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.500\nThe rule,\n\n80\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.010\nwe'll talk about technology in some detail\na little bit later on in another episode.\n\n81\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.100\nBut generally speaking, information\nmanagement across the eye to life cycle\n\n82\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.230\nis to find points of integration.\n\n83\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.770\nProcesses don't operate in a vacuum and\ntheir data set are related, right?\n\n84\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.650\nThe artifacts they create are relate.\n\n85\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.330\nSo, coming up with tool sets in\ninformation systems that allow you to\n\n86\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.620\nsee the whole picture of these\nprocesses is a great goal.\n\n87\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.450\nIt's not one you'll get overnight,\nthere's certainly a great goal.\n\n88\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.620\nAnd as you're taking exams,\nyou're looking for\n\n89\n00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.719\nthose opportunities to integrate\nacross your tool sets.\n\n90\n00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, along with everything else,\nwe've already seen that every process,\n\n91\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.700\nof course, involves metrics.\n\n92\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.370\nSo, what are the metrics or\ncommon success factors and\n\n93\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.140\nKPIs that we're really looking for?\n\n94\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Great question, Ronnie.\n\n95\n00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.990\nI think I might challenge\nyou just a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.760\nWhat does successful releases look like?\n\n97\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.370\nWe've talked about some\nof the processes inside,\n\n98\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.130\nwhat would a successful release look like,\nwhat will make it,\n\n99\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.090\nwhat is critical of the release of\nthe employment management has to get done?\n\n100\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.340\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to challenge\nmy own memory right now.\n\n101\n00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.430\nI really can't think of one right now.\n\n102\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.480\nI'm trying.\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry to put you on the spot.\n\n103\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.650\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, it happens.\n\n104\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.360\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so, one of the things to consider\nrelease and deployment management is\n\n105\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.283\ntrying to make sure you deliver\nbeneficial changes on time.\n\n106\n00:05:09.283 --> 00:05:10.734\n&gt;&gt; Timely manner-\n&gt;&gt; On budget.\n\n107\n00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:12.004\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; We're on budget, so,\n\n108\n00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:13.940\nthink about the management\nof those things.\n\n109\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.800\nIf that's critical success factors,\ndelivering things on time and\n\n110\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.340\non budget then, what would you measure?\n\n111\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.901\n&gt;&gt; Cost and time.\n\n112\n00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:20.560\n&gt;&gt; Time.\n\n113\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, perhaps you wanna\nmeasure the quality of them, too.\n\n114\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.040\nDid it cause pain, right?\n\n115\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.440\nDid you have a bunch of incidents, right?\n\n116\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.560\nOn the other side, so\n\n117\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.590\nperhaps another metric could be the number\nof incidents caused by your releases.\n\n118\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.180\nDid you cause a lot of pain?\n\n119\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.580\nDid you create outages because\nyou released something?\n\n120\n00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so,\n\n121\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.060\nif you want to consider the success of\na release in deployment management is\n\n122\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.320\ndelivering beneficial\nchanges without causing harm.\n\n123\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.450\nSo, if you measure the harmful\nartifacts like incidents, outages, and\n\n124\n00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.040\nthose types of things and relate them back\nto release and deployment management,\n\n125\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.250\nyou've got some viable\nmetrics to consider there.\n\n126\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.150\nSo, key performance indicators cold\nbe measuring the negative impacts.\n\n127\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.340\nBut you could also measure\nthe positive impacts.\n\n128\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.350\nIf you've promised faster,\nthen measure speed, etc, yep, good.\n\n129\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, along with that then,\njust like everything else,\n\n130\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.230\nevery other process, we've also\ntalked about challenges and risks.\n\n131\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.980\nSo, in the idea of our deployment, and of\ncourse, our release and deployment here.\n\n132\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.290\nWhat are those challenges?\n\n133\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.800\nWhat is it that we are really\ngonna encounter every time?\n\n134\n00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.360\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n135\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.100\nAgain, a challenge being a risk\ncould have 100% chance of happening.\n\n136\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.600\nGetting people to buy in to your process.\n\n137\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.540\nWe talked about that, we talked about\nchange, and we talked about config and\n\n138\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.490\nservice validations testing,\ncertainly a challenge you'll face.\n\n139\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.090\nHow to get people to buy in, policy is\ngoing to be a big part of that, and\n\n140\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.940\nhaving a viable process that actually\nworks is going to be a part of that.\n\n141\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.140\nShowing the value of it.\n\n142\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.660\nDealing with poor estimates of timing,\n\n143\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.130\nright, is going to be\na challenge to deal with.\n\n144\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.130\nThere's a lot of factors\nwithin your control.\n\n145\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.370\nThere's some factors\nthat aren't your control,\n\n146\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.044\nincluding the business themselves.\n\n147\n00:06:58.044 --> 00:07:01.622\nThey may slow you down, yet\nyou're trying to satisfy their deadline.\n\n148\n00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:05.276\nSo, time measurements and\ntime estimates are difficult,\n\n149\n00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:08.126\nthe customers typically\nwants things first,\n\n150\n00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:13.800\nyou will promise them something maybe not\nquite as first, you better meet it, right?\n\n151\n00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.480\nSo, that's definitely gonna be\na challenge to meet your time estimates.\n\n152\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.459\nQualitative measurement, are you actually\ndelivering the value you intend to deliver\n\n153\n00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:23.105\nis going to be a challenge and\nthe promise at the same time.\n\n154\n00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:28.110\n&gt;&gt; So in that aspect of risk too,\nrisk as well, right?\n\n155\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.090\nSo, there seems to be,\nat least from what I can tell here,\n\n156\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.130\na lot more risk than the challenges.\n\n157\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.206\nSo, is that something I gotta consider\nwhen I start to push this out?\n\n158\n00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.488\n&gt;&gt; Well, certainly the release and\n\n159\n00:07:38.488 --> 00:07:40.590\ndeployment management\nneeds to be effective.\n\n160\n00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.440\nIt needs to be quick.\n\n161\n00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.550\nQuick enough, I should say needs to\nbe timely, whatever timely means.\n\n162\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.110\nEffective, timely and\nnot causing pain, right?\n\n163\n00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, built into that is\n\n164\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.620\nsome risk aversion,\nyou are purposefully slowing things down,\n\n165\n00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.060\nyou are going to engage\nin a testing culture.\n\n166\n00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.694\nRight, you're going to have a service\nvalidation and testing culture that\n\n167\n00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:05.450\nverifies and validates that what\nyou're putting out is actually.\n\n168\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.310\nReady for prime time, right?\n\n169\n00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.720\nSo, the risks inherent in change\nis the risk we're talking about.\n\n170\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.130\nAnd that is not just technical risk.\n\n171\n00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.960\nIt's cultural risk as well.\n\n172\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.320\nBehavioral change is\nnot easy to implement.\n\n173\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.700\nI recall a particular service that\nwe launched that was well-designed.\n\n174\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.100\nIt had high availability, high warranty.\n\n175\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.280\nHigh functionality, and\nwhen we deployed it,\n\n176\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.280\nthere was no excitement\nwhatsoever in the user community.\n\n177\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.498\nThey couldn't care less basically,\nthey weren't interested in it.\n\n178\n00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:38.520\nSomehow, we missed\nsomething along the way,\n\n179\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.580\nwe deliver something on time,\non budget, of high functionality.\n\n180\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.790\nAnd yet, no one seemed to care.\n\n181\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.350\nSo, that's also a risk, is to make\nsure you're continually aligning with\n\n182\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.460\nthe real business expectations, and\n\n183\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.750\nnot just building something that's sweet,\nand got a lot of bells and whistles.\n\n184\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.548\nYou're actually doing something for\na customer outcome.\n\n185\n00:08:57.548 --> 00:09:01.450\n&gt;&gt; When we started to take a look then,\nI remember that we've talked about change\n\n186\n00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.430\nmanagement as really being part\nof service transition, but\n\n187\n00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.860\nthis seems to be more operational,\nright, is what we're taking a look at.\n\n188\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.050\nOr are we still in the transition phase?\n\n189\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.000\n&gt;&gt; We're still in transition,\n\n190\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.148\nit's really kinda difficult\ndiscussion to have sometimes.\n\n191\n00:09:13.148 --> 00:09:16.540\nBut remember, ITIL,\nwhen they set out to write the books,\n\n192\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.920\nthey decided to break things\ndown into five books.\n\n193\n00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; They call one of those books service\n\n194\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.110\ntransition, and that's one of\nthe stages of the life cycle.\n\n195\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.730\nIf you're considering bringing\na brand new service into life,\n\n196\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.250\ninto a totally green field-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n197\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Then the flow of operations\nis certainly from strategy\n\n198\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.140\nto design to transition and\nthen to operations.\n\n199\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.320\nBut once you have an operational service,\nyou're going to need to change it.\n\n200\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.340\nSo, you're gonna go back through\nthese same things, right?\n\n201\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.100\nThese same things.\n\n202\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.710\nNow, if it's for\n\n203\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.070\nminor changes, maybe it doesn't go\nall the way back up to strategy.\n\n204\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.990\nIf it's for a great big change,\nmaybe it does.\n\n205\n00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:57.080\nAgain, the example I'll use,\ntweaking and adding a widget to\n\n206\n00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.900\nSharePoint, is something that maybe,\ncomes from operations, and is managed\n\n207\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.580\nthrough transitional processes, change,\nrelease, deployment, and testing, right?\n\n208\n00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.030\nAnd that's just managed without bothering\nservice design and service strategy.\n\n209\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.270\nThat's certainly viable, but\nreplacing Lotus Notes with SharePoint\n\n210\n00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.990\nis something that probably went all\nthe way up to service strategy,\n\n211\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.880\nworked its way through the cost benefit\nanalysis, got appropriate design,\n\n212\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.350\ngot appropriate transition planning,\nand then became operational.\n\n213\n00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.280\nSo, it really is a matter of scale,\nwhether you consider operations,\n\n214\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.380\nwhether you consider change\nmanagement as part of operations, or\n\n215\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.800\npart of some other life cycle stage.\n\n216\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.450\nIt's clear that ITIL's clearly\nputs change management in\n\n217\n00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.720\nthe transition life cycle stage,\nmake no mistake about that, but\n\n218\n00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.880\nthat that transition stage could be\nevoked directly from operations,\n\n219\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.380\nwithout the involvement of strategy and\ndesign is viable.\n\n220\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, just like\neverything else, in every process\n\n221\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.920\nwe've talked about the idea of\nan owner as well as a Process Manager.\n\n222\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.538\nWhat are the responsibilities when\nwe start taking a look at this?\n\n223\n00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:03.270\n&gt;&gt; The generic responsibilities and\naccountabilities of owner and\n\n224\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.910\nmanager are the same.\n\n225\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.650\nAs a processor owner for\nrelease and deployment,\n\n226\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.960\nyou need to make sure the quality\nof this process is up.\n\n227\n00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.300\nYou got a good, high quality process,\nwhich means continual improvement,\n\n228\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.650\nmeasurement of the process, continual and\n\n229\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.920\ngradual progress toward a great process,\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.140\nSo, that's what the process\nowner's gonna be responsible for.\n\n231\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.860\nAs we talked about generically before,\n\n232\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.050\nthe process manager is\ninvolved with the day to day.\n\n233\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.150\nSo, a release and deployment process\nmanager is a busy person, right?\n\n234\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:39.620\nYou probably have many of these,\nnot just one manager, right?\n\n235\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.450\nYou can also combine roles as\nwe've talked about before.\n\n236\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.060\nSo, the generic treatment of owner and\nmanager will serve you well conceptually.\n\n237\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.970\nBut just understand that this\nprocess is a busy process, right?\n\n238\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.140\nIt's got lots of things to do,\nlots of things to consider,\n\n239\n00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.680\nlots of data inputs and a time scale\nthat's pretty short sometimes.\n\n240\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.230\n&gt;&gt; Now, and Terry, the other thing that I\nthink might be a little bit different, and\n\n241\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.190\nyou'll have to correct me if I'm wrong\nhere, is that you talk about the idea\n\n242\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.650\nof a practitioner, but\nin this role of release and\n\n243\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.680\ndeployment, you might have two different\ntypes of practitioners, right?\n\n244\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.290\nOne for packaging and one for deployment.\n\n245\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.201\nWhy do we need to differentiate those out?\n\n246\n00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:17.430\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n247\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.780\nIt depends on the complexity\nof the change,\n\n248\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.770\nit's a technical complexity as well.\n\n249\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.300\nConsider that deployment\nmeans a lot of things,\n\n250\n00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.850\nit's not just deploying technology,\nit's getting people trained.\n\n251\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.750\nIt's getting processes updated.\n\n252\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.980\nIt's doing lots of things that\nmake this service possible, and\n\n253\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.720\nnot just solution possible.\n\n254\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.125\nSo, when you consider that kind of scope,\nservice versus solution,\n\n255\n00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:43.282\nyou're probably going to devolve into some\nareas of specialty where you're going to\n\n256\n00:12:43.282 --> 00:12:44.744\nhave your technical people.\n\n257\n00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:47.886\nAnd then you're gonna have the folks\nthat are more customer facing,\n\n258\n00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:51.110\ndealing with UAT, test execution,\nand stuff like that.\n\n259\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.810\nYou recall earlier that we separated\nthe duties of building from\n\n260\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:00.076\nthe duties of testing, so in that regard,\nyou have different practitioners as well.\n\n261\n00:13:00.076 --> 00:13:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Now, I just realized something as I was\nlooking down here trying to see something.\n\n262\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.029\nI'm gonna do an acronym check on you.\n\n263\n00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:08.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n\n264\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.830\n&gt;&gt; Which is, you also have ELS.\n\n265\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.794\nEarly life support practitioner.\n\n266\n00:13:12.794 --> 00:13:13.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:14.923\n&gt;&gt; Somebody know CPR?\n\n268\n00:13:14.923 --> 00:13:15.631\nIs that what we're talking about?\n\n269\n00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, but no.\n\n270\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, early life support,\n\n271\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.760\noften built into project plans for\na new launch of a service,\n\n272\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.610\nis a period of time where the project\nstays in play after launch.\n\n273\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:33.260\nIt can be used to mitigate any big\nproblems that were unforeseen.\n\n274\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.900\nIt could be used for\nadditional training of service desk staff.\n\n275\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.370\nIt could be the marriage of the project\nand the service desk staff for\n\n276\n00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.700\na temporary time, right?\n\n277\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.580\nTo make sure there's appropriate knowledge\ntransfer in a real live environment.\n\n278\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.240\nSometimes, where life support is\ndefined within a project scope,\n\n279\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.120\nparticularly funded for a specific time,\nI've sort of seen that play out,\n\n280\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.280\nthat seems to be the most\nreasonable in real life.\n\n281\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.630\nITIL happens to preach it a little bit\ndifferently, that early life support is\n\n282\n00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:09.280\nthat period of time between service\nlaunch and service acceptance.\n\n283\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.750\nThey don't put a timeline on it, whatever\nit takes to get it accepted, right?\n\n284\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.100\nSo, if you launch something\nthat's got lots of problems,\n\n285\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.310\nyou need to resolve all those\nproblems before life support is over.\n\n286\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.540\nThat's how ITIL positions it, right?\n\n287\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.010\nA little bit differently, and\n\n288\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.870\nmaybe somewhat impractical when you're\ntrying to budget a project for it.\n\n289\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.130\nThose tend to be capitalized funds or\noperational funds.\n\n290\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.020\nWhatever the funding source is,\nit's a finite amount.\n\n291\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.210\nAnd to say, I need another extra\nhundred thousand dollars for\n\n292\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.655\nthree more months of early life support,\nyou're probably not gonna be very popular.\n\n293\n00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:43.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So again,\n\n294\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.800\nthe practical approach is probably gonna\nbe more some sort of hybrid of that,\n\n295\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.420\nwhere early life support is active for\nawhile.\n\n296\n00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.200\nThey try to mitigate as many\nproblems as they want, and\n\n297\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.722\nthey are certain to make the risk register\nmanageable before they stand down.\n\n298\n00:14:55.722 --> 00:14:59.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, our final particular role\nthat we have and we want to know about\n\n299\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.890\nthe responsibilities is the build and\ntest environment manager as well.\n\n300\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.970\nSo, how is this different from the Process\nManager we were talking about before?\n\n301\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:09.805\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n302\n00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:12.680\nITIL is certainly\nhighlighting a key factor.\n\n303\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.700\nWhat ITIL has done,\nthe way it's grown over the years\n\n304\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.980\nis through practical experience,\ndoing research,\n\n305\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.760\ngoing into organizations finding out\nwhat works well, what doesn't work well.\n\n306\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.320\nSo, defining this role called Build and\nTest Environment Manager, again,\n\n307\n00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.610\nkeep in mind this is not\nan organizational structure.\n\n308\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.990\nYou might be the early life\nsupport practitioner and\n\n309\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.430\nthe build and tested environment manager.\n\n310\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.770\nA given person could\nplay more than one role.\n\n311\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.330\nBut identifying this role means you're\n\n312\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.380\nidentifying someone that's\ngoing to be accountable for\n\n313\n00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.380\nensuring the integrity of the live\nenvironment and the test environment.\n\n314\n00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.650\nThe primary reason why tests fail\nis not because in production and\n\n315\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.830\noperations, it's not necessarily because\nthe code was built wrong, necessarily.\n\n316\n00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.770\nIt's because it was tested in\nan environment that didn't mimic\n\n317\n00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.680\nthe live environment.\n\n318\n00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.680\nThat's a common occurrence, right?\n\n319\n00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.170\nI wouldn't say it's number one or\nnumber two,\n\n320\n00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:08.090\nbut it's a common occurrence in that you\ngotta have these environments controlled.\n\n321\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.980\nSo, identifying a role to take\ncare of those environments\n\n322\n00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.660\nis a step that ITIL says you should make,\nto make sure you have accountability for\n\n323\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.060\nthat very important aspect.\n\n324\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.730\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry,\n\n325\n00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.775\nwell, that is, again, another big\nprocess that we've taking a look at.\n\n326\n00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:27.720\nWith a lot of deep concepts that we really\nshould take the time to think about, and\n\n327\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.260\nmake sure that we understand before\ngoing into that example as well.\n\n328\n00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.490\nSo Terry, is there any particular\nfocus that I should have\n\n329\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:42.000\nin my mind before getting ready, or as\nI'm preparing for the exam at this point?\n\n330\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.190\n&gt;&gt; Not specifically, I'll give you\nthe same advice I had given before.\n\n331\n00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.750\nThose practice exams that you\nhave access to are valuable.\n\n332\n00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.480\nTake one or two of the questions that are\nfocused on release and deploy management,\n\n333\n00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.300\nand change management, and\nyou'll reinforce these.\n\n334\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.110\nAt the same time, you'll be getting\ninside the mind of the test maker, and\n\n335\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.862\nunderstanding just how they test\nagainst the objectives of the test.\n\n336\n00:17:03.862 --> 00:17:05.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well, thank you for\n\n337\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.560\nhelping us to understand the concept of\nrelease and deployment management better.\n\n338\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.940\nYou remember, you've gotta review these.\n\n339\n00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.640\nJust like I did,\n\n340\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.290\neven though I've been doing these shows\nwith Terry, it was still very easy for me\n\n341\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.810\nnot to be able to come up with the answers\nright then when we've been doing this.\n\n342\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.190\nBut a lot of times though,\n\n343\n00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.800\nyou can have that same anxiety\nas you go in on the test.\n\n344\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.863\nSo, preparation is the key as\nyou prepare for that as well.\n\n345\n00:17:28.863 --> 00:17:31.788\nYou're also gonna see that these\nconcepts will appear over and\n\n346\n00:17:31.788 --> 00:17:35.153\nover again, just like we've seen now\na pattern through every process,\n\n347\n00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:39.030\nthere's a lot of things that do, not so\nmuch overlap, but you see the same things.\n\n348\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.400\nWhen we're talking about risk and\n\n349\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.810\nchallenges, as well as the idea\nof roles and responsibilities.\n\n350\n00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.010\nAll of these are key factors in every\nprocess we've been talking about.\n\n351\n00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.870\nSo make sure you go back over them, make\nsure you actually do have them solemnly in\n\n352\n00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.010\nyour mind before getting,\nas you're getting ready for your exam.\n\n353\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.080\nBut it's also a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n354\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.334\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n355\n00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:01.499\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n356\n00:18:01.499 --> 00:18:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more ITIL,\nrelease control and validation.\n\n357\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:12.659\n[MUSIC]\n\n358\n00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:15.948\n&gt;&gt;

They emphasize the goal request fulfillment is not so much about incident management as it is about fulfilling planned expectations.  They also discuss request fulfillment in terms of using a self-fulfillment portal or a service desk.  The key is not so much about the system that is in place but the formalization,adoption, and use of the system that is implemented along the way.  Also the team discusses the basic challenges and risks associated with request fulfillment process.",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.750\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.540\nAnd today, we're taking a look at\nITIL release, control and validation.\n\n8\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.350\nWe're diving into request fulfillment, and\n\n9\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.040\nhere to help us out is gonna be our\nITIL expert himself, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.510\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.590\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.870\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n13\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.940\n&gt;&gt; So, as we're gonna dig in\ntoday into request fulfillment,\n\n14\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.590\nI'm gonna start with\na very simple question.\n\n15\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.928\nIn fact, Ron, I'll even ask you,\nwhat is a request?\n\n16\n00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.208\n&gt;&gt; As I start thinking\nabout the idea of requests,\n\n17\n00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.230\nTerry, I always think about\nthings in terms of help desk.\n\n18\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.268\nA lot of times,\nthere's something that I asked for,\n\n19\n00:00:49.268 --> 00:00:53.810\nbecause I don't know where to find\nsomething, or something is broken.\n\n20\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.790\nOr it could be that I don't have what I\nneed I need right now at my desk, and\n\n21\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.830\nI need something else to tell\nme to do what I need to do.\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's good,\nand almost right 100%.\n\n23\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.900\nYou mentioned,\nI don't know where something is, so\n\n24\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.960\nyou call the service desk.\n\n25\n00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.088\nThat's certainly something the service\ndesk is gonna be keen to answer for you,\n\n26\n00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:13.738\nand do so efficiently, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.738 --> 00:01:17.822\nI need to find where this application is,\nor I need a new headset.\n\n28\n00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:21.060\nYou mentioned something though, that\nactually, ITIL would call an incident.\n\n29\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.090\nThis things not working,\nI need it to work.\n\n30\n00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420\nSo then, the service desk\nwas trying to fix something.\n\n31\n00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.624\nSo, service is somehow diminished,\nbecause something's broken,\n\n32\n00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.986\nthen that's an incident,\nwe need to restore service.\n\n33\n00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:38.670\nSo, this idea of fulfilling requests\nmeans you're fulfilling a need,\n\n34\n00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.218\non a routine basis,\nin a repeatable process, right?\n\n35\n00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:45.418\nSo I need a new headset,\nwhere is that application,\n\n36\n00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:48.660\ncan you install this software for\nme, right?\n\n37\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.170\nMy battery is not recharging,\ncan you replace the battery?\n\n38\n00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.421\nThe types of things that customer needs,\n\n39\n00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.342\nor the user needs to use your service\nwould be the kind of things that would\n\n40\n00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:01.059\nbe requested in a standard\nfulfillment process.\n\n41\n00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:06.096\nSo, requests fulfillment, as a process, is\nthe methodical way you go about defining\n\n42\n00:02:06.096 --> 00:02:10.657\nwhat is requestable, and make sure you\nfulfill those requests efficiently.\n\n43\n00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.199\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, let me ask this\nquestion then, since you made this\n\n44\n00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.300\ndistinction between the idea of\na service request and an incident.\n\n45\n00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.590\nWhy aren't they the same thing if I'm\nsaying hey, there's something wrong,\n\n46\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.740\nversus what you're talking about?\n\n47\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nconsider the scale of what could be wrong.\n\n48\n00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.100\nYou might get a user that calls to service\ndesk and says, I can't the submit button,\n\n49\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.670\nand you might just consider well,\nthat's just an uninformed user, right?\n\n50\n00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.430\nSo, you remind the user that there is a\nscroll bar, and they can scroll down, and\n\n51\n00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.680\nthe submit button is down below.\n\n52\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.500\nThey just can't see it.\n\n53\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.090\n&gt;&gt; Or, what if 30 people called\nthe service desk and says,\n\n54\n00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.170\nI can't find the submit button?\n\n55\n00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.280\nMaybe the change you did this past weekend\naccidentally removed the submit button.\n\n56\n00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n57\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n58\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.520\nthere you see there's\nsomething you have to fix.\n\n59\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.290\nIn that latter example,\nyou have to go fix something.\n\n60\n00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.120\nAnd the first example is just really\ngiving the user some information.\n\n61\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.550\nSo, a request for\ninformation to help a user out,\n\n62\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.130\nbecause they're not quite fully\ninformed is the nature of the request.\n\n63\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.700\nAnd again, maybe to utilize a service,\n\n64\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.820\nyou need a special piece of equipment,\nor you need, like I said,\n\n65\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.450\na headset, or you need to replace your\nbattery and those kind of things.\n\n66\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.220\nSo, those standard fulfillment options\n\n67\n00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.462\nwould also be under the rubric\nof request fulfillment.\n\n68\n00:03:26.462 --> 00:03:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Al right, so Terry,\n\n69\n00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.800\nwhy in the world are we talking about\nthis idea of request fulfillment then?\n\n70\n00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.700\nIn terms of release control and\nvalidation,\n\n71\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810\nI don't hear anything about a release, I\ndon't here anything about a control here,\n\n72\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.820\nand definitely not any validation,\nso why are we talking about here?\n\n73\n00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good question, and\n\n74\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.900\nI get a lot of questions about this,\nso request fulfillment, in fact,\n\n75\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.980\nis a process that shows up in the service\noperations publication, right?\n\n76\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.730\nIt's intended to be something that's\noperated on a day to day basis,\n\n77\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.170\nthis process, and indeed it is.\n\n78\n00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.050\nThe reason why it shows up here is that,\n\n79\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.050\nsome request might lead\nto an actual change.\n\n80\n00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.820\nYou'll recall when we talked about change\nmanagement we talked about three types of\n\n81\n00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.680\nchanges.\n\n82\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.010\nWe had standard changes,\nemergency changes, and normal changes.\n\n83\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.530\nA standard change is a change that\nhas been approved one time, and\n\n84\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.350\nby the official cab change advisory board,\nbut after first approval,\n\n85\n00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.298\nit can be executed anytime after that\nwithout going back for approval.\n\n86\n00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:29.747\nSo, request fulfillment could be a process\nthat you put in front of standard request.\n\n87\n00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:32.352\nThis is example,\na change to a laptop to install\n\n88\n00:04:32.352 --> 00:04:35.676\nsoftware might be something you\nwant to keep under control,\n\n89\n00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:39.079\nso you come up with a request model,\nremember the word model?\n\n90\n00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:39.946\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n91\n00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:45.499\nmodel is a predefined set of steps that\ndefine how to implement a particular\n\n92\n00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:51.030\nthing with a change request test\nmodel we talked about release models.\n\n93\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.730\nSo, this word model just means repeatable,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.511\nSo, request fulfillment is certainly\ngoing to define the request model.\n\n95\n00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.835\nSo, if a request comes to\ninstall software, that,\n\n96\n00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:03.095\nin fact,\nmight be a change under control, right?\n\n97\n00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:05.570\nBut you don't have to go back for\napproval for it.\n\n98\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.950\nSo, in a nutshell, a request could be for\na standard change.\n\n99\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.933\nThat's why it's here, and\nthis release control of validation.\n\n100\n00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.585\nBecause you're controlling\nwhat can be requestable,\n\n101\n00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:20.622\nwhat can be standardized as a change,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:20.622 --> 00:05:25.155\nNow, that said,\nnot all requests are for a change.\n\n103\n00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:26.715\nLike I said, someone might call and say,\n\n104\n00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:30.265\nI can't find the submit button,\nor where is this application?\n\n105\n00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:33.295\nThose kinds of requests don't\nnecessarily lead to a change, but\n\n106\n00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:35.485\nit's just information being pass on.\n\n107\n00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:38.610\nAnd not all standard changes\n\n108\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.050\nhave a request fulfillment processing\nfrom them in front of them.\n\n109\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.840\nSo, there is a difference between\na request and a change, but\n\n110\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.800\nthey do intersect often.\n\n111\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.320\n&gt;&gt; Now, since you're talking about this\nidea of the processing itself, is ITIL\n\n112\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.400\nrecommending a very formalized type of\napproach to the request fulfillment?\n\n113\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.190\nOr is this something that we just need\nto make sure that we just include in\n\n114\n00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.080\nthe process itself?\n\n115\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.530\nJust saying, Terry, this is what I need,\nand I'll walk by you,\n\n116\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.260\nagain, like the water cooler talk.\n\n117\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, as with other processes,\n\n118\n00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.770\nITIL certainly make a strong case that\nif you don't define the process, and\n\n119\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.890\nyou just do it ad hoc as they come around,\nyou're not gonna be as efficient.\n\n120\n00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.230\nYou won't do it the same way.\n\n121\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.460\nIt won't be repeatable,\nyou won't necessarily be efficient.\n\n122\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.460\nSo, as customers are using your\nservice to make that interaction with\n\n123\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.112\nyour service high quality, you need to be\nefficient in the management of requests.\n\n124\n00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:37.110\nIt's gonna be hard to be efficient\nif you're doing it ad hoc,\n\n125\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.300\ncoming up with formal request\nfulfillment process is a key to that.\n\n126\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.475\n&gt;&gt; A standardization on the process like\nthat is primed more of what we're looking\n\n127\n00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:49.667\nfor, we're talking about an implementation\nof sunlight, rather than just.\n\n128\n00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:53.828\nTerry, just email me on that, or\njust drop me a phone call, or text me.\n\n129\n00:06:53.828 --> 00:06:57.720\nWe're probably talking about\nsome type of standardization.\n\n130\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and defining what kind\nof request can be handled in what ways.\n\n131\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.370\nYou might have some requests\nthat actually have a work\n\n132\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.060\nflow through them that\nrequire management approval.\n\n133\n00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.890\nYou might not want every one\nof your users, for instance,\n\n134\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.350\nto be able to install the latest\nversion of Microsoft Project.\n\n135\n00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.100\nSo, because there's an additional cost,\nit's not part of the standard bill.\n\n136\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.450\nPeople want, some people really need it,\nbut it costs some money.\n\n137\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.470\nSo, for those kinds of requests you might\nactually Intervene with a workflow,\n\n138\n00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.760\nthat asked for management approval, right?\n\n139\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.790\nSo, if you're asking for\nmanagement approval, then workflow\n\n140\n00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.360\nwould include that approval, and\nthen the software could be installed.\n\n141\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.830\nBut I also could see work\ncould be very informal.\n\n142\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.050\nYou could have service desk, there are\njust help desk to call them kiosk perhaps,\n\n143\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.750\nwhere you can walk up to\nthe service desk technician and\n\n144\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.680\nsay my battery won't charge\nif you got a new one, right?\n\n145\n00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.035\nThat seems very informal.\n\n146\n00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:53.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n147\n00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.089\n&gt;&gt; But even then, that technician is\nkeeping notes, he's writing it down,\n\n148\n00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:59.511\nhe's logging it,\nthe fact that it was requested.\n\n149\n00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.763\nHe know my laptop now has a new battery.\n\n150\n00:08:01.763 --> 00:08:05.036\nAnd perhaps there's even something\nhappening in the backend in terms of cost\n\n151\n00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:07.110\nallocation for this new battery, right?\n\n152\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.430\nThat, me as a user, is not even aware of.\n\n153\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.010\nSo, again, request fulfillment is\ngoing to determine, as a process, it's\n\n154\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.340\ngoing to determine what is requestable,\nwhat is the proper workflow for this.\n\n155\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.940\nThere could be other self-help types\nof requests, too, where you go and\n\n156\n00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.700\nfind it yourself.\n\n157\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.270\nRather than request from a technician,\nthe installation of new software.\n\n158\n00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.880\nPerhaps you put up a web portal, and\npeople can come in, and through that\n\n159\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.005\nworkflow, get access to downloadables so\nthey can install their own software.\n\n160\n00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:39.725\nAnd even that could have a workflow for\n\n161\n00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:41.605\nmanagement approval and\nthat sort of thing.\n\n162\n00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:45.860\nSo it doesn't necessarily mean human\nintervention, it just means you understand\n\n163\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.645\nneeds to be requested and you have\nthe appropriate workflows in place.\n\n164\n00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:54.023\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nin the overall framework of ITIL then,\n\n165\n00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:58.360\nTerry, like everything else in terms of\nprocesses that we've been talking about,\n\n166\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.020\neverything should have\nsome business value.\n\n167\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.330\nBesides the idea of a standardization\nwhere everybody can do that,\n\n168\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.760\nwhat are some of the business values that,\nwhat are other business values,\n\n169\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.560\nI should say, that request\nfulfillment really helps us out in?\n\n170\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, it gives you control, for one.\n\n171\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.003\nYou're not just passing out iPads everyday\nto everyone that asks for one, right?\n\n172\n00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:19.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n&gt;&gt; There needs to be some sort of process.\n\n173\n00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.730\nSo, you're getting in front of that and\nyou're being efficient.\n\n174\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.280\nSo, there could be cost savings for\nthe business.\n\n175\n00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.240\nMy first day of employment,\n\n176\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.725\nI call the service desk say,\nI'd like to have five iPads.\n\n177\n00:09:29.725 --> 00:09:31.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That'd be great, it's Christmas time.\n\n178\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.490\nBut again,\nyou're putting in some controls, right?\n\n179\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.200\nAnd some points of accountability and\ndata information about these things.\n\n180\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.870\nThe other business value is you get\ngood at this, you're efficient at it.\n\n181\n00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.960\nAgain, let's say it is legitimate for\na user to request an iPad, right?\n\n182\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.980\nShould the fulfillment process take\nthree weeks to figure this out and\n\n183\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.929\nget the appropriate approval?\n\n184\n00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:55.700\nCuz you're sending around emails to\neveryone and you're waiting for something.\n\n185\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.930\nOr should you streamline it in the way\nwhere approvals come more quickly?\n\n186\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.900\nAgain, request fulfillment is going\nto be the process that gets in\n\n187\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.820\nfront of these questions instead of\nbeing reactive to these questions.\n\n188\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nhelp us out with some of the policies and\n\n189\n00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.750\nsome of the principles that are really\ngonna drive us to push towards\n\n190\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.360\nimplementing some type of\nrequest fulfillment model.\n\n191\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, as we've talked about with all\nof our processes, they don't stand alone.\n\n192\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.220\nTo make processes work, there needs\nto be some governance around them and\n\n193\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.430\npolicy is a big part of that.\n\n194\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.280\nIt could be policies such as,\n\n195\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.947\nthou shall not pass out iPads\nunless they are paid for.\n\n196\n00:10:31.947 --> 00:10:33.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, obviously I'm being kinda\n\n197\n00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:34.670\nfacetious there.\n\n198\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.090\nBut basically that's what you're saying.\n\n199\n00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.420\nYou could have policies that suggest that\n\n200\n00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.110\nthings that cost money must go\nthrough management approval.\n\n201\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.030\nThat would be policy, right?\n\n202\n00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.330\nOr it could be a threshold of how much\nmoney that is, or it could be based on\n\n203\n00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.620\nyour position within the company,\nwhether you have to get permission.\n\n204\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.170\nSo policy would drive those\nkinds of questions about\n\n205\n00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.290\nhow this request fulfillment process\nis supposed to be governed, right?\n\n206\n00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.520\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry, you had just\nmentioned the idea of some type of self\n\n207\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:11.060\nportal, as helping us out in the idea\nof this request fulfillment.\n\n208\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.940\nWhat are some of the basic types of\nconcepts that we need to consider, if\n\n209\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.470\nall of a sudden that just clicked to light\nlike, we should automatically do that.\n\n210\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.580\nWhat are some of those concepts\nthat we need to really focus in on?\n\n211\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Well, just consider\nthe efficiencies of the service desk.\n\n212\n00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.350\nDo you want the service\ndesk taking a call?\n\n213\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.365\nDo you want the service\ndesk answering an email?\n\n214\n00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:34.545\nDo you want the service desk looking\nat a ticketing system, right?\n\n215\n00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:38.015\nThose are all potential options\nthat all could be available, right?\n\n216\n00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:41.635\nOr, do you want to set up a request\nfulfillment process that allows the user\n\n217\n00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:45.640\nto help themselves, thereby letting\nyour service desk work on incidents,\n\n218\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.970\nwhen you really need to restore services.\n\n219\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.680\nSo don't bother them with\nthe day to day things,\n\n220\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.560\ntry to automate some of these things.\n\n221\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.500\nAnd with today's technology,\n\n222\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.720\nit's not hard to develop workflows in such\na way that you can allow users to come\n\n223\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.240\nonto an interface and help themselves\nto the services they need and\n\n224\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.620\nhave their requests fulfilled\nthrough some sort of engine.\n\n225\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, along with this\nthen, if we implement something like this\n\n226\n00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.000\nwe also need to think about\nthings like SLAs as well, right?\n\n227\n00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, of course.\n\n228\n00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.850\nI think as a concept,\nservice level agreements,\n\n229\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.516\nhaving performance standards set in place,\ncould apply to just about any process.\n\n230\n00:12:23.516 --> 00:12:27.670\nBut certainly request fulfillment is\na process that faces users directly, and\n\n231\n00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.660\nif you're slow at this or inefficient or\nyou deliver the wrong thing, right?\n\n232\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.110\nThey ask for a pencil you gave them a pen,\nthey asked for a battery for\n\n233\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.630\nan HP laptop and you have a Mac, right?\n\n234\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.973\nIf the request fulfillment\nprocess is ineffective,\n\n235\n00:12:41.973 --> 00:12:45.340\nthen you're gonna be\ndissatisfying costumers.\n\n236\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.860\nSo if you wanna be concerned about\nhow you're serving customers,\n\n237\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.896\nkeeping score is important.\n\n238\n00:12:50.896 --> 00:12:54.290\nAnd therefore, having an agreement with\ncustomers that we will return iPads\n\n239\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.270\nwithin two days,\nwe will get you an iPad within two days.\n\n240\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.520\nSetting that expectation,\npublishing that expectation.\n\n241\n00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.800\nThen, if a user is waiting two days for\nan iPad,\n\n242\n00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.790\nthey shouldn't be screaming, they\nshould realize it just takes two days.\n\n243\n00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.900\nHaving a good negotiated agreement about\nhow quickly you will resolve your requests\n\n244\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.570\nis just good practice.\n\n245\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.060\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, I know one of the\nfrustrating things that I have with self\n\n246\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.580\nportals, like the self-help portals,\nis this ability to\n\n247\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.810\nunderstand where it's actually moving once\nI actually submit some type of request.\n\n248\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:27.990\nSo I don't know,\n\n249\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.350\nafter I submit it sometimes,\nwhether it's actually being worked on.\n\n250\n00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.490\nDid it get shuffled off, did it disappear\ninto the internet somewhere, or\n\n251\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.710\nwhatever may happen.\n\n252\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.900\nHow important is that process of\ntracking in something like this?\n\n253\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.780\n&gt;&gt; Obviously it's key.\n\n254\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.060\nTransparency and\nawareness of your users, and actually\n\n255\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.830\nof the people that are provisioning this\nrequest having that flow of information.\n\n256\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.691\nIf you're going to put up a portal,\na self-help portal, then the data and\n\n257\n00:13:53.691 --> 00:13:57.554\ninformation related to this request\nneeds to be clear, transparent, and\n\n258\n00:13:57.554 --> 00:14:01.319\navailable to both the requester and\nthose teams that are fulfilling it.\n\n259\n00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:05.358\nIt's amazing how easily you think that\nsomething like that could be tracked.\n\n260\n00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:09.592\nBut then I've done this before,\non incidences more than anything else,\n\n261\n00:14:09.592 --> 00:14:13.098\nwhere I've submitted something and\nI waited days and days.\n\n262\n00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:15.312\nAnd finally I submitted something else and\nthey're like,\n\n263\n00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:16.558\ndo you have the original number?\n\n264\n00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:19.741\nI was like, I don't even know\nif it was actually accepted or\n\n265\n00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:21.088\nif it was anything else.\n\n266\n00:14:21.088 --> 00:14:24.925\nAnd so, sometimes these things can come\nback if we don't have a system like that\n\n267\n00:14:24.925 --> 00:14:29.420\nto at least tell me it's pending, or it's\nbeen rejected, or whatever it might be.\n\n268\n00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.940\nSo, it's always one of those\nkind of Catch-22's for me.\n\n269\n00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.020\nWhenever I see somebody that says\njust submit this kinda contact form.\n\n270\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.275\nIf you don't have immediate contact,\nor something that says, hey,\n\n271\n00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:40.610\nwe're taking care of this.\n\n272\n00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.125\nYou kind of almost don't trust a system,\nor at least, a customer may go,\n\n273\n00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:45.810\nthat system doesn't work.\n\n274\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.730\nSo I think that this is one\nmore important elements,\n\n275\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.246\nespecially in a concept of\nrequest fulfillment like this.\n\n276\n00:14:51.246 --> 00:14:54.882\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, transparent communications,\n\n277\n00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:59.270\nbi-directional between customers and\nthe service provider,\n\n278\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.120\nis primarily driven, as ITIL would\nsuggest strongly, through a service desk.\n\n279\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.520\nSo if you wonder whether that request is\nstill floating out there to ether and\n\n280\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.950\nno one is managing it and you have\na question, if you pick up that phone or\n\n281\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.200\nyou get into a chat room with\na service desk technician.\n\n282\n00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.150\nThe service desk should certainly\nhave access to be able to find out\n\n283\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.430\nwhat's going on with this.\n\n284\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.400\nIf it's not transparent to the user and\n\n285\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.440\nthey call, then you need to be\nable to respond where it is.\n\n286\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.430\nAnd that also is a data point.\n\n287\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.870\nIf you end up with 50 calls\na day with people saying,\n\n288\n00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.360\nI don't know where my request is, I don't\nknow if it's being actioned or not.\n\n289\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.650\nThen you obviously have an opportunity for\nimproving.\n\n290\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.270\nAnd improvement doesn't mean you have\nto be faster at fulfilling requests.\n\n291\n00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.700\nIt just means you need\nto be more transparent.\n\n292\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, so how do we get that\ncoordinated a little bit better?\n\n293\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.360\nHow do we understand what's going on once\nwe have that idea of request fulfillment?\n\n294\n00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.975\nWhat type of activities are we\nreally taking a look at,\n\n295\n00:15:54.975 --> 00:16:00.179\nin terms of doing this type of request\nfulfillment once it's been submitted?\n\n296\n00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.640\nWell, it could be manual.\n\n297\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.955\nIt could be automated.\n\n298\n00:16:02.955 --> 00:16:07.015\nIt could be somewhere in between,\nwhere part of it is automated, and\n\n299\n00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:08.600\npart of it is manual.\n\n300\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.090\nThe key to this is not to define,\ncertainly not on this exam, and\n\n301\n00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.470\ncertainly not on this level of\nunderstanding, trying to found out how to\n\n302\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.120\ndo all these details, but to understand\nthat request fulfillment is the process\n\n303\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.670\nthat addresses these details, and\ncomes up with workable answers.\n\n304\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, as we start moving through\nthat then, another part of it then is,\n\n305\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.090\nhow do we know when the request\nis then fulfilled, right?\n\n306\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.110\nSo, how do we bring about this idea of\nclosure, is what we're taking a look at.\n\n307\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.370\n&gt;&gt; As you keep up with\nthe information about a request,\n\n308\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.530\nyou should certainly be having a dataset,\nhave the information stored in a system.\n\n309\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:53.443\nIt's not unusual for organizations to\nuse the same incident management system,\n\n310\n00:16:53.443 --> 00:16:55.520\nand request fulfillment system.\n\n311\n00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.340\nThey'd log it, right?\n\n312\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.260\nAnd they just log it with\na special categorization.\n\n313\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.840\nConversely, you could also have a separate\nrequest fulfillment dataset, right?\n\n314\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.320\nWhether you keep it in the same\ndatabase or separate databases,\n\n315\n00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.630\nyou need to keep up with data,\nand it's going to have status.\n\n316\n00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.980\nWhen it was requested,\nwhen it was processed, and\n\n317\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.590\nwhen it was actually completed.\n\n318\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.700\nAnd there should be some closure.\n\n319\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.960\nBy closure, I mean feedback from\nthe user that yep, I got it.\n\n320\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.890\nSo there should be,\nwhether that's automated, or\n\n321\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.690\nwhether that's interaction\nbetween two human beings.\n\n322\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.610\nYou need to go ahead and\n\n323\n00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.930\nlog the fact that the customer agrees,\nI got what I asked for.\n\n324\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.400\n&gt;&gt; So, it seems like end user\nsatisfaction is kind of the key here\n\n325\n00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.060\nin understanding that fulfillment and\nthat closure.\n\n326\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.720\nAnd that way, that ticket can\nthen be closed as we need it.\n\n327\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.080\nSo, there really seems to\nbe a lot of elements that\n\n328\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.980\nI may not have considered before.\n\n329\n00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.900\nWhen I think about the idea of just\nsubmitting some type of request,\n\n330\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.160\nI just normally think somebody\nhas the answer at the other end.\n\n331\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.620\nThey should just be able to tell me,\nand I'm done.\n\n332\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.480\nBut in this way of doing things,\n\n333\n00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.570\nwe might be able to set that model\nup to say if that's a simple answer,\n\n334\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:07.300\nwe give it them, or if it's a more\ncomplex after an incident of some sort,\n\n335\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.040\nand I don't have the technical skills\nto answer it, we might escalate it.\n\n336\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.220\nSo we're actually just trying to figure\nout where the information goes, so\n\n337\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.880\nthat the fulfillment can be done, right?\n\n338\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.100\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n339\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.880\nThat's right.\n\n340\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.024\nIt's certainly your service desk\npeople would need to understand\n\n341\n00:18:20.024 --> 00:18:22.560\nthe difference between a request,\nand an incident.\n\n342\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.610\nAnd with that good training,\nthey would route it accordingly.\n\n343\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\nunderstanding that.\n\n344\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.730\nAnd for us to actually move on,\n\n345\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.140\nwe also need to address this idea of\nwhat you call inner process interfaces.\n\n346\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.670\nSo, what are we taking a look at here\nwhen we start to talk about that?\n\n347\n00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.790\nWe now know that the idea of\nrequest fulfillment really can hit\n\n348\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.630\nchange management.\n\n349\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.820\nIt can do other things here.\n\n350\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.210\nWhat are some of the other\nthings that we're talking about?\n\n351\n00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.620\n&gt;&gt; I think to start this conversation,\nor to continue this conversation,\n\n352\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.310\nwe'll have a look at the graphic here.\n\n353\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.850\nAnd there are several points of interface\nwith other life cycle stages and\n\n354\n00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.270\nthe processes within.\n\n355\n00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.070\nCertainly, request fulfillment could\nbe something that costs somebody some\n\n356\n00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.320\nmoney, right?\n\n357\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.840\nIf you're requesting an iPad,\n\n358\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.800\nthat's gonna be something that's gonna\nhave some sort of cost for somewhere.\n\n359\n00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.405\nIs there some sort of cost transfer\nthrough your organization for\n\n360\n00:19:10.405 --> 00:19:12.835\nthat type of request?\n\n361\n00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:15.585\nSo, you're gonna be interfacing\nwith the of financial management,\n\n362\n00:19:15.585 --> 00:19:17.695\nas you see up there in service strategy.\n\n363\n00:19:17.695 --> 00:19:21.455\nService design, actually service\ndesign is going to be describing what\n\n364\n00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:23.440\nthings need to be requested.\n\n365\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.430\nSo, service design is kind of\ngoing to be leading the charge on\n\n366\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.770\nwhat is going to be available\nwithin the service.\n\n367\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.860\nPerhaps some of the services you're\ndesigning really needs special equipment,\n\n368\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.820\nand therefore, the users of this service\nare need, need to have some sort\n\n369\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.216\nof provisioning mechanism to get that\npiece of equipment to make it work.\n\n370\n00:19:41.216 --> 00:19:45.439\nRight, I worked with R&amp;D scientists\nin service provision, and\n\n371\n00:19:45.439 --> 00:19:50.680\nthey needed certain measurement\ninstruments that were IT-type instruments.\n\n372\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.870\nThey captured information in,\nand then put it into a database.\n\n373\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.600\nAgain, service design\nwould be discerning what\n\n374\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.590\nis going to make this service successful.\n\n375\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.000\nDoes it require certain\nthings to be provisioned?\n\n376\n00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.270\nTherefore, you need to put up a request\nfor film and process in front of it.\n\n377\n00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.570\nOf course, service transition,\nwe've talked about this already.\n\n378\n00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.830\nRequests that come in can be something for\na change, right?\n\n379\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.220\nSo, it's gonna be interfacing\nwith release and deployment.\n\n380\n00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.180\nAsset configuration management,\nand of course, change management.\n\n381\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.640\nAnd finally, operations,\nwe've also talked about that.\n\n382\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.150\nService operations is dealing with\nincident and problem management.\n\n383\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.150\nAnd a very special type of request is\nI need access to something, right?\n\n384\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.230\nI need to have access to the HR database.\n\n385\n00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.650\nSo, there's a request that comes in\nthat's going through a process called\n\n386\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.170\naccess management.\n\n387\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:37.830\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, Terry.\n\n388\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:43.690\nSo, let's talk about, now that we've\ngot this idea in our minds here,\n\n389\n00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.840\nabout the information that's\nrequired to make sure that\n\n390\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.710\nthe request fulfillment is going to be\nsuccessful the way that we want to.\n\n391\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.110\nSo, what are some of the sources of\ninformation we're taking a look at?\n\n392\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not just the sources,\n\n393\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.880\nit's the info you're gonna\nhave to keep up with.\n\n394\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.870\nObviously there's sources, there's inputs\ncoming in, you're gonna keep up with.\n\n395\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.310\nI mean,\nthe request itself is a point of input.\n\n396\n00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.810\nSomeone making a phone call,\nor getting in the chat engine,\n\n397\n00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.480\nor engaging with hour self-help.\n\n398\n00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.790\nThat is a point of interface, and\na point of information gathering.\n\n399\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.250\nSomething has been requested as\na data point you need to know, right?\n\n400\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.630\nSo, coming up with the information and\nkeeping track of this information\n\n401\n00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.300\nis gonna be critical to\nasses a request fulfillment.\n\n402\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.980\nAnd then in terms of outputs,\nyou might want to know\n\n403\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.920\nhow many iPads were requested this week,\nhow many iPads were requested this month?\n\n404\n00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.400\nIs it slowing down, is it going up, right?\n\n405\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.710\nSo, being able to extract this information\nto get some meaningful knowledge out of it\n\n406\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.028\nis going to be important as well, right?\n\n407\n00:21:37.028 --> 00:21:40.340\nSo, request fulfillment is going to\nbe defining these processes, but\n\n408\n00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.370\nalso going to enable the, I'm sorry,\nwe're gonna be describing these steps you\n\n409\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.490\ntake to get the request fulfilled, but\nit's also gonna be making sure that\n\n410\n00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.380\nthe information is tracked in such a way\nthat you can effectively manage this flow.\n\n411\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n412\n00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.287\nJust like all the other processes as well,\n\n413\n00:21:56.287 --> 00:22:00.781\nrequest fulfillment doesn't stand by\nitself as being saying I have it in place,\n\n414\n00:22:00.781 --> 00:22:04.301\nand that makes it a success,\nwhich apparently, I can't say.\n\n415\n00:22:04.301 --> 00:22:06.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that makes it a success.\n\n416\n00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.050\nSo, what are some of the critical success\nfactors that we're talking about,\n\n417\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.752\nand some of the KPIs?\n\n418\n00:22:11.752 --> 00:22:15.280\n&gt;&gt; We've touched a little bit already,\nthe speed which you\n\n419\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.240\nfulfill requests is gonna be something\nthat's gonna be concern of the user.\n\n420\n00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.590\nSo, you should probably keep\nscrolling on that, right?\n\n421\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.840\nThat you're delivering them on time,\nit's not necessarily you do it fast,\n\n422\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.390\nyou deliver it as intended, right?\n\n423\n00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.540\nAs agreed.\n\n424\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.470\nSo, certainly keep in score on the\nefficiency of your request process, and\n\n425\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.550\nI think just sheer volume, right?\n\n426\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.960\nThe sheer volume of request\nis a standard metric.\n\n427\n00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.920\nDo you want to keep score on\nthe volume and the efficiency, right?\n\n428\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.910\nSo, as you look here on the inter graphic,\n\n429\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.030\nyou can see,\nare they efficient and timely?\n\n430\n00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.840\nWe talked about that, so, meantime,\nelapse before handling requests, right?\n\n431\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.470\nSo, the requests, you have the time\nstarts when it's requested,\n\n432\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.840\nhow long that it take to get it fulfilled?\n\n433\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.710\nAverage costs,\n\n434\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.430\nper service request, could be built into\nthe number of man hours actually required.\n\n435\n00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.670\nAs a person, have to go do something.\n\n436\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.600\nKeeping score on this could lead you\nto some recommendations for automation.\n\n437\n00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.000\nIf you're spending $3000\na week in person hours,\n\n438\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.610\ntrying to fulfill requests,\n$3000 a week can add up to an investment.\n\n439\n00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.140\nThen say, maybe we can automate this,\n\n440\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.800\nand put some sort of engine\nin front of it, right?\n\n441\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.030\nAgain, depending on the scale and\n\n442\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.460\nthe size of your organization,\nautomation can be a big deal.\n\n443\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.330\nAnd justifying that automation could\nbe based on the metrics you find here.\n\n444\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, one of the interesting\ncritical success factors I see here\n\n445\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.260\nthough, is that second one.\n\n446\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.809\nOnly authorized requests can be fulfilled.\n\n447\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.070\nDo we really have to worry about\nunauthorized requests that much,\n\n448\n00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.100\nthat we have to state something like this?\n\n449\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.490\n&gt;&gt; Let's say it's the first day of\nemployment, I call the service desk and\n\n450\n00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.150\nsay I'd like five iPads.\n\n451\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.665\nAnd they'd give me five iPads, and I make\nmy family happy this Christmas, right?\n\n452\n00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:51.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Obviously,\n\n453\n00:23:51.786 --> 00:23:53.623\nthat sounds unauthorized to me, right?\n\n454\n00:23:53.623 --> 00:23:54.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not something that\n\n455\n00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.140\nnormally happens.\n\n456\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.076\nSo, having these things in\ncontrol through policy, and\n\n457\n00:23:58.076 --> 00:23:59.982\nthen limiting the numbers of those.\n\n458\n00:23:59.982 --> 00:24:03.650\nSo, that authorization for an iPad is\nprobably gonna come from a manager.\n\n459\n00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.642\nRight.\nIt's probably that an employee is not\n\n460\n00:24:05.642 --> 00:24:07.979\ngonna be able to say I want one and\nthey get it, right?\n\n461\n00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:10.576\nSo there's probably something\nin this workflow for\n\n462\n00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:14.364\nthat type of request that suggests\nthe manager has to come in and justify it.\n\n463\n00:24:14.364 --> 00:24:18.023\nAnd again perhaps there is some cost\ncenter magic happening in the back end, or\n\n464\n00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:21.242\nthis manager's cost center actually\ngets attributed to that cost,\n\n465\n00:24:21.242 --> 00:24:22.610\nthat sort of thing.\n\n466\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.038\nSo understanding authorized and\nunauthorized simply means you understand\n\n467\n00:24:27.038 --> 00:24:31.197\nwhat can be done without permission\nwhat must be done with permission.\n\n468\n00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n469\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.123\nAnd I started to get out a little bit more\nas we start to buy more and more items and\n\n470\n00:24:36.123 --> 00:24:38.070\nwe might need more support.\n\n471\n00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.848\nThere's usually a time when somebody on\nthe phone asks like \"what's the service\n\n472\n00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:43.617\ntag number?\n\n473\n00:24:43.617 --> 00:24:47.390\nOr what the i or\na serial number is to that device.\n\n474\n00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.610\nThat's kind of a very\nbasic form of saying,\n\n475\n00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.560\nwe wanna make sure that this is\nactually a device that you bought, and\n\n476\n00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.830\nthat's yours, and\nthat they can trace it back.\n\n477\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.657\nSo I can see that.\n\n478\n00:24:56.657 --> 00:24:59.681\nSo it could be very possibly\nthat somebody just might go,\n\n479\n00:24:59.681 --> 00:25:04.180\nI just wanna see what the information is\nand let me see what I can get from this.\n\n480\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.226\nWhere they might not have actually,\nnot supposed to be able to do that.\n\n481\n00:25:07.226 --> 00:25:11.610\nAnd we have that here at ITProTV,\nwhere were try and be very good at\n\n482\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.870\nresponding to our membership about\nthe idea of requesting content.\n\n483\n00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:21.280\nSo we have a content request form that\nwe allow people to just simply say,\n\n484\n00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.900\nhey here's a show I'd like to see.\n\n485\n00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.850\nBut we do know that if we just open it up,\nwe'll have requests for everything.\n\n486\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.020\nSo we usually limit it to our membership\nand that way, only if they're a member,\n\n487\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.800\nthey can submit something like that.\n\n488\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.180\nSo the link's right there,\nit's available for\n\n489\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.200\nanybody that wants to go to our website,\nbut\n\n490\n00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.690\nonly if they're actually a member will\nthey get access to something like that.\n\n491\n00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.810\n&gt;&gt; And that's very good,\nyou're asking for something.\n\n492\n00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.790\nYou're actually putting something in\nfront of customers that allow them to\n\n493\n00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.960\ninteract with you.\n\n494\n00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.260\nSo requests can be just for dialog,\nthey can be for dialog back and forth.\n\n495\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.510\nYou mentioned the idea of cost.\n\n496\n00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.530\nA classic example of cost that\ncan be perhaps recaptured is for\n\n497\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.110\nsoftware licensing.\n\n498\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.970\nWe automated the process.\n\n499\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.680\nUsers could go out and\ndownload software, and\n\n500\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.120\nit didn't really have to ask for\npermission if it was less than $200.\n\n501\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.450\nSo if I go out there and I install\nMicrosoft Project because I wanna\n\n502\n00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:17.870\ndo a demo next week but I'm not really\na project manager and I don't use it.\n\n503\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.563\nThe software request fulfillment\nengine was able to keep up.\n\n504\n00:26:21.563 --> 00:26:25.227\nNot only was installed in my laptop,\nit knew how often I used it.\n\n505\n00:26:25.227 --> 00:26:30.536\nAnd if I didn't use it, it knew and I also\ngot an email that says you know what,\n\n506\n00:26:30.536 --> 00:26:34.135\nyou're not actually using this,\nplease verify and\n\n507\n00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:38.280\nconfirm you still need it,\nif not you press the button.\n\n508\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.170\nAnd by golly,\nit was then installed for my machine.\n\n509\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.090\nAnd they could reallocate that license\nto someone else that really needed it.\n\n510\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.468\nSo request fulfillment can\nbe quite elaborate but\n\n511\n00:26:47.468 --> 00:26:49.806\nyou have to have it under control.\n\n512\n00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:54.268\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry moving on with the\nidea of helping us and the Agile framework\n\n513\n00:26:54.268 --> 00:26:58.810\nas well, we also need to address the idea\nof the challenges and the risks as well.\n\n514\n00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.954\nSince you've already told us that\nchallenges are essentially risks that take\n\n515\n00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.049\nwhatever is gonna happen,\n\n516\n00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:06.585\nwhat are some of those challenges and\nthen help us to identify the risks, too.\n\n517\n00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we certainly have talked\nabout some of these already.\n\n518\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.700\nWhat is a request?\n\n519\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.295\nThat's a challenge.\n\n520\n00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:13.364\nWhat are you gonna put\na request engine in front of?\n\n521\n00:27:13.364 --> 00:27:15.330\nAnd by engine I mean process.\n\n522\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.570\nIs it a service desk call,\nIs it a automated system,\n\n523\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.760\nwhatever that might be,\nthat engine that gets requests fulfilled.\n\n524\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.690\nWhat is going to be requestable,\nis gonna be a challenge you face, right?\n\n525\n00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.710\nAre you handle it ad-hoc, or are you gonna\nformalize it, is another key question.\n\n526\n00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.712\nIs it so\nrare that you don't need to formalize it,\n\n527\n00:27:34.712 --> 00:27:36.788\nthat could be a decision you make.\n\n528\n00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:39.539\nSo that's certainly\na challenge you're gonna face,\n\n529\n00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:42.466\nand then also keeping up with\nthe data on these things, and\n\n530\n00:27:42.466 --> 00:27:46.292\nmanaging the data after you prop up\nwhat's gonna be a requestable service,\n\n531\n00:27:46.292 --> 00:27:49.510\nyou need to also keep score, and\nhow are you gonna keep score?\n\n532\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.261\nThat's gonna be a challenge you face.\n\n533\n00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:54.414\n&gt;&gt; All right, so some of the risks that we\nmight face is that even though we think\n\n534\n00:27:54.414 --> 00:27:58.380\nwe've got a good system, it could turn\nout just to be poor quality, right?\n\n535\n00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.102\nYeah it could be.\n\n536\n00:27:59.102 --> 00:28:03.332\nAnd so if you're not keeping score the\nrisk is that you're passing out iPads to\n\n537\n00:28:03.332 --> 00:28:07.305\npeople that don't need them or shouldn't\nhave them or it could be that you\n\n538\n00:28:07.305 --> 00:28:11.756\nregularly miss, you install the wrong\nsoftware, or the wrong version, right?\n\n539\n00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:15.030\nBecause you're not keeping score\non the proper version of things.\n\n540\n00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.180\nSo, as you open these things up\nthere is certainly gonna be snugs so\n\n541\n00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.230\nthe risk is not tending to those\nsnugs you would lose control.\n\n542\n00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.106\nAnd, again, if you pass me up five iPads,\n\n543\n00:28:25.106 --> 00:28:27.150\nI might appreciate your\ninefficient system.\n\n544\n00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.334\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And have a very merry Christmas.\n\n545\n00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:30.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\n\n546\n00:28:30.235 --> 00:28:34.318\nalong with this of course, then, are what\nare the essential roles that we're taking\n\n547\n00:28:34.318 --> 00:28:37.790\na look, if we're gonna establish\nthe idea of risk fulfillment.\n\n548\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.230\nI'm assuming we're gonna have a process\nowner, and a process manager.\n\n549\n00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.830\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n550\n00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.920\n&gt;&gt; And then practitioner as well?\n\n551\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.540\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\na very special name for practitioner,\n\n552\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.340\nthey refer to as a fulfillment analyst.\n\n553\n00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.560\nSomeone who's actually\ndoing the keeping score,\n\n554\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.840\ndoing some analysis of,\nhow many requests did we have this week?\n\n555\n00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.170\nIs it going up, is it going down?\n\n556\n00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.610\nAre costs being accounted for\nappropriately?\n\n557\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.800\nEtc., so having this analyst, the data,\nthe devil's in the details there.\n\n558\n00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.800\nSo having an analyst take\ncare of the data issues and\n\n559\n00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.290\ninformation issues is gonna\nbe a key role as well.\n\n560\n00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.520\nAnd as you said, Ronnie,\ncertainly someone accountable for\n\n561\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.110\nthe process itself through\nthe ownership and a manager.\n\n562\n00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:15.680\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n563\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.180\nSo Terry,\n\n564\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.350\nthat's a lot of information in taking\nlook at the idea of request fulfillment.\n\n565\n00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:25.320\nBut it doesn't seem like it's one of those\nthat requires some real special magic.\n\n566\n00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.850\nIt seems fairly intuitive and\nstraightforward, but\n\n567\n00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.360\nit's a great reminder for\nus especially when preparing for the exam.\n\n568\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.700\nSo, Terry help us out as we\nare getting ready for the exam.\n\n569\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.220\nWhat are some of the things\nthat we can do to help us\n\n570\n00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.350\nto make sure that we have\nthese things in our mind?\n\n571\n00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:43.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a good exercise for\nyou downloadable.\n\n572\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.750\nYou can look at it on the screen here,\n\n573\n00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.060\nsimply called request\nfulfillment activities, right?\n\n574\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.570\nSo it has an intuitive name.\n\n575\n00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.750\nThe suggestion there takes\nonly five minutes give or\n\n576\n00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.050\ntake, probably gonna be less than that.\n\n577\n00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.240\nBut what that lets you do is dive in and\n\n578\n00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:02.030\ntake a measured look at the complexities\nof this particular process.\n\n579\n00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.757\nWe talked about it conceptually,\n\n580\n00:30:03.757 --> 00:30:07.106\nthis is gonna give your some practice\nhow to apply this knowledge.\n\n581\n00:30:07.106 --> 00:30:09.410\nAgain, concept I think\nare fairly intuitive, but\n\n582\n00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.120\nhow would you then apply this\nto give in case studies.\n\n583\n00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.460\nThat's gonna be helpful as you prepare for\nthe exam and\n\n584\n00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.000\nalso very helpful as you take this back\nto the office and try to implement.\n\n585\n00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, well once again thank\nyou for helping us to understand request\n\n586\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:26.580\nfulfillment at the degree that we need\nto and helping us with that activity\n\n587\n00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:33.170\nas we continue to move on towards\nthe fulfillment of our request as well.\n\n588\n00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.080\nIt really does help to make sure\nthat we cement these things in our\n\n589\n00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.960\nmind right now as we go back.\n\n590\n00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.990\nBig part of the process of\nrelease control and validation.\n\n591\n00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.970\nSo it's also a great place for us to\ntake a break now and end this episode.\n\n592\n00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.630\nSigning off for\nITPro.TV I've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n593\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.630\n&gt;&gt;

They describe the need for change evaluation is normally on a larger scope in terms of business strategy rather than on a technical implementation level.  These types of evaluations can effect the business outcome, the service operation and even the infrastructure of the organization, according to the guys.  Terry also describes some of key terminology, activities and factors (STORMPUP) that must be considered in the change evaluation.  Lastly, they summary the entire process with reminder to try and apply the knowledge learned!",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.750\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and, today,\nwe're diving into ITIL release control and\n\n6\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.820\nvalidation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.790\nWe're specifically\ndiving in to that realm,\n\n8\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.170\nthat specific realm,\nof the change evaluation process.\n\n9\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.480\nAnd here to help us is our ITEL\nexpert himself, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.520\nTerry, welcome back to\nthe ITPro.TV studios.\n\n11\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370\n&gt;&gt; As always, glad to be here, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.580\nChange evaluation has an interesting\nevolution, if you will.\n\n13\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.190\nYou may recall that we had\nservice validation and testing.\n\n14\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.370\nAnd the evolution of that\nparticular process started off\n\n15\n00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.220\nas it being embedded within release and\ndeployment management.\n\n16\n00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.062\nAnd you'll recall at release and\n\n17\n00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:55.692\ndeployment management has one\nof its stages is testing, right?\n\n18\n00:00:55.692 --> 00:01:00.729\nThrough ITIL research and\nthe librarians doing their due diligence.\n\n19\n00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.418\nThey discovered that testing\nwas important enough and\n\n20\n00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:06.053\ndetailed enough that it\ndeserved it's own process.\n\n21\n00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:08.260\nWell that's what change\nevaluation is about.\n\n22\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.060\nChange evaluation is an activity that's\ngoing to happen in change management.\n\n23\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.620\nIt certainly is.\n\n24\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.930\nWe talked about change management.\n\n25\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.840\nAnd they're going to evaluate\nchanges as they come in.\n\n26\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.670\nAs time went on and\nas this evolved, they realized,\n\n27\n00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.350\nthe ITIL librarians that is, that change\nevaluation could be significant enough and\n\n28\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.150\nbig enough that it\ndeserves its own process.\n\n29\n00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.770\nAnd here we have it, we have change\nevaluation as a separate process.\n\n30\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.822\nI'll say this just to\nset the context here.\n\n31\n00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:37.950\nChange evaluation is not necessarily\nformalized for every single change you do.\n\n32\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.840\nYou don't have to be as formal for some\nchanges as you would for others, right.\n\n33\n00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.499\nSo this idea of change evaluation as a\nprocess being defined is probably going to\n\n34\n00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.871\nbe defined through your change models.\n\n35\n00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.746\nAnd remember a change model is a way that\nyou treat specific types of changes in\n\n36\n00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:59.000\na pre-defined way, so for big changes,\nchange evaluation may be in play.\n\n37\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.840\nFor those day to day changes that you tend\nto do after a service is operational,\n\n38\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200\nmaybe change evaluation is\nnot quite as formal, right?\n\n39\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.625\nSo that's just kinda set the context for\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n40\n00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:14.060\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Terry, just help me out\nwith like a specific example of what you\n\n41\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.566\nmight mean by the idea of evaluating\nchange for lets say like an infrastructure\n\n42\n00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:22.959\nof something or some type of business\nvalue that we might be taking a look at.\n\n43\n00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Well good,\ngood do a compare and contrast.\n\n44\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.710\nLets say the change you're managing\nnow is the patching of your severs.\n\n45\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.327\nYou have a server say 300 servers and\n\n46\n00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:37.565\nyou need to get them up to\na certain patch level right.\n\n47\n00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:39.515\nYou're probably gonna have\na change model for that.\n\n48\n00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:44.242\nYou're gonna have a standard way that you\napproach those types of changes right.\n\n49\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:47.880\nAnd you've probably already evaluated\nwhat the risk benefit is for\n\n50\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.510\ndelaying, testing, etc.\n\n51\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.869\nSo when that kind of change comes your way\na formal change evaluation process may not\n\n52\n00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.428\nbe required because you've already\ndefined it within your model.\n\n53\n00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.670\nBut let's take another server\ninfrastructure type of question.\n\n54\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.670\nLet's say you're going to go\nto a virtualization strategy.\n\n55\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.290\nYou've had hard box servers interacts for\nyears but now you wanna virtualize that.\n\n56\n00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.240\nThat's a different kind of game right?\n\n57\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.520\nYou're talking about evaluating a cost,\nbenefit analysis of virtualization,\n\n58\n00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.270\nthe level of effort,\ndo you have the right skill set?\n\n59\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.620\nWas the impact gonna be on customer\nfacing processes if we virtualize things?\n\n60\n00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.930\nIs performance gonna go down, is it gonna\ngo up, is it gonna be the same, right?\n\n61\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.778\nSo that's a bit more complicated,\ntherefore, having a more formal process\n\n62\n00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:37.864\nfor change evaluation for that type of\ninfrastructure change might be in order.\n\n63\n00:03:37.864 --> 00:03:42.539\n&gt;&gt; All right so when we start to take\na look then at some of the issues here.\n\n64\n00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:47.114\nWhat you're really trying to help us to\nunderstand is that this is kind of not\n\n65\n00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:50.409\nnecessary again for\nevery little tiny detail change.\n\n66\n00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.041\nBut if it's gonna cause us to re-evaluate\nlike a service that we're really gonna\n\n67\n00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:59.190\nchange or the overall nature\nof what we're providing.\n\n68\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.780\nThat this is where we have\nto think about it and\n\n69\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.330\nmake sure we formalize\nthat process of doing so.\n\n70\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.570\n&gt;&gt; And the value in doing so.\n\n71\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.380\nI think if I speak to the value\nof doing this formally,\n\n72\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.840\nis that you will be focused on\nthe business evaluation of this.\n\n73\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.440\nWhat I mean by that is, let's say you\nwanna virtualize your server estate.\n\n74\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.750\nThis is something a lot of\norganizations have done and\n\n75\n00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.990\nthey've done it to save money.\n\n76\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.000\nHard boxes cost more than\nvirtual servers period.\n\n77\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.810\nRight they just cost less.\n\n78\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.430\nThey're more efficiently administered,\nIT might say.\n\n79\n00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.780\nThe customer may say, so.\n\n80\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.270\nI mean, what does the business\ncare about IT efficiencies?\n\n81\n00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.560\nSo translating that IT efficiency in\nsomething the business cares about\n\n82\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.170\nis more important.\n\n83\n00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.050\nSo change evaluation will\nnecessarily have this focus on\n\n84\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.280\nwhat is the value we're delivering.\n\n85\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.710\nSure, we're becoming more efficient.\n\n86\n00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.220\nWhat does that mean to the users?\n\n87\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.280\nMaybe we're saving money.\n\n88\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.541\nWhat does that mean to the end users?\n\n89\n00:04:56.541 --> 00:05:01.220\nRight maybe we can be more\nflexible in providing service and\n\n90\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.580\ntherefore more responsive to every\nchanging business needs, right.\n\n91\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.700\nSo again your pointing\ntowards the business,\n\n92\n00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.390\npointing toward the customers when\nyou do this change evaluation.\n\n93\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.110\nAnd chances are you're gonna\ndo a before and after.\n\n94\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.570\nIf you're gonna promise some efficiencies\non the business side not just for\n\n95\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.010\nIT, then measure those efficiencies\non the other side after the change.\n\n96\n00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.470\nSo that's another key aspect\nof change evaluation,\n\n97\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.460\nis it has this predictive nature.\n\n98\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.400\nWhat is the expected impact, the intended\nresults we hope to get, right?\n\n99\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.970\nAnd then of course,\nlook at the other side of the changes and\n\n100\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.210\ndid we reach those intended results?\n\n101\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.340\nOf course, it's also gonna be\nevaluating on the other side,\n\n102\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.440\nthose unintended results, which could be\npositive but they also might be negative.\n\n103\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.980\nSo change evaluation's gonna try to\nbe predictive of these risks and\n\n104\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.420\npredictive of the value, so\nthe risk benefit analysis.\n\n105\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.130\nAnd also, on the other side of the change,\n\n106\n00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.540\nchange evaluation is going\nto follow through with,\n\n107\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.960\ndid we get the value we intended to get,\nand did we mitigate the risk fully?\n\n108\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.870\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry,\nhelp us with iTel here a little bit more.\n\n109\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.155\nAgain, we understand it's not\na prescriptive type of process that we're\n\n110\n00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:08.909\nlooking at.\n\n111\n00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.012\nBut at the same time when you start\ntalking about change evaluation then,\n\n112\n00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:19.789\nis there a particular or how should we say\nthat we went through enough evaluations?\n\n113\n00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:20.666\nDoes that make sense?\n\n114\n00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:25.900\nDo we need to take more time in\nevaluating this process or less time, or\n\n115\n00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.700\nare we talking about that as well,\nthat ITIL just doesn't care?\n\n116\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.670\nOr is this something else when we start\ntalking about the details behind that?\n\n117\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.845\n&gt;&gt; Every process should have clear\n\n118\n00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:36.627\nobjectives is what it's\nsupposed to be delivering.\n\n119\n00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:37.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n120\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.053\n&gt;&gt; And that should be value.\n\n121\n00:06:39.053 --> 00:06:41.900\nThe process should be fit for\npurpose and providing something.\n\n122\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.710\nIt shouldn't be a process just for\nthe sake of process.\n\n123\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.480\nSo, we'll look at, a little bit later,\n\n124\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.320\nabout key performance indicators and\ncritical success factor for this process.\n\n125\n00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.750\nBut effectively and\ngenerically what you're going to do for\n\n126\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.410\nany process is you're going to make\nsomeone accountable for it and\n\n127\n00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.580\nmake sure it is fit for purpose.\n\n128\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.842\nSo to address the concerns of\nhow you improve ,or do you even\n\n129\n00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:09.643\nneed it is going to be driven by\nhaving a dedicated process owner.\n\n130\n00:07:09.643 --> 00:07:14.573\n&gt;&gt; All right so lets talk about some of\nthe policies then that really do help us\n\n131\n00:07:14.573 --> 00:07:19.720\nto drive along the need and\nthe idea for the change evaluation.\n\n132\n00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.935\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n133\n00:07:20.935 --> 00:07:25.837\nI think policy as with other processes\nis kind of repeating this same\n\n134\n00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:29.670\nsong is that processes\ndon't exist on an island.\n\n135\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.490\nThey need policies to bolster them and\nback them up.\n\n136\n00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.580\nAs it relates to change evaluation.\n\n137\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.820\nPolicies may state\nthe general parameters for\n\n138\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.070\nwhat type of changes need\nformal evaluation processes.\n\n139\n00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.590\nPerhaps a formal evaluation is required.\n\n140\n00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.460\nFor any big change such as a change\nproposal to bring in a brand new service.\n\n141\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.312\nThe type of change I mentioned earlier\nwhere you wanna virtualize your\n\n142\n00:07:51.312 --> 00:07:51.996\nserver estate.\n\n143\n00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:56.814\nThat might be of scale that you want\nto make sure you have a full change of\n\n144\n00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:57.840\nevaluation on.\n\n145\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.892\nSo policies will set in play When\na change evaluation is required and\n\n146\n00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:06.301\nwhen a formal change evaluation is\nrequired and when a steady state kind of\n\n147\n00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:12.232\noperational changes can just be managed\nwithout a fully formal change evaluation.\n\n148\n00:08:12.232 --> 00:08:17.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the idea of evaluating is\nthat we also have the idea what the end\n\n149\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.810\nresult is in mind.\n\n150\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.550\nSo as we start to implement this idea for\n\n151\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.480\nthe concept, right, what do we do with\ndeviations when we don't get that?\n\n152\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.670\nDo we just move on with it or do we\nchange the actual evaluation process?\n\n153\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.930\nWhat are we taking a look at here?\n\n154\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.050\n&gt;&gt; I'll give you some examples here.\n\n155\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.060\nI'll stay with that server\nvirtualization example.\n\n156\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.660\nServer virtualization promises\nmoney savings for IT.\n\n157\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.490\nIt promises ease in administration for IT.\n\n158\n00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.870\nIt perhaps therefore provides\nsome efficiencies for IT.\n\n159\n00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.440\nIf you did a formal change\nevaluation process, and\n\n160\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.870\njust pointed to all the IT values,\nthen those would be the values you chase.\n\n161\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.220\nAnd the customers are saying so what?\n\n162\n00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.560\nThey're not really seeing it.\n\n163\n00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.850\nIf, on the other hand, your change\nevaluation process does lead to\n\n164\n00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.600\nanalysis of what does this mean in terms\nof delivering services to customers?\n\n165\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.230\nAre we gonna be better for the customers?\n\n166\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.350\nWhat does this mean for them?\n\n167\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.120\nSo I think a great way to\nanswer your question would be,\n\n168\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.050\nif change evaluation is allowing you to\nincrease value for your end users and\n\n169\n00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.670\nfor your customers, then change\nevaluation is providing value, right.\n\n170\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.710\nAnd staying within that example.\n\n171\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.200\nFrom my own experience on\nserver virtualization,\n\n172\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.900\nwe did focus just on the IT\nbased value statements.\n\n173\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.030\nWe're gonna save IT money, we're\ngonna be more efficient in IT, right.\n\n174\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.170\nAnd we sold that to the business that\nwe will be able to charge you less for\n\n175\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.800\nservers.\n\n176\n00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.190\nThe business just kind of\nscratched their head and says,\n\n177\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.450\nI didn't realize what the cost of servers\nwere in the first place so, thank you.\n\n178\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.880\nCarry on, right, that kind of thing.\n\n179\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.110\nIt wasn't meaningful to them.\n\n180\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.510\nLater on, I wouldn't say by accident,\nbut later on,\n\n181\n00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.300\nwe realized the value of virtualization\nin our testing environments.\n\n182\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.770\nWe could more easily replicate our\nproduction environment into testing and\n\n183\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.080\ntherefore we had better testing.\n\n184\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.910\nNow that's getting closer to\nsomething that customers cares about.\n\n185\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.240\nYou can say because their\ntesting is more accurate and\n\n186\n00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.658\nmore effective we launch\nservices with fewer flaws, right?\n\n187\n00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:22.630\nSo again, connecting the dots\nbetween your activities and\n\n188\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.760\nwhat you'd expect to get is\nwhat change evaluation's about.\n\n189\n00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.800\nAnd diving deep and focusing on how\nis this gonna help the customers and\n\n190\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.860\nend users is fundamental.\n\n191\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, so in that change evaluation\nthen, is there a particular type\n\n192\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.590\nof concept that we might actually\nfocus in on on the evaluation side?\n\n193\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.170\nYou mentioned specifically something\nlike plan, do, check, and act.\n\n194\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.890\nWhat do we normally mean by that\nin terms of the evaluation?\n\n195\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.610\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n196\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.660\nPlan, do, check, act,\n\n197\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.750\notherwise known as the Deming cycle is\na methodology of continuous improvement.\n\n198\n00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:02.190\nSo the nature of plan, do, check, act is\nyou plan to do something to bring value.\n\n199\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.540\nYou then you do that.\n\n200\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.330\nPlan, do.\n\n201\n00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.590\nYou then do the thing you plan to do.\n\n202\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.530\nAnd then you check, right.\n\n203\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.970\nDid you deliver the value\nintended to deliver?\n\n204\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.830\nAnd of course the next action\ncould be based on that answer.\n\n205\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.375\nDid you deliver the value\nintended to deliver?\n\n206\n00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.320\nDid you deliver a part of it?\n\n207\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.560\nDid you deliver all of it?\n\n208\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.603\nWere there things that\ncould have been better?\n\n209\n00:11:20.603 --> 00:11:23.680\nSo then your next action is what's next,\nright.\n\n210\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.300\nChange evaluation is this Deming cycle is\ngoing to give you the plan, the doing.\n\n211\n00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.940\nAnd it's also gonna follow up and say,\ndid we actually do what we're supposed to\n\n212\n00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.980\ndo and then give a basis for\nthe next action.\n\n213\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.450\nSo in that same virtualization\nconcept of yep,\n\n214\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.840\nwe delivered the value we\nwere supposed to deliver.\n\n215\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.530\nWe got all these servers\nvirtualized within 18 months.\n\n216\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.690\nWe virtualized our entire estate.\n\n217\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.870\nWe now got the processes in place to\nmake it more effective to replicate\n\n218\n00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.710\nthe production environment\ninto the test environments and\n\n219\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.280\nour test's deviations are going down,\nright?\n\n220\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.950\nAnd then, rinse and repeat,\nkeep moving around.\n\n221\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, since this is actually\ndivided up into a different area,\n\n222\n00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.120\nI think that there's several terms that we\nneed to go over, Terry, to help us out.\n\n223\n00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.620\nAre these kind of, when you talk about\nthe terminology of change evaluation,\n\n224\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.490\nare these some of the terms that\nwe're about to take a look at here,\n\n225\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.080\nreally ITIL specific?\n\n226\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.130\n&gt;&gt; Not so much.\n\n227\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.190\nIf you have a look at the graphic here.\n\n228\n00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.180\nAnd memorizing these is not critical.\n\n229\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.610\nYou're gonna have some exercises, and\n\n230\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.890\nyou're gonna see these words\nplay out on your practice exams.\n\n231\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.310\nAnd they are not counterintuitive.\n\n232\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.450\nThey have real meanings,\nthat are not unique just to ITIL.\n\n233\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:41.170\nAs you look at the summary list there, you\ncan see that these are not unusual words.\n\n234\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.874\nWhat I will want to point out\nto is that these words refer to\n\n235\n00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:50.593\nassessment of your own service\nprovider capabilities.\n\n236\n00:12:50.593 --> 00:12:53.025\nBut they also focus on\nthe business as well,\n\n237\n00:12:53.025 --> 00:12:57.460\nand what are the capabilities of\nthe business to take on this new service.\n\n238\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.220\nSo rather than memorize the words,\n\n239\n00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.820\nfocus on the concepts of change\nevaluation It's not just focused on IT.\n\n240\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.200\nIt's focused on the customers and\nthe users and\n\n241\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.160\nyou have to understand their\nenvironments in pretty complete detail.\n\n242\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, now along with\nthese different terminologies,\n\n243\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:21.180\nyou also have another, what we'll\ncall a mnemonic that helps us here.\n\n244\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.364\nIt's a strange pneumonic so,\nTerry, tell us about STORM PUP.\n\n245\n00:13:26.364 --> 00:13:28.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] STORM PUP.\n\n246\n00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.620\nCute little word.\n\n247\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.120\nIf you look at the graphic here, again,\nyou can see what it's referring to and\n\n248\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.400\nthe factors you need to be considering for\nchange evaluation.\n\n249\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.490\nAgain, worth giving some\nattention to as you go back and\n\n250\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.850\nstudy, I'm not going to necessarily\ngo through all these individually.\n\n251\n00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.650\nBut I do wanna focus on a couple of these\nto reinforce some key components here.\n\n252\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:57.850\nThe service provider capability is also\nclosely related to organizational setting.\n\n253\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.060\nSo is the service provider ready?\n\n254\n00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.230\nIs the organization ready?\n\n255\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.110\nI have certainly launched\nservices where we did so\n\n256\n00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.680\nwell, it was on time, on budget,\nhad all the functionality.\n\n257\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.850\nBut the users didn't even care, right.\n\n258\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.560\nSo was the organizational\nsetting ready for this?\n\n259\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.400\nSo you see that change evaluation is not\njust gonna focus on IT's capabilities\n\n260\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.965\nto deliver on time on a budget.\n\n261\n00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.500\nIt really wanna focus\non the business impact.\n\n262\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.200\nSo that's what you see here as you\ngo through the STORM PUP mnemonic,\n\n263\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.870\nis that people are gonna be involved,\nare they gonna be able to do it well?\n\n264\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.860\nThe use,\nwill people be using this effectively?\n\n265\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.200\nIs it gonna be fit for use?\n\n266\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.580\nAnd, of course, the overall purpose is\ngonna be focused on the business as well.\n\n267\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.970\nSo among these acronyms here,\nthe STORM PUP mnemonic,\n\n268\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.400\nis a mixture of service provider\nreadiness, user readiness and\n\n269\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.160\nmake sure they're all\nconsidered holistically.\n\n270\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.710\nChange evaluation wants to drive value for\nthe business.\n\n271\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.205\n&gt;&gt; And when I look at this list of\ndifferent terms that you also have here,\n\n272\n00:14:57.205 --> 00:15:00.000\nit's that term tolerance\nthat kind of gets me.\n\n273\n00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.741\nCuz I always think about it just\nin a day-to-day usage here, and\n\n274\n00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:06.598\nthe way that you have it described,\nthe ability or\n\n275\n00:15:06.598 --> 00:15:10.040\ncapacity of a service to\nabsorb the change or release.\n\n276\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.040\nWhat do we mean by absorbing it?\n\n277\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.290\nWe're not just integrating it in, are we,\nor is that what we're talking about?\n\n278\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly it is.\n\n279\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.460\nGive you an example from our own space.\n\n280\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.820\nWe launched a learning management service.\n\n281\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.430\nOne of the value propositions of\nlearning management service was\n\n282\n00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.000\nyou can convert eLearning.\n\n283\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.720\nOr you can convert instructor led\ntraining to eLearning, right.\n\n284\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.500\nSo basically,\nwhat it meant is converting PowerPoints\n\n285\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.390\nto some sort of eLearning\ninteractive module, right?\n\n286\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.070\nWe said that the learning management\nsystem could do this for you.\n\n287\n00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.990\nSo we sold it on the value proposition.\n\n288\n00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.920\nAnd many value propositions.\n\n289\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.621\nBut one of the value propositions was, you\ncan do training more effectively by not\n\n290\n00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:53.620\ngoing to an instructor led\nclass more efficiently,\n\n291\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:58.209\nyou can just take it online and it'll\nbe wiz bang, dang, and everything else.\n\n292\n00:15:58.209 --> 00:16:00.299\nVery great.\n\n293\n00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:05.235\nWhat we failed to do, though, We misread\nthe tolerance, is that we didn't really\n\n294\n00:16:05.235 --> 00:16:10.950\nunderstand how many times people would be\nasking our service for help with this.\n\n295\n00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:15.100\nSo we didn't design a PowerPoint\nconversion service,\n\n296\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.360\nwe didn't do that very well.\n\n297\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.560\nWe designed a learning management system.\n\n298\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.980\nAnd it was fully capable\nof delivering eLearning.\n\n299\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.420\nBut we didn't think about\nthis other service need.\n\n300\n00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.966\nSo we weren't ready for that demand, and\n\n301\n00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:30.327\nthe users were saying you\nexpect me to do that, right?\n\n302\n00:16:30.327 --> 00:16:34.918\nSo here were end users, manufacturing\nteams, sales teams, saying yep, we'd love\n\n303\n00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:39.412\nthe learning management system, but how\nare we going to convert our PowerPoints?\n\n304\n00:16:39.412 --> 00:16:40.900\nHm, good question.\n\n305\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.770\nI wish we'd thought about that, right.\n\n306\n00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.620\nSo change evaluation would've been the\nprocess that would've thought about that.\n\n307\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.970\nAsk all the questions about how this\nservice is gonna be utilized, and\n\n308\n00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.690\nwhat's the potential tolerance for\nour organization,\n\n309\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.370\nas a service provider,\nto be able to take on that work.\n\n310\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.910\nWe didn't do that in that case, because we\ndidn't have a formal change evaluation.\n\n311\n00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.190\nWe understood the value proposition.\n\n312\n00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.180\nBut we didn't do a full change evaluation\nabout how that value could be delivered.\n\n313\n00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very understandable, a lot\nof times when you start off with something\n\n314\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.740\nthat you believe will happen, and then you\nrealize the technology itself is not as\n\n315\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.080\ncapable as you think it is, and you\nstill have to continue to move forward.\n\n316\n00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.400\nSo sometimes we do see where that\ntolerance is not the way that we thought\n\n317\n00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.370\nit was gonna be.\n\n318\n00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.940\nNow along with that, Terry,\n\n319\n00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:28.340\nlet's talk about risk management a little\nbit in terms of change management as well.\n\n320\n00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.340\nSo when we start talking\nabout managing risk for\n\n321\n00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.960\nchange evaluation,\nwhat are we really trying to focus in on.\n\n322\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.740\n&gt;&gt; Let's take that same\nexample I just mentioned.\n\n323\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.848\nLet's just say that we were forthright\nin our change evaluation, and\n\n324\n00:17:40.848 --> 00:17:44.537\nwe understood that there was going\nto be some level of demand for\n\n325\n00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:47.890\nconverting PowerPoints into eLearning,\nright.\n\n326\n00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.298\nSo we anticipated it,\nwe asked the question, hm,\n\n327\n00:17:50.298 --> 00:17:52.654\nwe just don't know what\nthat demand's gonna be.\n\n328\n00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:54.404\nWe're not getting\nthe attention of the customer,\n\n329\n00:17:54.404 --> 00:17:56.280\nthey're not sure what\nthey wanna do with this.\n\n330\n00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.524\nThey're not even sure if\nthey even want to do that,\n\n331\n00:17:58.524 --> 00:18:00.980\nthey still may like constructor training.\n\n332\n00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.810\nRight, so the business doesn't even know.\n\n333\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.140\nWell, let's identify this as a risk,\nright.\n\n334\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.000\nSo let's at least identify\nthe potential that we're not gonna\n\n335\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.190\nhave the tolerance for this,\nand be transparent about it.\n\n336\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.180\nRonnie, you have your project\nmanagement experience.\n\n337\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.100\nA big part of risk mitigation\nis simply risk identification.\n\n338\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You can't\n\n339\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.280\nbegin to mitigate risk\nwithout identifying it.\n\n340\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.040\nChange evaluation is going to\nbe forthright in understanding\n\n341\n00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.600\nthe potential risks.\n\n342\n00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.570\nIt doesn't mean they are gonna happen,\nit means there are risks gonna happen.\n\n343\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.780\nGet them articulated,\n\n344\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.570\nget them written down and\nthen you're not caught blindsided.\n\n345\n00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.720\n&gt;&gt; That actually make sense that once\nwe actually understand that we still\n\n346\n00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.190\nhave to make sure that we don't get caught\nblindsided, even in the evaluation point.\n\n347\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.840\nBut at the end of everything,\nonce we have everything in place and\n\n348\n00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.670\nwe've now gone through that process\nof making sure that we evaluate\n\n349\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.720\nthe changes that we need and managing and\nmitigating the risk, the overall\n\n350\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.310\nend result is normally some type of\nreport or how do we, what is the output.\n\n351\n00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.290\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n352\n00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.843\nChange evaluation is a process, for\nsure, but it has a specific output.\n\n353\n00:19:06.843 --> 00:19:08.510\nAnd the output's gonna be consider.\n\n354\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.410\nHere are the risk that we've identified,\n\n355\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.510\nhere's the extended value\nthat we expect to have.\n\n356\n00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.135\nSo there's a pre-launch or\npre-deployment evaluation report.\n\n357\n00:19:18.135 --> 00:19:20.175\nHere is what we expect, right.\n\n358\n00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:22.405\nHere's the risk that we still have, right.\n\n359\n00:19:22.405 --> 00:19:24.415\nAnd here's how we're\nmitigating those risks.\n\n360\n00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:28.105\nAnd then, after the change, you can\nfollow up with your change evaluation for\n\n361\n00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:29.075\nthe actuals.\n\n362\n00:19:29.075 --> 00:19:32.135\nSee you have the predictive piece,\nand you have the actual piece.\n\n363\n00:19:32.135 --> 00:19:34.225\nChange evaluation is there for both.\n\n364\n00:19:34.225 --> 00:19:37.765\n&gt;&gt; So, when you start to see this, since\nyou're talking about the idea of both pre\n\n365\n00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:43.880\nand post here, and when you compare them,\nwhat is our hope and our result?\n\n366\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.396\nWhat are we supposed to learn from\nthat if they do differ so much?\n\n367\n00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:51.795\n&gt;&gt; Well, obviously depending\n\n368\n00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:53.295\non where the learning was-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n369\n00:19:53.295 --> 00:19:55.930\n&gt;&gt; Right,\ndepending on what value was missed or\n\n370\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.490\nwhat risks were actually realized.\n\n371\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so in any given project, or\n\n372\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.860\nin any given change if you will, there's\ngoing to be learning opportunities.\n\n373\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.770\nThis is exactly what change\nevaluation is enabling, right.\n\n374\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.270\nIt's enabling an opportunity to learn that\nour predictions weren't very accurate.\n\n375\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So now we've got room for\n\n376\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.010\nimprovement, right.\n\n377\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:17.470\nOr, if they were accurate and\nwe did receive the pain, and we maybe\n\n378\n00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:21.770\nwere accurate in identifying the risks,\nbut not identifying the probability.\n\n379\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.220\nAnd maybe our mitigation\nsteps weren't effective.\n\n380\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.230\nThen again another learning opportunity.\n\n381\n00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.590\nBut what change evaluation allows you\nto do is to do this transparently.\n\n382\n00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.980\nYou're not just flailing\naround in the wind guessing.\n\n383\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.870\nYou are methodically looking at it.\n\n384\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.010\nAnd again,\naccountability through a process owner\n\n385\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.160\nis going to be a big part of this.\n\n386\n00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, so help us to manage\nthis a little bit better as far as all\n\n387\n00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.060\nthe data that we need to\nmake sure that we have this.\n\n388\n00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.900\nWhat is the information management\nwe're gonna be looking at?\n\n389\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Well, as with all the processes\nkeeping up with these reports,\n\n390\n00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.620\nmaking them available to\npeople at the right times.\n\n391\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.640\nRemember, there's a predictive\nnature of change evaluation, and\n\n392\n00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.960\nthere's a post-launch remit for\nchange evaluation.\n\n393\n00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.280\nSo because of that, what you need to\nconsider is that this needs to be\n\n394\n00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.730\ntransparent and made available to people\nat the right time, for the right reasons.\n\n395\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.260\nSo the predictive part is you\nwanna make sure you're predicting\n\n396\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.070\nthe particular risks and\nimpacts for change evaluation, and\n\n397\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.700\nmaybe even lead to rejection, saying nope,\nthere's way too many variables here.\n\n398\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.800\nYou need to rethink this.\n\n399\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.300\nGo get some more money.\n\n400\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.940\nGo get some more resources.\n\n401\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.410\nGo engage the customer more fully\nbecause we're not moving forward in\n\n402\n00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.770\na progressive way if we don't answer\nthese questions before, right.\n\n403\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.120\nOr, after you launch and\nyou find some issues,\n\n404\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.960\nthen of course you need to be transparent\nabout what needs to happen next.\n\n405\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.356\nIn the case of that eLearning conversion,\nPowerPoints to eLearning,\n\n406\n00:21:46.356 --> 00:21:47.610\nwe did learn after.\n\n407\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.640\nWe didn't predict it well.\n\n408\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.690\nThis is from own experience.\n\n409\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:54.760\nWe didn't predict it well, and\nthen we got blindsided by it.\n\n410\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.340\nSo we then had to rebound, and\nour rebound wasn't graceful.\n\n411\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.220\nIt wasn't a graceful rebound at all,\nright.\n\n412\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.030\nSo that was just pointing to a need that\nwe need to be wiser about this in our\n\n413\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.340\nengagement with the customers, right, and\nat least identify this risk more fully so\n\n414\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.385\nthat when we do need to rebound,\nwe have a graceful way to get there.\n\n415\n00:22:13.385 --> 00:22:14.980\nThat's all about\nthe information management.\n\n416\n00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:15.517\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n417\n00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:18.320\nSo Terry,\nas we start to see this a little bit more,\n\n418\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.360\nhelp me just amend a couple of things.\n\n419\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.280\nReally going back to the very beginning\nhere on evaluating whether or\n\n420\n00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.190\nnot I'm going to need\nthe change management.\n\n421\n00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.530\nNot change management,\n\n422\n00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.520\nsorry, change evaluations-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n423\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.570\n&gt;&gt; Right at the beginning here.\n\n424\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.980\nSo I come up to this process, is it\nnormally a pain point that I'm looking\n\n425\n00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.250\nfor, or is it really just the fact that\nI might be considering I'm gonna shift\n\n426\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.390\naway from something over here\nto move to something like that?\n\n427\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.210\nSo are those two usually the more\n\n428\n00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.999\ncommon ways to say that this is what's\ngonna change the evaluation process?\n\n429\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Change evaluation is gonna be triggered\nthrough change management, period, right.\n\n430\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.016\nNow change management gets triggered\nby other means, right, but\n\n431\n00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:03.767\nchange evaluation is a subset\nof change management.\n\n432\n00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:05.805\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nJust as service validation and\n\n433\n00:23:05.805 --> 00:23:08.862\ntesting is a subset of release and\ndeployment management.\n\n434\n00:23:08.862 --> 00:23:13.318\nSo the overall governing process for\nchange evaluation, indeed,\n\n435\n00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:15.330\nis change management.\n\n436\n00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.390\nThat authoritative process for\nall changes, right.\n\n437\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.945\nAs we mentioned at the outset here,\nchange models are going to define when and\n\n438\n00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:28.971\nhow formal your change\nevaluation process is gonna be.\n\n439\n00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:33.290\nSo again, change model is gonna describe\nthe big things, the small things and\n\n440\n00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.170\npredefined steps for\nhow you go about that.\n\n441\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.190\nThe example I mentioned for\n\n442\n00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.820\na change model is, perhaps you know\nhow you're going to patch servers.\n\n443\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.234\nAnd you are so good at that,\nand it's so routine,\n\n444\n00:23:44.234 --> 00:23:47.471\nthat it doesn't require a change\nevaluation every time, right.\n\n445\n00:23:47.471 --> 00:23:51.075\nBut if you're going to launch on an\ninfrastructure upgrade where you're gonna\n\n446\n00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:54.088\nvirtualize all your servers,\nthat's different, right.\n\n447\n00:23:54.088 --> 00:23:58.210\nSo that's a kind of big change that\nprobably requires a more formal change\n\n448\n00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.481\nevaluation process.\n\n449\n00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.835\nThose are gonna be triggered through\nserver strategy discussions,\n\n450\n00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:07.000\nthrough service design discussions that\nthen feed the change management discussion\n\n451\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.030\nWhich triggers off change\nevaluation through the modeling.\n\n452\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.713\n&gt;&gt; All right so help us again as we start\nto have this model then and understand\n\n453\n00:24:14.713 --> 00:24:19.714\nwhere we're gonna find success in our\ncritical success factors and our KPIs.\n\n454\n00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:21.015\n&gt;&gt; Good point.\n\n455\n00:24:21.015 --> 00:24:23.980\nAs with other processes\nyou need to keep score.\n\n456\n00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:29.160\nSo evaluating whether or not your\nchanges are effective pre and post\n\n457\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.230\nis gonna be some of the key performance\nindicators or critical success factors.\n\n458\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.000\nIf you look at the graphic here, you'll\nsee there's just a couple listed here.\n\n459\n00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.960\nStakeholders have a good understanding\nof expected performance, right.\n\n460\n00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.410\nChange evaluation's gonna say,\nwe are gonna be able to deliver this.\n\n461\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:47.490\nAnd performance could be the saving of\nmoney, the speeding up of something,\n\n462\n00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.650\nthe more accuracy, right,\nfewer errors, that sort of thing.\n\n463\n00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.320\nSo, that's the expected performance,\nyou're gonna predict it.\n\n464\n00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.560\nSo stakeholders have an understanding\nof expected performance,\n\n465\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.390\nof course on the other end, you have a\nbetter understanding of actual performance\n\n466\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.030\nbecause you're following\nup through with that.\n\n467\n00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.440\nJust as these two pieces of\nchange evaluation play out,\n\n468\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.260\nyou're being predictive and\nyou're following through with the actuals.\n\n469\n00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, so along with that then,\nstandard question once again,\n\n470\n00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.590\nwhat are really gonna be those\nchallenges that we're gonna be facing?\n\n471\n00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.923\nAnd also let's talk about the risk\njust one more time to help reinforce\n\n472\n00:25:21.923 --> 00:25:23.000\nthe concept.\n\n473\n00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.990\n&gt;&gt; Again, a challenge is a risk,\nit has a 100% chance of happening.\n\n474\n00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.750\nIf you want to be formal with\nyour change evaluation process,\n\n475\n00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.750\nimagine how that's going to marry up with\nyour project management disciplines.\n\n476\n00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.200\nPMOs are certainly risk aware, right.\n\n477\n00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.770\nProject management is\nintended to be risk aware.\n\n478\n00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.040\nSo change evaluation and\n\n479\n00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.340\nits intersection with project management\nis going to be a challenge you face.\n\n480\n00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.930\nAnd an important one, right, make sure\nthat you're on the same page, right.\n\n481\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.230\nBusiness relationship management,\n\n482\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.360\nhow you're engaging with the business\nis another big challenge here.\n\n483\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.200\nAnd making sure that you have the\nappropriate engagement with the business,\n\n484\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.990\nso that you can assess the value\nproposition more fully.\n\n485\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.870\nChange evaluation cannot be too\nsuccessful with assessing value\n\n486\n00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.030\nunless there's some good conversations\nwith the business, right?\n\n487\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.510\nSo you're gonna get those different\ncustomer stakeholder's perspectives.\n\n488\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.230\nIT's capabilities.\n\n489\n00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.934\nYou're gonna have to work with IT\norganizations to understand what their\n\n490\n00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:21.330\ncapabilities, what their tolerances is as\nyou pointed out in the STORM PUP mnemonic.\n\n491\n00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.610\nThe tolerance of the IT\norganization to take on this change\n\n492\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.990\nas in the example we've used\nthe eLearning challenge.\n\n493\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.870\nWe weren't tolerant of that change.\n\n494\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.216\nWe weren't ready to handle\nthe demand of people saying I want\n\n495\n00:26:33.216 --> 00:26:37.180\n500 PowerPoints converted to\neLearning by the end of the year.\n\n496\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.550\nWe weren't ready for that and\nwe had to rebound, right.\n\n497\n00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.905\nSo again getting engaged with IT and\ngetting engaged with the business to\n\n498\n00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:46.700\nunderstand the requirements and make sure\nthere's appropriate response to that\n\n499\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.190\ndemand is gonna be key for\nchange evaluation.\n\n500\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.710\nThat's what makes it so important.\n\n501\n00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.865\nYou're asking the right kinds of\nquestions to mitigate the risk and\n\n502\n00:26:53.865 --> 00:26:57.686\nyou're interfacing with the project\nmanagement discipline to make sure you're\n\n503\n00:26:57.686 --> 00:26:59.974\ndelivering on time,\non budget and as expected.\n\n504\n00:26:59.974 --> 00:27:03.158\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, with the idea of risk here,\n\n505\n00:27:03.158 --> 00:27:07.695\nwhat I have also seen in\norganizations is that at times,\n\n506\n00:27:07.695 --> 00:27:12.713\nthey take the most inexperienced\nperson that they can find and\n\n507\n00:27:12.713 --> 00:27:17.179\nsay, you're gonna work on\nthis evaluation process.\n\n508\n00:27:17.179 --> 00:27:20.980\nHow risky is that during this\ntype of change evaluation?\n\n509\n00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.715\n&gt;&gt; You need to have empowered people, you\nneed to have a wise people, you need to\n\n510\n00:27:24.715 --> 00:27:28.632\nhave people touched various parts of the\nbusiness to be able to understand this.\n\n511\n00:27:28.632 --> 00:27:32.943\nNow it's not just bureaucracy there's\nnuance to this, there's understanding of\n\n512\n00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:37.140\nthe full scope and being very inquisitive\nand drilling down to the impacts.\n\n513\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.120\nChances are the change evaluation manager,\nthe one's that's practicing\n\n514\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.110\nthis process is going to be someone that's\nwidely known across the organization and\n\n515\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.870\nis aware of the business factors going\non as well to be quite effective.\n\n516\n00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.760\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n517\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.882\nYeah sometimes you just get that because\nyou have somebody available and they're\n\n518\n00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:59.119\nlike, you're gonna be working on change\nevaluation and now you do have somebody's\n\n519\n00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:03.358\nasking more questions just because they\ndon't understand the process of what needs\n\n520\n00:28:03.358 --> 00:28:07.440\nto be done and that could influence the\nway that the evaluation really comes out.\n\n521\n00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.854\nThey might give you a more\npositive evaluation than what you\n\n522\n00:28:10.854 --> 00:28:14.348\nthink because they just go well,\nit looks like it'll work.\n\n523\n00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:16.988\nWhereas somebody that might take\na little bit more time, and\n\n524\n00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:19.730\nhave a little bit more experience,\njust sit there and go look,\n\n525\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.440\nwe need to ask you to evaluate more than\nwhat we just think might happen here.\n\n526\n00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.470\nSo, I've seen instances\nlike that happen as well.\n\n527\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.400\nAll right, so once again, since we also\nneed to make sure that we have the proper\n\n528\n00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.750\npeople in the right place to help us out,\n\n529\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.730\nhelp us out with understanding the roles\nthat we need to have here too.\n\n530\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.000\n&gt;&gt; Well no surprise, if you watched any of\nthe other episodes you'll understand that\n\n531\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.720\nevery process you have, an owner,\na manager and practitioner.\n\n532\n00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.580\nAnd certainly that's the case here.\n\n533\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.450\nWe need someone that owns this\nprocess to make sure it fits for\n\n534\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.960\npurpose, accountable for it.\n\n535\n00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:54.050\nAnd then someone that is practicing or\nactually implementing, managing a process,\n\n536\n00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.970\ncracking the whip, beating the drum,\nmaking sure that it's done appropriately,\n\n537\n00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.460\nit's the process manager,\nright, as we've seen before.\n\n538\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.640\nAnd then practitioners on the ground,\nsomeone's actually creating the reports,\n\n539\n00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.860\nmaking sure the datasets are right,\nthe right questions are answered.\n\n540\n00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.400\nComing up with the data model that's going\nto support the decision making process of\n\n541\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.600\nchange evaluation.\n\n542\n00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.120\nA risk register.\n\n543\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.260\nMaybe it's just a configuration\nof SharePoint sites.\n\n544\n00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.230\nAgain, not getting into\nthe details of this, but\n\n545\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:24.960\nhaving a practitioner managing that flow\nof information is gonna be vital too.\n\n546\n00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\na lot of different pieces here.\n\n547\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.920\nStill fairly intuitive in understanding\nthat before any big change needs to be\n\n548\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.320\nmade, we normally make an evaluation.\n\n549\n00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.480\nIf we're, we are actually doing\nsomething like this with buying a car.\n\n550\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.970\nWe would think that this\nwould be just as important\n\n551\n00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:46.190\nif we were actually running a business and\nneeding to implement changes.\n\n552\n00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.980\nSo, change evaluation, very important\nprocess that we need to understand.\n\n553\n00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.250\nSo Terry as we prepare for the exam\nwhat are some things we can do to help\n\n554\n00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.420\nmake sure that we cement the concepts?\n\n555\n00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.597\n&gt;&gt; Well there are a couple of options,\nalways again,\n\n556\n00:29:57.597 --> 00:30:00.282\nI can't reinforce enough that\ntaking these practice exams and\n\n557\n00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:03.541\nfocusing on those syllabus items that\nare related to change of evaluation.\n\n558\n00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:06.289\nThey'll be a question or\ntwo perhaps on the live exam,\n\n559\n00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:10.040\nI know the practice exams have\nquestions on change evaluation.\n\n560\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.580\nSo, if you look at the exams and\n\n561\n00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.890\nrealize that there's eight questions to\nbe asked, and there's seven processes and\n\n562\n00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.980\nthen there's general principles, most test\nmakers are gonna test all those items.\n\n563\n00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.210\nI shouldn't say most.\n\n564\n00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.880\nAll of those test makers\nare gonna test all those items.\n\n565\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.530\nSo it's kinda broken down.\n\n566\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.280\nYour test is gonna be broken\ndown into the seven processes\n\n567\n00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.440\nplus the general principles and\nhow they interrelate.\n\n568\n00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.590\nSo, find the questions on\nthe practice exam that are focused on\n\n569\n00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.730\nchange evaluation, reinforce those.\n\n570\n00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.350\nThere's also discussion exercises\nbased on the downloadable case study\n\n571\n00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.960\nthat has you apply\nthe knowledge to a given case.\n\n572\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.170\nAnd then of course there's also\nan exercise called change evaluation\n\n573\n00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.650\nprocess flow,\nwhich is also downloadable there.\n\n574\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Terry thank you again\nfor helping us to understand the important\n\n575\n00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.860\nnature of doing the change\nevaluation process.\n\n576\n00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.225\nIt is something that we should consider as\nwe start making larger changes within our\n\n577\n00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:04.390\norganization so\n\n578\n00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.240\nthat we have some formalized process to\nsay this is worth it or this isn't and\n\n579\n00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.510\nall the actual other types of risks\nthat go along with that as well.\n\n580\n00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.540\nThank also for joining us today,\nsigning off for\n\n581\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.760\nITProTv I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n582\n00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n583\n00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:24.297\n&gt;&gt; Stay turned and I hear for\nmore ITIL Release, Control and Validation.\n\n584\n00:31:24.297 --> 00:31:30.372\n[MUSIC]\n\n585\n00:31:30.372 --> 00:31:33.993\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

The entire goal is have the knowledge ready for how needs it at the right time, according to the team.  They review the constant idea of the need and the scope.  With the nature of the “ocean” of information there of course needs one some type of system (SKMS) to help with the management, distribution and use of the data available, according to the guys.  They also emphasize there is no one system to do it all but it will require integration of multiple systems that may have data; it may require a custom system; it may require just record keeping that is indexed to allow for the discovery of that information.  This is not a topic to be overlooked, according to the guys.",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:15.620\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.972\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today we're\ntaking a look at ITIL release control and\n\n6\n00:00:19.972 --> 00:00:20.727\nvalidation.\n\n7\n00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:25.300\nWe're specifically diving into a next\nprocess here of knowledge management.\n\n8\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.770\nAnd here to help us out is our\nITIL expert, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.450\nTerry, welcome back to the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.350\n&gt;&gt; As always, Ronnie, happy to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.920\nA pretty succinct treatment of this topic.\n\n12\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.500\nIt's a huge topic in terms of operations,\nit's a huge activity.\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.740\nBut we can knock this down in\nsome pretty digestible bits so\n\n14\n00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.410\nthat's what we're gonna do.\n\n15\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.160\nI'm gonna start with a graphic actually.\n\n16\n00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.600\nIf you look at the graphic here,\njust looking at the size and\n\n17\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.495\nscope of knowledge management.\n\n18\n00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:50.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's huge.\n\n19\n00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.340\nAnd if you consider it, as you go along\nthe little boxes with curvy sides,\n\n20\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.110\nthe curvy bottoms, are actually documents.\n\n21\n00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.840\nSo there can be many iterations of those,\nand\n\n22\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.780\nlook how many documents\nthere are in there.\n\n23\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.990\nThere are availability management systems,\nconfiguration management,\n\n24\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.400\ncontinuity management, availability\nmanagement, so there's systems out there.\n\n25\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640\nThere's databases out there.\n\n26\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.390\nIt is huge right?\n\n27\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.810\nWe've talked about the CMS and\nthe complexity of it, and\n\n28\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.860\nthe CMS is actually a subset of\nthe service knowledge management system.\n\n29\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.510\nSo the scope and size of knowledge\nmanagement is tremendous.\n\n30\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.460\nAnd I once saw an interesting\ndebate online.\n\n31\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.500\nI went to an ITIL forum for\nsome other reason.\n\n32\n00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.550\nAnd as I was there I saw,\nit was a good spirited debate,\n\n33\n00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.170\none person just lambasting ITIL basically\nsaying, what a ridiculous pipe crane.\n\n34\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.020\nThere is no such thing and\nnever will be such a thing as a service\n\n35\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.790\nknowledge management system,\nit's just too big and too complex.\n\n36\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.750\nAnother reader or\nanother poster put in there that\n\n37\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.050\nperhaps he was misconstruing\nthe idea of a system.\n\n38\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470\nThis is not something you got and by,\nthis is something got to be engineered and\n\n39\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.270\nthere's a lot of moving parts\nworking together for a common goal.\n\n40\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.360\nAnd I find both of these\nhave some truth to them.\n\n41\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.090\nI think in some regards, having an entire\nsystem that's fully understood, fully\n\n42\n00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.140\nmanaged, always current, always accurate\nis probably a little bit of a pipe dream.\n\n43\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.160\nBecause it is a moving target, ongoing.\n\n44\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.900\nWhen you're talking about knowledge you're\ntalking about something that's very\n\n45\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.980\nperishable and always growing, right?\n\n46\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.320\nSo, I think one of the guys that\nposted had some idea of the truth,\n\n47\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.240\nI think the other guy had\nsome idea of the truth.\n\n48\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.420\nThe truth is probably actually\nin the middle somewhere.\n\n49\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.610\nWhat is a service knowledge\nmanagement system?\n\n50\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.910\nWhat is a knowledge management process?\n\n51\n00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.140\nAnd that's what we're gonna discuss here.\n\n52\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry,\n\n53\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.040\nwhen we start to take a look at this\nidea of building a system like that.\n\n54\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.330\nThere are obviously, there are goals for\nthis but let me contrast it with this.\n\n55\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.820\nI know that there are certain people\nthat I have worked with in the past,\n\n56\n00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.060\nit didn't matter what I told them.\n\n57\n00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.410\nHere's where you can go\nan find that information.\n\n58\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.410\nThey absolutely had to go and\nmanually do it themselves no matter what.\n\n59\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.330\nSo I said, you can go and find it here and\nthen they would just walk over to whatever\n\n60\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.880\nsystem it was and\njust manually find all the information.\n\n61\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.960\nThat is a process for knowledge, but\nwhy do we really need to have this\n\n62\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.020\nin one place or the idea of\na system to help us to manage that?\n\n63\n00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Again, I'd like to focus on\nthe process more than the system.\n\n64\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.080\nThe system itself is going\nto be lots of moving parts.\n\n65\n00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.410\nAs you saw from that graphic,\nthere are lots of things involved, right?\n\n66\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.560\nThe process, the governance of that\nknowledge is gonna be as important as\n\n67\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.190\nthe systems that deliver that knowledge\nto the right people at the right time.\n\n68\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.610\nAnd that's really pointing to\nthe purpose of the process, and\n\n69\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.140\nthat's what I wanna focus on.\n\n70\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.680\nNot just for an academic setting,\nyou're gonna be preparing for\n\n71\n00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.500\nan exam you need to focus that way.\n\n72\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.480\nBut even as you take this back\noperationally, you need to focus on\n\n73\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.715\nthe process around this and\nthen lead yourself to the opposite,\n\n74\n00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:55.765\nthe obvious opportunities for shoring\nup your systems and how they integrate.\n\n75\n00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:58.025\nThere's not going to be\non monolithic system.\n\n76\n00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:02.495\nThere's not gonna be one person in control\nof this, or even two or three people.\n\n77\n00:04:02.495 --> 00:04:05.315\nIt's way too vast for\nthat kinda construction.\n\n78\n00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:07.215\nBut what you need to do,\nas a process owner for\n\n79\n00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:10.750\nknowledge management, is understand\nthe scope of knowledge articles,\n\n80\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.620\nthe knowledge items you need and\nwhat's an effective way\n\n81\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.980\nof making it available to the right\npeople at the right time.\n\n82\n00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.200\nThat is what the purpose of this process\nis, making sure that the right information\n\n83\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.300\nis available to the right\npeople at the right time so\n\n84\n00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.811\nthat they can gain knowledge and\napply wisdom, right?\n\n85\n00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:29.110\n&gt;&gt; All right so\n\n86\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.020\nlet's talk about the overall scope then\nwhen we start to take this example.\n\n87\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.510\nSo does this apply company wide or\nis it for a specific process like\n\n88\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.110\njust change management itself or\nwhat are we talking about here?\n\n89\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely for the entire\nservice provider organization and\n\n90\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.170\nit's actually going to potentially be\ninterfaces with external stakeholders,\n\n91\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.650\ncustomers and users can take advantage\nof the same type of information as well.\n\n92\n00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.940\nSo the stakeholder group is primarily\nthe service provider group,\n\n93\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.070\nthe IT organization if you will,\nthat's the primary stakeholder for\n\n94\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.300\nknowledge management.\n\n95\n00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.770\nJust consider, I mean just some examples\nof knowledge that needs to be shared.\n\n96\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.862\nIs it beneficial for\n\n97\n00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:09.369\nthe service provider to understand what\nperformance targets have been agreed to?\n\n98\n00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:12.350\nThat's the SLA, service level agreement.\n\n99\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.600\nCertainly it is.\n\n100\n00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.140\nSo is it also important for\ncustomers and users to be aware of that?\n\n101\n00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.910\nWhat the agree performance targets are?\n\n102\n00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.770\nYes, so that's a knowledge article or\nthat's a knowledge item, I should say.\n\n103\n00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.780\nThat's a knowledge item that's actually\nshared across stakeholder groups.\n\n104\n00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.940\nWhat about the service desk?\n\n105\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.640\nWhat kinda knowledge do\nthey need to be effective\n\n106\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.635\nwith managing their work from day to day.\n\n107\n00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:40.330\nITIL describes things like workarounds,\nknown error databases.\n\n108\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.510\nAgain, without giving the details of that,\n\n109\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.010\nthose are knowledge items that make\nthe service desk more effective, right.\n\n110\n00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.810\nAnd that has an effect\non end users as well.\n\n111\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.330\nSo again, the universe is large here.\n\n112\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.650\nComing up with discrete systems\nof knowledge management\n\n113\n00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.010\nis probably gonna be the approach.\n\n114\n00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.630\nI say discrete repositories for\nknowledge is gonna be appropriate.\n\n115\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.920\nBut the overarching goal,\n\n116\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.782\nthe right information in front of\nthe right people at the right time.\n\n117\n00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:10.140\n&gt;&gt;

Absolutely.\n\n183\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n184\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.090\nOf course, there's value there.\n\n185\n00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.450\nJust imagine the service desk\nhaving good data in front of them.\n\n186\n00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.080\nOr, good information in front of them.\n\n187\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.990\nThere's going to be more\nresponsive end users.\n\n188\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.530\nThat's a business value.\n\n189\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.250\nThe service desk is more efficient.\n\n190\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.340\nHaving data that let's you improve your\ninternal processes, the measurement data\n\n191\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.530\nthat you have, and the metrics you have\nmakes your processes more efficient.\n\n192\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.039\nThat could be translated\nto business value.\n\n193\n00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.040\nHaving a risk register.\n\n194\n00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.160\nUnderstanding transparently\nwhat risks you have and\n\n195\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.530\nhow you intend to mitigate those risks.\n\n196\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.850\nThat's good for project management.\n\n197\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.620\nAgain, providing value to end users\nbecause there's gonna be less disruptions\n\n198\n00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.200\nif you mitigate those risks.\n\n199\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.160\nThat's really the nature of this piece.\n\n200\n00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.230\nYep.\n\n201\n00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.070\n&gt;&gt; All right, with the way that you\ndescribed the ever-growing population of\n\n202\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:11.340\ndata and the information that we need,\nwhat are the ways that we\n\n203\n00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.610\ndeal with the policies then to\nhelp us to implement this system?\n\n204\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.000\nBecause, it's gotta be\nconstantly changing, doesn't it?\n\n205\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.230\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n206\n00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.600\nJust imagine, just the classic FAQ,\nfrequently asked questions.\n\n207\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.450\nWhat happens if that gets out of date?\n\n208\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n209\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.770\n&gt;&gt; It's not very helpful, right?\n\n210\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:34.050\nSo having policies for information refresh\nor review, ownership of knowledge, right?\n\n211\n00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.760\nWho owns these particular\nknowledge articles or\n\n212\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.170\nwho owns these particular\ninstances of information?\n\n213\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.700\nA policy can define that and\n\n214\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.800\nknowledge management will codify\nit in a procedural way, right?\n\n215\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.320\nSo policies could be put\nin place to say every\n\n216\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.160\nincident will have their\nworkaround identified, right?\n\n217\n00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.880\nWe will identify workarounds formally.\n\n218\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.820\nWe won't just pass it on from\nJohnny to Mary, from Mary to Lenny.\n\n219\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.790\nWe will document this somewhere,\nright, right?\n\n220\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.340\nIt could be that just the goal of policy\nas it relates to knowledge management\n\n221\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.250\nis to put in place a culture\nof knowledge sharing.\n\n222\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.440\nI once saw, and again,\n\n223\n00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.760\nI'm not recommending this,\nITIL is not recommending this.\n\n224\n00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.440\nBut I once did some consulting with\nan organization that had a goal, a policy.\n\n225\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.030\nThis was a policy goal.\n\n226\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.945\nThat 100% of their tickets from end users,\ntheir incidents,\n\n227\n00:11:28.945 --> 00:11:33.010\nwould be resolved by\nthe first service desk.\n\n228\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.270\nNot necessarily when they first call but\nthe service desk would solve them.\n\n229\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.510\nNow think about what kind of\nbehavior change that instills.\n\n230\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.790\nSo there's a policy that says,\n\n231\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.880\nthou shalt resolve 100% of our\ntickets at the service desk.\n\n232\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.560\nBy having a policy that\nstates such a stretched goal,\n\n233\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.200\nyou're going to change the behaviors\nnot only of the service desk, but\n\n234\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.170\nof all the smart people in the back end,\nand be it second third level support.\n\n235\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.540\nEnabling the service desk to do\nthat with solid knowledge articles,\n\n236\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.390\nwith efficient data searches, right.\n\n237\n00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.540\nHaving a search engine in front of\nthese kinds of things is going to be\n\n238\n00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.480\nvital, right.\n\n239\n00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.568\nSo again, there was a policy\nthat was driving behaviors and\n\n240\n00:12:10.568 --> 00:12:14.233\npushing that as management in a good\ndirection potentially, right.\n\n241\n00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.568\nSo, that's the kind of\nthing policy can do.\n\n242\n00:12:16.568 --> 00:12:21.247\nAgain I'm not recommending that strategy\nfor anybody and ITIL isn't either but\n\n243\n00:12:21.247 --> 00:12:27.070\nit's just a really stark example about how\npolicy can drive and support knowledge.\n\n244\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.700\n&gt;&gt; Now, since you did mention\nright at the beginning this idea\n\n245\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.560\nthat service knowledge management system.\n\n246\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.880\nWhat are some of the other tools\nthat we need to understand so\n\n247\n00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.735\nthat all these things can be\nintegrated cuz it seems like this\n\n248\n00:12:40.735 --> 00:12:44.165\nhas got to be the most massive\ntype of integration we can do.\n\n249\n00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:48.755\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you may recall,\nI recalled the CMS as a big boat.\n\n250\n00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.295\nConfiguration Management System, and\n\n251\n00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:52.995\nit has containers on that boat,\ncall those CMDBs.\n\n252\n00:12:52.995 --> 00:12:57.835\nThis is another rendition of that,\nmultiple configuration management database\n\n253\n00:12:57.835 --> 00:13:02.140\nresting inside the superset called\nthe configuration management system.\n\n254\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n255\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.890\n&gt;&gt; If the configuration management system\nis a boat and the CMDB are containers on\n\n256\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.120\nthat boat, service knowledge\nmanagement system is the ocean.\n\n257\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.750\nIt's everything else.\n\n258\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.600\nIt's so many things.\n\n259\n00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:19.480\nAnd it supports virtually every single\nthing we do as a service provider, right.\n\n260\n00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.730\nSo, it's certainly going to be\ninvolved in service strategy.\n\n261\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.850\nIt's gonna be involved in design.\n\n262\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.282\nKnowledge management encompasses,\nall the life cycle stages and\n\n263\n00:13:27.282 --> 00:13:29.210\nall details of the processes.\n\n264\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.650\nIt's huge, right.\n\n265\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.710\nSo, understanding how huge this is,\nas you've taken the task, you're not\n\n266\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:39.300\ngoing to be asked to design the perfect\nservice knowledge management system.\n\n267\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.830\nYou're going to be asked to provide\nsome governance, some process and\n\n268\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:49.120\nsome ownership of how we're going to keep\nup with this vast ocean of information.\n\n269\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Now along with that idea of\nunderstanding the ocean of information\n\n270\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.100\nthat we do have available to us and\nthe amount of data that we have.\n\n271\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.710\nA part of that strategy and\n\n272\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.610\na part of some of the different\nactivities that we have to do then is\n\n273\n00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.000\nalso to come along with how that's gonna\nintegrate with us as humans too, right?\n\n274\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.560\n&gt;&gt; Of course, absolutely.\n\n275\n00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.490\nSo defining an appropriate strategy and\nhow you're going to impart knowledge for\n\n276\n00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:13.460\nother people.\n\n277\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.420\nSo, it includes training, right?\n\n278\n00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.010\nYou're gonna have training artifacts\nassociated with knowledge transfer.\n\n279\n00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.790\nCertainly, transfer of knowledge is\npart of knowledge management as well.\n\n280\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.470\nHow do you effectively train people\nto have the right skills sets,\n\n281\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.570\nthe right knowledge?\n\n282\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.980\nIt can be formally, it can be informally,\nit can be self-help, right?\n\n283\n00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.140\nAll of the above.\n\n284\n00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.270\nSo, knowledge management is also going\nto describe, in some level of detail,\n\n285\n00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.205\nthe methodology of knowledge transfer and\nknowledge maintenance.\n\n286\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.740\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, so how do we actually\nget this knowledge management system then\n\n287\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.700\nto even go across things\nlike geographic boundaries?\n\n288\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.438\n&gt;&gt; Well that's just it.\n\n289\n00:14:49.438 --> 00:14:52.770\nIf the over-arching goal is\nto make knowledge available,\n\n290\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.640\ninformation available and\nknowledge available to the right people\n\n291\n00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.100\nat the right time, you also have to\nconsider the right place, right?\n\n292\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.030\nSo certainly, international\norganizations such as I used to work in.\n\n293\n00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.830\nPerhaps a different challenge\nthan an organization\n\n294\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.420\nwhere you're in one building\nwith 50 employees, right?\n\n295\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.210\nSo the challenge of\nknowledge management is\n\n296\n00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.260\ngoing to have to face potentially\nthe geographic stretch as well.\n\n297\n00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.100\nSo fortunately,\nIT systems can help with that.\n\n298\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.710\nWeb interfaces, application interfaces\nthe sharing of data common repositories\n\n299\n00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.214\nto SharePoint etc and other repositories.\n\n300\n00:15:27.214 --> 00:15:30.070\nSo it is a challenge and\n\n301\n00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.264\nthe universe but you need to\nconsider geography of this as well.\n\n302\n00:15:34.264 --> 00:15:39.880\nAnd again, focusing on the entire\nsystem as from a technical standpoint,\n\n303\n00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.310\nit is not gonna serve\nyou well academically.\n\n304\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.790\nI can promise you that.\n\n305\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.810\nTrying to design this system of work\n\n306\n00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.100\nis not what you're gonna be\nasked to do academically.\n\n307\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.181\nAnd honestly,\nI think that's also true operationally.\n\n308\n00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:55.777\nThere are gonna be things in place,\nright, that already exist.\n\n309\n00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:58.522\nPeople have a need to share\ninformation already, and\n\n310\n00:15:58.522 --> 00:16:01.023\nit's quite decentralized\nhow they share that.\n\n311\n00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:03.841\nSo as a knowledge\nmanagement process owner,\n\n312\n00:16:03.841 --> 00:16:07.400\nyou simply want to enable\nthe appropriate use of these and\n\n313\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.360\nperhaps streamline the use of\nthese to make it easier, right?\n\n314\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.500\nAnd one way to do that is actually with\na great search engine on top of all these\n\n315\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.170\nrepositories.\n\n316\n00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.400\nBeing able to search for information so\n\n317\n00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.069\nthat it can be rendered to\npeople at the right time.\n\n318\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.988\n&gt;&gt; So Terry,\nwhere in the world does this fit into\n\n319\n00:16:24.988 --> 00:16:30.268\nthe idea of CSI, or\nthe continual service improvement?\n\n320\n00:16:30.268 --> 00:16:37.140\n&gt;&gt; Good question, it goes both ways.\n\n321\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.500\nCSI as a discipline is trying to\n\n322\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.800\ninstill a culture of continual and\ngradual improvement.\n\n323\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.370\nBecause service knowledge management\nis never gonna be static.\n\n324\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.390\nIt's always changing.\n\n325\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.200\nKnowledge is gained every day.\n\n326\n00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.700\nArticles are published every day.\n\n327\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.930\nPeople learn something every day is\nthe way to put it., and you have so\n\n328\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.590\nmany people in the organization\nlearning something every day, right?\n\n329\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.800\nIt's always a moving target.\n\n330\n00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.480\nBecause it's a moving target\ninstilling this culture of\n\n331\n00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.456\nalways trying to get better,\nyou may never get to this.\n\n332\n00:17:08.456 --> 00:17:13.940\nI'll go back to that emotional\ndiatribe of that one user that says,\n\n333\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.150\nthis is a pipe dream,\nit will never happen.\n\n334\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.960\nI kinda get that.\n\n335\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.790\nYou will never, ever get there, right?\n\n336\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.290\nYou will never have all knowledge\nmastered for everybody.\n\n337\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.030\nThat's not it but\nthe aspiration is worthy.\n\n338\n00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.666\nAnd CSI is going to feed\nthat well with gradual and\n\n339\n00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:30.995\ncontinual improvement toward that goal.\n\n340\n00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:34.604\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Terry, we have to\nstart asking this basic question again,\n\n341\n00:17:34.604 --> 00:17:37.290\njust like with every other process here.\n\n342\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.860\nWhat is going to be our ability here for\ninformation management?\n\n343\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.590\nYou're talking about the ocean of data and\nso what are some of the questions we need\n\n344\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.810\nto ask when we start to take a look at\nthis for our entire service life cycle?\n\n345\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a process that's really\nquite interesting in that there's not\n\n346\n00:17:54.242 --> 00:17:56.980\na specific trigger for\nit because it's all out there.\n\n347\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.180\nIt's already out there.\n\n348\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.200\nThe need for\nknowledge is already there, so\n\n349\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.490\nwhat triggers it is the need for\nknowledge, right?\n\n350\n00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.830\nIf you take any seat in the organization,\nsit at the service desk,\n\n351\n00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.030\nyou're gonna have to have\nknowledge at your fingertips.\n\n352\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.210\nYou're a service owner, sit in that seat,\n\n353\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:14.230\nyou're gonna have to have\nknowledge at your fingertips.\n\n354\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.040\nLet's say you're a CEO.\n\n355\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.050\nYou need service strategy information.\n\n356\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.890\nYou'd have that at your fingertips, right?\n\n357\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.740\nSo the trigger of this process\nis really kind of a non-starter.\n\n358\n00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.760\nBecause it's always there all the time.\n\n359\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.860\nIt's always working, right?\n\n360\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.940\nSo I think the way you look at this is\nwhat gets this process started is the idea\n\n361\n00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:39.250\nthat you want to control and somehow\ngovern this universe of information.\n\n362\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.500\nThat's what gets us started.\n\n363\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so after getting it started\nthen, we also needed to take a look that\n\n364\n00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.490\nonce we start to understand the type of\ninformation that we need to keep, also\n\n365\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.630\nunderstanding all data or the information\nthat we need, may have a particular life\n\n366\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.692\nvalue of it in which the data itself\nafter awhile may not be useful.\n\n367\n00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:05.030\nWe understand that we also then need\nthe idea of some type of way to measure\n\n368\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.990\nwhether or not we are succeeding\nat this knowledge management,\n\n369\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.320\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n370\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.676\nSo what are the critical success factors,\nwhich I'm not going to be able to say\n\n371\n00:19:15.676 --> 00:19:18.580\nthe word success, and\nKPIs that we're looking at?\n\n372\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.327\n&gt;&gt; Well, if the overarching goal of\nknowledge management is to make sure\n\n373\n00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:26.452\nthe right information is available to\nthe right people at the right time, and\n\n374\n00:19:26.452 --> 00:19:29.840\nas you suggested Ronnie,\nat the right location, right?\n\n375\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.140\nIt's there for them.\n\n376\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.760\nThen you're gonna be looking for,\nthat's the critical success factors.\n\n377\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.390\nThen you're really gonna be looking for\n\n378\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.310\nthe key performance indicators\nthat mean that's available.\n\n379\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.754\nSo just as example,\nyou could do some qualitative analysis of\n\n380\n00:19:43.754 --> 00:19:48.610\nthe freshness of you FAQ,\nare they accurate, right?\n\n381\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.390\nSo you could do that by simply measuring\nthe number of reviews of the FAQ list.\n\n382\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.230\nSo again just using some examples.\n\n383\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:59.530\nThe known error database that\nsupports the service desk,\n\n384\n00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:05.050\nperhaps you're gonna be involved in\nthat in a way that allows you to access\n\n385\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.780\nthe criticality and value of that, that\nold records are removed and refreshed.\n\n386\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.910\nSo perhaps it's just a simple manner\nof ownership, who owns that knowledge?\n\n387\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.580\nSo the percentage of knowledge\nelements that have a designated owner\n\n388\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.840\ncould be a key performance indicator.\n\n389\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.520\nSo it can be at a very high level,\nit can be at a very low level,\n\n390\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.840\nhow you wanna manage this.\n\n391\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.470\nSince the universe of knowledge is so\n\n392\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.740\nhuge at any given organization you're\nprobably gonna divide and conquer.\n\n393\n00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.170\nIt's gonna be decentralized, so\nyou might be measuring knowledge quality\n\n394\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.010\nat a macro level as\nopposed to a detail level.\n\n395\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.710\nIf you look at the screen here\nyou can see some examples here.\n\n396\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.890\nAvailability of knowledge and\ninformation that supports decision making.\n\n397\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.010\nRight, that critical\nsuccess factor as I talked.\n\n398\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.910\nRight information in front of\nthe right people at the right time.\n\n399\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.170\nBut look at those KPIs.\n\n400\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.380\nIncreased accesses to\nthe SKMS by management,\n\n401\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.760\nmeaning people are using it, right?\n\n402\n00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.010\nThat's one good key performance indicator\nis people are actually using these\n\n403\n00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.130\nresources.\n\n404\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.930\nIncreased satisfaction, management\nlikes what they're getting, right?\n\n405\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.800\nGo ahead out to your stakeholders\nwhether they're management stakeholders,\n\n406\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.090\nwhoever the stakeholders are, go to\nthem and say have you got what you need?\n\n407\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.950\nIf not, we need to make it better,\nor they might have it, but\n\n408\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.860\nit could be more useful in graphical form.\n\n409\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.460\nHow can we change that, right?\n\n410\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.710\nThat sort of thing.\n\n411\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.580\nSo getting to the right levels of\nsatisfaction here is probably going\n\n412\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.140\nto require a lot of interaction\nwith your stakeholders\n\n413\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.470\nto make sure they're satisfied, right?\n\n414\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.405\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's also talk about\nthen, of course, the challenges and\n\n415\n00:21:34.405 --> 00:21:36.470\nthe risks that are involved with this.\n\n416\n00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.149\nSo we understand the idea\nof the challenges or\n\n417\n00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:39.571\nthe risks that will happen 100%.\n\n418\n00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:42.620\nSo now that we're talking about\nthe notion of information,\n\n419\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.755\nwhat is the other challenge that we have?\n\n420\n00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:46.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The universe.\n\n421\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no doubt.\n\n422\n00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.790\n&gt;&gt; No doubt, I mean the biggest\nchallenge is the biggest thing, right?\n\n423\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.300\nThe biggest challenge is this universe\nof knowledge you have to control right?\n\n424\n00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.310\nAnd getting stakeholders\ninvolved in what they need and\n\n425\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.980\nmaking sure that they can get to it,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.200\nOften times,\nwhat's the opposite of knowledge?\n\n427\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.210\nI guess ignorance?\n\n428\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.370\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, ignorance.\n\n429\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.160\nThat is going to be a challenge you face,\nright, is that there's ignorance.\n\n430\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.370\nAnd that is the challenge you're\ngonna face with knowledge management.\n\n431\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.490\nSo if your service desk is inefficient\nbecause they don't have access to\n\n432\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.660\nmeaningful data, if your managers\nare making uninformed decisions or\n\n433\n00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.510\nyou regularly produce services that\ndon't meet business value, right,\n\n434\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.290\nyou're going to have\nindicators of failure, right?\n\n435\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.089\nChances are those failures can be\nmitigated in the future with knowledge\n\n436\n00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:40.831\nmanagement making people aware, knowledge\ntransfer, knowledge management on going.\n\n437\n00:22:40.831 --> 00:22:45.654\n&gt;&gt; All right so Terry, help us out once\nagain, we understand that we need to know\n\n438\n00:22:45.654 --> 00:22:50.555\na little bit more about those process\nowners and, of course, the managers and\n\n439\n00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:52.390\npractitioners as well.\n\n440\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.680\nIs there anything else we\nneed to know about them?\n\n441\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you know about owners and\nthey're accountable for\n\n442\n00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.650\nthe entire process.\n\n443\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.470\nWithin knowledge management you need to\nidentify the stakeholders that actually\n\n444\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.542\nown the knowledge, right?\n\n445\n00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:08.880\nAnd one big risk that\nyou'll face is trying to\n\n446\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.030\nencourage a culture of knowledge sharing.\n\n447\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.249\nSome organizations, some people I\nshould say, just the human dynamic is,\n\n448\n00:23:14.249 --> 00:23:17.287\nthey discover knowledge is power and\nthey want to hold onto it, right?\n\n449\n00:23:17.287 --> 00:23:21.010\nThat's not necessarily productive for\nthe ongoing organization.\n\n450\n00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.980\nSo creating a culture is\ngoing to be part of it too.\n\n451\n00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.050\nKnowledge management could certainly\nbe the people that beat the drum and\n\n452\n00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.590\ncrack the whip so to speak.\n\n453\n00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.505\nBut you're gonna need\nsome process managers,\n\n454\n00:23:31.505 --> 00:23:34.750\nyou're also gonna need the practitioners,\nthe ones that own this knowledge.\n\n455\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.718\nThe knowledge owners, which is a funny\nword to describe, but the people actually\n\n456\n00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:43.691\nunderstand what they're trying\nto impart is gonna be critical.\n\n457\n00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:48.262\nSo just same examples,\nif something gets passed on to second,\n\n458\n00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:54.409\nthird level support to allow the service\ndesk to eventually close down an incident.\n\n459\n00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:58.080\nCould it be that that is a learning\nopportunity right away, right?\n\n460\n00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.963\nWhen I mentioned that aspirational goal of\nthat one organization that 100% of their\n\n461\n00:24:01.963 --> 00:24:04.061\ntickets would be resolved\nby the service desk,\n\n462\n00:24:04.061 --> 00:24:06.875\nit certainly changed the behavior\nof these people in the back.\n\n463\n00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:09.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; They didn't just solve it.\n\n464\n00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.280\nThey had to teach someone about it, right?\n\n465\n00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.960\nThat is a different kinda culture.\n\n466\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.110\nAnd again, I'm not necessarily saying\nthat's what you should do back\n\n467\n00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.190\nat the organization.\n\n468\n00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.835\nBut it is an example of how creating\na culture of knowledge management and\n\n469\n00:24:19.835 --> 00:24:23.780\nknowledge transfer is gonna be critical,\nand naming people and\n\n470\n00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.520\ngiving them accountability for\nsuch things.\n\n471\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.870\nSo, this knowledge base that\nthe service desk is using, right?\n\n472\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.230\nWhile it's being populated by lots of\nknowledge creators in the back end, you\n\n473\n00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.450\nshould probably have someone that actually\nowns that particular artifact as well,\n\n474\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.890\nthe knowledge base, right,\nor the FAQ list, or\n\n475\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.090\nthe service management checklist or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n476\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.710\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, well again,\nintroducing us to the very fact that\n\n477\n00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.860\na lot of the process that we're going\nthrough here in ITIL includes managing\n\n478\n00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:59.020\nan ocean of information,\nseems to be overwhelming.\n\n479\n00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.202\nAnd even though they seem logical,\n\n480\n00:25:01.202 --> 00:25:04.810\nit really is about the amount\nwe're talking about.\n\n481\n00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.680\nSo Terry,\nwhat can we do to help us out and\n\n482\n00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.610\nmake sure that we've got those concepts\nin our mind as we face the exam?\n\n483\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'll point you to the graphic here.\n\n484\n00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.200\nIt has some good names for you.\n\n485\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.380\nBut there's a couple of\nexercises that you can download.\n\n486\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.190\nOne's called Managing Data,\ninformation and knowledge.\n\n487\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.520\nDirected Self Study,\ncalled Knowledge Management.\n\n488\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.420\nIf you focus on that,\nabout a 60-minute exercise, again,\n\n489\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.292\nprobably take you about less than that.\n\n490\n00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:29.583\nBut it walks you through some\nscenarios and some case studies, and\n\n491\n00:25:29.583 --> 00:25:33.052\nthen asks you some very directed\nquestions based on those scenarios,\n\n492\n00:25:33.052 --> 00:25:36.050\na great way to reinforce this learning.\n\n493\n00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.090\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nWell Terry, thank you again for\n\n494\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:43.730\nintroducing us to the world of\nthe ocean of knowledge management.\n\n495\n00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.120\nIt is a gigantic process, but it's one\nthat makes the entire organization\n\n496\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.920\nmuch more efficient without having to\ngo and find the information itself.\n\n497\n00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.030\nThis is one of the key aspects, of course,\nof understanding ITIL's framework.\n\n498\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.495\nBecause it makes everything a bit more\nefficient, it actually ends up reducing\n\n499\n00:25:59.495 --> 00:26:02.611\ncost and later on, as you're actually\ntrying to do some of the things.\n\n500\n00:26:02.611 --> 00:26:06.240\nSo make sure you have\nthis concept mastered or\n\n501\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.850\nat least understood very easily\nbefore you go in for that exam.\n\n502\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.470\nWell, that's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n503\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.610\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n504\n00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n505\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:23.214\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL: Release, Control, and Validation.\n\n506\n00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:29.172\n[MUSIC]\n\n507\n00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:32.360\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.820\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.700\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking a look at ITIL Release,\n\n6\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.330\nControl, and Validation.\n\n7\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.210\nWe're specifically going to be taking\na look here at some of the different\n\n8\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.400\nconsiderations such as technology and\nimplementation here and\n\n9\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.680\nwith us is going to be our ITIL expert,\nMister Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.130\nTerry, welcome back to the show and\ntell us what we're talking about here,\n\n11\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.210\nwhen we start talking about all these\nideas of technology and implementation.\n\n12\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.020\n&gt;&gt; Well fundamentally,\nITIL is is about service management.\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.290\nIt's not about technology selection or\n\n14\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.530\neven implementation planning,\nthose types of things.\n\n15\n00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.140\nSo this treatment is gonna\nbe very superficial.\n\n16\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.960\nAnd if you've had any other intermediate\ncourses, you'll find actually a quite\n\n17\n00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.640\ngeneric treatment of the same topics\nof technology and implementation.\n\n18\n00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.060\nSo let's have a dive here.\n\n19\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.410\nJust quickly,\nif you look at the graphic here,\n\n20\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.040\nsome of the core functionality for\nITSM tools.\n\n21\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.693\nYou can certainly read the bullets there,\nbut\n\n22\n00:01:06.693 --> 00:01:10.502\nI can summarize this in some ways is that,\nyou need to be looking for\n\n23\n00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:14.124\ntool sets that allow you to\nmanage your services effectively.\n\n24\n00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:20.026\nAnd that's gonna be Including integration\nacross multiple processes, visibility,\n\n25\n00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:25.900\ndiscovery, metrics, reporting,\nperhaps remote control, self help systems.\n\n26\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.340\nThose are the types of technologies that\nare gonna enable you to be more flexible\n\n27\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.340\nand more focused on the customers and\n\n28\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.600\nthe business end and\nstreamline delivery of your services.\n\n29\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, as you start talking\nabout this idea, is there a,\n\n30\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.950\na way that we should rank these?\n\n31\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.460\nIf we say look, I know that\nthere's no way that I can look for\n\n32\n00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.960\nevery single one of these, Terry.\n\n33\n00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.360\nWhat, what would you consider kind of\nthe top ones that we might focus on?\n\n34\n00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.660\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's going to depend on the organization.\n\n35\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.380\nThere's no real prescription here for\nnot one size fits all.\n\n36\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.290\nYou might be a highly\nevolved service management\n\n37\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.970\norganization where you're just\nimproving your existing technologies.\n\n38\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.410\nYou might be starting from scratch and\nhaven't even picked a tool set for\n\n39\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.900\nyour service management suite.\n\n40\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.700\nSo there's no real set approach to this.\n\n41\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.320\nThe best approach would be a continual\nservice improvement approach\n\n42\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.660\nwhere you look at the critical areas,\nwork on them first,\n\n43\n00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.050\nsqueeze some value out of that and\ncontinually and gradually move forward.\n\n44\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.490\nIf you're an exam taker I think that's\nalso gonna be an important lesson to take\n\n45\n00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.440\naway as well.\n\n46\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.600\nIs that you're going to focus\non continual and gradual and\n\n47\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.570\ndon't just leap to the big\nsolution in the sky right away.\n\n48\n00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.130\nSo as you get choices on the exam, there\nwill be one that looks really promising,\n\n49\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.400\nespecially to an IT person that wants to\nsolve problems with big solutions, but\n\n50\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.340\nit's probably going to be more, the more\ncorrect answer's going to be the answer\n\n51\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.540\nthat leads you toward a measured\napproach where you look before you leap.\n\n52\n00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.980\nAnd I think that'd be true for\nyour technology limitation as well.\n\n53\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.500\n&gt;&gt; And the idea of thinking about\nevaluating what particular tools we need\n\n54\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.080\nversus the ones that we don't, it still\nseems challenging because every tool that\n\n55\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520\nyou might consider seems to say of course\nwe can do this, of course we can do this.\n\n56\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.880\nAnd so in this particular sense\nwe may actually have to deal and\n\n57\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.610\nkind of weed through a lot more\nmarketing than anything else and\n\n58\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.610\nthen figure out what solutions\nreally fit best for us, right?\n\n59\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.700\n&gt;&gt; Of course, imagine talking to a tool\nset vendor, if you're going to go out and\n\n60\n00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.760\nnot develop it in house,\nyou're talking to a tool set vendor.\n\n61\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.060\nThey're going to be selling you\nthings and, in that sales pitch,\n\n62\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.600\nthere's going to be real valuable things\nand perhaps some less valuable things.\n\n63\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.140\nSo understanding what value you're\ntrying to get out of these tool sets\n\n64\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.640\nis an important.\n\n65\n00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.760\nIf you look at the graphic here, you\nbecome in charge of this rather than let\n\n66\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.260\nthe sales effort lead you to\nthe water you need to drink.\n\n67\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.190\nYou get on top of this and you understand\nwhat it is you're trying to get done.\n\n68\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.340\nThis is rather serpentine here but\n\n69\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.420\nit really is just a linear process\nwhere you identify your requirements.\n\n70\n00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.280\nWhat products potentially could be in\nscope for delivering those particular\n\n71\n00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.420\nfunctionality, set of functionality and\nscale.\n\n72\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.020\nAnd then develop your selection criteria.\n\n73\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.250\nAs we look at this next slide, just wanna\nshow you as you look at your selection\n\n74\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.270\ncriteria you're looking for those\nthings that you must have, should have,\n\n75\n00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.870\ncould have or perhaps you'll have in\nthe future but you don't have right now.\n\n76\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.430\nIt's probably going to be pretty much\nimpossible to find a tool set that\n\n77\n00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.290\nmatches one percent of what\nyou're looking for, but\n\n78\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.690\nas a rule of thumb you should focus\non your process definition first and\n\n79\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.950\nyour process objectives and\nthen let the tools follow.\n\n80\n00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.490\nAgain, easier said than done because\nas your engaging with these vendors,\n\n81\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.080\nthey're going to try to lead you and,\nlegitimately so,\n\n82\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.960\nto how their tools provide\nvalue that's legitimate.\n\n83\n00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.500\nBut you need to focus on your processes\nfirst and then look at the tools.\n\n84\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.830\nAnother good rule of thumb is that,\nas you discerned what you must have,\n\n85\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.130\nyou want to make sure that\n100% of those are satisfied.\n\n86\n00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.060\nIf you've gone the trouble of\nanalyzing your requirements and\n\n87\n00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.837\nknow what you must have,\nthen don't compromise on those.\n\n88\n00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:04.550\nGo after those 100% of the time.\n\n89\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.850\nIt's unlikely you're gonna get something\nthat's gonna take care of everything.\n\n90\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.030\nSo for those other things that aren't\nmust haves, consider the 80 20 rule.\n\n91\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.020\nIf a tool set can give you 80% of\nthe functionality you're looking for\n\n92\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.480\nthen it's a good bet.\n\n93\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.237\n&gt;&gt; All right, now Terry, along with this\nidea and thinking about those different\n\n94\n00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:26.924\ntools that are available, there also\ncomes this unusual thing that happens.\n\n95\n00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:27.988\nAnd I've seen it happen and\n\n96\n00:05:27.988 --> 00:05:30.620\nyou've probably seen it happen\nwith just even hardware.\n\n97\n00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.440\nWhere you buy it, and three months later\nthat particular tool that you thought was\n\n98\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.170\nreally gonna be the thing\nthat does everything.\n\n99\n00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.840\nIt now seems a little bit dated.\n\n100\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.660\nIt doesn't work as well.\n\n101\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.770\nSo is there anything that kind\nof helps us to think about\n\n102\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.390\nfuture proofing a little bit?\n\n103\n00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.390\nOr is that just kind of\na pipe dream of saying,\n\n104\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.290\nthere's no way we're gonna actually\nbe able to say six months from now\n\n105\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.400\nthe tools that we select\nare really going to help us here?\n\n106\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's good news on this front.\n\n107\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.690\nIT service management has matured.\n\n108\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.922\nThere is a lot of vendors that\nhave coalesced around ITIL itself.\n\n109\n00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:06.340\nITIL is a safe bet.\n\n110\n00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.230\nBack in the day, good vendors, very good\nvendors, had provided good tool sets for\n\n111\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.700\nhow they envisioned service management.\n\n112\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.050\nMaybe they were really good at managing\ntickets at the service desk and\n\n113\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.520\nturning them into problems,\nand managing change.\n\n114\n00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.150\nBut they weren't necessarily using the\nsame vocabulary in their tool sets that\n\n115\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.590\nmaybe ITIL does vver\nthe years that has evolved.\n\n116\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.720\nAgain, ITIL is the world's single best and\nmost widely adopted service management\n\n117\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.870\npractice, therefore tool vendors\nhave caught up with that reality and\n\n118\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.780\nare now positioning their products\nto be ITIL-aligned, right?\n\n119\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.690\nSo that's good news.\n\n120\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.450\nAnother part of the good news is that as\nyou're developing your tool set strategy,\n\n121\n00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.080\nyou should consider future growth,\n\n122\n00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.820\nnot necessarily future functionality but\nfuture growth.\n\n123\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.900\nThe scale of your tool sets now could\nbe challenged in the future, right?\n\n124\n00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.290\nSo build in a little bit of scalability\ninto your tool selections, but\n\n125\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.210\nin terms of functionality,\n\n126\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.260\nthe good news is there's a lot of tool\nvendors out there that understand ITIL,\n\n127\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.759\nuse the language of ITIL, and\nunderstand the challenges of integration.\n\n128\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.560\nSo, just be careful of that.\n\n129\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.651\nUse tried and trusted vendors, one's\nthat's got some road wear if you will,\n\n130\n00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.205\nthey've been in this game for a while or\nhave shown some good vendors,\n\n131\n00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:31.145\nI'm sorry, some good customer bases,\nand have some experience with it and\n\n132\n00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:33.093\nyou'll make some safe bets.\n\n133\n00:07:33.093 --> 00:07:36.095\n&gt;&gt; Now Terry, that does sound like\na lot like some of the concepts that I\n\n134\n00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:38.620\nunderstand from project\nmanagement as well.\n\n135\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.282\nThat, even though we can take a look at\nthem, it does seem like some of those\n\n136\n00:07:43.282 --> 00:07:48.255\nskills do transfer over and kind of help\nme understand ITIL a little bit better.\n\n137\n00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:53.225\nSo is there a good way to take some of the\nthings that I might have learned to help\n\n138\n00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:57.827\ntransfer those over and to make sure\nthat everything integrates well.\n\n139\n00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.412\n&gt;&gt; Project management as a discipline does\nmarry up well with service management\n\n140\n00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:03.459\nas a discipline.\n\n141\n00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.420\nRisk management, for instance,\nis a big key of project management.\n\n142\n00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.990\nIt should be a big part\nof service management.\n\n143\n00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.550\nLooking ahead, predictive,\nunderstanding resource constraints,\n\n144\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.280\nunderstanding cost constraints, these are\ndisciplines that project management has.\n\n145\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.970\nAnd typically they apply those for\na project that has a beginning and an end.\n\n146\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.860\nThe only subtle difference,\nand significant difference,\n\n147\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.240\nI shouldn't say subtle, significant\ndifference between project management and\n\n148\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.700\nservice management, is service\nmanagement doesn't really have an end.\n\n149\n00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.550\nIt's cyclical.\n\n150\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.619\nIt is a circle.\n\n151\n00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:37.740\nAnd it's a cycle of improvement\nall the time, right?\n\n152\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.350\nSo while project management\ncircle brings a lot of discipline\n\n153\n00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.160\nto the game of service management,\nservice managements adds to that game\n\n154\n00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.260\nby making sure there's a continual and\ngradual churn for improving services.\n\n155\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.120\n&gt;&gt; Now when we start to,\nto pick up on this idea of services and\n\n156\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.950\neverything that we need as well as\nkind of a comprehensive system here.\n\n157\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.650\nWhere do we begin?\n\n158\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.160\nIs it important that service operations\nreally has a part in strategy and\n\n159\n00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.240\ntransition?\n\n160\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.180\nOr do we just say, hey top down,\nhere's a nice strategy just implement it.\n\n161\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's somewhat again,\nkind of an answer within your question.\n\n162\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.430\nIt would be folly for service strategists\n\n163\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.680\nto make a decision without considering\nthe downstream stages, right?\n\n164\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.160\nI believed in ITIL researches,\nthis librarian went out,\n\n165\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.740\nI say librarian the writer of ITIL is they\nwent out and try to define best practice.\n\n166\n00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.020\nThey found that highly\nfunctioning service organizations\n\n167\n00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.890\ninvolved operational folks at\nall stages of the life cycle.\n\n168\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.510\nSo, and then they codify that in\nthe writing of their best practices and\n\n169\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.880\ntheir recommendations.\n\n170\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.890\nSo, a strong recommendation from ITIL\nis to involve service operations early\n\n171\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.090\nand often.\n\n172\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.740\nWe've been talking this week about\nrelease, control, I'm sorry,\n\n173\n00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.050\nin these episodes, in release,\ncontrol, and validation, right?\n\n174\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.620\nSo, while that scope was somewhat narrow\nto the changing of existing services,\n\n175\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.030\noperations still needs\nto be involved in that.\n\n176\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.550\nThere is an operational\nchurn with change and\n\n177\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.650\nthose operational people know\nthat churn better than anybody.\n\n178\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.560\nThey understand those impacts perhaps\nbetter than anybody else because they're\n\n179\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.530\non the ground feeling\nthe pain of failed changes.\n\n180\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.010\nThey're on the ground feeling\nthe benefits of successful changes.\n\n181\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.400\nThey're the ones that are going\nto be delivering it ongoing.\n\n182\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.390\nSo, involve the shares operations\npeople earlier than later is key.\n\n183\n00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.490\n&gt;&gt; What are some of the other types\nof planning that we have to consider\n\n184\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.350\nwhen we're talking about this idea\nof the additional technologies like\n\n185\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.790\nlicensing and deployment?\n\n186\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.020\nWhat else do we need to consider here?\n\n187\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for this.\n\n188\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:42.590\nThis topic is not particularly exciting,\nbut you can get some\n\n189\n00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.040\ngood recommendations from other\npractitioners and other services.\n\n190\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.160\nLicensing, just how do you wanna\nthink about your licensing?\n\n191\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.174\nYou're gonna buy a tool set,\nhow many people are going to be using it,\n\n192\n00:10:55.174 --> 00:10:57.899\ndo you want dedicated licenses,\ndo you wanna share licenses?\n\n193\n00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:02.562\nDo you wanna have something called a web\nlicense, where some people can access this\n\n194\n00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:07.830\ntool set and a lot cheaper price but\nonly get some of the functionality right?\n\n195\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.630\nOr is it gonna be service on demand in\nfact some of this tools sets are actually\n\n196\n00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:16.360\nexternally hosted and they are intended\nto be scaled as you grow right?\n\n197\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.150\nSo there's lots of options in\nthis pages related to scale,\n\n198\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.940\nrelated to cost savings, etc.\n\n199\n00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.050\nITIL is certainly not\nprescriptive in this regard and\n\n200\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.900\nthe options available views that comes out\non an exam are going to be fairly obvious.\n\n201\n00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:35.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so along with this then,\nlet's then focus in on the idea of some\n\n202\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.940\nof the critical success factors that\nwe want to make sure that we go over.\n\n203\n00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough, as we concluded\nthe discussion on each of these seven\n\n204\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.890\nprocesses in release control validation,\n\n205\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.550\nwe focused on the critical success\nfactors of those processes.\n\n206\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.040\nI think it's also important to focus on\nthe critical success factors of service\n\n207\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.780\nmanagement at large and\n\n208\n00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.130\nthis really does mean that you're gonna\nbe focusing on business outcomes.\n\n209\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.940\nWe've also preached that\nthroughout these episodes as well.\n\n210\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.970\nIs that whatever you are doing, you need\nto have the focus that is going to add\n\n211\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.050\nbenefit and\nvalue to your customers, right?\n\n212\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.670\nIt's not just saving money for\nIT that's an important factor,\n\n213\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.400\nit could be an important factor for\nyour customers.\n\n214\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.850\nIf you save money,\nyou perhaps those savings get passed on.\n\n215\n00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.530\nOr you live to fight another day\nbecause of your profit margins.\n\n216\n00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.930\nWhatever that might be,\nit still has a customer focus, right?\n\n217\n00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.300\nSo the overarching theme of critical\nsuccess factors is you have a way\n\n218\n00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.000\nto determine how your service provision\nis benefitting your business.\n\n219\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.380\nAnd whether that's through release,\ncontrol, and validation,\n\n220\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.700\nstandardized processes, whether it's\nthrough operations, whether it's by\n\n221\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.620\ndefining the right services at server\nstrategy and designing them effectively.\n\n222\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.500\nAll these could be pointing\nto business outcomes.\n\n223\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.355\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times, Terry, we also end up\nseeing that the goal behind all of this,\n\n224\n00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:58.512\nas well, is that we might have teams that\nare geographically diverse, or it might\n\n225\n00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:03.990\nbe some type of process in which two\ndifferent companies have merged together.\n\n226\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.090\nAnd we still need them to share\nthe information between them.\n\n227\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.530\nSo help us out here on\nthe service management side and\n\n228\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.640\ntalk about collaboration a little bit.\n\n229\n00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.970\n&gt;&gt; Certainly your tool sets need\nto support knowledge share, right?\n\n230\n00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.860\nWhether that be through\ncollaboration in meetings.\n\n231\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.440\nWhether it be through\na regular set of interfaces.\n\n232\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.828\nWhether those be physical interfaces or\nas in face to face interfaces, or\n\n233\n00:13:28.828 --> 00:13:32.453\nelectronic interfaces and\nall the stakeholders involved.\n\n234\n00:13:32.453 --> 00:13:35.365\nWhether it be your suppliers,\nyour customers, your users or\n\n235\n00:13:35.365 --> 00:13:37.840\nthose people within your organization.\n\n236\n00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.010\nDeveloping a culture\nwhere you're sharing and\n\n237\n00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.890\nbeing transparent is really the best\npractice that ITIL is preaching here.\n\n238\n00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.420\nMaking sure that you have the right\ninformation in front of the right people\n\n239\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.700\nis not Knowledge Management's remit, but\nhaving a culture of sharing information\n\n240\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.669\nis something you're just going to\nhave to build out as an organization.\n\n241\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.620\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat actually makes a lot of sense, Terry,\n\n242\n00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.510\nas we start to take a look at\nservice management as a whole.\n\n243\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.280\nIn terms of release, control, and\nvalidations, I think that we've hit\n\n244\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.450\nevery process that we have been needing\nto hit to prepare us for the exam.\n\n245\n00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.600\nAnd now it means that we actually do need\nto get down to the point of studying as\n\n246\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.850\nwell and getting ready for the exam, too.\n\n247\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.790\nSo, Terry what are some of the things\nthat we can do to start preparing and\n\n248\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.620\nto make sure our minds are in the right\nplace as we get ready for the exam.\n\n249\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Well on this particular topic of\ntechnology implementation there's a good\n\n250\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.380\ncase study exercise for you to follow.\n\n251\n00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.660\nIt's a case study with a very specific\nfocus on implementation considerations,\n\n252\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.080\nit gets your juices flowing in that\ndirection and as I've mentioned before.\n\n253\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.020\nThose practice exams, those two practice\nexams you have access to is a very\n\n254\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.100\nvaluable guide to get you into the mind of\nthe test maker and understanding not just\n\n255\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.650\nhow you can take in this knowledge,\nbut how you can apply this knowledge.\n\n256\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.735\nAnd I highly recommend that you vet those\ntwo practice exams very thoroughly.\n\n257\n00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:57.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, Terry,\nwell, thank you again for\n\n258\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.700\nhelping us in this discussion,\n\n259\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.140\nand understanding that service management\nas a whole also needs to be considered.\n\n260\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.950\nA lot of times it's real easy\nto focus in on one are that you\n\n261\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.910\nfeel very comfortable with,\nand get very good at that.\n\n262\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.710\nBut not actually consider as part of the\nentire hole, and that's where we can also\n\n263\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.590\nfail, so make sure you review not only\nthis lesson, but also every lesson that\n\n264\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.930\nwe've had here, in terms of ITIL\nrelease control and validation but\n\n265\n00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:26.140\nthis is a great place for us to also\ngo ahead and have a stopping point.\n\n266\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.250\nSo signing off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n267\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n268\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:36.952\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for more\nITIL; Release, Control, and Validation.\n\n269\n00:15:36.952 --> 00:15:42.913\n[MUSIC]\n\n270\n00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:46.210\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.260\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.785\n&gt;&gt; Hello, again, and thank you for making\nthe intelligent choice to watch ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.739\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.150\nI'm your host Zach Memos, we're\ncontinuing on with sample paper review\n\n8\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.073\n&gt;&gt; Today it's ITIL, Release, Control, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:27.024\nValidation.\n\n10\n00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:28.540\nAnd who's bringing us the information?\n\n11\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.395\nTerry Decker, the man who knows\nall about it, hey, Terry.\n\n12\n00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, happy to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.980\nAnd as Zach said, we're looking at sample\npaper review, which is the practice exams.\n\n14\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.196\nAnd the subject matter for this one\nis Release, Control and Validation.\n\n15\n00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:45.980\nJust a side note, as a prerequisite,\nas you look at the slides here,\n\n16\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.540\na prerequisite is that you need\nto have taken the sample paper.\n\n17\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.240\nGo ahead and practice the exam,\nand then come to this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.830\nSo if you haven't done that yet,\nmake sure you get that done.\n\n19\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.200\nSo there's also another very\nhelpful video available for\n\n20\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.880\ndownload called General Approach\nto Exam Taking.\n\n21\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.440\nThis gives you some generic treatment\nof any intermediate exam, right?\n\n22\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.770\nAnd of course, you have to download\nthe sample papers themselves,\n\n23\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.100\nwhich consist of three parts.\n\n24\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.180\nThe scenario booklet, the question\nbooklet, and the answers and rational.\n\n25\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.830\nSo you'll use the question booklet and\nscenario booklet.\n\n26\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.350\nThat's what you'll get for\nthe live exam, as well.\n\n27\n00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.765\nThey don't give you the answers,\nunfortunately.\n\n28\n00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:27.480\nBut you get the questions that lead you\nto a scenario, you read the scenario.\n\n29\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.730\nAnd then you come back and answer\nthe question is the typical way to go.\n\n30\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.780\nSo be sure you practice first,\nand then come to this episode\n\n31\n00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.840\nto hone in on the finer points of\ntest taking for this particular exam.\n\n32\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.280\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, again,\ntake the practice exam before watching?\n\n33\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.420\n&gt;&gt; This episode.\n&gt;&gt; This episode, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nit'll be a lot more relevant to you.\n\n35\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.970\nI mean, you can do them out of order,\nyou could do it in different way.\n\n36\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.500\nBut to get the review and\nto get the new learning,\n\n37\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.191\nit's better if you go and\nread the sample paper.\n\n38\n00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:57.850\nGo attempt the sample paper,\ntry to pass it, basically.\n\n39\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.220\nAnd then come for the review.\n\n40\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.580\nYou'll find a lot more meat on the bone\nto chew on if you do it that way.\n\n41\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, that makes sense,\nthis is sample paper review.\n\n42\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly right.\n\n43\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's go right into it.\n\n44\n00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.920\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, that's exactly,\nlet's dig right in.\n\n45\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.200\nThe way I treat this is\nI kinda break them down.\n\n46\n00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.843\nYou'll see that I've put\nthings in some blue text,\n\n47\n00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:15.716\nsome green text, and some red text.\n\n48\n00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:19.504\nAnd you'll pick this up from the general\nexam taking tips if you watch\n\n49\n00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:21.260\nthat particular video.\n\n50\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.050\nBut really what I'm doing\nhere is I'm separating\n\n51\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.530\nthe more critical parts from\nthe informational parts.\n\n52\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.269\nThe blue bits are the business context or\nthe business strategy and direction.\n\n53\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.330\nIt's not irrelevant, but it's not very\ncritical to your success on the exam.\n\n54\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.670\nIt's just background.\n\n55\n00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.250\nNow the green bits,\nthis is where we talk about\n\n56\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.820\nthe particular service provider's\ncapabilities or their constraints.\n\n57\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.460\nDo they have a lot of money, are the\nmature in this area, immature in that one?\n\n58\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.050\nSo you get the idea of the context of how\neffective the service provider already is.\n\n59\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.610\nNow that's relevant when you're taking\nthe exam because if you find as\n\n60\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.474\nyou're reading the scenario that\nthe service provider is very strong in X,\n\n61\n00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:11.640\nthen you don't wanna go pick\nthe answer that says, let's improve X.\n\n62\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.210\nBecause it's already been taken care of,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.570\nSo that's just a way to match\nthe questions up with a given scenario.\n\n64\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.170\nLooking for the strengths,\nas well as the weaknesses,\n\n65\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.500\nis pretty important as\nyou're reading the scenario.\n\n66\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.990\nBut again, the most critical thing is\nthe specific question being asked or\n\n67\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.440\nthe specific deficiency being addressed.\n\n68\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.950\nAnd in this case,\nthis particular question,\n\n69\n00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.930\nit's all in the question, itself.\n\n70\n00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.780\nWhere it says, you've been asked by the\nCIO to recommend the approach that should\n\n71\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.610\nbe taken to deploy the release units,\n\n72\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.610\ntaking into account the business\nrequirements and the release policy.\n\n73\n00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.070\nSo this scenario better\ntell us about the policy.\n\n74\n00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.170\nAnd it better tell us about\nthe business requirements.\n\n75\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.460\nIt certainly better do that.\n\n76\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.328\nAnd then the rest of the story is,\nhow should we manage these release units?\n\n77\n00:03:55.328 --> 00:04:02.847\nSo again, RCV, the course, RCV,\nis focused on seven different processes.\n\n78\n00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.270\nThis is gonna be about release and\ndeployment management.\n\n79\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.490\nAnd it sounds like it's gonna be\nvery specific about the integrity\n\n80\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.420\nof release units and\nthe testing thereof, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.720\nSo let's have a look at the question and\nthe answers, themselves.\n\n82\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.470\nNow here,\nthis is required quite a bit of back and\n\n83\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.590\nforth between the answers and\nthe original scenario.\n\n84\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.340\nSo I took, for this example, I brought\nthe release units on over to here.\n\n85\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.943\nSo you'd have to have\nthese in front of you.\n\n86\n00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:29.139\nNow as you're taking the exam,\n\n87\n00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.320\nyou're gonna have to toggle\nbetween a couple of screens.\n\n88\n00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.460\nGo look at the scenario,\ncome back and look at the question.\n\n89\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.980\nGo back and look at the scenario,\nvery common.\n\n90\n00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.550\nObviously, here I could do a little bit\nof magic cuz I can put them all on one\n\n91\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.390\npiece of paper.\n\n92\n00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.120\n&gt;&gt; And have the sample paper with you,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.873\n&gt;&gt; Of course, it's very recommended as\nwe're doing this review that you have\n\n94\n00:04:45.873 --> 00:04:47.090\nthe sample paper in front of you.\n\n95\n00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.020\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And of course,\n\n96\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.219\nyou can separate them as you wish.\n\n97\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.338\nSo again,\n\n98\n00:04:51.338 --> 00:04:56.677\nwhat we're gonna find here is that we\nneed to be aware what the policy states.\n\n99\n00:04:56.677 --> 00:04:59.120\nAnd be aware what the business\nrequirements are.\n\n100\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.508\nAnd be aware of how are we're supposed\nto maintain integrity of released units,\n\n101\n00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:05.071\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.680\nSo as you look at this, again,\nnot to teach you the subject matter.\n\n103\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.422\nBut looking through here,\nyou'll see that, again, doing compare and\n\n104\n00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:16.160\ncontrast, as we looked across A,\nB, and C, I can see that B and\n\n105\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.180\nC seem to start of with the same words.\n\n106\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.790\nReassemble the release units into\nthe following released packages.\n\n107\n00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.193\nSo they start off the same, right?\n\n108\n00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.755\nA and D just say go ahead and\ndeploy the original release packages,\n\n109\n00:05:30.755 --> 00:05:32.610\njust however they're released.\n\n110\n00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.220\nNow as we read this scenario,\n\n111\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.810\nwe found that there was a problem with one\nof the units inside a release package.\n\n112\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.550\nIt's not working, so you can't deploy\nsomething that's not working, right?\n\n113\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.810\nSo A and D are already a little bit\nsuspect because they're basically saying,\n\n114\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.700\ngo ahead and deploy, right?\n\n115\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.140\nSo we got to watch out for\nthose glaring statements like that.\n\n116\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.410\nAnd then later on, we'll see that\na distinguishing characteristic\n\n117\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.770\nbetween B and\nC is that one ignores the policy.\n\n118\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.240\nWhere the policy says, do not\nrelease unless you've tested, right?\n\n119\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.980\nThe very specific policy.\n\n120\n00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.610\nSo if we're supposed to follow the policy,\n\n121\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.760\nwhich the question says we're supposed to,\nfollow the policy, don't break the rules.\n\n122\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.320\nAnd satisfy business requirements,\nthen B is getting a little suspect because\n\n123\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.990\nit seeks to immediately deploy something\nthat's not been fully tested, right?\n\n124\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.600\nIt seems to work, but\nit's not been tested yet.\n\n125\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.738\nSo again, this one comes down to an\nawareness of the integrity of the policy,\n\n126\n00:06:30.738 --> 00:06:35.149\nthe integrity of the release units, and\nyour awareness of release unit control.\n\n127\n00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:36.434\nThat's really what it is, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:36.434 --> 00:06:37.648\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n129\n00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Alright, and moving on to question 2.\n\n130\n00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.170\nAgain, the blue, green, and\n\n131\n00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.190\nred text have been applied here\njust as a visual reference.\n\n132\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.881\nYou can look there on\nyour own papers here.\n\n133\n00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:51.110\nThere's some background information\nregarding this hospital\n\n134\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.500\nmanagement company.\n\n135\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.910\nAnd then there is some service\nprovider context written in green here\n\n136\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.630\nabout how good they are at some things and\nmaybe not so good at the others.\n\n137\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.000\nBut then there's some specific\ndeficiencies found out.\n\n138\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.886\nAnd this is rendered in red\nwith these bullet statements.\n\n139\n00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:12.261\nAnd by the way, the question says, which\nchange evaluation factors for assessing\n\n140\n00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:16.610\nthe effects of implementing AMOS,\nwhich is the service they offer here.\n\n141\n00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.979\nWhich ones were neglected\nduring this implementation and\n\n142\n00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.903\nhave contributed most to its failure\nas described in the scenario?\n\n143\n00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:28.180\nSo notice the very first,\nwhich change evaluation factors?\n\n144\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.050\nSo here we need to know what factors\nare used to make change evaluations.\n\n145\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.180\nAnd to see which ones were neglected,\nright?\n\n146\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.180\nSo you recall, there's a pretty\ngood long list of factors in play.\n\n147\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.071\nAnd as you go to the rationale, what's\nreally sweet about this type of question\n\n148\n00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:49.451\nis that, as you go to the answers and\nrationale, there's a long list of\n\n149\n00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.479\nall the things that could be\nconsidered as an evaluation factor.\n\n150\n00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.192\nAnd they weigh them out individually.\n\n151\n00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:58.531\nRelevant, not relevant,\nrelevant, not relevant.\n\n152\n00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:00.804\nSo as you go and review this question,\n\n153\n00:08:00.804 --> 00:08:06.063\nyou're gonna get a solid refresher on what\nfactors are involved in change evaluation,\n\n154\n00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:10.910\nand you're gonna see it play out in\ncontext with a specific scenario, right?\n\n155\n00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.230\nSo let's go have a look\nat the question itself.\n\n156\n00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.700\nSo in this particular case,\n\n157\n00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.860\nnow while service provider capability\nis certainly one of the factors.\n\n158\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.590\nIt was related to this scenario.\n\n159\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.950\nSo while A starts off, there was\na lack of service provider capability\n\n160\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.280\nto deliver the required support.\n\n161\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.380\nIn fact, it explicitly stated, this\nparticular service had been rolled out\n\n162\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.690\nmany times successfully at\nmany different hospitals.\n\n163\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.630\nIt was just failing here.\n\n164\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.720\nSo service provider capability is probably\nnot a factor that was mistaken, right,\n\n165\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.160\nor misevaluated.\n\n166\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.490\nThe service provider\ndoes have the capability.\n\n167\n00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.760\nSo that's the red flag on that one.\n\n168\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.210\nAgain, relate it right\nback to the scenario.\n\n169\n00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.700\nThe rest of A sounds pretty good, right?\n\n170\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.690\nAs you look to B,\nwe talk about the words tolerance.\n\n171\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.020\nYou'll see later in quotes\norganizational settings.\n\n172\n00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.810\nSo what this particular question\nis doing is it's highlighting\n\n173\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.800\nthe very explicit terms ITIL gives\nto change evaluation factors.\n\n174\n00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800\nThere's tolerance,\noperational setting, right, etc.\n\n175\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.508\nSo this is one of these\nwhere you either know it or\n\n176\n00:09:17.508 --> 00:09:20.635\nyou don't as it relates to\nthis particular scenario.\n\n177\n00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:22.821\nSo what is tolerance,\nwhat is organizational setting?\n\n178\n00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:25.630\nYou need to kinda know what those\nare to make sense of these things.\n\n179\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.855\nAnd I'm not here to teach you those\njust now, but again, good news,\n\n180\n00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:33.070\nthe answer rationale itself gives\na very good lesson in this.\n\n181\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.630\nSo if you need to reinforce\nthis particular topic,\n\n182\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.850\nthis sample paper's gonna\nhelp you get there.\n\n183\n00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.700\nI'm just trying to help you understand and\ndistinguish among these different answers.\n\n184\n00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.400\nFair enough?\n\n185\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.970\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n186\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.530\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n187\n00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.720\n&gt;&gt; I say awesome an awful lot.\n\n188\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.820\nI just realized that.\n\n189\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.350\nIt's because I am always in awe\nof all this information and\n\n190\n00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.750\nthe way you make it all make sense,\nso thank you very much.\n\n191\n00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.830\n&gt;&gt; Glad you think so, very good.\n\n192\n00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.730\nAll right now, question three.\n\n193\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.230\nAgain, you are the quality\nmanager of the enterprise.\n\n194\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.160\nWhich one of the following options is\nthe best approach to resolve this issue?\n\n195\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.180\nSo we need to find the issue.\n\n196\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.840\nRight, so we've read the question,\nnow what is the issue?\n\n197\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.160\nAnd the issue, again, is showing up\nin red, the specific deficiency, or\n\n198\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.410\nthe specific problem\nthat needs to be solved.\n\n199\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.040\nRight?\n\n200\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.580\nAnd in this case,\n\n201\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.010\neight months after the launch of the new\nsystem little benefit has been realized.\n\n202\n00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.950\nWe got a new IT service management suite,\n\n203\n00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.600\nlittle benefit has been\nrealized by the company.\n\n204\n00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.152\nBusiness and users continue to\ncomplain about support quality, so\n\n205\n00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:31.841\nwe invested in this tool set to help\nus be a better IT service provider.\n\n206\n00:10:31.841 --> 00:10:33.541\nAnd 12 months later,\n\n207\n00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:39.580\nit's not working were not squeezing any\nvalue out of this new tool set, right?\n\n208\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.170\nThe senior management of the company has\nconcluded that the knowledge management\n\n209\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:47.680\nfunctionality, so now we're getting very\nspecific area of knowledge management now.\n\n210\n00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.791\nThat the knowledge management\nfunctionality provided by\n\n211\n00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:51.820\nthe collaboration tool is\nnot performing as expected.\n\n212\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.260\nSo, among the various things that could've\nbeen going wrong with this IT service\n\n213\n00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.440\nmanagement suite,\nwe're drilling down into only one of them.\n\n214\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.227\nNow, this is gonna be a test in\ndiscipline, test-taking discipline.\n\n215\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.250\nYou might be involved in the adoption\nof an IT service management suite, and\n\n216\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.540\nyou bring your work\nbaggage to this question.\n\n217\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.720\nAnd you'll see knowledge\nmanagement is one of them,\n\n218\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.510\nbut you also see, well, what we're\nstruggling on is incident management and\n\n219\n00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.120\nproblem management,\nintegration with change.\n\n220\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.830\nI mean you'll have all your baggage,\nright?\n\n221\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.789\nAnd you're gonna find an answer that looks\nlike it's taking in your concerns at work.\n\n222\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.930\nThat's not what we're here for, we're here\nto take an exam and have an academic focus\n\n223\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.918\nnot an operational one and here,\nas many things that can go wrong with a IT\n\n224\n00:11:33.918 --> 00:11:39.040\nservice management suite of\napplications this particular focus, as\n\n225\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.220\nit tells that last paragraph, the senior\nmanagement of the company has concluded.\n\n226\n00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.060\nThis is very decisive, that the knowledge\nmanagement functionality provided\n\n227\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.220\nby the collaboration tool is\nnot performing as expected.\n\n228\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.650\nThey've invited the quality manager to\nconduct an investigation and to recommend\n\n229\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.930\nways of improving the situation as\nrelates to knowledge management.\n\n230\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:04.300\nIn this question, you are the quality\nmanager with a very specific question.\n\n231\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.780\nHow is it this suite can be more effective\n\n232\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.271\ntoward the integration of\nknowledge management, right?\n\n233\n00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:16.060\nTough question, potentially, but\nthat's the question unto itself, right?\n\n234\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.690\nAll right, so A, since you worked with\nthe IT organization to assess the current\n\n235\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.170\nknowledge management process, and\n\n236\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.530\nthe roles and responsibilities\ndefined to execute the process.\n\n237\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.710\nNot so bad.\n\n238\n00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.970\nThe reason why this is\nkind of in this orangeish,\n\n239\n00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.980\nbrownish color is because\nit's kind of meh, right?\n\n240\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.290\nIt's not wrong, but it's not directly\nrelated to this particular issue.\n\n241\n00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.378\nAnd, by the way, it doesn't have\nany kind of customer focus or\n\n242\n00:12:40.378 --> 00:12:42.800\nbusiness-facing focus, right?\n\n243\n00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.480\nRemember that's one of the golden\nconcepts, customer focused?\n\n244\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.060\nIt's not showing up yet.\n\n245\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.990\nAnd we can see it's showing up,\nfor instance, in C.\n\n246\n00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.600\nYou start by talking to different\nbusiness and IT stakeholders.\n\n247\n00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.530\nSo, now you're getting involved\nwith a more holistic approach to\n\n248\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.450\nyour stakeholders, right?\n\n249\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:07.870\nRemember, the stakeholders are customers,\nusers, suppliers and of course, ourselves.\n\n250\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.700\nThe cobbler's kids need shoes too.\n\n251\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.895\nSo the IT service provider\nis also a stakeholder.\n\n252\n00:13:11.895 --> 00:13:15.753\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love that,\nthe cobbler's kids need shoes.\n\n253\n00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.698\nI love that.\n\n254\n00:13:17.698 --> 00:13:22.000\n&gt;&gt; So, there's already\na difference showing up with C.\n\n255\n00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.950\nAnd of course, as you can tell\nfrom my graphical representation,\n\n256\n00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.630\nC is gonna be the best answer.\n\n257\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:31.600\nBut as you're going through here, it looks\nlike the only one that really focuses on\n\n258\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.470\ncustomer outcomes or\nbusiness involvement so far is C.\n\n259\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.880\nSo, we already have a way\nto kinda point to C\n\n260\n00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.550\nwhen that very basic golden concept rule.\n\n261\n00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.430\nOkay, so as we continue to look.\n\n262\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.570\nNow B is identified as\nbeing totally wrong, right?\n\n263\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.830\nAnd of course I got that from\nthe rationale, but what makes it so bad?\n\n264\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.370\nIt says, you go back to examine the\ncustomization, the collaboration tool, and\n\n265\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.590\ndetermine how it has met\nthe stated process requirements.\n\n266\n00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:01.470\nIn addition, you compare other tools in\nthe market with a tool already purchased\n\n267\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.710\nand discuss with the vendor\nthe feasibility of adding functionality.\n\n268\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.490\nYou then make a recommendation to senior\nmanagement of implementing additional\n\n269\n00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.620\ntool functionality.\n\n270\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.740\nTool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool, tool.\n\n271\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.890\nNot process, process,\nprocess, tool, tool, tool.\n\n272\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.160\nSo obviously the tool set is important.\n\n273\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.690\nI don't want to disparage tools wholesale.\n\n274\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.777\nBut we have to consider process and\nhow it works with tool and\n\n275\n00:14:23.777 --> 00:14:28.075\nthe only thing they mentioned in the\nprocess, which was nothing to worry about.\n\n276\n00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:32.125\nIn fact, it says, it has met\nthe stated process requirements.\n\n277\n00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:35.345\n&gt;&gt; And isn't it true, they're looking for\nsome kind of specific action?\n\n278\n00:14:35.345 --> 00:14:36.865\n&gt;&gt; Related to knowledge management?\n\n279\n00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.375\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Not so generic.\n\n280\n00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:39.845\nSo good call there.\n\n281\n00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.125\nIt's not nearly specific enough, right?\n\n282\n00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:45.790\nSo hopefully you can get rid of the ones\nin zeros pretty quickly, right?\n\n283\n00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.550\nAnd A and\n\n284\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.210\nB are kinda in that category of not really\nto the point of knowledge management.\n\n285\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.680\nA lacks customer service or\n\n286\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.280\ncustomer focus, B doesn't add the customer\nfocus, it's all tools focused.\n\n287\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.930\nTools, tools, tools.\n\n288\n00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.960\nNeither one of them are specific to\nthe very specific questions or issue here.\n\n289\n00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.630\nHow is knowledge management\nsupposed to be helped?\n\n290\n00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.590\nThat's where the problem is, right?\n\n291\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.137\nThat's that.\n\n292\n00:15:11.137 --> 00:15:15.060\nNow, distinguishing between C and D,\na subtle difference here, perhaps.\n\n293\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.160\nIt says on D, you start by defining\nknowledge management strategy for\n\n294\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.570\nthe entire company.\n\n295\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.290\nThis is just a tell-tale\nsign of a red flag.\n\n296\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:30.852\nIf you're being asked to solve a problem,\nyou don't jump to the plan, right?\n\n297\n00:15:30.852 --> 00:15:34.990\nThis holds true on any ITIL exam,\nany exam question.\n\n298\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.110\nIf you're being asked to solve a problem,\ndon't jump to the decision part.\n\n299\n00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.660\nYou're gonna have to\ncollect some data first.\n\n300\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.620\nGet some stakeholder opinions if it is,\nin the lack of data.\n\n301\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.810\nFind some measurements,\ndo something that backs up your strategy.\n\n302\n00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.359\nHere, they jumped right into defining what\nyour strategy is without stepping back and\n\n303\n00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:55.372\ngetting good stakeholder feedback.\n\n304\n00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:57.418\nRequirements, feedback, etc.\n\n305\n00:15:57.418 --> 00:16:02.856\nSo again, while this is a great example of\nwhat not to do in finding the five answer,\n\n306\n00:16:02.856 --> 00:16:06.293\ndon't jump to the solution,\nlook before you leap.\n\n307\n00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:09.740\nNow the only exception to that is\nif all the looking was done in this\n\n308\n00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.811\nscenario, right?\n\n309\n00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:15.629\nIf all the looking, all the analysis,\nall the data, all the measurement,\n\n310\n00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:19.860\nis presented In the scenario, and\nthe question is very explicit.\n\n311\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.170\nWhat do you do with this data?\n\n312\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.393\nThen maybe you can jump to\nthe planning stage, right?\n\n313\n00:16:24.393 --> 00:16:26.429\nBut that certainly wasn't the case here.\n\n314\n00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:30.505\nIn fact it was just a conclusion that hey,\nnow this management's kind of squishy.\n\n315\n00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:31.360\nCan you help us out with this?\n\n316\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.250\nMake it more solid?\n\n317\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.326\nYou can't jump to the strategy without\nunderstanding the data behind it, or\n\n318\n00:16:36.326 --> 00:16:37.523\nthe measurements behind it.\n\n319\n00:16:37.523 --> 00:16:40.750\n&gt;&gt; Fair,\nthat squishy is the official word to use.\n\n320\n00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.402\n&gt;&gt; That's the ITIL word,\nITIL squishy, that's right.\n\n321\n00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You heard it here first.\n\n322\n00:16:45.935 --> 00:16:47.210\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n323\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.472\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n324\n00:16:49.472 --> 00:16:50.490\nAnyway, moving forward here.\n\n325\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.320\nAgain, the same treatment's being done.\n\n326\n00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.190\nNotice this one doesn't have\na whole lot of red in it, right?\n\n327\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.160\nSo there's a lot of\nbackground information.\n\n328\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.544\nWhat's the context of the business?\n\n329\n00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:01.030\nYou'll see one paragraph related to that.\n\n330\n00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.490\nYou'll see a lot of verbiage,\nthe green parts,\n\n331\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.570\nrelated to the current capabilities or\nconstraints of the IT service provider.\n\n332\n00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.554\nBut the actual question,\nthe actual deficiency being sought or\n\n333\n00:17:11.554 --> 00:17:14.590\nsought revenue for\nis pretty straightforward.\n\n334\n00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.040\nThe CMO secretary is very unhappy with\nthe response from the service desk.\n\n335\n00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.985\nNow, of course, you'd have to read\nupstream to find out what was so\n\n336\n00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:23.180\nunsatisfactory about it.\n\n337\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.808\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhat we have here is an unhappy customer\n\n338\n00:17:27.808 --> 00:17:32.480\nbecause we followed the process\nby the letter of the law.\n\n339\n00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.260\nThat's what you'll find.\n\n340\n00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.170\nIn the green bits, the service desk simply\ntold the secretary of a chief executive,\n\n341\n00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.246\nthat they're gonna have to wait for\n\n342\n00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:45.550\nthe software installation because\nthat's what their process says, right?\n\n343\n00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.580\nSo this is about request fulfillment.\n\n344\n00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.140\nAnd what's the appropriate\nway to fulfill requests?\n\n345\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.521\nThe nature of this beast is this.\n\n346\n00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:57.220\nShould you have a separate\nlittle process for\n\n347\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.980\nexecutive request that's different\nfrom the rank and file request?\n\n348\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.408\nIf your answer is yeah, you probably\nshould consider executives to get special\n\n349\n00:18:07.408 --> 00:18:11.650\ntreatment, what ITIL calls that is\na model, a request fulfillment model.\n\n350\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.590\nSo this is about request fulfillment and\nit's about the need to define\n\n351\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.217\nan appropriate model for\nhandling executive requests, okay.\n\n352\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.420\nThat's the academic nuggets here.\n\n353\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.736\nSo, again, distinguishing among these,\nagain it's already in red so\n\n354\n00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:32.178\nyou already know if I've already\ndone the evaluations, but\n\n355\n00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:35.080\njust how rote and pendantic it is.\n\n356\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.881\nTake a look at this.\n\n357\n00:18:36.881 --> 00:18:39.610\nYou realize this is a one-off event.\n\n358\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.410\nYou believe the service desk has responded\nappropriately by telling a chief executive\n\n359\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.260\nofficer they're gonna have\nto wait three days, right?\n\n360\n00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.980\nChief executive officers go\ninto a meeting that afternoon.\n\n361\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.745\nHe needs something installed on his\nlaptop, and you just told the chief,\n\n362\n00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:54.113\nnot the CEO but\nthe high executive I'm sorry,\n\n363\n00:18:54.113 --> 00:18:56.560\nyou're gonna have to wait three days,\nright?\n\n364\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.080\nThe answer is that's just fine,\nlet the executive wait.\n\n365\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.067\nNow as much as we might like to do that,\ntell executives they have to eat their own\n\n366\n00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:06.790\ndog food I think the phrase is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n367\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.297\n&gt;&gt; Drink their own champagne.\n\n368\n00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:12.696\nAs much as we might think it's appropriate\nthat executives have to follow the same\n\n369\n00:19:12.696 --> 00:19:16.020\nrules, that's just not\nthe reality of life and business.\n\n370\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.031\nIf the chief marketing officer says I\nneed to have this because I got a meeting\n\n371\n00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:20.981\ncoming, right?\n\n372\n00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.656\nAnd I gotta present, if you don't have\nthat available for him you might lose\n\n373\n00:19:24.656 --> 00:19:28.693\na sale, you might lose an opportunity,\nthe business will suffer and what are you?\n\n374\n00:19:28.693 --> 00:19:30.280\nFollowing process?\n\n375\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.273\nIs that what the value you're bringing is?\n\n376\n00:19:31.273 --> 00:19:35.350\nSo obviously you need to have different\nrules is what this is all saying, and\n\n377\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.100\nit's a reasonable approach\nto come up with rules.\n\n378\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.070\nSo again, I already know what the great\nanswer is here, it's already A, but\n\n379\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.870\nwhat your doing is saying we're gonna work\nthis, we're gonna solve this for you.\n\n380\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.426\nSorry CMO, right?\n\n381\n00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:47.592\nChief Marketing Officer.\n\n382\n00:19:47.592 --> 00:19:50.710\nWe're gonna take care of this for\nyou right away as an exception, right?\n\n383\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.038\nSo the service desk was correct,\nthis is how long is takes,\n\n384\n00:19:54.038 --> 00:19:57.101\nand we're going to work on future,\na future model that\n\n385\n00:19:57.101 --> 00:20:00.846\nwe can handle this more effectively for\nyou in the future, right?\n\n386\n00:20:00.846 --> 00:20:02.950\nSo that's taking care\nof the customer side.\n\n387\n00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.046\nAnd now you're turning operationally\nsaying, you know what?\n\n388\n00:20:05.046 --> 00:20:08.700\nWe need to have a methodology\nwhere our service desk can follow.\n\n389\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.160\nIt's called a model, by the way.\n\n390\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.860\nRequest fulfillment model.\n\n391\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.529\nWe need to have a model\nby which our service desk\n\n392\n00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:17.550\ncan effectively handle\nrequests from executives.\n\n393\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.370\nSo which one of them does that?\n\n394\n00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.010\nA does it, right?\nAnd the other ones don't.\n\n395\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.309\nB just relies on the process as it is,\nand thinks the executives have to wait.\n\n396\n00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:30.670\nIf you look over at D,\nit's certainly starting off the same way.\n\n397\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.405\nYou call the CMO, and say we're gonna\nwork on this as a high priority and\n\n398\n00:20:33.405 --> 00:20:34.097\nas an exception.\n\n399\n00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:38.199\nAnd then you jump into an idea,\nwe're coming up with this big data grab,\n\n400\n00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:40.708\nmaking it way more\ncomplex than you need to.\n\n401\n00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:41.260\nSee this.\n\n402\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.597\nTo ensure the required business reports\nare made available in time, you\n\n403\n00:20:44.597 --> 00:20:48.382\nimmediately send a deployment practitioner\nto install the necessary software.\n\n404\n00:20:48.382 --> 00:20:51.760\nSo you're really just going over and\naboard, right?\n\n405\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.360\nThe best answer was follow\nthe process to expedite it.\n\n406\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.350\nStill get the approvals,\nfollowing a process.\n\n407\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.165\nThere's a reason for the process,\njust be quick at it, right?\n\n408\n00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:01.755\nD totally went way around the process,\n\n409\n00:21:01.755 --> 00:21:06.264\nextraordinary efforts which\nweren't necessary helpful either.\n\n410\n00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:07.274\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Heroic efforts is not\n\n411\n00:21:07.274 --> 00:21:08.210\nnecessarily the way to go.\n\n412\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so A covers the golden concepts,\ncustomer, service, value.\n\n413\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.972\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what you're really\n\n414\n00:21:15.972 --> 00:21:17.440\nlooking for.\n\n415\n00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.254\n&gt;&gt; Right, and answering the question.\n\n416\n00:21:18.254 --> 00:21:19.732\n&gt;&gt; And answering this question.\n\n417\n00:21:19.732 --> 00:21:20.869\n&gt;&gt; Answering this question directly,\nvery good.\n\n418\n00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:21.950\nAll right.\n\n419\n00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.342\nAll right.\n\n420\n00:21:23.342 --> 00:21:25.810\nQuestion five.\n\n421\n00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.379\nAgain, blue, green, and red.\n\n422\n00:21:27.379 --> 00:21:29.160\nWhat's the big ask here?\n\n423\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.385\nIn this case, you need to recommend which\nIT stakeholder should be added to verify\n\n424\n00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:35.723\nand sign off each test\nmodel in the scenario.\n\n425\n00:21:35.723 --> 00:21:36.621\nWell first of all,\n\n426\n00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:40.004\nwe're gonna be looking at very\nspecific stakeholders in this volume.\n\n427\n00:21:40.004 --> 00:21:42.538\nWe see them later,\nwhich one of these stakeholders,\n\n428\n00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:44.519\nwhich ones of them are involved, right?\n\n429\n00:21:44.519 --> 00:21:49.600\nWe get some very scant\nbusiness context here.\n\n430\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.595\nA global publishing company is working\nwith an external supplier to deliver a new\n\n431\n00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:57.984\nand innovative online download service,\nall right?\n\n432\n00:21:57.984 --> 00:21:59.320\nCongratulations, business.\n\n433\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.204\nThe green bits again referring to what\nthe service provider's context is,\n\n434\n00:22:03.204 --> 00:22:06.190\nwhat's their current capabilities or\nconstraints are.\n\n435\n00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.216\nAnd then the red, the specific ask.\n\n436\n00:22:08.216 --> 00:22:11.704\nIn this case, you need to improve\nIT stakeholder involvement, and\n\n437\n00:22:11.704 --> 00:22:15.268\ntesting at the right points through\nthe service life cycle, right?\n\n438\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.406\nWe have service level requirements,\nwe have deployment and service operations.\n\n439\n00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:26.356\nWe have some acronyms being used, those\nacronyms are gonna be brought forth in\n\n440\n00:22:26.356 --> 00:22:31.340\nthe answer questions too, so\nwe gotta connect the dots there, right?\n\n441\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:35.218\nSo these are the particular test\nmodels being in place, service level\n\n442\n00:22:35.218 --> 00:22:40.552\nrequirements, deployment requirements, and\nservice operation requirements, all right?\n\n443\n00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:44.070\nThose test models are being in place.\n\n444\n00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.770\nSo how does this play out in your,\nwith the specific ask?\n\n445\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.770\nYou are the service\nvalidation test manager, and\n\n446\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.057\nyou need to recommend which IT\nstakeholder should be added to verify and\n\n447\n00:22:54.057 --> 00:22:57.400\nsign off each test model in the scenario.\n\n448\n00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.125\nSo really what this boils down to is\ndo you need the deployment manager\n\n449\n00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:03.842\ninvolved at this stage?\n\n450\n00:23:03.842 --> 00:23:05.890\nDo you need them involved in that stage?\n\n451\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.886\nDo you need the service level\nrequirements, SLM, to sign off in this\n\n452\n00:23:10.886 --> 00:23:15.610\npart of the validation, or\nlater on in the validation, right?\n\n453\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.658\nWhere do different people get involved\nin different stages of testing and\n\n454\n00:23:19.658 --> 00:23:21.952\nvalidation is really what this is about.\n\n455\n00:23:21.952 --> 00:23:26.938\nSo as you go through the various nuances,\nthis is really getting into the details\n\n456\n00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:31.420\nof who should be in play at what time,\nat what point, right?\n\n457\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:36.413\nHere they're getting the external supplier\ninvolved in the service level requirements\n\n458\n00:23:36.413 --> 00:23:38.750\nand the service operation tests models.\n\n459\n00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.920\nThe external supplier is gonna be\nproviding support after launch.\n\n460\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.243\nThey're gonna do what we've\ntold them to do, so to speak.\n\n461\n00:23:46.243 --> 00:23:50.555\nThey're gonna be involved in support,\nso that's kind of a non-starter.\n\n462\n00:23:50.555 --> 00:23:56.314\nA says add IT supplier management to SLR,\nand again this is after deployment.\n\n463\n00:23:56.314 --> 00:24:00.552\nSo not key, at information security\nmanagement to the service level\n\n464\n00:24:00.552 --> 00:24:03.520\nrequirements and SO test models.\n\n465\n00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.430\nSecurity management is not\ninvolved at this stage.\n\n466\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.190\nThey don't need to be there for\n\n467\n00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.360\nthe operational models that are in\nthat particular case, right?\n\n468\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.430\nSo then compare and contrast,\nso what do they have in common?\n\n469\n00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.530\nB looks like it's pretty close to C,\nit's starting off.\n\n470\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:27.970\nAdd the IT supplier management to\nthe SLR and deployment test models.\n\n471\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.310\nSo the first bot is identical in B and C.\n\n472\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.660\nAre they in contention?\n\n473\n00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.380\nThey could be later on in contention.\n\n474\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.270\nThe second bot, add the deployment manager\nto the SLR and deployment test models.\n\n475\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.450\nHere they're adding information security\nmanagement to the deployment and\n\n476\n00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:48.279\nservice operations test models\ninstead of the deployment manager.\n\n477\n00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:52.780\nAgain, the security manager\nneeds to be there for\n\n478\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:56.210\nthe deployment and\nservice level requirements pieces.\n\n479\n00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.130\nSo that´s where those\ndistinguish themselves.\n\n480\n00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.050\nSo again compare and contrast.\n\n481\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.029\nA great opportunity in this particular\nquestion to go through the answer´s\n\n482\n00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:07.646\nrational to pick up on the various\nstages of testing and validation.\n\n483\n00:25:07.646 --> 00:25:09.880\nAnd which role should be\ninvolved at what time.\n\n484\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.080\nSo it´s good learning opportunity as well\nas a good enforcement opportunity, okay.\n\n485\n00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.176\nAgain, fairly straight forward.\n\n486\n00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:17.484\n&gt;&gt; And we're doing well on time.\n\n487\n00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:19.820\nWe've got question five,\nwe can go on to question six.\n\n488\n00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.466\nWe have sometime.\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n489\n00:25:20.466 --> 00:25:21.197\nLet's do it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:21.197 --> 00:25:23.820\n&gt;&gt; Yep, finding some rhythm here.\n\n491\n00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.470\nNow this one has a lot of red.\n\n492\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.630\nLots of things being asked here,\nin this particular case.\n\n493\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.090\nYou are the head of enterprise\nservice desk and are responsible for\n\n494\n00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.750\nthe development of a plan\nto resolve these issues.\n\n495\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.250\nWe need to find the issues,\nright as we're reading it.\n\n496\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.670\nSo the question is giving us the context.\n\n497\n00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:44.510\nYou are the head of the Enterprise Service\nDesk, and we need to resolve these issues.\n\n498\n00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.320\nI put those in quotes.\n\n499\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.710\nSo what are these issues, right?\n\n500\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.560\nAnd then what's the most\neffective approach?\n\n501\n00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.805\nAll right, so we can compare and contrast\napproaches to resolving these issues.\n\n502\n00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:57.425\nAnd the issues are a large number of\ncomplaints have been received about\n\n503\n00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:58.518\nthe effectiveness.\n\n504\n00:25:58.518 --> 00:26:01.710\nAnd efficiency of the Enterprise\nService Desk in responding to and\n\n505\n00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.330\nresolving incidents and problems.\n\n506\n00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.920\nThe root cause has been\nidentified as a lack of\n\n507\n00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.407\nenterprise-wide configuration\nmanagement data source.\n\n508\n00:26:10.407 --> 00:26:14.950\nSo they're already giving you the hint\nof what needs to be fixed, right?\n\n509\n00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.030\nThere's a problem.\n\n510\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.130\nIncidents and\nproblems aren't resolved very quickly.\n\n511\n00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.452\nThe source of that problem is a lack\nof enterprise-wide configuration\n\n512\n00:26:22.452 --> 00:26:23.611\nmanagement data.\n\n513\n00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:25.960\nAnd then they talk about that.\n\n514\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.300\nIn the green bits, they talk about how\neach of the different locations has their\n\n515\n00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.650\nown little separate configuration\nmanagement system if you will,\n\n516\n00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.580\ncould be a spreadsheet for that matter.\n\n517\n00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.920\nThey all have their\ndifferent data sources.\n\n518\n00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.000\nThat's a problem.\n\n519\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.320\nIt also counters the Itel recommendation\n\n520\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.500\nthat you should have at enterprise wide\nCMDB, configuration management database.\n\n521\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.690\nThat is an aspiration you\nshould strive for right?\n\n522\n00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.290\nSo you don't wanna throw\nthe baby out with the bath water.\n\n523\n00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.960\nYou could have some good data out here\nright, so you don't wanna throw it away.\n\n524\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.061\nBut how can you consolidate that data\nto make sure it's effective for all?\n\n525\n00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:01.809\nYou've consolidated the service desk, but\n\n526\n00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:04.130\nyou haven't consolidated\nyour data sources.\n\n527\n00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.770\nWhat this comes down to, right?\n\n528\n00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:09.330\nAnd it says that specifically\nthe configuration information was not\n\n529\n00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:13.310\nconsolidated when the enterprise\nservice desk was created.\n\n530\n00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.270\nThere's no enterprise wide\nconfiguration management system.\n\n531\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:20.131\nThey're just reinforcing this idea that's\ncounter to the best practice that I\n\n532\n00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:22.680\ntoo would recommend a consolidated CMS.\n\n533\n00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.880\nOne CMS, enterprise y.\n\n534\n00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.640\nSo that's the issue,\nyou got the spirit data sources and\n\n535\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.330\nyour job is the SD function.\n\n536\n00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.980\nYou want to resolve this issue and\ncome up with a plan for it, interesting.\n\n537\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:42.164\nShould the service desk be the owner\nof the configuration management system?\n\n538\n00:27:42.164 --> 00:27:45.102\nWhat would I tell, say about that, right?\n\n539\n00:27:45.102 --> 00:27:47.353\nSo let's see how this plays out, okay.\n\n540\n00:27:47.353 --> 00:27:48.660\nInteresting question is playing out here.\n\n541\n00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:54.280\nSo your head of the service desk and you\nhave disparate data all over the place.\n\n542\n00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.000\nThe first one says, you decide to\nbuild enterprise wide comparative\n\n543\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.090\nmanagement database to\nresolve the current issues.\n\n544\n00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:05.160\nThat's not a terrible decisions,\nthat's why it's in brown here.\n\n545\n00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.420\nBut again shouldn't you\nget this in data first?\n\n546\n00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.040\nAgain, that's jumping to the action\nbefore you look before you leap.\n\n547\n00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.570\nIt's probably where you're gonna go, but\n\n548\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.170\nthat can't be the right\nsequence of events.\n\n549\n00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.105\nProbably not starting there.\n\n550\n00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:23.220\nSo it's a little bit suspect again, not\nwrong, but not necessarily first, right.\n\n551\n00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.620\nIf you look at B and how it starts off.\n\n552\n00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.510\nYou start by constructing\na logical configuration model.\n\n553\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.858\nIf I wanted to have this what\nwould it look like, right.\n\n554\n00:28:30.858 --> 00:28:33.880\nAnd once you've got the data model figured\nmaybe you can start just importing some of\n\n555\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.510\nthe data from these.\n\n556\n00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.750\nYou don't have to go out and\nbuild a whole new one, right.\n\n557\n00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:42.116\nSo answer B is at least\nallowing the promise of using\n\n558\n00:28:42.116 --> 00:28:44.866\nexisting data to be fulfilled.\n\n559\n00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:45.994\nYou gotta have the data.\n\n560\n00:28:45.994 --> 00:28:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Gotta have the data.\n\n561\n00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n562\n00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.820\nSo again, compare and\ncontrast as we're going through here.\n\n563\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.440\nLet's look at the bad one over\nhere on the right, the D.\n\n564\n00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.700\nYou decide to preserve the current\nconfiguration management environment and\n\n565\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.340\nadd a knowledge management\nsystem on top of it.\n\n566\n00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.380\nIn other words you're gonna\nhave disparate data sources.\n\n567\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.140\nAnd you wanna add to that a knowledge\nmanagement system that somehow is\n\n568\n00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.320\ngathering all this data from everywhere.\n\n569\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.710\nNot necessarily the most\nefficient approach, right?\n\n570\n00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:17.002\nYou implement the SKMS so\nnow we've just gone a different way.\n\n571\n00:29:17.002 --> 00:29:21.783\nWe're not going to a model of unified data\nsources, manageable data sources we're\n\n572\n00:29:21.783 --> 00:29:25.030\ngoing to a presentation layer\nof knowledge management.\n\n573\n00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.329\nProbably not a good idea either, right?\n\n574\n00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:29.968\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n575\n00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.272\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n576\n00:29:31.272 --> 00:29:33.818\nSo again, looking at the best\nanswer here is an opportunity for\n\n577\n00:29:33.818 --> 00:29:35.460\nyou to pick up some good learning.\n\n578\n00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.160\nDoing the compare and\n\n579\n00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.060\ncontrast, and even recognizing\nthe brown bits is kind of a tough one.\n\n580\n00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.340\nIt's not necessarily wrong but\nis it directly relevant and\n\n581\n00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.230\nis it in the right order?\n\n582\n00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.730\nSo if you look at C it just says\n\n583\n00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:51.170\nyou start by adopting one of\nthe existing data sources.\n\n584\n00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.020\nAt least we're using some existing data,\nright?\n\n585\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.290\nAnd mostly matches what you already have.\n\n586\n00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:57.990\nThat's not a bad start.\n\n587\n00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.215\nThen you convert this data source\nto become enterprise wide CMDB.\n\n588\n00:30:01.215 --> 00:30:03.860\nWell that's then discounting\nall of the rest of the data.\n\n589\n00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.030\nSo you're losing that other good data.\n\n590\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.810\nSo something's gonna have\nto be brought together,\n\n591\n00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:12.700\nsome sort of data model that can bring\nthese disparates data sets together.\n\n592\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.393\nIt lets you preserve good data,\n\n593\n00:30:14.393 --> 00:30:17.281\nit let's you do some\nrationalization of the bad data.\n\n594\n00:30:17.281 --> 00:30:20.470\nAnd it also gives you an opportunity to\nconsolidate, and that's where B is going.\n\n595\n00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.010\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, all right.\n\n596\n00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.397\nWell, we could probably stop here.\n\n597\n00:30:24.397 --> 00:30:25.720\nWhat do you think?\n\n598\n00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.075\n&gt;&gt; Great idea.\n&gt;&gt; It's a good stopping point.\n\n599\n00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:31.310\nYou want to do a little recap of maybe\nwhere we've started and now where we are?\n\n600\n00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Well, we've gone through six of the\neight questions so what's left in part two\n\n601\n00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.890\nwill be question seven and question\neight and then with a follow up on.\n\n602\n00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.460\nWhat are the logistics of the exam,\nhow is it structured,\n\n603\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.540\nwhat should you do next, etc?\n\n604\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.730\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Terry.\n\n605\n00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.380\nSample paper review ITIL release\ncontrol and validation part two,\n\n606\n00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.240\nthis has been part one, and\nyou wanna catch both of those of course.\n\n607\n00:30:53.240 -->

00:00:05.627\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:12.279\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.430\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.271\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with sample paper review, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.850\nthis is part two of\nITIL Release Control and Validation.\n\n8\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.070\nAnd bringing us all the information we\nneed is our very own, Terry Decker.\n\n9\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.450\nTerry, nice to see you again, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.060\n&gt;&gt; Good to be here as always, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.403\nAnd as Zach said, we're gonna be\ndoing the remaining questions that we\n\n12\n00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:38.200\ndidn't cover in the first part\nof the sample paper review.\n\n13\n00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.803\nWe have question seven and eight, and\n\n14\n00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:42.330\na little follow up on some\ngeneral exam tips, will be both.\n\n15\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.468\nNow this question seven,\nas you look at the full screen here,\n\n16\n00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:50.304\nthe sample or question seven is,\nI call it persnickety.\n\n17\n00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:51.840\nIt's persnickety for a couple of reasons.\n\n18\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.534\nOne, parsing the question itself was\na little bit difficult or not rote,\n\n19\n00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:58.742\nnot the same run of the mill stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:02.679\nAgain, parsing the scenario, I'm trying\nto discern what's the business piece,\n\n21\n00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.910\nwhat's the service provider piece,\nand what was the specific ask.\n\n22\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.723\nAnd as I was reading this,\n\n23\n00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:12.970\nI was tempted to call the very first\nfew paragraphs all bad things.\n\n24\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.010\nBut then they fixed it\nwithin the same scenario.\n\n25\n00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.430\nThey talked about how bad things\nwere in the test environment,\n\n26\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.180\nbut they fixed that stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.200\nAnd the rest of the scenario then\npoints to the idea of fulfilling some\n\n28\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.538\nroles within your organization,\nwhich that became the specific ask.\n\n29\n00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:29.490\nAnd of course,\nthe question gave me that hint.\n\n30\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.230\nIt says, which one of the following\nbest matches the correct roles, and\n\n31\n00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.510\nresponsibilities for each person?\n\n32\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.920\nSo the first half of the scenario\nis basically irrelevant.\n\n33\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.430\nIt's not that meaningful to your\nsuccess on the question itself,\n\n34\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.740\nthat happens occasionally.\n\n35\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.700\nSo it's persnickety for that reason.\n\n36\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.376\nThis question is also kind of\npersnickety for another reason in that,\n\n37\n00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:54.821\nit's dealing with what many people\nconsider a subjective area.\n\n38\n00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:57.845\nPicking the right person for\nthe right role.\n\n39\n00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:01.025\nITIL, however, thinks you could\ntake a more objective approach\n\n40\n00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.855\nto personnel decisions, and\nthat's what this one's focusing on.\n\n41\n00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:04.435\nYou're looking for\n\n42\n00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:09.882\ndifferent types of skill sets associated\nwith different types of activities, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.532\nIn this case, they talk about the roles.\n\n44\n00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:17.402\nYou see the roles identified A through D,\na service validation and testing manager,\n\n45\n00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:21.832\na release and deployment manager, a\nrelease packaging and build practitioner,\n\n46\n00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:25.720\nand a build and\ntest environment manager, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.050\nAll right, so we got four roles,\nand we have three people.\n\n48\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.690\nSo we're gonna divide those roles\namongst the three people we have.\n\n49\n00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.310\nNow the three people we have, Caroline,\nshe's been the IT quality and\n\n50\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.110\ntest manager for the last two years.\n\n51\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.430\nNow, I'm already thinking, that if she's\nalready doing something related to\n\n52\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.690\nquality and test manager,\nare any of the roles related to that?\n\n53\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.650\nService validation and\n\n54\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.590\ntesting manager sounds like already a good\nmatch, it's already in the role, right?\n\n55\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.520\nSo sometimes it's kinda just that easy,\nthat's a definite match right away.\n\n56\n00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.948\nNow we're kind of get some nuance here.\n\n57\n00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.345\nEric has been the IT development manager.\n\n58\n00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:07.540\nSo Eric is more of a techno guy,\ntechno geek, if you will.\n\n59\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.490\nHe's in the weeds of developing things.\n\n60\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.840\nIs that a good match particularly for\nsome of these roles?\n\n61\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920\nPackaging and build,\nputting things together, right?\n\n62\n00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.528\nIs he managing the test environments?\n\n63\n00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:20.570\nWell, perhaps Eric could do that.\n\n64\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.622\nAnd then Dermot, who joined\nthe organization last week as a project\n\n65\n00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:27.520\nmanager, not necessarily technical.\n\n66\n00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.797\nNot necessarily steeped,\nhe is also new to the company.\n\n67\n00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:32.760\nHe's in a technical management function.\n\n68\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.410\nSo he´s got some technical skills.\n\n69\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.070\nAnd he has experience building and\ndeploying releases.\n\n70\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.190\nSo he has built and\ndeployed things, all right.\n\n71\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.380\nSo we get the kind of idea here.\n\n72\n00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.970\nLet´s look at how this\nplays out in the questions.\n\n73\n00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.940\nNow again, I'm already kind of looking for\n\n74\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.020\nsomething that matches up Caroline with\nthe testing and validation manager.\n\n75\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.365\nRight, because she's already in that row.\n\n76\n00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:53.670\nDo I see any of those?\n\n77\n00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.725\nWell, I can kind of limit A,\ncuz she's not even put there at all.\n\n78\n00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:03.819\nYeah, she does have the service validation\ntesting manager, she's in there, right?\n\n79\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.770\nOops, she happens to be in there, so\nthat didn't help me out too much, right?\n\n80\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.044\nShe happens to be a validation\ntesting manager in all the scenarios,\n\n81\n00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:15.400\nsince you have additional things to do.\n\n82\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.050\nWell, got to divide these\nthings up a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.670\nSo Caroline,\nthat didn't help me out a lot.\n\n84\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.650\nSo now I'm looking for,\n\n85\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.520\nokay, what about leveraging Eric's\nexperience as we've seen before?\n\n86\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.050\nEric has experience,\nhe's been the IT development manager.\n\n87\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.310\nHe's got this techno background.\n\n88\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.810\nWhat tends to be more\ntechnical among these things?\n\n89\n00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.310\nCould he be release package and\nbuild practitioner?\n\n90\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.900\nYeah, just putting the build\nenvironments together.\n\n91\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.840\nRight, that sounds like something\nDermot could do on a regular basis.\n\n92\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.120\nIt then require a high level.\n\n93\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.442\nYou're just following instructions and\nmaking sure these things are set up,\n\n94\n00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:52.104\nright, some.\n\n95\n00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:53.010\nNot necessarily bad, right?\n\n96\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.790\nBut it's matching up.\n\n97\n00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.680\nRelease packaging, and this is\nanother issue, release packaging and\n\n98\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.040\nbuild practitioner, I'm looking at A,\nand then that's the name of the role.\n\n99\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.870\nBut what do they do?\n\n100\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.120\nEnsures that the test\nenvironment is built correctly.\n\n101\n00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.750\nNo, that's not a good match, right?\n\n102\n00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.270\nBuild and test environment manager\nensures that the environment is built\n\n103\n00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.160\ncorrectly, right?\n\n104\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.440\nSame thing with Apple Caroline,\n\n105\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.100\nreleasing deployment manager is not\nprocessing the design and test plans.\n\n106\n00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.820\nSo now there's a mismatch on\nthe definition of the roles.\n\n107\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.620\nIt's not a mismatch to Caroline, Eric, or\nDermot, the roles aren't defined well.\n\n108\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.828\nSo that's what making A pretty suspect is\nnot a direct relationship there, right?\n\n109\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.760\nSo I need to see something where it says,\nthe service validation and\n\n110\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.600\ntesting manager designs and plans tests.\n\n111\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.070\nThat's what they do.\n\n112\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.810\nDoes that show up anywhere?\n\n113\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.880\nAnd it does, it shows up in C and D.\n\n114\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.360\nAgain, looking at the right roles and\nwhat they would actually get done.\n\n115\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.850\nSo not matching to the people themselves,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.333\nSo as you look at C,\nyou'll see service validation\n\n117\n00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:07.186\ntesting manager does design and\nplan tests.\n\n118\n00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:09.134\nLook at D, service validation testing\nmanager does design and plan tests, but\n\n119\n00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.300\nthey don't necessarily build and\ntest the environment.\n\n120\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.330\nRight, they wouldn't necessarily do that,\nto get there in the weeds of things.\n\n121\n00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.130\nSo this is really a role understanding,\n\n122\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.450\nand then matching to the role to\nthe appropriate person, right?\n\n123\n00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.850\nThat's what it points out there,\nin this particular case.\n\n124\n00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.600\nAnd C in this case,\nobviously has the more correct answers.\n\n125\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.450\nSo a good learning opportunity here,\ngo to the rationale, look at those, do\n\n126\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.410\nthe compare and contrast pieces, and find\nthose red herrings as quickly as you can.\n\n127\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.720\nGet rid of the ones and the zeroes,\nand move on to the distinguishing\n\n128\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.640\ncharacteristics between the five and\nthe three, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.050\nFinally, question eight.\n\n130\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.590\nAgain, not much,\nno business context in this one.\n\n131\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.020\nIt's all talking about\nthe service provider, and\n\n132\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.030\nthen a specific deficiency\nbeing identified.\n\n133\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.410\nYou are preparing your presentation\nusing relevant examples.\n\n134\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.540\nWhich one of the following options\ndescribes the most correct application of\n\n135\n00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.400\nservice transition processes and\nactivities,\n\n136\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.360\nthroughout the service life cycle stage,\nokay, stages, all of the stages.\n\n137\n00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.537\nSo you're looking at how\nservice transition fits\n\n138\n00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:17.820\nin with the entire life\ncycle of a service, right?\n\n139\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.061\nSo in this case, some of the IT service\nmanagement staff members are confused as\n\n140\n00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:24.216\nto how service transition processes and\n\n141\n00:07:24.216 --> 00:07:27.670\nactivities are applied through\nthe service life cycle stages.\n\n142\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.280\nLet me put this another way.\n\n143\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.470\nWhile ITIL certainly defined\nthese five core publications,\n\n144\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.770\nbroken them down into five separate\nstages in the life cycle of a service.\n\n145\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.830\nYou'll recall, service strategy, service\ntransition, I'm sorry, service strategy,\n\n146\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.280\nservice design, service transition,\nservice operations and CSI.\n\n147\n00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.050\nOur CV focuses a lot on\nservice transition, right?\n\n148\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.350\nReduce control and validation has a lot\nof those transitional processes in them.\n\n149\n00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.150\nDo they operate in a vacuum?\n\n150\n00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.240\nThey do not.\n\n151\n00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.630\nAnd this is reinforcing the idea that,\nit would be silly for\n\n152\n00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.340\nservices transition practitioners to not\nhave conversations with operations people.\n\n153\n00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.570\nIt would be silly for service transition\nnot have interaction with service\n\n154\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.200\ndesign people, and\nservice strategy people.\n\n155\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.870\nThis is directly focused on this idea\n\n156\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.330\nof integration across the stages\nin a life cycle, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.649\nLet's see how this plays out\non the questions, right?\n\n158\n00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:25.820\nYou're preparing a presentation on how\nthey're supposed to interact, right?\n\n159\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.000\nAgain, I've already kind of done the heavy\nwork for you, cuz I've got them in red and\n\n160\n00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.480\ngreen, and etc.\n\n161\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.270\nSo what's right and what's wrong.\n\n162\n00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.110\nBut, are these appropriate answers?\n\n163\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.230\nAnd let's just look.\n\n164\n00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.830\nService asset configuration management.\n\n165\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.576\nHow does it interact, or how does it\nsupport other stages in a life cycle?\n\n166\n00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:46.230\nIt says SACM will be used at\nthe service strategy stage to\n\n167\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.140\nupdate the service catalog\nwith the new service levels.\n\n168\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.382\nNow this is wrong for a couple reasons.\n\n169\n00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:55.859\nOne, certainly, service asset\nconfiguration management which makes\n\n170\n00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:59.380\nthe CMS, the configuration\nmanagement system come to life.\n\n171\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:03.500\nCertainly, it can be used at\nthe service strategy level, yes.\n\n172\n00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.990\nBut, service strategy doesn't\nupdate the service catalog, and\n\n173\n00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.930\nit doesn't ascertain the service levels,\nthat happens in service design.\n\n174\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.050\nSo this is just really awareness\nat what happens at which stage.\n\n175\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.940\nA is kinda eliminated because\nthere's a mismatch there.\n\n176\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.730\nThe second bullet in A.\n\n177\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.030\nChange management will be used\nat the service design stage\n\n178\n00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.740\nto update the service portfolio.\n\n179\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.470\nAgain, the portfolio is a strategic asset,\nnot a design asset.\n\n180\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.810\nSo another mismatch there.\n\n181\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.240\nAnd then finally, see, the service\nacceptance criteria for the release and\n\n182\n00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.565\ndeployment management process will be\ndesigned at the start of the service\n\n183\n00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:38.090\ntransition stage.\n\n184\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.010\nActually, service acceptance criteria\nis determined in service design.\n\n185\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.100\nNot at the beginning\nof service transition.\n\n186\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.210\nSo in other words,\nyou design what success looks like.\n\n187\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.910\nService acceptance criteria is designed\nin, and then you begin to transition.\n\n188\n00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.980\nAnd of course you're gonna validate\nthat acceptance criteria, and\n\n189\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.050\nservice transition.\n\n190\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.520\nSo A is kind of wrong\non all kinds of points.\n\n191\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:05.070\nIt misaligns the strategic, or the stage's\ndeliverables with the wrong stage, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.540\n&gt;&gt; It's a red herring.\n\n193\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.100\n&gt;&gt; Big time.\n\n194\n00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Very red, that's right.\n\n195\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.990\nAnd then in comparison, let's look\nat one that has some nuance in it.\n\n196\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.259\nLet's take a look at C,\n\n197\n00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.257\nchanged management will be used at\nthe service strategy stage to authorize\n\n198\n00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:22.620\nthe addition of the collection\nservice to the service portfolio.\n\n199\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:23.880\nThat's a true statement.\n\n200\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.280\nChange management approves and\nauthorizes change proposals.\n\n201\n00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.020\nSo for change proposals come from service\nstrategy, change management will be\n\n202\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.650\nprocess that will come in, and authorize\nthat to be added to the portfolio.\n\n203\n00:10:39.425 --> 00:10:44.440\nSACM will be used to service design\nstage to capture the details\n\n204\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.590\nof the collection service in the CMS.\n\n205\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.100\nAbsolutely, that's what SACM does,\nprovides a CMS, and\n\n206\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.200\nmakes sure the appropriate\nthings are added to it.\n\n207\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.950\nAnd as you're designing things,\nyou need to ascertain what we have and\n\n208\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.470\nmake sure it's up to date.\n\n209\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.510\nSo C's looking pretty good.\n\n210\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.870\nIt's aligning the right\ndeliverable with the right stage.\n\n211\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.970\nIn this case,\nthe details of the collection service.\n\n212\n00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.323\nAnd then finally, the bullet C, the final,\nthe service acceptance criteria for\n\n213\n00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:12.482\nthe release and employee management\nprocess will be developed at the service\n\n214\n00:11:12.482 --> 00:11:13.880\ntransition station.\n\n215\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.420\nAgain, service acceptance criteria\nhappens in service design.\n\n216\n00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.270\nThat's what we've learned, so we're just\ntrying to align the right deliverable,\n\n217\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.750\nin this case,\nthe service acceptance criteria.\n\n218\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.730\nThat deliverable does not\nhappen in service transition.\n\n219\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.780\nIt happens in service design,\nanother bad answer.\n\n220\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.262\nSo again, you have to know what it is.\n\n221\n00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:34.380\nAnd this is a pretty\nstraightforward question.\n\n222\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.560\nYou either know it or you don't.\n\n223\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.310\nWhich deliverable happens in which stage?\n\n224\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.110\n&gt;&gt; It's a case of knowing the chicken or\nthe egg, right?\n\n225\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n226\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:41.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n227\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.670\n&gt;&gt; So, a good question,\na great question for review.\n\n228\n00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.030\nIt also gives you an idea of what\nthe test maker might have in mind, and\n\n229\n00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.470\nhow he's gonna test you on your knowledge,\nand be able to apply it.\n\n230\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.440\nSo, we learned about these things in RCV.\n\n231\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.730\nWe learned about all these levels in RCV.\n\n232\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.830\nWe touched on every single one of them.\n\n233\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.860\nBut now, we have to equate\nit to these other stages.\n\n234\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.180\nWhich deliverable happens and which stage,\nis what this question is about.\n\n235\n00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.535\nA very good review question.\n\n236\n00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:09.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's it.\n\n237\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.540\nThat's the eight questions for\nsample paper one.\n\n238\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.470\nI want to remind you that\nthere's other work to do, right?\n\n239\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.430\nIf you haven't already,\nmake sure you take the other sample paper.\n\n240\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.790\nThese sample papers, these practice exams\nare the single most valuable resource you\n\n241\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.770\nhave beyond the lecture\nprovided by ITProTV.\n\n242\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.130\nSo once you get into those sample papers,\nyou're going to either reinforce\n\n243\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.570\nthe learning, take on new learning, or\nget inside the mind of the test maker.\n\n244\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.080\nAll those things are very valuable.\n\n245\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.080\n&gt;&gt; So once again, it's important\nto do the sample paper exam first,\n\n246\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.150\nbefore going through these videos, yeah.\n\n247\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.929\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\nAnd then there's a second sample paper,\n\n248\n00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:48.783\nwithout an episode to review but\n\n249\n00:12:48.783 --> 00:12:52.430\nnow you've got the hang of how\nwe go through this review.\n\n250\n00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.790\nYou can test yourself and\nmore evaluate yourself.\n\n251\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.700\nAre you getting on top of these test,\nor are the tests on top of you?\n\n252\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.270\nAnd when you get to a point that you're on\ntop of these tests, you could be ready.\n\n253\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.470\nSo let's take a look at the graphic here.\n\n254\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.030\nYou'll see that, certainly reach\nout onto the forum, talk to experts\n\n255\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.590\nthere if you want to complain about\na test question, so they complain.\n\n256\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.430\nIf you want to highlight the difficulty\nof a particular question,\n\n257\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.910\nwhere the test maker seem to get\nmaybe a little too subjective and\n\n258\n00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.340\nbrought too much opinion and\nnot fact, that's totally legitimate.\n\n259\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.590\nThese test questions aren't\nnecessarily perfectly designed.\n\n260\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.180\nAnd some of those imperfect one show up on\nthe sample papers instead of on the real\n\n261\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.630\nexam, which that's good for us, right?\n\n262\n00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.370\nBut remember,\n\n263\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.660\nyou could reinforce your learning as\nwell as get new learning there, right?\n\n264\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.542\nAnd when you're all ready to go,\nyou can purchase your exam voucher from\n\n265\n00:13:41.542 --> 00:13:45.130\nPassionIT Group, and\nyou have the ability to then schedule.\n\n266\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.280\nOnce you have the voucher in your hand,\n\n267\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.780\nyou have the ability to schedule\nthat exam at your convenience.\n\n268\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.560\nI wish you luck on the exam, and\nin your future studies for ITIL.\n\n269\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.320\n&gt;&gt; Excellent job, Terry,\nthank you very much.\n\n270\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.130\nSample paper review ITIL Release,\nControl and Validation part two.\n\n271\n00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.170\nThere is part one, watch them both,\nyou should, thank you.\n\n272\n00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.250\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n273\n00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.340\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always
