00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.828\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:12.766\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen.\n\n6\n00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.548\nIf you have ever wondered how\nto become an ITIL master,\n\n7\n00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.880\nwell then this is the show you.\n\n8\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.220\nIn this episode we have ITIL master\nJo Peacock in studios to explain and\n\n10\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.970\nhelp you through this process.\n\n11\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.330\nSo Jo where do we begin?\n\n12\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330\nObviously this is a pretty prestigious\ncertification to be able to obtain,\n\n13\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.820\nso I might be a little nervous or\na little uneasy about this process and\n\n14\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.960\nI'm hoping you can help with that.\n\n15\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.075\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou got every right to be nervous.\n\n16\n00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:44.280\n[LAUGH] I'm a little bit sort of\nreticent about the whole process.\n\n17\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.920\nThe first thing that I\nwant you to ask yourself\n\n18\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920\nIs why do I need to become an ITIL master?\n\n19\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.040\nAnd that's a legitimate question.\n\n20\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.290\nThe ITIL master qualification, as a\nprocess, is approximately two years long.\n\n21\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.105\nOr a maximum of two years long,\ndepending on how you approach this and\n\n22\n00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.455\nso you have to ask yourself,\nit's a PhD equivalent.\n\n23\n00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:09.995\nDo you actually really need to have\nthe ITIL master certification?\n\n24\n00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.415\nIt's not exactly an easy\ncertification to gain and\n\n25\n00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.245\nit's a certification where\nyou have to demonstrate\n\n26\n00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:21.810\nin a real world example that you have\nimplemented all of the elements of ITIL.\n\n27\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380\nAll of them, not just some of them,\n\n28\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700\nall of them in a real world situation,\nso you can't make it up either.\n\n29\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.460\nAnd you have to have\nevidence of this as well.\n\n30\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.370\nSo is it something that\neverybody can achieve?\n\n31\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.360\nIs it something everybody needs\nto achieve or wants to achieve?\n\n32\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.920\nAnd the answer to that is no.\n\n33\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.990\nFor most, the ITIL expert certification\nis the prestige that you need.\n\n34\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.130\nIt's the equivalent of the version\ntwo ITIL service manager.\n\n35\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.240\nAnd in which case,\nthen as a service manager, as an expert,\n\n36\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.570\nthen that is more than sufficient\nto both implement ITIL and\n\n37\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340\nto be able to manage ITIL based\nframeworks in your environment.\n\n38\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.563\nLet's just take a look at\nthe qualifications theme right now.\n\n39\n00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.988\nYou'll see that what we have in our\nqualification scheme is you have in\n\n40\n00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:14.440\nthe red at the top,\nyou have the ITIL expert.\n\n41\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440\nAnd you have the ITIL\nmaster above that and\n\n42\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.070\nright at the very bottom, ITIL Foundation.\n\n43\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.468\nITIL Foundation is something that\nmost organizations how are looking to\n\n44\n00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:28.370\nimplement an ITIL based framework,\nwell they will expect they're employees,\n\n45\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.320\ntheir staff to have achieved\nThe ITIL Foundation certification.\n\n46\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.250\nWhat ITIL Foundation does\nis that ITIL Foundation,\n\n47\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.640\nit will give you an understanding,\na foundation if you want,\n\n48\n00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.960\nbut an understanding\nof the ITIL framework.\n\n49\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.450\nITIL's not plug and play.\n\n50\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.020\nAs a framework,\nit's not a one size fits all approach.\n\n51\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.660\nSo you can't simply take\nit out of the book and\n\n52\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.520\nthen apply it and implement it in your\norganization and expect it to work.\n\n53\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.410\nIf you do that,\n\n54\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.030\nI can tell you now you're going to end up\nwith more chaos than you started off with.\n\n55\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.650\nIt doesn't work like that,\nit's a framework.\n\n56\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.610\nWe'll tell you what\nprocesses you need to have.\n\n57\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.230\nAnd it's up to you, then,\nto take the ITIL framework, and\n\n58\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.120\nto adapt to suit your environment.\n\n59\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.610\nAnd so\nITIL Practitioner will help you do that.\n\n60\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.650\nCuz the ITIL Practitioner course,\n\n61\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.380\nthe ITIL Practitioner show that we\nhave here on ITProTV, well that\n\n62\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.530\nactually works with you to\nidentify areas for improvement.\n\n63\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.250\nTo identify exactly where you can improve,\n\n64\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.562\nwhat you can implement, and\nhow you can adapt ITIL to implement it.\n\n65\n00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:47.980\nITIL Practitioner,\nI look at this diagram and\n\n66\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700\nI don't like this diagram and\nI'll tell you why.\n\n67\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900\nBecause ITIL Practitioner,\nwhen we used to show diagrams before when\n\n68\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.260\nITIL Practitioner first\nwas released in 2016,\n\n69\n00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.000\nITIL Practitioner was always\nshown off to the side.\n\n70\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.760\nSo it was actually showing off sort\nof to this side of the diagram itself\n\n71\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.420\nbecause ITIL practitioner takes all of\nthe knowledge that you previously had and\n\n72\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.020\nthen it then works with\nthat knowledge to help\n\n73\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.310\nyou implement ITIL to help you\nidentify improvement opportunities.\n\n74\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.960\nITIL Practitioner is actually the study,\nthe class,\n\n75\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.530\nthe guide, the show,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n76\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.790\nIt's that element that will\nhelp you implement ITIL.\n\n77\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.810\nITIL Master won't help you implement ITIL.\n\n78\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.930\nITIL Master just demonstrates\nthat you have implemented ITIL.\n\n79\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.485\nIf you actually want to implement an ITIL\nbased framework in the real world,\n\n80\n00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:50.430\nITIL Practitioner is what you need.\n\n81\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.050\n&gt;&gt; So, what I'm gathering Jo, is if I'm\nnot familiar with the ITIL framework and\n\n82\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.860\nthe exact disciplines here,\nthis is not the place for that.\n\n83\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.930\nI already should know that knowledge,\nit's an implied knowledge at this point.\n\n84\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.320\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's not just an implied knowledge,\n\n85\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.200\nbut ITIL expert is based on experience.\n\n86\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.270\nSo you have to have implemented it, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.860\n&gt;&gt; So this is not way around it.\n\n88\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no way around this at\nall, you have to have implemented ITIL.\n\n89\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.203\nThis is not, it's not optional,\nit's not just based on theory.\n\n90\n00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:26.277\nYou cannot read all of the ITIL books and\nabsorb all of the ITIL books and even have\n\n91\n00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:31.600\nread the ITIL practitioner guidance and\nthen think, well that's okay then.\n\n92\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.540\nNow that I'm an ITIL expert,\nI can become an ITIL master.\n\n93\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.890\nBecause that's not how it works,\nit's based on theory.\n\n94\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.400\nAnd it's based on evidence-based theory.\n\n95\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.650\nSo it's not based on theory,\nit's based on evidence.\n\n96\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.447\nIt's based on practical evidence.\n\n97\n00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:48.590\nYou have to have implemented ITIL.\n\n98\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.660\nSo, ITIL Practitioner is probably\nwhat most people are looking for.\n\n99\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.840\nMost people are looking for something to\nhelp them and something that demonstrates\n\n100\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.692\nthat they know how to implement ITIL,\nand that's what ITIL Practitioner does.\n\n101\n00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:09.290\nNow, personally, I like,\nI personally prefer\n\n102\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.775\nindividuals to complete ITIL Practitioner\nafter they've completed what we call our\n\n103\n00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:18.220\nintermediates, which are our life cycle\nmodules and our capability modules.\n\n104\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.250\nAnd you can complete,\nif you want to become an ITIL expert,\n\n105\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.170\nyou can complete either, well,\neither the life cycle modules,\n\n106\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.840\nas you see on the left hand side or\nyou can complete the capability modules.\n\n107\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.590\nAnd the capability modules look more at a,\nnow what I would call a practitioner with\n\n108\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.670\nlower case p, at the practitioner\nside of implementing processes, but\n\n109\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.710\nthey're very much theory-based.\n\n110\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.475\nManaging across the life\ncycle is a course,\n\n111\n00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:50.341\na class that looks at\nthe entire life cycle but\n\n112\n00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:54.841\nfrom a senior management,\nfrom a CIO perspective.\n\n113\n00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:59.405\nBut you see what we've done in all\nof these, in the intermediates,\n\n114\n00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:04.368\nin the MALC as we like to call it,\nmanaging across the life cycle, in all of\n\n115\n00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:09.850\nthose tests and in all of those shows,\nwhat we've looked at is just the theory.\n\n116\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.633\nWe've looked at the theory of ITIL.\n\n117\n00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:15.945\nAnd at no point in time and what we were\nfinding was that we were getting were\n\n118\n00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:19.427\npeople that had achieved\nthe ITIL expert certification and\n\n119\n00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:22.020\nthen after that they'd said, right okay.\n\n120\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.710\nWell this is great.\n\n121\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.640\nI've got all this knowledge and\nall this theory and\n\n122\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.790\nI don't know how to implement it.\n\n123\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.970\nAnd this is where ITIL Practitioner comes\nin cuz ITIL Practitioner says okay,\n\n124\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.390\nlet's work out a starting point then for\nyou.\n\n125\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.764\nLet's work out how you can adapt\nITIL to suit your environment.\n\n126\n00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:39.900\nAnd that's what ITIL Practitioner is for.\n\n127\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.766\nNow, you don't have to take either all of\nthe life cycle and all of the capability.\n\n128\n00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.040\nYou can mix and match,\n\n129\n00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.931\nand, of course, for those of you\nthat are considering ITIL master,\n\n130\n00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:55.763\nyou've already been through this process\nand you've already got yourself to a point\n\n131\n00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:01.390\nwhere you have The prerequisite number of\npoints to be able to achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n132\n00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.900\nYou will achieve ITIL Expert\nautomatically on two conditions.\n\n133\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.362\nThat you have achieved your 22 credits,\nand\n\n134\n00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:15.260\nthat those 22 credits include\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n135\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.889\nSo you have achieve 17 credits\nbefore you get to qualify for\n\n136\n00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.540\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n137\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.141\nAnd then, you can take managing\nacross the life cycle, and then,\n\n138\n00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:26.310\nyou can achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n139\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.096\nNow you can be incredibly sad like me,\nand you do them all, but\n\n140\n00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.534\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.\n\n141\n00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:35.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I figured, well-\n&gt;&gt; What happened, Jo?\n\n142\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.410\nYou just couldn't choose which\none was your favorite, or?\n\n143\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.930\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I didn't get a choice.\n\n144\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.375\n[LAUGH] This is one of the problems\nwhen you've been involved in\n\n145\n00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:48.890\nITIL from the actual authors,\nwhere we wrote ITIL.\n\n146\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.280\nYeah, you don't get any choice in this.\n\n147\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.825\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so all of them.\n\n148\n00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.960\n[LAUGH] But then,\nit's up to you to pick and choose.\n\n149\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.480\nYou need to get to 17, and you have to\nhave completed ITIL Foundation, and\n\n150\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.560\nyou have to have completed\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n151\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.140\nAnd how you make up the 17, well, it's\nreally 15 because two is from foundation.\n\n152\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.050\nYou've gotta make up another 15 before you\ncan take managing across the life cycle.\n\n153\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:23.820\nBut you're ITIL expert tells you\nthat you have achieved the theory.\n\n154\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.930\nThat you understand the ITIL theory.\n\n155\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.150\nAn ITIL practitioner teaches\nyou how to apply that theory.\n\n156\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.810\nITIL Master then tests that\nyou have applied that theory.\n\n157\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.150\nSo what is ITIL Master then?\n\n158\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.080\nIt actually says, right at the very top\nthere, it is an assessment qualification.\n\n159\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.340\nAnd it is, it's gonna take you\nabout six to 24 months duration.\n\n160\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.160\nIt's a thesis style qualification, and\n\n161\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.660\nI'll come more into that\na little bit later.\n\n162\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.180\nIt is experienced based,\nthough isn't a training course.\n\n163\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.984\nThere is a prerequisite, and\nthe prerequisite is that you\n\n164\n00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:04.398\nare an ITIL Expert,\nthat's most definitely a prerequisite.\n\n165\n00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:10.097\nAnd that you have to have had a minimum\nof five years in IT management or\n\n166\n00:10:10.097 --> 00:10:13.553\nIT leadership, a minimum of five years.\n\n167\n00:10:13.553 --> 00:10:20.302\nSo you have to be an IT Master,\nso you have to be an IT manager.\n\n168\n00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:26.340\nAnd you have to have demonstrated, and by\nthe way, we need your resume or your CV.\n\n169\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.100\nYou have to have demonstrated that you\nhave been in an IT management position for\n\n170\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.560\nat least five years.\n\n171\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.320\nWe're also gonna ask for\nreferences, as well.\n\n172\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.702\nJust a word of warning here.\n\n173\n00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:41.414\nAs it says here, and this in in quotes,\n\n174\n00:10:41.414 --> 00:10:45.270\nthis is directly from\nthe ITIL Master guidelines.\n\n175\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.610\nAnd it just simply says,\nto achieve ITIL Master,\n\n176\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.460\nyou've got to be able to explain and\nto justify how you have applied\n\n177\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.910\nyour knowledge, and\nyour principles, and your methods.\n\n178\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.619\nYour ITIL knowledge, and\nyour principles, and\n\n179\n00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:01.140\nyour methods to achieve business outcomes.\n\n180\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.832\nAnd it says in one or\nmore practical assignments,\n\n181\n00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:06.000\ntrust me it's a lot more than one.\n\n182\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.210\nAnd it's gonna be between ten and\n\n183\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.190\n20 different assignments that you're going\nto be asked to do, between ten and 20.\n\n184\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.730\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that.\n\n185\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.270\nProbably, in our next episode,\n\n186\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.900\nwhen we just get a little bit\nmore into the meat of this.\n\n187\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.440\nBut it's a thesis style qualification, and\n\n188\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.780\nyou will be expected to\ncompile assignments.\n\n189\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.610\nI've already said between ten or\n\n190\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.660\n20 different assignments\nthat you have to compile,\n\n191\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.110\nthat you have to submit in exactly\nthe same way as if you were at university.\n\n192\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.500\nYou would have to submit and\nthey would be assessed.\n\n193\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.880\nThey would be marked by\ntwo individual assessors.\n\n194\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.250\nSo there's no bias there,\n\n195\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.230\nyou can't claim that there's any sort of,\nyou can't claim that this.\n\n196\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.690\n&gt;&gt; They just didn't like me Jo, and\nthat's why I didn't get my certification.\n\n197\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But having an additional individual\n\n198\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.060\nwill help even the playing field.\n\n199\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.945\n&gt;&gt; There are two assessors, yes.\n\n200\n00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.834\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to how it used to be\n\n201\n00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:05.945\nwithin ITIL version two.\n\n202\n00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:09.760\nYour exams were always\nassessed by two examiners.\n\n203\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.290\nIn this case, then yes,\nyou have two examiners or\n\n204\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.700\nassessors that will assess\neach of your papers.\n\n205\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.570\nSo as I said, there's no claim of yeah,\nthe examiner just didn't like me.\n\n206\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.575\nAnd that's the reason why I didn't pass.\n\n207\n00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.030\nBecause, and it's not just that,\n\n208\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.273\nyou're gonna get an interview afterwards,\nas well.\n\n209\n00:12:27.273 --> 00:12:31.670\nSo we're gonna ask for references,\nwe're going to interview you.\n\n210\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.086\nWe are going to assess your submissions.\n\n211\n00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:39.880\nIt's not a short process like we say,\nit says between six to 24 months.\n\n212\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.490\nI have never known anybody that has\ncompleted it in less than 18 months,\n\n213\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.130\nnever.\n\n214\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.230\nThere's a lot of work to be done.\n\n215\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.238\nAnd I have actually had people that I've\ncoached through ITIL Master in the past,\n\n216\n00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.122\nwhere they've come to me and said.\n\n217\n00:12:54.122 --> 00:12:58.900\nWell, you know what, we implemented an\nITIL based framework in our organization.\n\n218\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.400\nSo I've decided to write a book about it,\nand what I'm going to do is I'm gonna\n\n219\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.944\nsubmit that book as my proposal for\nmy ITIL Master.\n\n220\n00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.759\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I had to turn around to them and\n\n221\n00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:14.630\nsay, well, there's nothing\nwrong with you writing a book.\n\n222\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.288\nBut that book is not going to be\nsufficient for a submission for\n\n223\n00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:20.370\nITIL master.\n\n224\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.009\nSo what I'm saying to somebody\nthat because it is not going to\n\n225\n00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:25.390\nbe sufficient for\nsubmissions to ITIL Master.\n\n226\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.602\nIt tells you the level of the depth\nof knowledge that's required, and\n\n227\n00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:35.830\nthe depth of knowledge that I will\nexpect to see in these submissions.\n\n228\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:43.670\nSo, the mandatory stages, mandatory,\nthese aren't any choice at all.\n\n229\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:48.150\nIs that you have to register with an\nexamination institute, like People Cert,\n\n230\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.850\nfor instance.\n\n231\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.123\nWe have a partnership with People Cert.\n\n232\n00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:55.640\nYou register and you apply.\n\n233\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.706\nThen you prepare a proposal, and the\nproposal will talk of [INAUDIBLE] probably\n\n234\n00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:03.789\nin our next episode, we're gonna talk\nthrough the application process etc.\n\n235\n00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:08.616\nBut you will prepare a proposal,\nand that proposal will state these\n\n236\n00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:13.880\nare what assignments I'm going to do,\nthis is what I'm going to submit.\n\n237\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.894\nAnd then, the examining institute\nwill write back to you and say, yes,\n\n238\n00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:20.618\nthat's okay, they're valid.\n\n239\n00:14:20.618 --> 00:14:25.480\nOr they'll write back to you and say,\nyou haven't demonstrated an even spread.\n\n240\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.880\nYou haven't demonstrated enough\nknowledge across the board within ITIL.\n\n241\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.200\nYou've concentrated mainly in\nservice operation, for instance, or\n\n242\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.740\nyou've concentrated mainly at\nthe implementation of service strategy.\n\n243\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.610\nBut you have no mention of continual\nservice improvement of service strategy.\n\n244\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.760\nSo, the examining board, the examining\ninstitute will come back to you and\n\n245\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.620\nsay whether the proposal is good enough or\nnot.\n\n246\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.390\nAnd they will also check your references,\nthey will check your resume.\n\n247\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.320\nSo they will check whether you\ndo actually qualify to sit\n\n248\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.430\nthe ITIL Master certification\nright at the very start.\n\n249\n00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.140\nThat can take about three months,\njust that process in itself,\n\n250\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.410\ndepending on, you've gotta register\nwith the examining institute.\n\n251\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.730\nIt depends on how long it takes you to\ncome up with your proposal, to be honest.\n\n252\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.620\nAnd then what you'll need to do is\nthen you submit your work package, and\n\n253\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.660\nthat you'll have 14 months to do.\n\n254\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.230\nThen your work package is assessed, and\nthat could take another month or so.\n\n255\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.250\nAnd then you are invited for an interview.\n\n256\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.400\nAt your interview,\nyou will be tested on your experience.\n\n257\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.930\nYou'll be questioned on your resume and\nyour CV.\n\n258\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.080\nYou'll be questioned in great\ndetail on the work package itself.\n\n259\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.730\nAnd that's gonna be around about an hour\nand a half to two hours of interview.\n\n260\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.792\nYou will get opportunity to ask questions,\nas well.\n\n261\n00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:57.725\nIt is just a regular interview, but\nnevertheless, you will be interviewed.\n\n262\n00:15:57.725 --> 00:16:03.403\nAnd at that point in time That is when you\nfinished your ITIL master and that's when\n\n263\n00:16:03.403 --> 00:16:09.390\nthey will make a decision to whether you\ncan be awarded your ITIL master or not.\n\n264\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.979\nSo this is not, as I say, an insignificant\namount of work that's got to be done here.\n\n265\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.130\nJust in order to submit the work package,\n\n266\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.977\nyou've got to have registered with the\nexamining is institute and paid the fee.\n\n267\n00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:26.919\nNow obviously, I know that Cherokee\nis sort of hung up money here.\n\n268\n00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm just frugal Jo.\n\n269\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:35.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't have an exact answer to\nthat cuz that depends on any agreements\n\n270\n00:16:35.365 --> 00:16:42.130\nand any contracts that you might have\nwith the examining institute yourself.\n\n271\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.270\nYou've got to have completed\nyour application in full.\n\n272\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.700\nAnd that means you have to have\nsubmitted your resume or your CV.\n\n273\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.590\nIt means that you also have to submit\nevidence of references as well.\n\n274\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.370\nSo whatever is in your work proposal,\nyour work package.\n\n275\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.700\nYou have to have evidence that\nyou have actually completed them.\n\n276\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.692\nSo it's not enough to say,\nI implemented an incident management.\n\n277\n00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:14.410\nI just knocked my microphone there,\nI hope everyone can hear me okay.\n\n278\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.620\n[LAUGH] It's not enough for\nyou to say that I have just completed and\n\n279\n00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:25.375\nimplemented an incident\nmanagement based process.\n\n280\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.040\nNo, you can't do that.\n\n281\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.303\nYou've got to provide evidence of\nthe incident management based process,\n\n282\n00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:34.080\nthe ITIL based process.\n\n283\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.500\nYou've also got to provide a reference\nto support the fact that yes indeed,\n\n284\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.879\nit was in fact your work.\n\n285\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.600\nAnd you've also got to provide evidence\nthat you didn't just implement it,\n\n286\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.200\nthat obviously that it ran successfully.\n\n287\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.470\nAnd you've got to provide evidence\nof how you implemented it and\n\n288\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.827\nthen how it was subjected to-\n&gt;&gt; Measured success.\n\n289\n00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:54.529\n&gt;&gt; Continuous self improvement and\nmeasure success, etc.\n\n290\n00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:55.176\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n291\n00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n292\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.490\nSo, all of that got to be submitted.\n\n293\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.030\nAnd then, you received notification\nfrom the examining institute\n\n294\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.300\nthat your application has been accepted.\n\n295\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.605\nThat doesn't mean that they like\nyour proposal at that point in time,\n\n296\n00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:12.905\nwhat that means is, okay,\nyes your references have checked out okay,\n\n297\n00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:14.293\nthat your resume looks okay.\n\n298\n00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:19.531\nAnd you do meet the minimum\nnumber of year within service\n\n299\n00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:24.470\nmanagement leadership in\nthat type of role, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.510\nAnd then and it's only then that's\nwhen you submit your proposal and\n\n301\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.790\nyour proposal is very simply this is\nthe work that I'm going to do it.\n\n302\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.520\nSo this is what I'm gonna\ngive you is this okay.\n\n303\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.910\nAnd then after you've done that,\nand that can take another month or\n\n304\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.350\nso to go through because you\ngotta write this thing first.\n\n305\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.470\nYou've got to decide and we'll talk\na little bit more about your proposal and\n\n306\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.590\nyour work package.\n\n307\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.810\nBut you have got to decide then\nexactly what's going to appear\n\n308\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.560\nin your work package.\n\n309\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.970\nAnd what the weighting is, etc.\n\n310\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.940\nAnd we'll talk about weighting cuz\ndifferent elements carry a higher weight,\n\n311\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.900\nwhich is why it's between ten and\n\n312\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.270\n20 different assignments\nthat you have to submit.\n\n313\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.610\nAnd it's only after you receive\nconfirmation from the examining institute.\n\n314\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.597\nThat you then start to\nwork on your work package.\n\n315\n00:19:17.597 --> 00:19:22.930\nThere is no point in starting to work\non your work package before then.\n\n316\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.098\nBecause they could simply turn around and\nsaying, no that's no sufficient enough.\n\n317\n00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.008\n&gt;&gt; You're not able to apply\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit like the person turning\n\n318\n00:19:29.008 --> 00:19:33.700\naround to me and said, I want to write\na book about how we implemented ITIL.\n\n319\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.900\nAnd I turn around and say, yes but then\nthat doesn't meet all of your criteria.\n\n320\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.730\nAnd here's all of your criteria and\nhere's all of the weighting and\n\n321\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.390\nif you write a book and these are the\nchapters that you intend in your book,\n\n322\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.610\nit's still not enough to qualify for\nITIL master.\n\n323\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.150\nSo ITIL master is quite a chunk.\n\n324\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.003\nSo what we're going to do is,\n\n325\n00:19:54.003 --> 00:19:57.647\nwe're going to leave this\nparticular episode right now.\n\n326\n00:19:57.647 --> 00:20:02.593\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nI'm going to go into great detail about\n\n327\n00:20:02.593 --> 00:20:08.040\nthe actual proposal itself and the work\npackage what you're expected to submit.\n\n328\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.108\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you for that intro Jo.\n\n329\n00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:12.790\nAnd ladies and gentlemen stay tuned\nbecause we wanna go through that process\n\n330\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.963\nand make sure we have everything\nwe need to become an ITIL master.\n\n331\n00:20:15.963 --> 00:20:19.146\nFor the show to sign up,\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n332\n00:20:19.146 --> 00:20:20.107\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n333\n00:20:20.107 --> 00:20:22.033\nSee you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n334\n00:20:22.033 -->
