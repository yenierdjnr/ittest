00:00:08.229\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.828\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:12.766\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentlemen.\n\n6\n00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.548\nIf you have ever wondered how\nto become an ITIL master,\n\n7\n00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.880\nwell then this is the show you.\n\n8\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.220\nIn this episode we have ITIL master\nJo Peacock in studios to explain and\n\n10\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.970\nhelp you through this process.\n\n11\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.330\nSo Jo where do we begin?\n\n12\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.330\nObviously this is a pretty prestigious\ncertification to be able to obtain,\n\n13\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.820\nso I might be a little nervous or\na little uneasy about this process and\n\n14\n00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.960\nI'm hoping you can help with that.\n\n15\n00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.075\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou got every right to be nervous.\n\n16\n00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:44.280\n[LAUGH] I'm a little bit sort of\nreticent about the whole process.\n\n17\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.920\nThe first thing that I\nwant you to ask yourself\n\n18\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920\nIs why do I need to become an ITIL master?\n\n19\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.040\nAnd that's a legitimate question.\n\n20\n00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.290\nThe ITIL master qualification, as a\nprocess, is approximately two years long.\n\n21\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.105\nOr a maximum of two years long,\ndepending on how you approach this and\n\n22\n00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.455\nso you have to ask yourself,\nit's a PhD equivalent.\n\n23\n00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:09.995\nDo you actually really need to have\nthe ITIL master certification?\n\n24\n00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.415\nIt's not exactly an easy\ncertification to gain and\n\n25\n00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:16.245\nit's a certification where\nyou have to demonstrate\n\n26\n00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:21.810\nin a real world example that you have\nimplemented all of the elements of ITIL.\n\n27\n00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380\nAll of them, not just some of them,\n\n28\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700\nall of them in a real world situation,\nso you can't make it up either.\n\n29\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.460\nAnd you have to have\nevidence of this as well.\n\n30\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.370\nSo is it something that\neverybody can achieve?\n\n31\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.360\nIs it something everybody needs\nto achieve or wants to achieve?\n\n32\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.920\nAnd the answer to that is no.\n\n33\n00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.990\nFor most, the ITIL expert certification\nis the prestige that you need.\n\n34\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.130\nIt's the equivalent of the version\ntwo ITIL service manager.\n\n35\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.240\nAnd in which case,\nthen as a service manager, as an expert,\n\n36\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.570\nthen that is more than sufficient\nto both implement ITIL and\n\n37\n00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340\nto be able to manage ITIL based\nframeworks in your environment.\n\n38\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.563\nLet's just take a look at\nthe qualifications theme right now.\n\n39\n00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.988\nYou'll see that what we have in our\nqualification scheme is you have in\n\n40\n00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:14.440\nthe red at the top,\nyou have the ITIL expert.\n\n41\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440\nAnd you have the ITIL\nmaster above that and\n\n42\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.070\nright at the very bottom, ITIL Foundation.\n\n43\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.468\nITIL Foundation is something that\nmost organizations how are looking to\n\n44\n00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:28.370\nimplement an ITIL based framework,\nwell they will expect they're employees,\n\n45\n00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.320\ntheir staff to have achieved\nThe ITIL Foundation certification.\n\n46\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.250\nWhat ITIL Foundation does\nis that ITIL Foundation,\n\n47\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.640\nit will give you an understanding,\na foundation if you want,\n\n48\n00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.960\nbut an understanding\nof the ITIL framework.\n\n49\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.450\nITIL's not plug and play.\n\n50\n00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.020\nAs a framework,\nit's not a one size fits all approach.\n\n51\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.660\nSo you can't simply take\nit out of the book and\n\n52\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.520\nthen apply it and implement it in your\norganization and expect it to work.\n\n53\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.410\nIf you do that,\n\n54\n00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.030\nI can tell you now you're going to end up\nwith more chaos than you started off with.\n\n55\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.650\nIt doesn't work like that,\nit's a framework.\n\n56\n00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.610\nWe'll tell you what\nprocesses you need to have.\n\n57\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.230\nAnd it's up to you, then,\nto take the ITIL framework, and\n\n58\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.120\nto adapt to suit your environment.\n\n59\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.610\nAnd so\nITIL Practitioner will help you do that.\n\n60\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.650\nCuz the ITIL Practitioner course,\n\n61\n00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.380\nthe ITIL Practitioner show that we\nhave here on ITProTV, well that\n\n62\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.530\nactually works with you to\nidentify areas for improvement.\n\n63\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.250\nTo identify exactly where you can improve,\n\n64\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.562\nwhat you can implement, and\nhow you can adapt ITIL to implement it.\n\n65\n00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:47.980\nITIL Practitioner,\nI look at this diagram and\n\n66\n00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700\nI don't like this diagram and\nI'll tell you why.\n\n67\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900\nBecause ITIL Practitioner,\nwhen we used to show diagrams before when\n\n68\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.260\nITIL Practitioner first\nwas released in 2016,\n\n69\n00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.000\nITIL Practitioner was always\nshown off to the side.\n\n70\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.760\nSo it was actually showing off sort\nof to this side of the diagram itself\n\n71\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.420\nbecause ITIL practitioner takes all of\nthe knowledge that you previously had and\n\n72\n00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.020\nthen it then works with\nthat knowledge to help\n\n73\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.310\nyou implement ITIL to help you\nidentify improvement opportunities.\n\n74\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.960\nITIL Practitioner is actually the study,\nthe class,\n\n75\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.530\nthe guide, the show,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n76\n00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.790\nIt's that element that will\nhelp you implement ITIL.\n\n77\n00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.810\nITIL Master won't help you implement ITIL.\n\n78\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.930\nITIL Master just demonstrates\nthat you have implemented ITIL.\n\n79\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.485\nIf you actually want to implement an ITIL\nbased framework in the real world,\n\n80\n00:04:47.485 --> 00:04:50.430\nITIL Practitioner is what you need.\n\n81\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.050\n&gt;&gt; So, what I'm gathering Jo, is if I'm\nnot familiar with the ITIL framework and\n\n82\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.860\nthe exact disciplines here,\nthis is not the place for that.\n\n83\n00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.930\nI already should know that knowledge,\nit's an implied knowledge at this point.\n\n84\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.320\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nit's not just an implied knowledge,\n\n85\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.200\nbut ITIL expert is based on experience.\n\n86\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.270\nSo you have to have implemented it, okay?\n\n87\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.860\n&gt;&gt; So this is not way around it.\n\n88\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no way around this at\nall, you have to have implemented ITIL.\n\n89\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.203\nThis is not, it's not optional,\nit's not just based on theory.\n\n90\n00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:26.277\nYou cannot read all of the ITIL books and\nabsorb all of the ITIL books and even have\n\n91\n00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:31.600\nread the ITIL practitioner guidance and\nthen think, well that's okay then.\n\n92\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.540\nNow that I'm an ITIL expert,\nI can become an ITIL master.\n\n93\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.890\nBecause that's not how it works,\nit's based on theory.\n\n94\n00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.400\nAnd it's based on evidence-based theory.\n\n95\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.650\nSo it's not based on theory,\nit's based on evidence.\n\n96\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.447\nIt's based on practical evidence.\n\n97\n00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:48.590\nYou have to have implemented ITIL.\n\n98\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.660\nSo, ITIL Practitioner is probably\nwhat most people are looking for.\n\n99\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.840\nMost people are looking for something to\nhelp them and something that demonstrates\n\n100\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.692\nthat they know how to implement ITIL,\nand that's what ITIL Practitioner does.\n\n101\n00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:09.290\nNow, personally, I like,\nI personally prefer\n\n102\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.775\nindividuals to complete ITIL Practitioner\nafter they've completed what we call our\n\n103\n00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:18.220\nintermediates, which are our life cycle\nmodules and our capability modules.\n\n104\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.250\nAnd you can complete,\nif you want to become an ITIL expert,\n\n105\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.170\nyou can complete either, well,\neither the life cycle modules,\n\n106\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.840\nas you see on the left hand side or\nyou can complete the capability modules.\n\n107\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.590\nAnd the capability modules look more at a,\nnow what I would call a practitioner with\n\n108\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.670\nlower case p, at the practitioner\nside of implementing processes, but\n\n109\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.710\nthey're very much theory-based.\n\n110\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.475\nManaging across the life\ncycle is a course,\n\n111\n00:06:46.475 --> 00:06:50.341\na class that looks at\nthe entire life cycle but\n\n112\n00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:54.841\nfrom a senior management,\nfrom a CIO perspective.\n\n113\n00:06:54.841 --> 00:06:59.405\nBut you see what we've done in all\nof these, in the intermediates,\n\n114\n00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:04.368\nin the MALC as we like to call it,\nmanaging across the life cycle, in all of\n\n115\n00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:09.850\nthose tests and in all of those shows,\nwhat we've looked at is just the theory.\n\n116\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.633\nWe've looked at the theory of ITIL.\n\n117\n00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:15.945\nAnd at no point in time and what we were\nfinding was that we were getting were\n\n118\n00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:19.427\npeople that had achieved\nthe ITIL expert certification and\n\n119\n00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:22.020\nthen after that they'd said, right okay.\n\n120\n00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.710\nWell this is great.\n\n121\n00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.640\nI've got all this knowledge and\nall this theory and\n\n122\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.790\nI don't know how to implement it.\n\n123\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.970\nAnd this is where ITIL Practitioner comes\nin cuz ITIL Practitioner says okay,\n\n124\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.390\nlet's work out a starting point then for\nyou.\n\n125\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.764\nLet's work out how you can adapt\nITIL to suit your environment.\n\n126\n00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:39.900\nAnd that's what ITIL Practitioner is for.\n\n127\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.766\nNow, you don't have to take either all of\nthe life cycle and all of the capability.\n\n128\n00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.040\nYou can mix and match,\n\n129\n00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.931\nand, of course, for those of you\nthat are considering ITIL master,\n\n130\n00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:55.763\nyou've already been through this process\nand you've already got yourself to a point\n\n131\n00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:01.390\nwhere you have The prerequisite number of\npoints to be able to achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n132\n00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.900\nYou will achieve ITIL Expert\nautomatically on two conditions.\n\n133\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.362\nThat you have achieved your 22 credits,\nand\n\n134\n00:08:10.362 --> 00:08:15.260\nthat those 22 credits include\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n135\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.889\nSo you have achieve 17 credits\nbefore you get to qualify for\n\n136\n00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:22.540\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n137\n00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.141\nAnd then, you can take managing\nacross the life cycle, and then,\n\n138\n00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:26.310\nyou can achieve ITIL Expert.\n\n139\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:31.096\nNow you can be incredibly sad like me,\nand you do them all, but\n\n140\n00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.534\nthen-\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.\n\n141\n00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:35.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I figured, well-\n&gt;&gt; What happened, Jo?\n\n142\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.410\nYou just couldn't choose which\none was your favorite, or?\n\n143\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.930\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I didn't get a choice.\n\n144\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.375\n[LAUGH] This is one of the problems\nwhen you've been involved in\n\n145\n00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:48.890\nITIL from the actual authors,\nwhere we wrote ITIL.\n\n146\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.280\nYeah, you don't get any choice in this.\n\n147\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.825\n[LAUGH] So yeah, so all of them.\n\n148\n00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.960\n[LAUGH] But then,\nit's up to you to pick and choose.\n\n149\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.480\nYou need to get to 17, and you have to\nhave completed ITIL Foundation, and\n\n150\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.560\nyou have to have completed\nmanaging across the life cycle.\n\n151\n00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.140\nAnd how you make up the 17, well, it's\nreally 15 because two is from foundation.\n\n152\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.050\nYou've gotta make up another 15 before you\ncan take managing across the life cycle.\n\n153\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:23.820\nBut you're ITIL expert tells you\nthat you have achieved the theory.\n\n154\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.930\nThat you understand the ITIL theory.\n\n155\n00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.150\nAn ITIL practitioner teaches\nyou how to apply that theory.\n\n156\n00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.810\nITIL Master then tests that\nyou have applied that theory.\n\n157\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.150\nSo what is ITIL Master then?\n\n158\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.080\nIt actually says, right at the very top\nthere, it is an assessment qualification.\n\n159\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.340\nAnd it is, it's gonna take you\nabout six to 24 months duration.\n\n160\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.160\nIt's a thesis style qualification, and\n\n161\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.660\nI'll come more into that\na little bit later.\n\n162\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.180\nIt is experienced based,\nthough isn't a training course.\n\n163\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.984\nThere is a prerequisite, and\nthe prerequisite is that you\n\n164\n00:10:00.984 --> 00:10:04.398\nare an ITIL Expert,\nthat's most definitely a prerequisite.\n\n165\n00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:10.097\nAnd that you have to have had a minimum\nof five years in IT management or\n\n166\n00:10:10.097 --> 00:10:13.553\nIT leadership, a minimum of five years.\n\n167\n00:10:13.553 --> 00:10:20.302\nSo you have to be an IT Master,\nso you have to be an IT manager.\n\n168\n00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:26.340\nAnd you have to have demonstrated, and by\nthe way, we need your resume or your CV.\n\n169\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.100\nYou have to have demonstrated that you\nhave been in an IT management position for\n\n170\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.560\nat least five years.\n\n171\n00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.320\nWe're also gonna ask for\nreferences, as well.\n\n172\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.702\nJust a word of warning here.\n\n173\n00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:41.414\nAs it says here, and this in in quotes,\n\n174\n00:10:41.414 --> 00:10:45.270\nthis is directly from\nthe ITIL Master guidelines.\n\n175\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.610\nAnd it just simply says,\nto achieve ITIL Master,\n\n176\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.460\nyou've got to be able to explain and\nto justify how you have applied\n\n177\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.910\nyour knowledge, and\nyour principles, and your methods.\n\n178\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.619\nYour ITIL knowledge, and\nyour principles, and\n\n179\n00:10:58.619 --> 00:11:01.140\nyour methods to achieve business outcomes.\n\n180\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.832\nAnd it says in one or\nmore practical assignments,\n\n181\n00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:06.000\ntrust me it's a lot more than one.\n\n182\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.210\nAnd it's gonna be between ten and\n\n183\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.190\n20 different assignments that you're going\nto be asked to do, between ten and 20.\n\n184\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.730\nWe'll talk a little bit more about that.\n\n185\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.270\nProbably, in our next episode,\n\n186\n00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.900\nwhen we just get a little bit\nmore into the meat of this.\n\n187\n00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.440\nBut it's a thesis style qualification, and\n\n188\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.780\nyou will be expected to\ncompile assignments.\n\n189\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.610\nI've already said between ten or\n\n190\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.660\n20 different assignments\nthat you have to compile,\n\n191\n00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.110\nthat you have to submit in exactly\nthe same way as if you were at university.\n\n192\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:43.500\nYou would have to submit and\nthey would be assessed.\n\n193\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.880\nThey would be marked by\ntwo individual assessors.\n\n194\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.250\nSo there's no bias there,\n\n195\n00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.230\nyou can't claim that there's any sort of,\nyou can't claim that this.\n\n196\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.690\n&gt;&gt; They just didn't like me Jo, and\nthat's why I didn't get my certification.\n\n197\n00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But having an additional individual\n\n198\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.060\nwill help even the playing field.\n\n199\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.945\n&gt;&gt; There are two assessors, yes.\n\n200\n00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.834\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's very similar to how it used to be\n\n201\n00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:05.945\nwithin ITIL version two.\n\n202\n00:12:05.945 --> 00:12:09.760\nYour exams were always\nassessed by two examiners.\n\n203\n00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.290\nIn this case, then yes,\nyou have two examiners or\n\n204\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.700\nassessors that will assess\neach of your papers.\n\n205\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.570\nSo as I said, there's no claim of yeah,\nthe examiner just didn't like me.\n\n206\n00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.575\nAnd that's the reason why I didn't pass.\n\n207\n00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:25.030\nBecause, and it's not just that,\n\n208\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.273\nyou're gonna get an interview afterwards,\nas well.\n\n209\n00:12:27.273 --> 00:12:31.670\nSo we're gonna ask for references,\nwe're going to interview you.\n\n210\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.086\nWe are going to assess your submissions.\n\n211\n00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:39.880\nIt's not a short process like we say,\nit says between six to 24 months.\n\n212\n00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.490\nI have never known anybody that has\ncompleted it in less than 18 months,\n\n213\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.130\nnever.\n\n214\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.230\nThere's a lot of work to be done.\n\n215\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.238\nAnd I have actually had people that I've\ncoached through ITIL Master in the past,\n\n216\n00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.122\nwhere they've come to me and said.\n\n217\n00:12:54.122 --> 00:12:58.900\nWell, you know what, we implemented an\nITIL based framework in our organization.\n\n218\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.400\nSo I've decided to write a book about it,\nand what I'm going to do is I'm gonna\n\n219\n00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.944\nsubmit that book as my proposal for\nmy ITIL Master.\n\n220\n00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.759\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I had to turn around to them and\n\n221\n00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:14.630\nsay, well, there's nothing\nwrong with you writing a book.\n\n222\n00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.288\nBut that book is not going to be\nsufficient for a submission for\n\n223\n00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:20.370\nITIL master.\n\n224\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.009\nSo what I'm saying to somebody\nthat because it is not going to\n\n225\n00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:25.390\nbe sufficient for\nsubmissions to ITIL Master.\n\n226\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.602\nIt tells you the level of the depth\nof knowledge that's required, and\n\n227\n00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:35.830\nthe depth of knowledge that I will\nexpect to see in these submissions.\n\n228\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:43.670\nSo, the mandatory stages, mandatory,\nthese aren't any choice at all.\n\n229\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:48.150\nIs that you have to register with an\nexamination institute, like People Cert,\n\n230\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.850\nfor instance.\n\n231\n00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.123\nWe have a partnership with People Cert.\n\n232\n00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:55.640\nYou register and you apply.\n\n233\n00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.706\nThen you prepare a proposal, and the\nproposal will talk of [INAUDIBLE] probably\n\n234\n00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:03.789\nin our next episode, we're gonna talk\nthrough the application process etc.\n\n235\n00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:08.616\nBut you will prepare a proposal,\nand that proposal will state these\n\n236\n00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:13.880\nare what assignments I'm going to do,\nthis is what I'm going to submit.\n\n237\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.894\nAnd then, the examining institute\nwill write back to you and say, yes,\n\n238\n00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:20.618\nthat's okay, they're valid.\n\n239\n00:14:20.618 --> 00:14:25.480\nOr they'll write back to you and say,\nyou haven't demonstrated an even spread.\n\n240\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.880\nYou haven't demonstrated enough\nknowledge across the board within ITIL.\n\n241\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.200\nYou've concentrated mainly in\nservice operation, for instance, or\n\n242\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.740\nyou've concentrated mainly at\nthe implementation of service strategy.\n\n243\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.610\nBut you have no mention of continual\nservice improvement of service strategy.\n\n244\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.760\nSo, the examining board, the examining\ninstitute will come back to you and\n\n245\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.620\nsay whether the proposal is good enough or\nnot.\n\n246\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.390\nAnd they will also check your references,\nthey will check your resume.\n\n247\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.320\nSo they will check whether you\ndo actually qualify to sit\n\n248\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.430\nthe ITIL Master certification\nright at the very start.\n\n249\n00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.140\nThat can take about three months,\njust that process in itself,\n\n250\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.410\ndepending on, you've gotta register\nwith the examining institute.\n\n251\n00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.730\nIt depends on how long it takes you to\ncome up with your proposal, to be honest.\n\n252\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.620\nAnd then what you'll need to do is\nthen you submit your work package, and\n\n253\n00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.660\nthat you'll have 14 months to do.\n\n254\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.230\nThen your work package is assessed, and\nthat could take another month or so.\n\n255\n00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.250\nAnd then you are invited for an interview.\n\n256\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:38.400\nAt your interview,\nyou will be tested on your experience.\n\n257\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.930\nYou'll be questioned on your resume and\nyour CV.\n\n258\n00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.080\nYou'll be questioned in great\ndetail on the work package itself.\n\n259\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.730\nAnd that's gonna be around about an hour\nand a half to two hours of interview.\n\n260\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.792\nYou will get opportunity to ask questions,\nas well.\n\n261\n00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:57.725\nIt is just a regular interview, but\nnevertheless, you will be interviewed.\n\n262\n00:15:57.725 --> 00:16:03.403\nAnd at that point in time That is when you\nfinished your ITIL master and that's when\n\n263\n00:16:03.403 --> 00:16:09.390\nthey will make a decision to whether you\ncan be awarded your ITIL master or not.\n\n264\n00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.979\nSo this is not, as I say, an insignificant\namount of work that's got to be done here.\n\n265\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.130\nJust in order to submit the work package,\n\n266\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.977\nyou've got to have registered with the\nexamining is institute and paid the fee.\n\n267\n00:16:21.977 --> 00:16:26.919\nNow obviously, I know that Cherokee\nis sort of hung up money here.\n\n268\n00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm just frugal Jo.\n\n269\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:35.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't have an exact answer to\nthat cuz that depends on any agreements\n\n270\n00:16:35.365 --> 00:16:42.130\nand any contracts that you might have\nwith the examining institute yourself.\n\n271\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.270\nYou've got to have completed\nyour application in full.\n\n272\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.700\nAnd that means you have to have\nsubmitted your resume or your CV.\n\n273\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.590\nIt means that you also have to submit\nevidence of references as well.\n\n274\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.370\nSo whatever is in your work proposal,\nyour work package.\n\n275\n00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.700\nYou have to have evidence that\nyou have actually completed them.\n\n276\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.692\nSo it's not enough to say,\nI implemented an incident management.\n\n277\n00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:14.410\nI just knocked my microphone there,\nI hope everyone can hear me okay.\n\n278\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.620\n[LAUGH] It's not enough for\nyou to say that I have just completed and\n\n279\n00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:25.375\nimplemented an incident\nmanagement based process.\n\n280\n00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.040\nNo, you can't do that.\n\n281\n00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.303\nYou've got to provide evidence of\nthe incident management based process,\n\n282\n00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:34.080\nthe ITIL based process.\n\n283\n00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.500\nYou've also got to provide a reference\nto support the fact that yes indeed,\n\n284\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.879\nit was in fact your work.\n\n285\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.600\nAnd you've also got to provide evidence\nthat you didn't just implement it,\n\n286\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.200\nthat obviously that it ran successfully.\n\n287\n00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.470\nAnd you've got to provide evidence\nof how you implemented it and\n\n288\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.827\nthen how it was subjected to-\n&gt;&gt; Measured success.\n\n289\n00:17:51.827 --> 00:17:54.529\n&gt;&gt; Continuous self improvement and\nmeasure success, etc.\n\n290\n00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:55.176\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n291\n00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n292\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.490\nSo, all of that got to be submitted.\n\n293\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.030\nAnd then, you received notification\nfrom the examining institute\n\n294\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.300\nthat your application has been accepted.\n\n295\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.605\nThat doesn't mean that they like\nyour proposal at that point in time,\n\n296\n00:18:09.605 --> 00:18:12.905\nwhat that means is, okay,\nyes your references have checked out okay,\n\n297\n00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:14.293\nthat your resume looks okay.\n\n298\n00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:19.531\nAnd you do meet the minimum\nnumber of year within service\n\n299\n00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:24.470\nmanagement leadership in\nthat type of role, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:29.510\nAnd then and it's only then that's\nwhen you submit your proposal and\n\n301\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.790\nyour proposal is very simply this is\nthe work that I'm going to do it.\n\n302\n00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.520\nSo this is what I'm gonna\ngive you is this okay.\n\n303\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.910\nAnd then after you've done that,\nand that can take another month or\n\n304\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.350\nso to go through because you\ngotta write this thing first.\n\n305\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.470\nYou've got to decide and we'll talk\na little bit more about your proposal and\n\n306\n00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.590\nyour work package.\n\n307\n00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.810\nBut you have got to decide then\nexactly what's going to appear\n\n308\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.560\nin your work package.\n\n309\n00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.970\nAnd what the weighting is, etc.\n\n310\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.940\nAnd we'll talk about weighting cuz\ndifferent elements carry a higher weight,\n\n311\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.900\nwhich is why it's between ten and\n\n312\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.270\n20 different assignments\nthat you have to submit.\n\n313\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.610\nAnd it's only after you receive\nconfirmation from the examining institute.\n\n314\n00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.597\nThat you then start to\nwork on your work package.\n\n315\n00:19:17.597 --> 00:19:22.930\nThere is no point in starting to work\non your work package before then.\n\n316\n00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.098\nBecause they could simply turn around and\nsaying, no that's no sufficient enough.\n\n317\n00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.008\n&gt;&gt; You're not able to apply\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit like the person turning\n\n318\n00:19:29.008 --> 00:19:33.700\naround to me and said, I want to write\na book about how we implemented ITIL.\n\n319\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.900\nAnd I turn around and say, yes but then\nthat doesn't meet all of your criteria.\n\n320\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.730\nAnd here's all of your criteria and\nhere's all of the weighting and\n\n321\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.390\nif you write a book and these are the\nchapters that you intend in your book,\n\n322\n00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.610\nit's still not enough to qualify for\nITIL master.\n\n323\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.150\nSo ITIL master is quite a chunk.\n\n324\n00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.003\nSo what we're going to do is,\n\n325\n00:19:54.003 --> 00:19:57.647\nwe're going to leave this\nparticular episode right now.\n\n326\n00:19:57.647 --> 00:20:02.593\nAnd when we come back in our next episode,\nI'm going to go into great detail about\n\n327\n00:20:02.593 --> 00:20:08.040\nthe actual proposal itself and the work\npackage what you're expected to submit.\n\n328\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.108\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you for that intro Jo.\n\n329\n00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:12.790\nAnd ladies and gentlemen stay tuned\nbecause we wanna go through that process\n\n330\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.963\nand make sure we have everything\nwe need to become an ITIL master.\n\n331\n00:20:15.963 --> 00:20:19.146\nFor the show to sign up,\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n332\n00:20:19.146 --> 00:20:20.107\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n333\n00:20:20.107 --> 00:20:22.033\nSee you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n334\n00:20:22.033 -->

00:00:08.559\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.485\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:15.118\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:15.118 --> 00:00:17.475\nThis is a part two,\nbecause in the last show,\n\n7\n00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.585\nwe really weren't able to continue, or\n\n8\n00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.870\nfinish, I should say with the description\non how to become an ITIL master.\n\n9\n00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.760\nSo, we were able to get Miss Jo Peacock\nback in studios to finish up this\n\n10\n00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.500\nexplanation.\n\n11\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.430\nThank you for joining us, Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.852\n&gt;&gt; Are you saying I talk too much?\n\n13\n00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:31.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that what you said?\n\n14\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I didn't say it, you said it.\n\n15\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it does seem like a pretty\n\n16\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.570\nlengthy process to go through.\n\n17\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.810\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe cover it thoroughly and\n\n18\n00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.430\nnot just breeze through this.\n\n19\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.760\n&gt;&gt; I don't like to gloss over the ITIL\nmaster to be perfectly honest,\n\n20\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.740\nbecause the ITIL master is\nsuch a prestigious award.\n\n21\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.190\nBut at the same time\nthere's a lot of work, and\n\n22\n00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.890\nthere's a lot of effort involved in it.\n\n23\n00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.131\nAnd I know that a lot of people will\ntend to sort of just gloss over it.\n\n24\n00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:03.400\nAnd say, yes, you can be an ITIL master\nif you want to, here, read this.\n\n25\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.330\nHere, read this doesn't really explain it,\n\n26\n00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.480\nbecause it's quite,\ninvolved should we say.\n\n27\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.510\nAnd as we said, I've said in the last\nepisode it's about 6 to 12 months.\n\n28\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.340\nI've never known anybody to\ndo it in less than 18 months.\n\n29\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.860\nAnd it's a long, long process.\n\n30\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.390\nYou've got to submit a lot, and you've\ngot to be able to demonstrate a lot.\n\n31\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.000\nAnd so it's worth just spending a little\nbit of time just explaining exactly what\n\n32\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.060\nis required.\n\n33\n00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.450\nBecause you don't get\nthree chances at this.\n\n34\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.921\nYou'll get one chance to\nsubmit your work package.\n\n35\n00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:41.649\nAnd you might be asked once to\nsubmit some more evidence or\n\n36\n00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.180\nmaybe to add a little bit more\nmeat to the bones, but that's it.\n\n37\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.570\nThat's the chance that you get, and if\nyou don't get through in that particular\n\n38\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590\nchance, then you've gotta\ngo through it all again.\n\n39\n00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.750\nThat includes another fee,\nthat includes starting from scratch,\n\n40\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.380\nthat includes resubmitting a proposal,\ngetting references,\n\n41\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.870\nresubmitting your resume etc.\n\n42\n00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.222\nNow I mean the good news to all of that\nis that if you do have to go through\n\n43\n00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:09.887\nit again.\n\n44\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.490\nThen, of course,\n\n45\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.780\nyour longevity within service management\nas a leader has increased in that time.\n\n46\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.201\nBut nevertheless,\n\n47\n00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:22.570\nyou can imagine how much time this is\ngoing to take on top of your daily job.\n\n48\n00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.137\nThis is not a course where\nyou just take a week out and\n\n49\n00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:29.032\nyou just write some things, this is gonna\ntake months for you to actually do.\n\n50\n00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:32.550\nSo, you couldn't do this on an evening,\nyou got to do this in your downtime.\n\n51\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.643\nThis is not something\nthat you will just do.\n\n52\n00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.581\nAnd you'll rely on other people\nas well to help you with this,\n\n53\n00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:40.760\nbecause other people are going to\nhave to verify your experience.\n\n54\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.620\nAnd they're going to have to\nwrite references for you.\n\n55\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.170\nSo you are going to be relying on others,\ntoo, it's a lot of work.\n\n56\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.538\nSo in our last episode, we looked\nthen at the actual process itself.\n\n57\n00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.733\nAnd we started off with\nthe application and\n\n58\n00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:57.910\nthe submission of your CV or your resume.\n\n59\n00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.890\nAnd the submission of references,\npeople that are willing to stand up and\n\n60\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.860\nsay yes, it was definitely this\nperson that performed this work.\n\n61\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.360\nAnd it was definitely this\nperson that had this experience.\n\n62\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.230\nAnd so then you submitted your proposal.\n\n63\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.120\nAnd your proposal said, well,\nthis is how much work I'm going to do.\n\n64\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.510\nThis is what I'm going to give you.\n\n65\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.100\nYour proposal, the purpose of that is just\nto convince the assessors, as it says,\n\n66\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.520\nthat the planned assignments were\nundertaken by you, that you did them.\n\n67\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.370\nAnd that everything that\nyou're submitting or\n\n68\n00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.630\nwill be submitting in your work package,\nmeets all of the requirements.\n\n69\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.590\nNow, there are a few documents\nthat are available to download in\n\n70\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.070\nyour downloadable material for\nthis particular show.\n\n71\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.653\nAnd even though the show is\nonly a couple of episode.\n\n72\n00:03:54.653 --> 00:03:59.868\nBecause of the requirements and because\nof the waiting on all of the requirements\n\n73\n00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:04.170\nas well, then there are documents\navailable for you to download.\n\n74\n00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.913\nThere is a spreadsheet available for you\nto download that shows you the waiting for\n\n75\n00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:10.368\neach particular topic.\n\n76\n00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:14.429\nAnd it shows you the elements\nthat you have to submit and\n\n77\n00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:17.550\nthe scope within each of the elements.\n\n78\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.940\nThis is not something that I can\nexplain to you in ten minutes.\n\n79\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.385\nThis is something that takes me normally,\nwhen somebody comes to me to ask me for\n\n80\n00:04:25.385 --> 00:04:26.650\nadvice on this,\n\n81\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.530\nthis is normally something that will take\nme a good half a day to explain to you.\n\n82\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.810\nIt's not something that's\njust a small detail.\n\n83\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.440\nWhat I would normally say to you,\nyou have to have, and we've seen in\n\n84\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.220\nthe previous episode, you have to have\nengagement with an examiner institute.\n\n85\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.630\nAnd at that point in time, what I would\nnormally say to you is to either reach out\n\n86\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.280\nto a training organization or\nto reach out to an individual trainer or\n\n87\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.610\nconsultant, maybe somebody\nwho has helped you and\n\n88\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.230\nwho has coached you through\nto your ITIL expert.\n\n89\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.820\nMaybe reach out through a trainer who you\nfound who you really, really liked for\n\n90\n00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.740\ninstance.\n\n91\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.120\nYou can also reach out to us at ITProTV,\n\n92\n00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.510\nand we'll be happy to point\nyou in the right direction.\n\n93\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.700\nEven myself, or\n\n94\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.540\nanother one of my colleagues will\nbe able to help you with this.\n\n95\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.100\nBut reach out to somebody who\ncan guide you through this.\n\n96\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.678\nReaching out to a training organization\nmay cost a little bit more money.\n\n97\n00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.513\nReaching out to a trainer or consultant,\n\n98\n00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:36.700\nsomebody like myself may cost\nyou a little bit of money.\n\n99\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.190\nMuch better to do that than to\n\n100\n00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.280\nwaste all of your time and effort to-\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you're already gonna make\n\n101\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.371\nthe investment to obtain this\ncertification, you wanna make sure you're\n\n102\n00:05:46.371 --> 00:05:49.576\nsuccessful not just throwing your money\nout because you messed a few things.\n\n103\n00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:53.320\nWell let's face it, most people\nwill invest in training anyway.\n\n104\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.870\nI mean, just watching this\nepisode is an investment.\n\n105\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.310\nIt's an investment of your time, and\n\n106\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.350\nobviously, it's an investment\nwith your subscription as well.\n\n107\n00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.992\nSo, yes, if you want to achieve this\nthan this is something that you do\n\n108\n00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:07.996\nhave to make a small\namount of investment in.\n\n109\n00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:11.138\nBut it doesn't have to be\na huge amount of investment.\n\n110\n00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.930\nBut get some guidance,\ndon't go into this blind.\n\n111\n00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.080\nGo into this blind and I'll guarantee\nyou won't be particularly successful.\n\n112\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.180\nBecause you've got to work out\nthe scope and the elements.\n\n113\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.350\nYou've got to write a,\nin this proposal you have got to\n\n114\n00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.230\nwrite the details of your work package.\n\n115\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:38.330\nAnd if it's not broad enough,\nif it doesn't cover enough of ITIL.\n\n116\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.780\nIf it's concentrated mainly in,\nsay, service operation or\n\n117\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.700\nconcentrated mainly in continual service\nimprovement as opposed to implementation,\n\n118\n00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.000\nthen it's not going to be accepted.\n\n119\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.640\nThere is a proposal template,\nwhich you'll download.\n\n120\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.240\nThat's where you'll use that\ntemplate to submit your proposal.\n\n121\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.070\nLike I said, get somebody to help you.\n\n122\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.904\nBecause even in a previous episode, as I\nmentioned, somebody who came to me and\n\n123\n00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:06.979\nsaid to me that they\nwanted to write a book.\n\n124\n00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.142\nAnd they listed out the chapters\nin this book that they wanted\n\n125\n00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:14.570\nwrite about their own organization's\nimplementation of an ITIL based framework.\n\n126\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:22.465\nThat wasn't sufficient to meet the needs\nof the ITIL master program itself.\n\n127\n00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:27.760\nSo, be aware the waiting on all of\n\n128\n00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.550\nthe elements as we call them is available\nto you in a downloadable spreadsheet.\n\n129\n00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.340\nSo download that and\ntake a look at the spreadsheet.\n\n130\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.470\nThis work package,\nit's the fourth stage as it were.\n\n131\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.290\nAnd you have got to complete this,\nonce your proposal has been confirmed,\n\n132\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.720\nyou have got to then complete\nyour work package as it's called.\n\n133\n00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.719\nAnd there are four sections to this.\n\n134\n00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:58.037\nThe first one is the eligibility,\nthe entry criteria.\n\n135\n00:07:58.037 --> 00:08:01.053\nYou've got to complete your work\npackage using your template.\n\n136\n00:08:01.053 --> 00:08:05.970\nYou've got to go through the checklist and\nmake sure that you've covered everything.\n\n137\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.160\nThat you've displayed the right, take\na look at Bloom's taxonomy for instance.\n\n138\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.830\nThat you have displayed\nthe right level of involvement.\n\n139\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.870\nIt's not just a level of involvement that\nsays that I can write down what I did,\n\n140\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.860\nit's a level of involvement that\ndemonstrates that this is why\n\n141\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.510\nyou did certain things.\n\n142\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.370\nAnd this was the reason\nbehind your decisions.\n\n143\n00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:32.470\nAnd these were the evidence that you\nlooked at in order to make your decisions.\n\n144\n00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:38.509\nYou also, as part of your work package,\nyou have to obtain your referee statements\n\n145\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:45.810\nfrom at least one referee of the\norganizations benefiting the assignments.\n\n146\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.249\nSo let's say for instance, in your resume,\n\n147\n00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:53.412\nin your CV you have been at\na number of organizations and\n\n148\n00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:58.303\nyou're using examples from each\nof those organizations to help\n\n149\n00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:02.400\nyou in which case then\nyou've gotta get references.\n\n150\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.070\nYou've got to obtain referee so\ntheir consent.\n\n151\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.410\nAnd you have to have to have references.\n\n152\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.550\nThis is not just a case of submitting\nlike you do when you submit your CV or\n\n153\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.410\nyour resume from a job application and\nyou just submit some details and\n\n154\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.420\nyou never know that company\nmight contact them yes or no.\n\n155\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.770\nNo you have to actually get a reference.\n\n156\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.410\n&gt;&gt; Good working information.\n\n157\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.192\n&gt;&gt; Right, you've got to get a reference\nand that reference has got to say\n\n158\n00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:31.665\nthat yes, your work package is accurate,\nyes you did work here.\n\n159\n00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:36.917\nYes, you are accountable for\nthis implementation and\n\n160\n00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:40.124\nyou have got to get them on board.\n\n161\n00:09:40.124 --> 00:09:43.950\nNow the number of references that\nyou need is completely up to you.\n\n162\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:51.119\nIt says at least one referee\nfrom each of the organizations.\n\n163\n00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:53.025\nI know the question\nyou're going to ask me.\n\n164\n00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:56.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good, because I don't.\n\n165\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n166\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.080\nWell, that's fair enough.\n\n167\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.130\nNormally Cherokee likes to think that\nif we've got little bit more weight to\n\n168\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.970\nthings, if we've got a little bit in terms\nof references or something like that,\n\n169\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.760\nthat maybe that will give us a little\nbit more of a fighting chance.\n\n170\n00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n171\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.190\nThat's not the case.\n\n172\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.160\nBut it is possible to not have enough.\n\n173\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n174\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, if I say, Jo, you know,\n\n175\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.493\nwell maybe Jo would be a bad example.\n\n176\n00:10:21.493 --> 00:10:23.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because everyone, not everyone,\n\n177\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.570\nbut people in this industry know Jo.\n\n178\n00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.270\nBut let's say-\n&gt;&gt; People in this industry know that Jo is\n\n179\n00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.760\nmean and evil.\n\n180\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.570\nIs that what you are saying?\n\n181\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\nI’m saying\n\n182\n00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Let's say I had someone else as\n\n183\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.570\na reference and they'd never heard this\nperson and this person they couldn't you\n\n184\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.370\nknow find their credentials or find them\non the company page or find them online.\n\n185\n00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.110\nOr anything like that.\n\n186\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.550\nAnd they're like well, Cherokee you\nhave this kind of ghost vouching for\n\n187\n00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.970\nall the work that you've done but\nwe can't get ahold of them.\n\n188\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.450\nThe phone just rings and I don't know.\n\n189\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.370\nBut maybe they'd be asking for additional\nreferences in situations like that?\n\n190\n00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:03.810\n&gt;&gt; I have, I would always advise to you\nthat one reference is never enough.\n\n191\n00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:04.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n192\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.030\n&gt;&gt; One's is officially\nthe one reference is enough,\n\n193\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.830\nI would always advice that one\nreference would never enough.\n\n194\n00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.240\nWhat if they wanted,\n\n195\n00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.775\nwhat if they assessors did actually\nwant further clarification?\n\n196\n00:11:16.775 --> 00:11:22.260\nAnd it turned out that you had made\nup that reference, for instance.\n\n197\n00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.892\nSo I would advise that one\nreference is just never enough.\n\n198\n00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:27.230\nYou want two or\n\n199\n00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:32.440\nthree references just to verify the not\njust that you are who you say you are,\n\n200\n00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.190\nbut just to corroborate your story\nreally more than anything else, right?\n\n201\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.200\nYou have to also provide a declaration,\n\n202\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.520\nthis is a written declaration, an official\ndeclaration, that this is your own work,\n\n203\n00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.960\nthat you haven't plagiarized\nthis from somewhere else.\n\n204\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.448\nThis is not a copy of\nsomebody else's work package,\n\n205\n00:11:51.448 --> 00:11:54.322\nthis is something that\nyou have done yourself.\n\n206\n00:11:54.322 --> 00:11:55.201\n&gt;&gt; Do it in your own format.\n\n207\n00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:56.593\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n208\n00:11:56.593 --> 00:12:00.650\n&gt;&gt; Straight, original and\nlegitimate, authentic.\n\n209\n00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.170\n&gt;&gt; And so this work package and\n\n210\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.830\nall of the statements that you've got has\ngot to be sent to the examining institute\n\n211\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.720\nwithin 14 months from the day to\nthe acceptance in the proposal.\n\n212\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.760\nNow when I say within 14 months, given\nthat the first thing that you've had to do\n\n213\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.360\nif you remember from your last episode,\nthe first thing that you've had to do\n\n214\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.070\nis you've had to register\nwith the examining institute.\n\n215\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.100\nAnd then you've had to\nsubmit your proposal.\n\n216\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.300\nWell you've submitted your proposal and\nyou've submitted your resume, your CV etc.\n\n217\n00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.710\nIt could be a month before that come back.\n\n218\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.308\nIt could be a month before and\nI said could, the time scales vary, but\n\n219\n00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:47.020\nonce you've paid your application and\nyou've actually submitted an application,\n\n220\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.859\nthen that could be a month between then\nand you submitting your resume and\n\n221\n00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:53.788\nsubmitting your proposal.\n\n222\n00:12:53.788 --> 00:12:58.130\nAnd it could be a month until they come\nback and say yes your proposal's okay.\n\n223\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.750\nSo two months could have passed,\nthen you've got 14 months\n\n224\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.250\nfrom the day to that being accepted\nto submit your work package.\n\n225\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.043\nIt's gonna take you a few\nmonths to do that and\n\n226\n00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:15.132\nthey won't accept it too quickly\neither because then there will be a,\n\n227\n00:13:15.132 --> 00:13:18.897\nbearing in mind, that they gotta\napprove your proposal first.\n\n228\n00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:21.427\nThen as far as the examining\ninstitute are concerned,\n\n229\n00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:23.390\nthis has to be written from scratch.\n\n230\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.950\nThis isn't something\nyou can prepare early,\n\n231\n00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.140\nbecause you don't know what\nthey're going to ask for.\n\n232\n00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.235\nSo then you submit your work package.\n\n233\n00:13:34.235 --> 00:13:38.200\nAnd it's about point in time after\nyou submit your work package\n\n234\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.923\nthat you will then be asked for\nthe interview.\n\n235\n00:13:40.923 --> 00:13:45.024\nSo your proposal and your work package,\n\n236\n00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:49.599\nyour proposal has got to outline\nthe assignments that you're going to use.\n\n237\n00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.480\nThe sources in your work package,\n\n238\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.770\nthe source materials that you're\nusing has got to be referenced.\n\n239\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.550\nIf you reference another book,\nif you reference say the ITIL,\n\n240\n00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.910\nyour publications, you've got to\nreference the ITL publications\n\n241\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.820\nif you used a particular\nportion of a book.\n\n242\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.945\nLet's say for instance you used\nKotter's Eight Steps quite a lot.\n\n243\n00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:17.180\nKotter's eight steps to\ntransformational change,\n\n244\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.200\nyou can find that in the ITIL CSI book.\n\n245\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.467\nLet's say you use that quite a lot\nto ensure transformational change or\n\n246\n00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:30.980\nensure that when you implemented\na new process that it went smoothly.\n\n247\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.820\nWell then you have to reference\nthat in your material.\n\n248\n00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.710\nYou also have to use diagrams and\n\n249\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.660\nany other appendices that you\nmight want to use as evidence.\n\n250\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.100\nThink about a word count as well.\n\n251\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.980\nYou have to provide evidence\nof the word count and\n\n252\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.620\nyou have to provide evidence\nof your involvement.\n\n253\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.760\nIf somebody else led the charge\n\n254\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.640\nin a particular improvement initiative and\nin a particular implementation,\n\n255\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.970\nthen you've gotta provide\nevidence that you were involved.\n\n256\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.930\nYou can't just claim somebody\nelse's work on your own.\n\n257\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.440\nSo the work package itself.\n\n258\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.840\nAnd we're up to number three here,\nthe work package requirements.\n\n259\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.180\nThey have got to use, you've got to\nuse the template that's involved,\n\n260\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.720\nthe template that's given to you.\n\n261\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.270\nYou've gotta describe each assignment.\n\n262\n00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.190\nYou've got to also give credit to\nthe organizations that were involved, so\n\n263\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.380\nwherever you happened to work at the time.\n\n264\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:34.670\nYou have got to format it in a way\nthat you identify the outcomes that\n\n265\n00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.160\nwere expected.\n\n266\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.640\nIn other words,\nremember your business cases and\n\n267\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.320\nin your business case you've gotta say\nthis is what I expect to happen here.\n\n268\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.300\nAnd then at the end you say, right,\nand this is what I achieved.\n\n269\n00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.360\nAnd this is how we measured it.\n\n270\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.757\nAnd also the outcome,\nthe IT outcomes that were expected.\n\n271\n00:15:51.757 --> 00:15:53.363\nSo remember that in ITIL,\n\n272\n00:15:53.363 --> 00:15:58.401\na service is a means of delivering value\nto customers by facilitating the outcomes\n\n273\n00:15:58.401 --> 00:16:03.160\nthat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n274\n00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.310\nYou've got to demonstrate that you\nhave delivered value to the business.\n\n275\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.200\nSo it's not even just a case\nof demonstrating that you\n\n276\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.390\nimplemented incident management.\n\n277\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.220\nYou've got to provide visible proof\nthat that incident management\n\n278\n00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.940\nactually had a positive\nimpact on the organization.\n\n279\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.890\nSo it's not just a case of saying, yeah,\nI implemented incident management, and\n\n280\n00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.370\nlook here,\nI've got a reference to prove it as well.\n\n281\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:38.730\nShow me, I use this a lot when it comes to\ninternational standards and I say 20,000.\n\n282\n00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.130\nI'd say show me.\n\n283\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.200\nThis is our ITIL version of this.\n\n284\n00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.070\nThis is my ITIL version of show me.\n\n285\n00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.430\nShow me what you did.\n\n286\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.130\nShow me what you achieved.\n\n287\n00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.680\nYour actual work package itself.\n\n288\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.330\nOkay, and this is where it\nstarts to get complicated, and\n\n289\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.710\nthis is why I tell you\nget some help with this,\n\n290\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.220\nbecause you've got to include\nbetween 10 to 20 assignments.\n\n291\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.150\nBut they're based on weighting.\n\n292\n00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.715\nYour elements list is in\nthe downloadable material.\n\n293\n00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.340\nIt's in an excel spreadsheet.\n\n294\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.940\nYou've got to have at least one element\nfrom each ITIL Lifecycle phase and\n\n295\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.219\nthere's gotta be two that's\ngot a weighting of 3.\n\n296\n00:17:19.219 --> 00:17:22.576\nYou've gotta have at least\nthree that's weighted at 2.\n\n297\n00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:25.933\nYou've gotta have at least\nthree that's weighted at 1.\n\n298\n00:17:25.933 --> 00:17:30.770\nAnd you've gotta have at least one\nelement that's weighted at 2 or above,\n\n299\n00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.580\n2 or 3 from each single Lifeccycle phase.\n\n300\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.450\nI mean that in itself just\nblows your mind, right?\n\n301\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:42.300\n[LAUGH] And it does, and you'll be looking\nat elements such as maybe the four\n\n302\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.855\nPs of service strategy,\nthat's one element.\n\n303\n00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.850\nOr the five aspects of service design,\nthat's another element.\n\n304\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.370\nYou had a question Cherokee.\n\n305\n00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:51.990\nDon't ask me to do math, all right?\n\n306\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.501\nJust don't ask me to do that.\n\n307\n00:17:53.501 --> 00:17:56.810\n&gt;&gt; I know you'll know the answer to this,\nJo, you may have already said it.\n\n308\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:01.130\nSo I don't wanna [LAUGH] ask a silly\nquestion here, but I'm just thinking,\n\n309\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.901\nlook, after looking at all this\neffort that I'm putting forth,\n\n310\n00:18:04.901 --> 00:18:06.155\nwhat is the process?\n\n311\n00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:08.700\nAre we gonna talk about\nthe process of recerttification?\n\n312\n00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.040\nOr is this a one time, grandfathered in\ntype situation or what should I expect?\n\n313\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.488\n&gt;&gt; This called just jumping\nahead of ourselves.\n\n314\n00:18:17.488 --> 00:18:19.008\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nI figured you would get there.\n\n315\n00:18:19.008 --> 00:18:23.030\nBut I'm looking at all these\nprerequisites here and all these options.\n\n316\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.800\nAnd I'm like, okay, so\nI'm achieving this, but then what?\n\n317\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Once you've got your ITIL Master,\nyou've got your ITIL Master.\n\n318\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.660\nIt's a bit like having the ITIL Expert.\n\n319\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.880\nIt's a bit like in version 2 we\nhad the ITIL Service Manager.\n\n320\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.110\nOnce you've got that qualification,\nyou've got that qualification.\n\n321\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.441\nThe thing is that in version 2, and\n\n322\n00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:44.760\nversion 2was replaced with\na 2007 version 3 of ITIL.\n\n323\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.030\nOnce you've got your ITIL version 2\nService Manager then when version 3 came\n\n324\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.530\nalong then people will look\nin to having version 3 ITIL\n\n325\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.252\nexperts instead of version\n2 ITIL service managers.\n\n326\n00:18:58.252 --> 00:19:02.890\nSo whilst the qualification doesn't\nexpire, and all those people out there,\n\n327\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.590\nlike myself, went through the whole and\n\n328\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.600\ntaught the whole ITIL version 2,\nsort of, Service Manager.\n\n329\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.271\nWell, we're still service managers, but\nit's just that that's out of date now.\n\n330\n00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:19.370\nAnd it's not that it's expired.\n\n331\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.347\nIt's just that it's no longer relevant,\nso you have to think about relevance.\n\n332\n00:19:23.347 --> 00:19:27.365\nNow at the moment,\nthere are no plans to replace ITIL.\n\n333\n00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:29.290\n[LAUGH] There are no plans.\n\n334\n00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:34.370\nWe've just had, well, the 2011 version\nwas sort of commercially available.\n\n335\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.830\nReally started to take\noff in sort of 2012.\n\n336\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:41.020\nThere's no plans right now, but\nthat doesn't mean anything.\n\n337\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.220\nI mean, we've just implemented,\n\n338\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.930\nwe've just introduced last year in 2016\nthe ITIL Practitioner qualification.\n\n339\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.700\nAnd right now, ITIL is still relevant.\n\n340\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.070\nIt doesn't really need any sort of update.\n\n341\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.900\nIt's still relevant, and we move into\nintegration with DevOps and Agile, etc.,\n\n342\n00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.050\nand other frameworks.\n\n343\n00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:02.883\nSo I don't envisage the ITIL\nmaster qualification being\n\n344\n00:20:02.883 --> 00:20:06.113\nredundant in the UK sense of the word.\n\n345\n00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:11.600\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] I don't envisage it\nbeing sort of irrelevant anytime soon.\n\n346\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.066\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But it will always be\n\n347\n00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:15.500\na valid qualification that you have.\n\n348\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.280\nI mean, let's face it,\nyou work hard for it.\n\n349\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.560\nSo we looked at the weighting and\n\n350\n00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.560\nthe elements that you will have\nto choose in your work package.\n\n351\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.460\nThat's completely up to you, but\nas you can see, there has to be a spread.\n\n352\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.640\nYou've gotta have at least one\nfrom each Lifecycle phase.\n\n353\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.104\nAnd you have to have between 10 and 20,\n\n354\n00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:39.190\nit really depends on what\nweighting you're having.\n\n355\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.415\nBecause you have to have at least one,\nsorry, at least one for\n\n356\n00:20:42.415 --> 00:20:43.665\neach Lifecycle phase.\n\n357\n00:20:43.665 --> 00:20:47.809\nAt least two that are 3 and above,\nand at least three that are 2 and\n\n358\n00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:50.120\nabove and at least three that are 1.\n\n359\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.930\nWell, I mean if you look at that,\nthen you've got six.\n\n360\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.330\nSo you've got eight there, and\nthen you've got at least one.\n\n361\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.708\nBy the time you've done the math,\nit can be between 10 and 20.\n\n362\n00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:00.208\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n363\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.000\n&gt;&gt; Then what happens after that?\n\n364\n00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.930\nWell, after you've submitted,\n\n365\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.800\nyou'll receive notification\nthat you get a panel interview.\n\n366\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.100\nIt's normally done virtually, by\nthe examining institute, by the assessors.\n\n367\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.772\nIt's normally done virtually.\n\n368\n00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:18.860\nI say, normally.\n\n369\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:25.482\nWhen it first came out it was a real live\nthing, but it's usually done virtually.\n\n370\n00:21:25.482 --> 00:21:30.880\nYou'll have two or thee assessors there,\nmaybe even an independent observer.\n\n371\n00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.330\nIt's around about two hours,\nas I've already said, and\n\n372\n00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.960\nit's just going to be an interview that\njust goes through your work package and\n\n373\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.220\nasks questions about your work package.\n\n374\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.924\nAnd this is not just designed to ensure\nthat you understand the ITIL framework and\n\n375\n00:21:44.924 --> 00:21:49.837\nthat you understand how to implement that\nITIL framework, but this is also designed\n\n376\n00:21:49.837 --> 00:21:54.460\nto, well, really to verify that\nit was you that did all of this.\n\n377\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.297\nSo there'll be questions that ask\nabout specific situation that-\n\n378\n00:21:58.297 --> 00:21:58.910\n&gt;&gt; You should or\n\n379\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.880\nwould definitely know about you\nif actually perform the work.\n\n380\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.272\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for instance, we were just\ntalking about Cotter's eight steps in\n\n381\n00:22:05.272 --> 00:22:07.817\na very, eight steps to\ntransformational change in CSI.\n\n382\n00:22:07.817 --> 00:22:11.050\nYou'd use that when you were\nimplementing a new process.\n\n383\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.550\nI might ask you.\n\n384\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.580\nI might say something to you about, so\n\n385\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.194\nwhat sources of resistance\ndid you come across?\n\n386\n00:22:17.194 --> 00:22:19.817\nNow, I'd expect that to\nbe in your work package.\n\n387\n00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:24.699\nBut I might sort of twist that around\nslightly, and say, so did you get any of\n\n388\n00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:29.887\nthose people that sort of sit there in\nmeetings that say, yes, and then actively\n\n389\n00:22:29.887 --> 00:22:34.730\nturn around and start undermining you\nthe minute they walk out of the door?\n\n390\n00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.070\nQuestions are asked like that,\n\n391\n00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.920\nquestions are asked that are designed to\ntest that it's definitely your own work.\n\n392\n00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.080\nWe also ask questions on experience and\non your CV or\n\n393\n00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.060\nyour resume,\nwhich ever you want to call it.\n\n394\n00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.400\nSo we'll ask questions on, really,\nyour involvement within IT,\n\n395\n00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.050\nand there's no reason why,\nit's an interview.\n\n396\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:58.900\nThere's no reason why you\ncan't ask questions as well.\n\n397\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.934\nBut then after that, you will be notified\nafter the assessors have obviously\n\n398\n00:23:04.934 --> 00:23:08.713\ndiscussed, then you will be\nnotified as to your success and\n\n399\n00:23:08.713 --> 00:23:12.209\nas to whether you achieve\nyour ITIL Master, yes or no.\n\n400\n00:23:12.209 --> 00:23:14.280\nYou're not gonna be given\na grade on this one.\n\n401\n00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.390\nIt's either yes or no.\n\n402\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.570\nYou've achieved ITIL Master, or\nyou haven't achieved ITIL Master.\n\n403\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.179\nAnd that's it, and\nthat's your ITIL Master process.\n\n404\n00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.795\nThe whole thing's gonna take between,\nit says between,\n\n405\n00:23:28.795 --> 00:23:34.259\ntraditionally, it's normally\nbetween 18 months and\n\n406\n00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:38.604\n2 years, but\nit can be as quick as 6 months.\n\n407\n00:23:38.604 --> 00:23:40.323\n&gt;&gt; Overachievers [INAUDIBLE].\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I mean,\n\n408\n00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:42.280\nI've never actually seen that.\n\n409\n00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.534\nI've certainly never seen anybody that\nsubmitted early without being asked to\n\n410\n00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:47.105\ngo back and\n\n411\n00:23:47.105 --> 00:23:52.010\nreview what they've written because maybe\nit's not substantial enough, for instance.\n\n412\n00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.710\nOr it doesn't have enough\nexperience demonstrated, etc.\n\n413\n00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.410\nSo think about it carefully.\n\n414\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.800\nThis is not something that\nyou can take lightly.\n\n415\n00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.740\nAnd just remember that you've gotta\napproach this in a methodical way.\n\n416\n00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:12.230\nAnd you have to ask yourself whether it's\nactually relevant to your role, right now.\n\n417\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.150\nWill it add any value?\n\n418\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.670\nIt's like anything with ITIL,\nwhat we want to do is to add value, and\n\n419\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.830\nyou've got to ask yourself exactly\nthe same question with this,\n\n420\n00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:24.450\nwill this actually add any value\nto you and your organization?\n\n421\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.669\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH] while I've been\nsitting here and listening to you,\n\n422\n00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:31.411\nI actually had to do a quick online\nsearch because for a lot of people, yeah,\n\n423\n00:24:31.411 --> 00:24:33.535\nthis is a great personal accomplishment.\n\n424\n00:24:33.535 --> 00:24:34.589\nBut let's face it,\n\n425\n00:24:34.589 --> 00:24:38.650\nsome people are looking at the monetary\nvalue of something like this.\n\n426\n00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.150\nAnd you guys can do a search as well,\n\n427\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.410\nbut it's pretty significant\nlooking at the average salary.\n\n428\n00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.240\nOf course, that's gonna be\ncontingent upon, several factors,\n\n429\n00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.295\nlike geographical region and so\nforth, but not too shabby, Jo.\n\n430\n00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:54.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It depends on what you do to be proud.\n\n431\n00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.216\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Right,\n\n432\n00:24:55.216 --> 00:24:57.729\nit's what you do with that\nparticular certification as well.\n\n433\n00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.610\n&gt;&gt; I mean,\nit depends on what you do with it.\n\n434\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.247\nIt really, really does.\n\n435\n00:25:00.247 --> 00:25:03.192\nI can't answer that.\n\n436\n00:25:03.192 --> 00:25:08.408\n[LAUGH] I'm not gonna say anything.\n\n437\n00:25:08.408 --> 00:25:09.002\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n438\n00:25:09.002 --> 00:25:11.286\nyou can show me what you've\ngot a little bit later on.\n\n439\n00:25:11.286 --> 00:25:13.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can look online for\nyourselves.\n\n440\n00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.080\nBut yeah, just to get an idea there.\n\n441\n00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.872\nSo all right, so is that it?\n\n442\n00:25:16.872 --> 00:25:21.508\nOr is there any other final thoughts\nthat you'd like to share little bits of\n\n443\n00:25:21.508 --> 00:25:24.099\nwisdom before we embark on this process?\n\n444\n00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:27.840\n&gt;&gt; Bits of wisdom,\nI have no more wisdom left.\n\n445\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.858\nThe only thing that I can say is if\nthis is something that you are seriously\n\n446\n00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:33.401\nthinking about, then, by all means,\nget in touch with us.\n\n447\n00:25:33.401 --> 00:25:36.914\nAnd certainly either I or\nsomebody else can help and\n\n448\n00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:39.390\nguide you through this process.\n\n449\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.130\nThis is not something that you should\nattempt to do alone, put it that way.\n\n450\n00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.161\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, thank you for\nyour time, Jo, and thank you and\n\n451\n00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:48.829\ngood luck on achieving your\nITIL Master
