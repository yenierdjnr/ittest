00:00:08.248\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:11.967\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:14.153\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Practitioner series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.153 --> 00:00:16.540\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.290\nIn this episode, we'll really introduce,\nwell, at least Jo will, our ITIL expert,\n\n8\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.130\nintroduce what this series is gonna be all\nabout and what we should come to expect.\n\n9\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130\nSo, Jo, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely great,\nhow are you, Cherokee?\n\n11\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm just glad you're here, because I\ncertainly can't deliver this information.\n\n12\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.150\nSo I'm really hoping that you'll\nbe able to explain to us what we\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.842\nhave to look forward to in the series.\n\n14\n00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:43.947\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, in the ITIL Practitioner\nclass, the ITIL Practitioner\n\n15\n00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:48.457\nshow is unlike any other ITIL\nshow that you have ever watched.\n\n16\n00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:51.644\nIt's unlike any class that\nyou've ever undertaken, and\n\n17\n00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:56.370\nit's unlike any qualification in\nterms of ITIL that you have ever sat.\n\n18\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020\nITIL Practitioner does not fit\nin with the actual life cycle\n\n19\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580\nstream of all of your other ITIL courses.\n\n20\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.790\nThis particular show will look\nat the implementation of ITIL.\n\n21\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.791\nSo, there is an assumption there and\nthat you have.\n\n22\n00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:21.549\nAnd in fact, it's a prerequisite\nyou must have completed your ITIL\n\n23\n00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.830\nfoundation in order to be able to\nsit the ITIL practitioner test.\n\n24\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.900\nMy recommendation is that you've\nalso completed your MALC as well.\n\n25\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.300\nIn that you have actually gone\nthrough your intermediates, and\n\n26\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.340\nyou have attained ITIL expert status.\n\n27\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.480\nAnd at that point in time,\nthis is when we look at ITIL practitioner.\n\n28\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.600\nThe practitioner certification is\ndesigned for those consultants,\n\n29\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060\nthose specialists, and those managers\nwho are looking to implement ITIL.\n\n30\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.800\nImplement either ITIL as a whole or\nimplement maybe one or\n\n31\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.690\ntwo processes in ITIL.\n\n32\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.380\nSo it is designed for those experts\nwho understand ITIL completely.\n\n33\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.480\nYou cannot implement unless you understand\nwhat you're trying to implement.\n\n34\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.180\nWhich is why even though the prerequisite\nis just at the foundation level\n\n35\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.470\ncertificate.\n\n36\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.970\nI would recommend that you have\ndone other intermediates and\n\n37\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.260\neven MALC before you attempt\nto implement anything.\n\n38\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.180\nYou cannot implement anything, bearing\nin mind that you have to adopt ITIL and\n\n39\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.200\nthen adapt it to your environment.\n\n40\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.212\nYou have to understand what\nyou're adopting first.\n\n41\n00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:30.770\nSo and as I said,\n\n42\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.300\nyou can't implement anything unless\nyou have a full understanding of it.\n\n43\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.400\nNow this class, this particular\ncourse is completely different\n\n44\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.880\nto any of the other ITIL\nshows in its format.\n\n45\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.572\nThe recommendations from Axelos are for\n\n46\n00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:53.092\nthe ITIL practitioner\nthat we have around about\n\n47\n00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:58.350\na 25 to 35% tutor led study experience.\n\n48\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.824\nThe remainder of that, between 65 and\n75% is undertaken by exercises.\n\n49\n00:03:05.824 --> 00:03:10.789\nAnd these are exercises designed\nto test your ability to be able\n\n50\n00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:15.730\nto implement ITIL and\nimplement any of the processes in ITIL.\n\n51\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.590\nSo, this test can actually test\nyou on any of these processes.\n\n52\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.602\nWhich is why I say, you have to know them.\n\n53\n00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.150\nYou have to know them like\nthe back of your hand,\n\n54\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.270\nbecause your test is going to test you.\n\n55\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.620\nIt's gonna give you a scenario, and\n\n56\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.170\nit's going to test you on your ability\nto adapt ITIL in that scenario.\n\n57\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.200\nSo as I've said,\nyou have to be able to adapt ITIL.\n\n58\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290\nSo you have to know it in\norder to be able to adapt it.\n\n59\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.277\nSo, as far as this particular show is\nconcerned, with the ITIL Practitioner\n\n60\n00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:50.186\nshow, you're not going to find as many\nhours in our episodes as you have with\n\n61\n00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:55.122\nall of the previous ITIL shows and\nas you have with all of our intermediates.\n\n62\n00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:59.865\nBecause this particular show is focused\nvery much on your downloadable material\n\n63\n00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.644\nand on the exercises contained\nin that downloadable material.\n\n64\n00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:07.861\nNow, as always,\nwith all of our other ITIL shows,\n\n65\n00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:12.482\nwe are available as\nthe professionals in the ITIL fora.\n\n66\n00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:15.940\nWe're available for\nyou if you have any questions.\n\n67\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.224\nAnd in fact, in terms of feedback for your\nexercises, I would tell you that, yes,\n\n68\n00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:26.224\ndefinitely come back to us, and we'll be\nable to advice in any way that we can.\n\n69\n00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:32.167\nNow and I'm gonna talk to you in a moment\nabout the format of the actual study and\n\n70\n00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:35.151\nthe format of our examination as well.\n\n71\n00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.999\nBut what I would tell you is,\nas I've already told you,\n\n72\n00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.125\nwe have huge emphasis on the exercises and\nnot so\n\n73\n00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:48.590\nmuch emphasis on the actual\nepisodes themselves.\n\n74\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.990\nThis means you're going to be\ndoing a lot of work for yourself.\n\n75\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.230\nNow there's a temptation there,\n\n76\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.590\nand don't tell me that there\nisn't because I know there is.\n\n77\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.520\n&gt;&gt; I know, Jo, I was gonna ask you,\nis this something that if I feel\n\n78\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.533\nconfident with, I can just skip over the\nhomework and not perform the exercises?\n\n79\n00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.597\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely no,\n\n80\n00:05:03.597 --> 00:05:09.170\nthe problem with the people that\nare taking the ITIL Practitioner classes.\n\n81\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.710\nThat sounds negative, doesn't it,\nsaying they've got a problem.\n\n82\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.140\nBut it's really, really easy to assume\nthat you've got enough information, and\n\n83\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.322\nyou know enough about ITIL.\n\n84\n00:05:17.322 --> 00:05:22.829\nAnd therefore we don't have to take\nthe exercises because it's okay,\n\n85\n00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.492\nwe know everything.\n\n86\n00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.670\nLet me let you into a little secret here.\n\n87\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.694\nThe ITIL practitioner test,\nto be perfectly honest,\n\n88\n00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.937\nthe pass rate is not particularly high.\n\n89\n00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:32.770\nAnd you know what?\n\n90\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.740\nWe see a significant drop in pass rate for\nITIL practitioner for\n\n91\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.020\nthose that don't undertake the exercises.\n\n92\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.894\nThe exercises are designed, and\nthey're for a specific reason, and\n\n93\n00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.573\nthat's why they're there available\nin the downloadable material.\n\n94\n00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:51.578\nBecause they're designed to test\nyour ability to adapt ITIL,\n\n95\n00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:53.401\ngiven certain situations.\n\n96\n00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.940\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nyou know how to do that,\n\n97\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.720\nbecause you're gonna be in\na real-world situation,\n\n98\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.270\nwhere you have to implement ITIL, where\nyou have to adapt what's in the book.\n\n99\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.120\nSo as I've already said,\n\n100\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.020\nthere's an assumption that\nyou know what's in the book.\n\n101\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.427\nAnd all of the intermediate and\nall of the MALC tests and\n\n102\n00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:13.593\neverything that you've done so\nfar, they will test your theory.\n\n103\n00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:18.191\nWhat we're gonna test you here in ITIL\nPractitioner is that you know how to use\n\n104\n00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:18.982\nthe theory.\n\n105\n00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:23.951\nAnd so these exercises are designed\nto give you certain scenarios and\n\n106\n00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:28.330\ncertain situations that test\nyour knowledge of the theory.\n\n107\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.327\nSo no, you can't skip the exercises,\nCherokee.\n\n108\n00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:31.895\n&gt;&gt; I had to ask, Jo, I had to ask.\n\n109\n00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:35.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so let's take\na look then in a little bit more\n\n110\n00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:37.673\ndepth at just what's going\nto happen in this class.\n\n111\n00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:39.359\nAnd right in front of you right now,\n\n112\n00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.900\nyou'll see what we call\nthe ITIL Practitioner Book.\n\n113\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.670\nThis is the official ITIL book.\n\n114\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.330\nNow this is completely up to you, but I'm\ngonna recommend that you go to your local\n\n115\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.450\nbook retailer, whoever that may be.\n\n116\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.680\nOnline, you can buy it from\nAxelos if you want to.\n\n117\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.800\nAnd you purchase this book.\n\n118\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.934\nThis book is, well, required.\n\n119\n00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:05.703\nI'm gonna be referring to it\nthroughout the actual class itself,\n\n120\n00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:08.182\nbut this exam is an open book exam.\n\n121\n00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:09.225\nAnd when I say open book,\n\n122\n00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.980\nI don't mean any of the material\nthat you've got in front of you.\n\n123\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.330\nI mean this book, right now,\nthat's on the screen,\n\n124\n00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.650\nthe official ITIL Practitioner Guidance.\n\n125\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.490\nYou can use this during your test.\n\n126\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.370\nThat should give you a little bit\nof an insight as to exactly what\n\n127\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.530\nthis test entails because there's no other\nITIL qualification that's been open book.\n\n128\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.800\nThere's no other ITIL exam\nthat's open book, just this one.\n\n129\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.730\nSo what's in the book?\n\n130\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.140\nWell, the book contains a tool kit,\n\n131\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.936\nsomething that everybody's been\nasking for, for a long, long time.\n\n132\n00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:44.240\nAnd the tool kit is literally\njust a set of templates.\n\n133\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.422\nI get asked all the time,\ndo you have a template for an SLA?\n\n134\n00:07:47.422 --> 00:07:49.880\nDo you have a template for a CSO register?\n\n135\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.730\nDo you have a template for\na stakeholder worksheet or\n\n136\n00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.520\nstakeholder analysis or\ntraining needs analysis?\n\n137\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.900\nWell, we do now.\n\n138\n00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.322\nIt's in this book, and you can refer\nto these throughout your test.\n\n139\n00:08:03.322 --> 00:08:06.157\nBut more importantly,\nthroughout the case study and\n\n140\n00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:10.360\nthroughout your course exercises,\nyou're going to be using this book.\n\n141\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.490\nAnd I'm gonna be referring to\nspecific pages in this book\n\n142\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.350\nthroughout our episodes\non ITIL Practitioner.\n\n143\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.441\n&gt;&gt; Jill,\nwhere can I find one of these books?\n\n144\n00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.466\n&gt;&gt; Well, as I said just a little\nwhile ago, any bookstore and\n\n145\n00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:29.740\nany online retailer will be\nable to sell you these books.\n\n146\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.850\nYou can buy it from the Axelos website.\n\n147\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.563\nJust remember that the book\nis produced in the UK.\n\n148\n00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:40.503\nSo the prices that you're quoting or that\nyou're going to be quoted are in pounds.\n\n149\n00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:44.240\nAnd that remains static, but\nof course, the exchange rate differs.\n\n150\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.711\nSo you're going to see different\nprices in different places.\n\n151\n00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:50.260\nIt's still the same book, it's just\nbeen dependent on the exchange rate when\n\n152\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.310\nwhoever that retailer is\nbought that particular book.\n\n153\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.515\nThat's the only difference.\n\n154\n00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:58.310\nYou're gonna have a case study,\nit's in your downloadable material.\n\n155\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.280\nThis case study is going\nto be used in your test.\n\n156\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.310\nAnd this case study refers to\na company called CruiseAlongCars and\n\n157\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.550\nother organizations, subsidiary and\npartner organizations,\n\n158\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.730\nsuch as the DriveYou.com, etc, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.200\nSo that case study, I'm going to be\nreferring to throughout the class, and\n\n160\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.940\nI'm also going to be referring to that for\nyour exercises as well.\n\n161\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.480\nSo, as I've already told you,\nthe exam guidelines, or rather, the Axelos\n\n162\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.119\nguidelines are that we spend between\n65 and 75% of our time on exercises.\n\n163\n00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:36.093\nAnd it mentions here a minimum of 50%,\nand it is going to be a minimum of 50%.\n\n164\n00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:41.097\nAnd I've already mentioned that these are\ndesigned to emulate real world scenarios,\n\n165\n00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.544\nreal world experience.\n\n166\n00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:46.720\nIt's based on the holistic implementation\nof all of our ITIL processes.\n\n167\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.071\nSo, it's very imperative\nthat you understand ITIL.\n\n168\n00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:51.788\nIn our subsequent episodes,\n\n169\n00:09:51.788 --> 00:09:56.046\nthe first episodes that we're going\nto have in this particular show after\n\n170\n00:09:56.046 --> 00:10:00.389\nthis one are really going to be just\na recap on foundation, just to help us.\n\n171\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.010\nSo let's take a look then at,\n\n172\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:09.480\nwell, your expectations in terms\nof the actual shows themselves.\n\n173\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.690\nThe syllabus, as I've already mentioned,\ntalks about ITIL concepts.\n\n174\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.480\nIt talks about the CSI approach and\nguiding principles and metrics.\n\n175\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.160\nWe're going to be covering all of these.\n\n176\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.360\nNow you might think that you've\nalready covered these in your\n\n177\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.320\nprevious sessions,\nas you've looked at CSI, for instance.\n\n178\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.150\nWell, you haven't, not at this angle and\nnot to this degree of depth.\n\n179\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.640\nSo Cherokee, when you mention about,\nI don't need to do the exercise.\n\n180\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.800\nYeah, don't be overconfident, because this\nis not what this is designed to test you.\n\n181\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm not just understanding\nthe theory anymore.\n\n182\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.120\nI have to know how to\nimplement it at this stage.\n\n183\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we learnt in all of our\nother shows is the actual theory itself.\n\n184\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.930\nAnd we learned to absorb the theory, and\nwe learned to apply some of the theory.\n\n185\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.125\nBut now, we're learning to adapt a theory.\n\n186\n00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:03.825\nSo in our previous episodes,\nin all of our other shows,\n\n187\n00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:06.750\nwe've learned to apply the theory.\n\n188\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.840\nNow we're learning to adapt to theory.\n\n189\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.737\nAnd so we're coming at this from\na completely different angle.\n\n190\n00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.340\nAnd then of course, we're going\nto have some exam prep as well.\n\n191\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.290\nHere we are, if we look at Blooms\nTaxonomy, here we are at sort of level\n\n192\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.630\nfour in analyzing and where level four and\nlevel five almost as well.\n\n193\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.042\nThat's where we're coming\nat this from there.\n\n194\n00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:32.181\nSo our approach is going to be\nvery much the learning itself,\n\n195\n00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:35.870\nin other words,\nthrough our shows and our episodes.\n\n196\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.800\nBut then we're also going to be\nundertaking the exercises that I've said.\n\n197\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.610\nAnd we're going to be learning\nassessment techniques, and\n\n198\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.900\nwe're going to be taking a mock test.\n\n199\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.370\nAnd lastly, really, for\nthis particular introduction,\n\n200\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.039\nI'm just going to tell you a little\nbit about your test itself.\n\n201\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.532\nYou have a multiple choice test, exactly\nthe same as all the other ITIL tests.\n\n202\n00:11:56.532 --> 00:12:00.393\nOnly this one is actually going\nto be open book, cuz I've said,\n\n203\n00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:05.450\nthe only ITIL test that's open book,\nand it's two hours and 15 minutes long.\n\n204\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.130\nThat's the longest ITIL\ntest that you've ever had.\n\n205\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.970\nYou're gonna get 40 questions, and\n\n206\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.450\nthese 40 questions are going\nto be based on the case study.\n\n207\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.680\nIt's exactly the same case study\nthat we are going to be looking at\n\n208\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.070\nthroughout this particular show.\n\n209\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.540\nIt's not a different case study.\n\n210\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.940\nSo I always advise everybody,\n\n211\n00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.080\nbefore they sit their test,\nget to know your case study.\n\n212\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.020\nRead it every single night if you need to.\n\n213\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.950\nJust get to know your case study.\n\n214\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.600\nYou have to get a mark of 28 out of 40 on\nthis test in order to be able to pass.\n\n215\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.150\nIt's multiple choice,\n\n216\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.540\nit's not complex multiple choice,\nit's simple multiple choice.\n\n217\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.600\nYou've got one right answer, that's it.\n\n218\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.637\nThere's no points awarded,\n\n219\n00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:52.713\nunlike in our intermediates,\nwhere we had a point system.\n\n220\n00:12:52.713 --> 00:12:53.680\n&gt;&gt; Partial credit or something like that?\n\n221\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you had a point\nsystem based on your best fit answer.\n\n222\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.040\nNot on this one, you've either got\nthe right answer or the wrong.\n\n223\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.880\nIt's as simple as that,\nvery simple multiple choice.\n\n224\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.130\nSo it's very, very important that\nyou understand how we adapt to ITIL.\n\n225\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.300\nNow, as I already mentioned, the early\nprerequisite is for the ITIL foundation.\n\n226\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.500\nBut I would also recommend\nthat you get to know\n\n227\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.350\nyour other ITIL intermediates\nbefore sitting a practitioner test.\n\n228\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.970\nBecause you simply cannot\nimplement something if you don't\n\n229\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.470\nunderstand what you're implementing.\n\n230\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.820\nSo for now, what I'd like you to do is,\n\n231\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.840\nI would like you to watch our foundation\nrecap and subsequent episodes.\n\n232\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.100\nOur next two episodes are going\nto be a recap of the foundation,\n\n233\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.018\njust to give you that refresher\ninto all of those processes.\n\n234\n00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:46.032\nAnd then, we'll then launch into\nthe ITIL practitioner body itself.\n\n235\n00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:47.656\nAnd in these episodes,\n\n236\n00:13:47.656 --> 00:13:52.310\nwe'll be looking at various\ntechniques to actually adapt to ITIL.\n\n237\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.881\nAnd then, of course,\ntowards the end of the show,\n\n238\n00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:58.552\nwe'll be going over a practice exam.\n\n239\n00:13:58.552 --> 00:14:03.088\nAnd we'll be reviewing only the answers\nin that practice exam, and also,\n\n240\n00:14:03.088 --> 00:14:07.632\nI'll be giving you some hints and tips\non how to start with the exam as well.\n\n241\n00:14:07.632 --> 00:14:10.591\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect, Jo, thank you for\ntaking the time to explain that to us.\n\n242\n00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:11.830\nHope to see you soon.\n\n243\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.220\nWe've got a whole lot of\nepisodes headed your way.\n\n244\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.040\nBut for now, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n245\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.440\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n246\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n247\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.552\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n248\n00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:26.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n249\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.564\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
