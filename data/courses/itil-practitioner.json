00:00:08.248\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:11.967\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:14.153\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Practitioner series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.153 --> 00:00:16.540\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.290\nIn this episode, we'll really introduce,\nwell, at least Jo will, our ITIL expert,\n\n8\n00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.130\nintroduce what this series is gonna be all\nabout and what we should come to expect.\n\n9\n00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130\nSo, Jo, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm absolutely great,\nhow are you, Cherokee?\n\n11\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.040\n&gt;&gt; I'm just glad you're here, because I\ncertainly can't deliver this information.\n\n12\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.150\nSo I'm really hoping that you'll\nbe able to explain to us what we\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.842\nhave to look forward to in the series.\n\n14\n00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:43.947\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, in the ITIL Practitioner\nclass, the ITIL Practitioner\n\n15\n00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:48.457\nshow is unlike any other ITIL\nshow that you have ever watched.\n\n16\n00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:51.644\nIt's unlike any class that\nyou've ever undertaken, and\n\n17\n00:00:51.644 --> 00:00:56.370\nit's unlike any qualification in\nterms of ITIL that you have ever sat.\n\n18\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020\nITIL Practitioner does not fit\nin with the actual life cycle\n\n19\n00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580\nstream of all of your other ITIL courses.\n\n20\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.790\nThis particular show will look\nat the implementation of ITIL.\n\n21\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.791\nSo, there is an assumption there and\nthat you have.\n\n22\n00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:21.549\nAnd in fact, it's a prerequisite\nyou must have completed your ITIL\n\n23\n00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.830\nfoundation in order to be able to\nsit the ITIL practitioner test.\n\n24\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.900\nMy recommendation is that you've\nalso completed your MALC as well.\n\n25\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.300\nIn that you have actually gone\nthrough your intermediates, and\n\n26\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.340\nyou have attained ITIL expert status.\n\n27\n00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.480\nAnd at that point in time,\nthis is when we look at ITIL practitioner.\n\n28\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.600\nThe practitioner certification is\ndesigned for those consultants,\n\n29\n00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.060\nthose specialists, and those managers\nwho are looking to implement ITIL.\n\n30\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.800\nImplement either ITIL as a whole or\nimplement maybe one or\n\n31\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.690\ntwo processes in ITIL.\n\n32\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.380\nSo it is designed for those experts\nwho understand ITIL completely.\n\n33\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.480\nYou cannot implement unless you understand\nwhat you're trying to implement.\n\n34\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.180\nWhich is why even though the prerequisite\nis just at the foundation level\n\n35\n00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.470\ncertificate.\n\n36\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.970\nI would recommend that you have\ndone other intermediates and\n\n37\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.260\neven MALC before you attempt\nto implement anything.\n\n38\n00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.180\nYou cannot implement anything, bearing\nin mind that you have to adopt ITIL and\n\n39\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.200\nthen adapt it to your environment.\n\n40\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.212\nYou have to understand what\nyou're adopting first.\n\n41\n00:02:30.212 --> 00:02:30.770\nSo and as I said,\n\n42\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.300\nyou can't implement anything unless\nyou have a full understanding of it.\n\n43\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.400\nNow this class, this particular\ncourse is completely different\n\n44\n00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.880\nto any of the other ITIL\nshows in its format.\n\n45\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.572\nThe recommendations from Axelos are for\n\n46\n00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:53.092\nthe ITIL practitioner\nthat we have around about\n\n47\n00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:58.350\na 25 to 35% tutor led study experience.\n\n48\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.824\nThe remainder of that, between 65 and\n75% is undertaken by exercises.\n\n49\n00:03:05.824 --> 00:03:10.789\nAnd these are exercises designed\nto test your ability to be able\n\n50\n00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:15.730\nto implement ITIL and\nimplement any of the processes in ITIL.\n\n51\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.590\nSo, this test can actually test\nyou on any of these processes.\n\n52\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.602\nWhich is why I say, you have to know them.\n\n53\n00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.150\nYou have to know them like\nthe back of your hand,\n\n54\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.270\nbecause your test is going to test you.\n\n55\n00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.620\nIt's gonna give you a scenario, and\n\n56\n00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.170\nit's going to test you on your ability\nto adapt ITIL in that scenario.\n\n57\n00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.200\nSo as I've said,\nyou have to be able to adapt ITIL.\n\n58\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290\nSo you have to know it in\norder to be able to adapt it.\n\n59\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.277\nSo, as far as this particular show is\nconcerned, with the ITIL Practitioner\n\n60\n00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:50.186\nshow, you're not going to find as many\nhours in our episodes as you have with\n\n61\n00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:55.122\nall of the previous ITIL shows and\nas you have with all of our intermediates.\n\n62\n00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:59.865\nBecause this particular show is focused\nvery much on your downloadable material\n\n63\n00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.644\nand on the exercises contained\nin that downloadable material.\n\n64\n00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:07.861\nNow, as always,\nwith all of our other ITIL shows,\n\n65\n00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:12.482\nwe are available as\nthe professionals in the ITIL fora.\n\n66\n00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:15.940\nWe're available for\nyou if you have any questions.\n\n67\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.224\nAnd in fact, in terms of feedback for your\nexercises, I would tell you that, yes,\n\n68\n00:04:21.224 --> 00:04:26.224\ndefinitely come back to us, and we'll be\nable to advice in any way that we can.\n\n69\n00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:32.167\nNow and I'm gonna talk to you in a moment\nabout the format of the actual study and\n\n70\n00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:35.151\nthe format of our examination as well.\n\n71\n00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.999\nBut what I would tell you is,\nas I've already told you,\n\n72\n00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.125\nwe have huge emphasis on the exercises and\nnot so\n\n73\n00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:48.590\nmuch emphasis on the actual\nepisodes themselves.\n\n74\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.990\nThis means you're going to be\ndoing a lot of work for yourself.\n\n75\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.230\nNow there's a temptation there,\n\n76\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.590\nand don't tell me that there\nisn't because I know there is.\n\n77\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.520\n&gt;&gt; I know, Jo, I was gonna ask you,\nis this something that if I feel\n\n78\n00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.533\nconfident with, I can just skip over the\nhomework and not perform the exercises?\n\n79\n00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.597\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely no,\n\n80\n00:05:03.597 --> 00:05:09.170\nthe problem with the people that\nare taking the ITIL Practitioner classes.\n\n81\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.710\nThat sounds negative, doesn't it,\nsaying they've got a problem.\n\n82\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.140\nBut it's really, really easy to assume\nthat you've got enough information, and\n\n83\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.322\nyou know enough about ITIL.\n\n84\n00:05:17.322 --> 00:05:22.829\nAnd therefore we don't have to take\nthe exercises because it's okay,\n\n85\n00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.492\nwe know everything.\n\n86\n00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.670\nLet me let you into a little secret here.\n\n87\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.694\nThe ITIL practitioner test,\nto be perfectly honest,\n\n88\n00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.937\nthe pass rate is not particularly high.\n\n89\n00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:32.770\nAnd you know what?\n\n90\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.740\nWe see a significant drop in pass rate for\nITIL practitioner for\n\n91\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.020\nthose that don't undertake the exercises.\n\n92\n00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.894\nThe exercises are designed, and\nthey're for a specific reason, and\n\n93\n00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.573\nthat's why they're there available\nin the downloadable material.\n\n94\n00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:51.578\nBecause they're designed to test\nyour ability to adapt ITIL,\n\n95\n00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:53.401\ngiven certain situations.\n\n96\n00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.940\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nyou know how to do that,\n\n97\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.720\nbecause you're gonna be in\na real-world situation,\n\n98\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.270\nwhere you have to implement ITIL, where\nyou have to adapt what's in the book.\n\n99\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.120\nSo as I've already said,\n\n100\n00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.020\nthere's an assumption that\nyou know what's in the book.\n\n101\n00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.427\nAnd all of the intermediate and\nall of the MALC tests and\n\n102\n00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:13.593\neverything that you've done so\nfar, they will test your theory.\n\n103\n00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:18.191\nWhat we're gonna test you here in ITIL\nPractitioner is that you know how to use\n\n104\n00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:18.982\nthe theory.\n\n105\n00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:23.951\nAnd so these exercises are designed\nto give you certain scenarios and\n\n106\n00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:28.330\ncertain situations that test\nyour knowledge of the theory.\n\n107\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.327\nSo no, you can't skip the exercises,\nCherokee.\n\n108\n00:06:30.327 --> 00:06:31.895\n&gt;&gt; I had to ask, Jo, I had to ask.\n\n109\n00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:35.017\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so let's take\na look then in a little bit more\n\n110\n00:06:35.017 --> 00:06:37.673\ndepth at just what's going\nto happen in this class.\n\n111\n00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:39.359\nAnd right in front of you right now,\n\n112\n00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.900\nyou'll see what we call\nthe ITIL Practitioner Book.\n\n113\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.670\nThis is the official ITIL book.\n\n114\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.330\nNow this is completely up to you, but I'm\ngonna recommend that you go to your local\n\n115\n00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.450\nbook retailer, whoever that may be.\n\n116\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.680\nOnline, you can buy it from\nAxelos if you want to.\n\n117\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.800\nAnd you purchase this book.\n\n118\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.934\nThis book is, well, required.\n\n119\n00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:05.703\nI'm gonna be referring to it\nthroughout the actual class itself,\n\n120\n00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:08.182\nbut this exam is an open book exam.\n\n121\n00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:09.225\nAnd when I say open book,\n\n122\n00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.980\nI don't mean any of the material\nthat you've got in front of you.\n\n123\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.330\nI mean this book, right now,\nthat's on the screen,\n\n124\n00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.650\nthe official ITIL Practitioner Guidance.\n\n125\n00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.490\nYou can use this during your test.\n\n126\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.370\nThat should give you a little bit\nof an insight as to exactly what\n\n127\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.530\nthis test entails because there's no other\nITIL qualification that's been open book.\n\n128\n00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.800\nThere's no other ITIL exam\nthat's open book, just this one.\n\n129\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.730\nSo what's in the book?\n\n130\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.140\nWell, the book contains a tool kit,\n\n131\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.936\nsomething that everybody's been\nasking for, for a long, long time.\n\n132\n00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:44.240\nAnd the tool kit is literally\njust a set of templates.\n\n133\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.422\nI get asked all the time,\ndo you have a template for an SLA?\n\n134\n00:07:47.422 --> 00:07:49.880\nDo you have a template for a CSO register?\n\n135\n00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.730\nDo you have a template for\na stakeholder worksheet or\n\n136\n00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.520\nstakeholder analysis or\ntraining needs analysis?\n\n137\n00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.900\nWell, we do now.\n\n138\n00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.322\nIt's in this book, and you can refer\nto these throughout your test.\n\n139\n00:08:03.322 --> 00:08:06.157\nBut more importantly,\nthroughout the case study and\n\n140\n00:08:06.157 --> 00:08:10.360\nthroughout your course exercises,\nyou're going to be using this book.\n\n141\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.490\nAnd I'm gonna be referring to\nspecific pages in this book\n\n142\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.350\nthroughout our episodes\non ITIL Practitioner.\n\n143\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.441\n&gt;&gt; Jill,\nwhere can I find one of these books?\n\n144\n00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.466\n&gt;&gt; Well, as I said just a little\nwhile ago, any bookstore and\n\n145\n00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:29.740\nany online retailer will be\nable to sell you these books.\n\n146\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:31.850\nYou can buy it from the Axelos website.\n\n147\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.563\nJust remember that the book\nis produced in the UK.\n\n148\n00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:40.503\nSo the prices that you're quoting or that\nyou're going to be quoted are in pounds.\n\n149\n00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:44.240\nAnd that remains static, but\nof course, the exchange rate differs.\n\n150\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.711\nSo you're going to see different\nprices in different places.\n\n151\n00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:50.260\nIt's still the same book, it's just\nbeen dependent on the exchange rate when\n\n152\n00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.310\nwhoever that retailer is\nbought that particular book.\n\n153\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.515\nThat's the only difference.\n\n154\n00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:58.310\nYou're gonna have a case study,\nit's in your downloadable material.\n\n155\n00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.280\nThis case study is going\nto be used in your test.\n\n156\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.310\nAnd this case study refers to\na company called CruiseAlongCars and\n\n157\n00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.550\nother organizations, subsidiary and\npartner organizations,\n\n158\n00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.730\nsuch as the DriveYou.com, etc, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.200\nSo that case study, I'm going to be\nreferring to throughout the class, and\n\n160\n00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.940\nI'm also going to be referring to that for\nyour exercises as well.\n\n161\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.480\nSo, as I've already told you,\nthe exam guidelines, or rather, the Axelos\n\n162\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.119\nguidelines are that we spend between\n65 and 75% of our time on exercises.\n\n163\n00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:36.093\nAnd it mentions here a minimum of 50%,\nand it is going to be a minimum of 50%.\n\n164\n00:09:36.093 --> 00:09:41.097\nAnd I've already mentioned that these are\ndesigned to emulate real world scenarios,\n\n165\n00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:42.544\nreal world experience.\n\n166\n00:09:42.544 --> 00:09:46.720\nIt's based on the holistic implementation\nof all of our ITIL processes.\n\n167\n00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.071\nSo, it's very imperative\nthat you understand ITIL.\n\n168\n00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:51.788\nIn our subsequent episodes,\n\n169\n00:09:51.788 --> 00:09:56.046\nthe first episodes that we're going\nto have in this particular show after\n\n170\n00:09:56.046 --> 00:10:00.389\nthis one are really going to be just\na recap on foundation, just to help us.\n\n171\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.010\nSo let's take a look then at,\n\n172\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:09.480\nwell, your expectations in terms\nof the actual shows themselves.\n\n173\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.690\nThe syllabus, as I've already mentioned,\ntalks about ITIL concepts.\n\n174\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.480\nIt talks about the CSI approach and\nguiding principles and metrics.\n\n175\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.160\nWe're going to be covering all of these.\n\n176\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.360\nNow you might think that you've\nalready covered these in your\n\n177\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.320\nprevious sessions,\nas you've looked at CSI, for instance.\n\n178\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.150\nWell, you haven't, not at this angle and\nnot to this degree of depth.\n\n179\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.640\nSo Cherokee, when you mention about,\nI don't need to do the exercise.\n\n180\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.800\nYeah, don't be overconfident, because this\nis not what this is designed to test you.\n\n181\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm not just understanding\nthe theory anymore.\n\n182\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.120\nI have to know how to\nimplement it at this stage.\n\n183\n00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we learnt in all of our\nother shows is the actual theory itself.\n\n184\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.930\nAnd we learned to absorb the theory, and\nwe learned to apply some of the theory.\n\n185\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.125\nBut now, we're learning to adapt a theory.\n\n186\n00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:03.825\nSo in our previous episodes,\nin all of our other shows,\n\n187\n00:11:03.825 --> 00:11:06.750\nwe've learned to apply the theory.\n\n188\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.840\nNow we're learning to adapt to theory.\n\n189\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.737\nAnd so we're coming at this from\na completely different angle.\n\n190\n00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.340\nAnd then of course, we're going\nto have some exam prep as well.\n\n191\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.290\nHere we are, if we look at Blooms\nTaxonomy, here we are at sort of level\n\n192\n00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:24.630\nfour in analyzing and where level four and\nlevel five almost as well.\n\n193\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.042\nThat's where we're coming\nat this from there.\n\n194\n00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:32.181\nSo our approach is going to be\nvery much the learning itself,\n\n195\n00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:35.870\nin other words,\nthrough our shows and our episodes.\n\n196\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.800\nBut then we're also going to be\nundertaking the exercises that I've said.\n\n197\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.610\nAnd we're going to be learning\nassessment techniques, and\n\n198\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.900\nwe're going to be taking a mock test.\n\n199\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.370\nAnd lastly, really, for\nthis particular introduction,\n\n200\n00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.039\nI'm just going to tell you a little\nbit about your test itself.\n\n201\n00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.532\nYou have a multiple choice test, exactly\nthe same as all the other ITIL tests.\n\n202\n00:11:56.532 --> 00:12:00.393\nOnly this one is actually going\nto be open book, cuz I've said,\n\n203\n00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:05.450\nthe only ITIL test that's open book,\nand it's two hours and 15 minutes long.\n\n204\n00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.130\nThat's the longest ITIL\ntest that you've ever had.\n\n205\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.970\nYou're gonna get 40 questions, and\n\n206\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.450\nthese 40 questions are going\nto be based on the case study.\n\n207\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.680\nIt's exactly the same case study\nthat we are going to be looking at\n\n208\n00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.070\nthroughout this particular show.\n\n209\n00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.540\nIt's not a different case study.\n\n210\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.940\nSo I always advise everybody,\n\n211\n00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.080\nbefore they sit their test,\nget to know your case study.\n\n212\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.020\nRead it every single night if you need to.\n\n213\n00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.950\nJust get to know your case study.\n\n214\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.600\nYou have to get a mark of 28 out of 40 on\nthis test in order to be able to pass.\n\n215\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.150\nIt's multiple choice,\n\n216\n00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.540\nit's not complex multiple choice,\nit's simple multiple choice.\n\n217\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.600\nYou've got one right answer, that's it.\n\n218\n00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.637\nThere's no points awarded,\n\n219\n00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:52.713\nunlike in our intermediates,\nwhere we had a point system.\n\n220\n00:12:52.713 --> 00:12:53.680\n&gt;&gt; Partial credit or something like that?\n\n221\n00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you had a point\nsystem based on your best fit answer.\n\n222\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.040\nNot on this one, you've either got\nthe right answer or the wrong.\n\n223\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.880\nIt's as simple as that,\nvery simple multiple choice.\n\n224\n00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.130\nSo it's very, very important that\nyou understand how we adapt to ITIL.\n\n225\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.300\nNow, as I already mentioned, the early\nprerequisite is for the ITIL foundation.\n\n226\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.500\nBut I would also recommend\nthat you get to know\n\n227\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.350\nyour other ITIL intermediates\nbefore sitting a practitioner test.\n\n228\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.970\nBecause you simply cannot\nimplement something if you don't\n\n229\n00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.470\nunderstand what you're implementing.\n\n230\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.820\nSo for now, what I'd like you to do is,\n\n231\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.840\nI would like you to watch our foundation\nrecap and subsequent episodes.\n\n232\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.100\nOur next two episodes are going\nto be a recap of the foundation,\n\n233\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.018\njust to give you that refresher\ninto all of those processes.\n\n234\n00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:46.032\nAnd then, we'll then launch into\nthe ITIL practitioner body itself.\n\n235\n00:13:46.032 --> 00:13:47.656\nAnd in these episodes,\n\n236\n00:13:47.656 --> 00:13:52.310\nwe'll be looking at various\ntechniques to actually adapt to ITIL.\n\n237\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.881\nAnd then, of course,\ntowards the end of the show,\n\n238\n00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:58.552\nwe'll be going over a practice exam.\n\n239\n00:13:58.552 --> 00:14:03.088\nAnd we'll be reviewing only the answers\nin that practice exam, and also,\n\n240\n00:14:03.088 --> 00:14:07.632\nI'll be giving you some hints and tips\non how to start with the exam as well.\n\n241\n00:14:07.632 --> 00:14:10.591\n&gt;&gt; All right, perfect, Jo, thank you for\ntaking the time to explain that to us.\n\n242\n00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:11.830\nHope to see you soon.\n\n243\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.220\nWe've got a whole lot of\nepisodes headed your way.\n\n244\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.040\nBut for now, we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n245\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.440\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n246\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n247\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.552\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n248\n00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:26.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n249\n00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.564\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.780\nCalifornia [CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.265\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.115\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.495\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nITIL Practitioner's Theories.\n\n7\n00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:18.792\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose In this\nepisode we'll be talking about, well,\n\n8\n00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:19.757\nwhat a service is.\n\n9\n00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:24.920\nAnd with us today to help provide that\ndefinition, is ITIL expert, Jo Peacock.\n\n10\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.420\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n11\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you,\nCherokee, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.728\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well, thank you for asking.\n\n13\n00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:35.030\nI don't think I'll be able to provide that\ncomplete definition quite like you would.\n\n14\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.504\nSo I'm looking forward to seeing\nwhat you have to say about that.\n\n15\n00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:41.591\nWell you know it's what I say in\nabsolutely all of the ISO classes okay.\n\n16\n00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:49.380\nI know that everybody gets fed up with\nthis particular definition of a service.\n\n17\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.980\nAnd at this particular level,\n\n18\n00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.840\ncertainly an ISO practitioner I do not\nexpect you to have to remember this.\n\n19\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.420\nSort of off by heart.\n\n20\n00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.343\nBut I don't expect you\nto remember this at all.\n\n21\n00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:03.397\nHowever, I do expect you to remember\nthe definition of a service.\n\n22\n00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:08.980\nIn other words, what it means and\nhow that translates to you.\n\n23\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.882\nNow, if you remember,\nway back in our introduction to ITIL\n\n24\n00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:17.911\npractitioner and\nalso in our foundation recap.\n\n25\n00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:23.098\nIn those episodes and in fact if we\ngo over to our ITIL foundation shows.\n\n26\n00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:27.060\nand if you go into any of\nthe intermediate show, and the Malt show.\n\n27\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.590\nWe explore the fact that\nwith ITIL you adopt and\n\n28\n00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.110\nthen you adapt the ITIL framework.\n\n29\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.000\nSo you can adopt any process.\n\n30\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.177\nYou can adopt any definition with ITIL but\nthen you adapt it to suit yourself,\n\n31\n00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:42.532\nbecause it's just a best practice,\nit's just a framework.\n\n32\n00:01:42.532 --> 00:01:45.190\nYou have to make it your own.\n\n33\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.712\nWell when we talk about adopting and\nadapting,\n\n34\n00:01:47.712 --> 00:01:50.750\nwell that applies to the definition\nof a service as well.\n\n35\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.670\nWhat do you consider to be a service?\n\n36\n00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.270\nI'm gonna tell you that a service\nis a means of delivering value by\n\n37\n00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.010\nfacilitating the outcomes that customers\nwant to achieve without the ownership of\n\n38\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.200\nspecific costs and risks.\n\n39\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.900\nWhat on earth does that mean in plain and\nsimple English?\n\n40\n00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.010\nWe're gonna break that down because\nin order for you to adapt to this.\n\n41\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.880\nWell, you first of all have to adopt it.\n\n42\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.170\nAnd in order to adopt it,\nyou have to understand it.\n\n43\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.110\nAnd so, we're gonna break this down.\n\n44\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.940\nServices means it's delivering value.\n\n45\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.250\nYou'll notice that that\nwas in capital letters.\n\n46\n00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.910\nBecause there's a definition of value,\nquite simply, but\n\n47\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.260\nalso we need to understand\nwhat that really means.\n\n48\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.690\nTo customers, well who are our customers?\n\n49\n00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.680\nBy facilitating the outcomes,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n50\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.110\nThat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n51\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.830\nSo let's break this down, first of all.\n\n52\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.400\nA service is a means of delivering value.\n\n53\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.249\nWe have to deliver something here in\nIT that is valuable to our customers.\n\n54\n00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.865\nIt's not something that's valuable to us.\n\n55\n00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:01.000\nIt's something that's valuable to them.\n\n56\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.990\nIt says there that it's the level to which\na service meets a customer expectations.\n\n57\n00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.444\nAnd it can be managed of measured\nby how much they're willing to pay.\n\n58\n00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:13.117\nSo value is, well, it's perceived.\n\n59\n00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:15.560\nAnd we'll look at that in our next slide.\n\n60\n00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.050\nBut right at this\nparticular minute in time,\n\n61\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.270\nI want you to think of value\nas something that we achieve.\n\n62\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.390\nIt's something that they see.\n\n63\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.810\nValue is very much perceived.\n\n64\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.930\nBut we need to deliver value.\n\n65\n00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.480\nAnd we can quantify that sometimes\nin maybe, an increase in sales.\n\n66\n00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.000\nThat's value.\n\n67\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.020\nDecrease in customer complaints.\n\n68\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.820\nThat's value.\n\n69\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.320\nValue's defined by the customer.\n\n70\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.490\nAnd, as we've already said,\n\n71\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.250\nit's generally defined by how\nmuch they're willing to pay.\n\n72\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.015\nSo we call it an affordable\nmix of features.\n\n73\n00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:53.785\nBut it's an achievement of objectives,\nthat's what we wanna facilitate.\n\n74\n00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:57.825\nWe wanna facilitate their outcomes,\nthat's what we mean by value.\n\n75\n00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:00.305\nAnd value is not necessarily\nwhere we increase profit,\n\n76\n00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:05.955\nvalue maybe just about enhancing our\nposition within the marketplace.\n\n77\n00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:07.855\nOr maybe a quicker time to market.\n\n78\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.500\nOne thing that we do know about value\nis value changes all of the time.\n\n79\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.950\nWhat does that really mean?\n\n80\n00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.952\nWell what I value today is not necessarily\nwhat I'm gonna value tomorrow.\n\n81\n00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:24.843\nAnd what I value today is certainly\ngoing to be different to what I valued\n\n82\n00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:25.918\nten years ago.\n\n83\n00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:30.896\nLet's say,\nI bought an iPhone ten years ago.\n\n84\n00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:35.300\nThat's when they first came out roughly,\nthereabout.\n\n85\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.840\nNow, let's look at\nthe definition of a service.\n\n86\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.830\nAnd the services in means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes.\n\n87\n00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.975\nSo what is the outcome, then,\n\n88\n00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:49.195\nthat we want facilitated on a cell phone,\non a mobile phone?\n\n89\n00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:52.772\n&gt;&gt; To dial and\nbe able to make phone calls mobily.\n\n90\n00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:57.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, to be able to make and\nreceive phone calls, yeah that's it.\n\n91\n00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.328\nSo ten years ago, I went out and\nI bought an IPhone, by the way, I didn't.\n\n92\n00:05:01.328 --> 00:05:05.153\nBut anyway, [LAUGH] ten years ago,\nI went out and I bought an iPhone,\n\n93\n00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:07.180\ndo I perceive value in that iPhone?\n\n94\n00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.500\nWell, ten years ago, I did cuz otherwise,\nI wouldn't have bought it, right?\n\n95\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.936\nSo What did it do?\n\n96\n00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.990\nWell it facilitated an outcome.\n\n97\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.730\nThat outcome was to send and receive,\nwell make and receive calls, right?\n\n98\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.670\nSo if I gave you that iPhone right now,\n\n99\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.670\nthat very same iPhone,\nwould you perceive value you in that?\n\n100\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.823\n&gt;&gt; Jo, I just got an iPhone today, and\nI don't think I could hold a candle to\n\n101\n00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:32.270\nthe model from ten years ago\nto the one that I have today.\n\n102\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.278\nSo I wouldn't see that value.\n\n103\n00:05:34.278 --> 00:05:38.200\n&gt;&gt; But yet\nit facilitates exactly the same outcome.\n\n104\n00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.250\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n105\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.730\n&gt;&gt; So\nwhy don't you see value in that name?\n\n106\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.139\n&gt;&gt; I guess because it\ndoesn't exceed all of my, or\n\n107\n00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.220\nat least even meet all of my expectations.\n\n108\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.690\nMaybe my expectations have risen.\n\n109\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.250\nSo, I need the technology or the service\nto, rise to my expectations as well.\n\n110\n00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.439\n&gt;&gt; But are you saying then,\nthat now let's go back to this.\n\n111\n00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.010\nThe definition of a service, is it means\nof delivering value by facilitating\n\n112\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.602\nthe outcome and the outcome is to make\na phone call and to receive a phone call.\n\n113\n00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:12.018\nSo your saying that your\noutcome has change?\n\n114\n00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:12.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:15.058\n&gt;&gt; How?\n\n116\n00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:15.970\n&gt;&gt; My value.\n\n117\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.207\n[LAUGH].\n\n118\n00:06:17.207 --> 00:06:18.885\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the different.\n\n119\n00:06:18.885 --> 00:06:20.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nMy value.\n\n120\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.943\nYeah, so\nnow I expect to sends you know emails and\n\n121\n00:06:23.943 --> 00:06:28.480\nexpect to log onto the internet,\nand check my Facebook.\n\n122\n00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.232\n&gt;&gt; But has the outcome changed?\n\n123\n00:06:30.232 --> 00:06:32.672\nBecause the outcome is still sending and\nreceiving or making and\n\n124\n00:06:32.672 --> 00:06:33.631\nreceiving a phone call.\n\n125\n00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:34.644\n&gt;&gt; Right, we need to update that.\n\n126\n00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.815\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n127\n00:06:35.815 --> 00:06:37.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n128\n00:06:37.482 --> 00:06:41.764\nbut this is very important,\nbecause this is something that we have\n\n129\n00:06:41.764 --> 00:06:45.890\nto understand when we're\ndefined in the service, in IT.\n\n130\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.135\nAnd this is actually why I wanna\nhave this discussion with you.\n\n131\n00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:53.263\nBecause you see, we have to understand\nwhat the outcome is and this where we,\n\n132\n00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:54.885\nit gets lost in translation.\n\n133\n00:06:54.885 --> 00:06:56.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And it does.\n\n134\n00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:59.087\nAnd we can talk about this now because,\nlet's look at this.\n\n135\n00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:05.392\nI've just told you that the outcome of the\nphone is to make and receive phone calls.\n\n136\n00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:05.892\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n137\n00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:07.430\nSo what I'm gonna do as a service\n\n138\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.920\nprovider, is I'm just gonna give you the\nability to make and receive phone calls.\n\n139\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.625\nAnd then when I said to you has\nthe outcome changed over the last however\n\n140\n00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:16.515\nmany years.\n\n141\n00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:21.344\nAnd you said, well, kind of and not\nreally because I still needed to make and\n\n142\n00:07:21.344 --> 00:07:25.206\nreceive phone calls, but\nnow I've got extra expectation.\n\n143\n00:07:25.206 --> 00:07:29.141\nSo does that mean, then, that,\nme as a service provider,\n\n144\n00:07:29.141 --> 00:07:32.225\nthen do I have to change my expectations?\n\n145\n00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:35.265\nDo I have to change what\nI've defined as an outcome?\n\n146\n00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:40.000\nOr is it your responsibility to tell me\nthat you've changed your expectations?\n\n147\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.434\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n148\n00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:46.004\nI think looking at both sides of that, I\nthink that the provider should be able to\n\n149\n00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:50.230\noffer new improved enhancements and\nlet the customer know about it.\n\n150\n00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.305\n&gt;&gt; Right!\nBut how do we know what new and\n\n151\n00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.272\nimproved enhancements you want?\n\n152\n00:07:54.272 --> 00:07:56.846\nSome kind of market research surveys,\n\n153\n00:07:56.846 --> 00:08:00.590\nlooking at competitors' products,\nthings like that.\n\n154\n00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.860\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nI'm playing devil's advocate here, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.327\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\nJo is really putting me on the spot, guys.\n\n156\n00:08:05.327 --> 00:08:07.502\nSo we did not plan this or anything.\n\n157\n00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:08.709\nI'm like, I don't know.\n\n158\n00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:10.493\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can see,\n\n159\n00:08:10.493 --> 00:08:12.920\nI can see her fumbling here, but\nthis is exactly what I wanted.\n\n160\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.070\nNo, no, I'm just mean,\nI told her about this.\n\n161\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.485\n&gt;&gt; As long as it helps you learn\nthat I'm all for it, that's fine.\n\n162\n00:08:18.485 --> 00:08:20.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's okay,\nI told her I was mean.\n\n163\n00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:23.055\nI warned her this a long time ago.\n\n164\n00:08:23.055 --> 00:08:28.870\nThe point that we're making here\nis that actually, you know what?\n\n165\n00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.455\nThere's a disconnect\nbetween our conversation or\n\n166\n00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:36.050\nbetween the way that we\nenvisage an outcome right?\n\n167\n00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.760\nAnd yet,\nI deliberately didn't warn her about this.\n\n168\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.590\nI deliberately didn't plan this,\n\n169\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.770\nbecause this is the exact\nconversation that I want.\n\n170\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.630\nBecause this is the conversation that\nhappens in our organizations every single\n\n171\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.010\nday, or rather, this is the conversation\nthat doesn't happen in our organization.\n\n172\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.940\nI don't know what you value.\n\n173\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.500\nI don't know what outcomes you want\nfacilitated unless you tell me.\n\n174\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.130\nBut I'm not gonna wait for\nyou to come and tell me because if I do,\n\n175\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.540\nthen I'm behind the times.\n\n176\n00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.750\n&gt;&gt; Right, I may go somewhere else and\nget it by phone from someone else.\n\n177\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.536\n&gt;&gt; Because you're expecting\nme to wow you every year.\n\n178\n00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:15.182\n&gt;&gt; Of course, Jo [LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:09:15.182 --> 00:09:20.264\n&gt;&gt; With the latest and greatest,\nand whatever that is that you want,\n\n180\n00:09:20.264 --> 00:09:24.310\nyou're expecting me to wow you with that.\n\n181\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.639\nSo as an IT service provider then, I have\ngot to be proactive in defining value.\n\n182\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.250\nSo in other words, I have almost\ngot to drive your value perception.\n\n183\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.689\nThis is not down to,\nyou just tell me what you value.\n\n184\n00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:43.297\nI've gotta drive your value perception,\nbecause if I come up with the latest and\n\n185\n00:09:43.297 --> 00:09:44.190\ngreatest toy.\n\n186\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.961\nFor instance, right now,\n\n187\n00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:50.680\nthe thing that everyone's talking\nabout is the cordless charging.\n\n188\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.200\nIf I come up with the latest and greatest\ntoy that does cordless charging, for\n\n189\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.140\ninstance, then you might be wowed by that.\n\n190\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.488\nAnd you'll say, I definitely need this,\nthis is what I value.\n\n191\n00:10:00.488 --> 00:10:01.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah?\n\n192\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.440\n&gt;&gt; But then I can also guarantee\nthat in ten years' time,\n\n193\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.100\nyou won't value that anymore.\n\n194\n00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.460\nBecause something else will have happened.\n\n195\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.600\nIt's a difficulty for us.\n\n196\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.640\nAs service providers,\nit's a huge challenge for\n\n197\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.530\nus to actually get this\nvalue perception right.\n\n198\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.110\nAnd so,\ngoing back to this particular slide,\n\n199\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.140\nit talks about value offers in\naffordable mix of features.\n\n200\n00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.920\nBut value's defined by the customer,\nand yet, if I can't wait for\n\n201\n00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.750\nthe customer to come and tell me what\nthey value, then how do I get it right?\n\n202\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.956\nBecause quite often,\n\n203\n00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:36.837\nCherokee doesn't know what she wants\nuntil she sees it somewhere else.\n\n204\n00:10:36.837 --> 00:10:37.953\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is this not true though?\n\n205\n00:10:37.953 --> 00:10:39.150\n&gt;&gt; No, that's a true story.\n\n206\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.350\n&gt;&gt; Because when we're looking\nto buy a new cell phone,\n\n207\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.940\nwe don't know what we want until we\nsee somebody else with what we want.\n\n208\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.360\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot easier to say what I\ndon't want versus what I do want.\n\n209\n00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.683\nAnd especially,\nnow I know I don't want this, but hm,\n\n210\n00:10:53.683 --> 00:10:56.685\nlet me think about what I\nreally need as a feature.\n\n211\n00:10:56.685 --> 00:10:58.735\n&gt;&gt; We're all used to being customers.\n\n212\n00:10:58.735 --> 00:11:02.895\nAnd we are all used to being customers\nof any sort of service provider.\n\n213\n00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:06.485\nAnd I use cell phones as an example\nbecause let's face it, we're-\n\n214\n00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:07.615\n&gt;&gt; Most people have cell phones.\n\n215\n00:11:07.615 --> 00:11:08.823\n&gt;&gt; Everybody's got a cell phone now.\n\n216\n00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:13.116\nAnd so look at the bottom half of\nthat slide where we talk about,\n\n217\n00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:15.145\nwhat service did IT provide?\n\n218\n00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:18.190\nWhat did the service actually do,\nand what was the cost?\n\n219\n00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.070\nThis is exactly what we\nconsider as consumers and\n\n220\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.410\nas customers when we're\ngoing to buy a cell phone.\n\n221\n00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.709\nAnd the thing is that we have to remember\nthat every single one of us now,\n\n222\n00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:33.304\nwe're all use as moral customers\nof a service of some sort.\n\n223\n00:11:33.304 --> 00:11:36.860\nAnd we bring that into\nour work environment.\n\n224\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.760\nSo in our work environment,\nwe might be users or\n\n225\n00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.620\ncustomers of the IT service itself.\n\n226\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.762\nBut we're going to bring those\nsame values into work, so\n\n227\n00:11:46.762 --> 00:11:48.796\nwe expect to be able to influence IT.\n\n228\n00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:53.768\nAnd the other thing that we do as well is\nthat we expect to be able to tell IT what\n\n229\n00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:56.330\nthey should be providing.\n\n230\n00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:01.120\nWe don't wait for IT to come and tell us,\nwe'll actually go to IT, and we say to IT,\n\n231\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.670\nI want one of these.\n\n232\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.130\nI want a tablet,\nI want something that's lightweight.\n\n233\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.220\nI want to be able to do this.\n\n234\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.950\nWe don't wait for IT to come to us.\n\n235\n00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.890\nSo when I asked you the question about,\nare you going to tell me what you want,\n\n236\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.863\nor are you going to wait for\nme to give it to you?\n\n237\n00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:19.561\nYou said you were gonna wait for\n\n238\n00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:22.990\nme to offer something to you\nthat was going to wow you.\n\n239\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.360\nThat was your expectation.\n\n240\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.430\nIf you have to come to me with a list\nof demands or a list of requests,\n\n241\n00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.490\nhow much value do you see in\nthe service that I provide?\n\n242\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.254\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, Jo,\n\n243\n00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:38.785\nI'd feel like you might not be doing your\njob if I have to tell you how to do it.\n\n244\n00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:43.170\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we had, in service strategy,\n\n245\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.710\na process called business\nrelationship management.\n\n246\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.240\nBusiness relationship management\nis key to this value definition.\n\n247\n00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.435\nBecause business relationship\nmanagement should be\n\n248\n00:12:53.435 --> 00:12:56.133\ndoing exactly what\nCherokee just asked for.\n\n249\n00:12:56.133 --> 00:13:01.010\nAnd business relationship management\nshould be recommending ways to wow our\n\n250\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.840\ncustomers.\n\n251\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.898\nWe should know our organization so\nwell that we understand not only what they\n\n252\n00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:11.981\nvalue right now, but\nwhat they're going to value in the future.\n\n253\n00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:16.673\nIt's an interesting point, and\nit's worth having this discussion.\n\n254\n00:13:16.673 --> 00:13:19.867\nBecause that's what I need\nto get to the bottom of,\n\n255\n00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:22.020\nis that as an IT service provider,\n\n256\n00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:27.170\nmost IT service providers will wait until\nCherokee comes and asks for something.\n\n257\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.440\nBut you've just demonstrated that\nyou don't perceive as much value if\n\n258\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.950\nyou've gotta ask for something than\nif I've offered you something and\n\n259\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.730\nI'm going to wow you with that.\n\n260\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.970\nThe other thing is, that once you\nthink you know everything about IT,\n\n261\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.780\nlet me tell you, lady, you don't.\n\n262\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.661\nOur business users, I don't expect\nthem to know everything about IT.\n\n263\n00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:59.000\nIf Cherokee has to come to me and say,\nI want this, then it's kind of too late.\n\n264\n00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.350\nCuz now, as a service provider,\nI'm on the back foot.\n\n265\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.900\nI'm already not meeting her expectations\ncuz I've not been proactive enough.\n\n266\n00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.606\nBut also, I now have to play catch up, and\nI might not have the technology to hand or\n\n267\n00:14:15.606 --> 00:14:19.858\nthe infrastructure to be able\nto play catch up for Cherokee.\n\n268\n00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:22.605\nSo it might be another two years before\nshe actually gets what she's asked for,\n\n269\n00:14:22.605 --> 00:14:24.204\nby which time,\nthat's gonna be way too late.\n\n270\n00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:27.949\nSo, value then, it's a perception, and\n\n271\n00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:32.536\nwe've got to be proactive\nabout delivering value.\n\n272\n00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:37.731\nHowever, we've also gotta\nunderstand that in the real world,\n\n273\n00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:41.880\nwe have to have an element\nof reactiveness as well.\n\n274\n00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.090\nBecause sometimes,\nour business changes direction.\n\n275\n00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.110\nSometimes our organization will ask us for\n\n276\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.170\nthings that we need to be\nreactive in providing.\n\n277\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.270\nSo, value then is a mixture\nof the outcomes achieved\n\n278\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:02.670\nand the preferences that a customer\nmay have and their perception.\n\n279\n00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.170\nSo it's not just about the ability\nto send and receive email.\n\n280\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.005\nIt's not just about the preferences\nthat a customer may have.\n\n281\n00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:15.178\nSome customers have preferences\nin terms of particular suppliers,\n\n282\n00:15:15.178 --> 00:15:19.570\nparticular service providers\nthat they like to use.\n\n283\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.580\nBut it's also about the perception.\n\n284\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.320\nAnd look at what it says\nin perception there.\n\n285\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.940\nIt says emotion, feeling,\nit's about experiences as well.\n\n286\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.140\nAn outcome is the intended or the actual\nresult of carrying out an activity.\n\n287\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.780\nIt's that making a phone call,\nit's that receiving a phone call.\n\n288\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:43.095\nSo what I mentioned is that\nwe've gotta be proactive.\n\n289\n00:15:43.095 --> 00:15:49.150\nAnd we have, as an IT service provider,\ngot to wow our business.\n\n290\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:54.902\nWe've got to wow our customer, which means\nWe have to have a marketing mindset.\n\n291\n00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:56.100\nWho's our business?\n\n292\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.830\nWho is our customer?\n\n293\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.770\nWhat do they actually value?\n\n294\n00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.850\nWe just had a very very brief conversation\nthere about what Cherokee values.\n\n295\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.295\nAnd I still don't really know\nmuch about what Cherokee values,\n\n296\n00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:09.522\ncuz I kind of bullied her\ninto it a little bit.\n\n297\n00:16:09.522 --> 00:16:12.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I kinda just said to her that,\n\n298\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.688\nyeah, you just wanna make phone calls,\ndon't you?\n\n299\n00:16:15.688 --> 00:16:20.890\n[LAUGH] But ultimately I'm going to,\nas a business relationship manager,\n\n300\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.000\nI'm gonna sit down with Cherokee and\nI'm gonna work out how she works.\n\n301\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.970\nRemember demand management and\nthose patterns of business activity.\n\n302\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:34.230\nI'm gonna sit down and I'm going to find\nout what her needs are, what she values.\n\n303\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.350\nI'm going to try and understand what\nit is that she's trying to achieve\n\n304\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.340\nin the long-term with our organization.\n\n305\n00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.890\nI need to understand the bottom question,\nnow.\n\n306\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.630\nWhy are our services\na value to the customer?\n\n307\n00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.614\nRemember, customers,\nthey don't buy services.\n\n308\n00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.620\nThey buy fulfillment of a specific need.\n\n309\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.863\nYou don't go out and\nbuy a new phone just to play a game.\n\n310\n00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:03.970\nYou go out and you buy a new\nphone to make the phone call.\n\n311\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.770\nAnd you have to understand\nwhat those outcomes are.\n\n312\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.285\nBut then as we've already discussed,\noutcomes can change.\n\n313\n00:17:11.285 --> 00:17:15.250\nWhat started off as an outcome,\nhowever many years ago when the iPhone 1\n\n314\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.470\nfirst came out, which was that ability\nto make and receive a phone call.\n\n315\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.040\nThat's changed.\n\n316\n00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.530\nAnd now,\nwe want the ability to play games.\n\n317\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.950\nWe want the ability to navigate places.\n\n318\n00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.930\nWe want the ability to detect the weather.\n\n319\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:35.310\nWe want the ability to be able to, I don't\nknow, it reads your messages to you.\n\n320\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.850\nYou wanna communicate by wearable devices,\nfor instance.\n\n321\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:46.140\nWe want that ability to do a lot\nmore that we did ten years ago.\n\n322\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.870\nSo outcome's change,\nvalue changes overtime.\n\n323\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.842\nSo the service is a means\nof delivering value,\n\n324\n00:17:54.842 --> 00:17:56.970\nthat's a tricky one because it changes.\n\n325\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.650\nBy facilitating outcomes and again,\n\n326\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.480\nthat's tricky because they can change too,\nand expectations change.\n\n327\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:14.020\nValue is also defined by the ability\nto deliver both utility and warranty.\n\n328\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.100\nUtility is,\ndoes it do what it's supposed to do?\n\n329\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.310\nDoes it make and receive a phone call?\n\n330\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.606\nAnd then warranty is it\nis available enough?\n\n331\n00:18:22.606 --> 00:18:24.670\nDoes it have enough capacity?\n\n332\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.180\nDoes it have enough continuity?\n\n333\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.710\nIs it secure enough?\n\n334\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.450\nAnd let me think about this in\nterms of our cell phones then.\n\n335\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.530\nSo it's not just enough for\nit to make and receive a phone call.\n\n336\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.060\nYou wanna know that you're not\nbeing listened into, right?\n\n337\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.581\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n338\n00:18:39.581 --> 00:18:40.682\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n339\n00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:44.330\nYou wanna know that you're not gonna\nhave to redial five times, yes?\n\n340\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz I expect it to make those\ncalls that I'm paying for, right?\n\n341\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you wanna know that you're\ngonna have enough service, wherever it is,\n\n342\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.120\nthat you are.\n\n343\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.520\n&gt;&gt; To establish and\nmaintain my communication, yes.\n\n344\n00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.714\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you need it available enough.\n\n345\n00:18:57.714 --> 00:19:01.511\nAnd there's nothing worse than\ntrying to download something, or\n\n346\n00:19:01.511 --> 00:19:05.712\ntrying to take a picture and being told\n[LAUGH] all right that you don't have\n\n347\n00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:10.278\nenough capacity to be able to use your\ncamera at that particular moment in time!\n\n348\n00:19:10.278 --> 00:19:11.118\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n\n349\n00:19:11.118 --> 00:19:12.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yet we think of, and\n\n350\n00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.890\nthis is the reason why I made a point\nearlier, we think of an outcome as just\n\n351\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.690\nbeing the ability to make a phone call and\nreceive a phone call.\n\n352\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.222\nBut yet, there's warranty aspects that\nhave gotta be brought into that as well,\n\n353\n00:19:24.222 --> 00:19:29.100\nbecause it's not just good enough\nto be able to make a phone call and\n\n354\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.370\nreceive a phone call intermittently.\n\n355\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.820\nIt has to be available enough.\n\n356\n00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.670\nIt has to have enough capacity, and\n\n357\n00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:40.260\nit has to be continuous, and have\nthe relevant amount of security as well.\n\n358\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.440\nSo both of these has to exist in order for\n\n359\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.940\na customer to perceive value,\nwhich reminds me, who's the customer?\n\n360\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.440\nWhat is a customer?\n\n361\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.930\nA customer is somebody in\nideal terms who has influence\n\n362\n00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.650\nover whether the money is spent.\n\n363\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.220\nIt's not necessarily the person\nwith the bank account.\n\n364\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.390\nIt could be a call center manager.\n\n365\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.838\nSomebody who has influence over\nwhether the money is spent.\n\n366\n00:20:07.838 --> 00:20:11.700\nA customer buys, a user uses.\n\n367\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.733\nSo, Cherokee let me ask you a question.\n\n368\n00:20:17.846 --> 00:20:21.726\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's just say,\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:20:21.726 --> 00:20:22.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:20:22.307 --> 00:20:24.619\n&gt;&gt; I'm Frightening the life out of her\n\n371\n00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:25.164\ntoday.\n\n372\n00:20:25.164 --> 00:20:26.950\nI'll be nice to you then.\n\n373\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.804\nI'm gonna take you and I'm gonna\nbuy you coffee after this episode.\n\n374\n00:20:29.804 --> 00:20:30.961\nHow does that sound?\n&gt;&gt; That's so sweet.\n\n375\n00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:32.630\nThat sounds amazing, Jo.\n\n376\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.787\n&gt;&gt; And I'll buy our director one as well,\njust cuz I'm feeling generous.\n\n377\n00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:37.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n378\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:42.130\n&gt;&gt; So when we go to the coffee shop,\nthe people at the coffee shop,\n\n379\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.370\nare they interested in what\nI think as a customer?\n\n380\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.650\nOr are they interested in what you think\nas the people who are drinking the coffee?\n\n381\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is kind of tricky\nquestion Jo because I remember\n\n382\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.880\nthe definition of customer versus user.\n\n383\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.800\nSo customer, you're the customer,\nyou're paying for our drinks.\n\n384\n00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n385\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.673\n&gt;&gt; I'm the user,\nI'm consuming the service if you will.-\n\n386\n00:21:03.673 --> 00:21:04.318\n&gt;&gt; Or drinking-\n\n387\n00:21:04.318 --> 00:21:05.016\n&gt;&gt; Drinking the drink, yeah.\n\n388\n00:21:05.016 --> 00:21:07.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n389\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.434\n&gt;&gt; So I think that,\n\n390\n00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:12.782\nof course they're gonna be interested\nin your opinion because you're\n\n391\n00:21:12.782 --> 00:21:17.346\nthe with the wallet, but they also may\nbe interested in my opinion because I\n\n392\n00:21:17.346 --> 00:21:20.037\nsomewhat influence your decision as well.\n\n393\n00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:20.633\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n394\n00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:21.473\n&gt;&gt; So how did I do?\n\n395\n00:21:21.473 --> 00:21:22.472\nYay.\n\n396\n00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:23.901\n[APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee's been listening,\n\n397\n00:21:23.901 --> 00:21:26.399\nall right,\nshe's been listening to all our episodes.\n\n398\n00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:29.100\nI can tell you now because that's so\nvery true.\n\n399\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.482\nAs a service provider, that coffee shop\nis not just interested in my opinion.\n\n400\n00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:38.440\nYou see, what I'm interested in, and\nlet's go back to that previous slide.\n\n401\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.630\nWhat I'm interested in is the utility.\n\n402\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:45.330\nI have a cup here, and I'm gonna hand\nthat in to the people at the coffee shop,\n\n403\n00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:49.630\nand I'm gonna say fill that\nwith coffee for Cherokee.\n\n404\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.870\nI will get one for our director,\nTaylor, one as well.\n\n405\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.270\nAnd I'll say, just fill that with coffee.\n\n406\n00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.630\nAll I'm interested in is\nthat this cup is full.\n\n407\n00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.720\nThat's all I'm interested in.\n\n408\n00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.700\nWhereas Cherokee and Taylor,\nthey're interested in what it tastes like.\n\n409\n00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.760\nSo I'm interested in the utility but\nthey're interested more in the warranty.\n\n410\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.760\nAnd so what's gonna happen is though\nif that warranty isn't up to par,\n\n411\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.821\nif that warranty is not great,\nif the coffee tastes awful,\n\n412\n00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:20.850\nthen they're gonna say to me\nnext time we're not going there.\n\n413\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.750\nWe're going somewhere else, we're\ngoing to use another service provider.\n\n414\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.350\nSo as a service provider we put emphasize\non the customer because the customer\n\n415\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.020\nis the person who buys, but\nultimately we still have to keep our users\n\n416\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.880\nhappy as well because they\ninfluence the customer.\n\n417\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.585\nThe customer's the person who agrees\nthose service level targets, but\n\n418\n00:22:42.585 --> 00:22:44.061\nthe user influences.\n\n419\n00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:48.535\nNow the outcome, well,\nwe know what an outcome is of a service.\n\n420\n00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:50.855\nIt's something that we want to achieve.\n\n421\n00:22:50.855 --> 00:22:53.860\nIt's an undertaking, it's a process.\n\n422\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.795\nIt's delivering a service.\n\n423\n00:22:55.795 --> 00:22:57.605\nIt's something that we want to achieve.\n\n424\n00:22:57.605 --> 00:22:59.145\nIt's not the same as an output.\n\n425\n00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:02.865\nAn output is a tangible thing,\nlike a piece of paper or a report.\n\n426\n00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:06.185\nThe outcome is, well,\nit's doing something.\n\n427\n00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:07.547\nIt's achieving something.\n\n428\n00:23:09.401 --> 00:23:14.405\nSo the outcome to the coffee shop,\nwell, that's a coffee obviously.\n\n429\n00:23:14.405 --> 00:23:18.447\nBut I'm not gonna be the one that\njudges how nice that tastes,\n\n430\n00:23:18.447 --> 00:23:20.790\nbecause I'm not from around here.\n\n431\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.425\nAnd to me the coffee wouldn't taste\nthat great anyway, maybe, perhaps,\n\n432\n00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:27.498\nalthough you wouldn't think it,\njudging by how much I drink.\n\n433\n00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:30.724\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So we've looked at then,\n\n434\n00:23:30.724 --> 00:23:34.040\na service as a means of delivering value.\n\n435\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.290\nWe've looked at the concept\nof value by facilitating\n\n436\n00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.150\noutcomes by making sure that\neverybody's got a coffee.\n\n437\n00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.822\nOr that we can make the phone call and\nwe can receive an outcome.\n\n438\n00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:46.797\nSo it's outcomes that\ncustomers want to achieve.\n\n439\n00:23:46.797 --> 00:23:51.087\nBut without the ownership\nof specific Costs and risk,\n\n440\n00:23:51.087 --> 00:23:56.225\nremember we looked value as being\nan affordable mix of features.\n\n441\n00:23:56.225 --> 00:24:00.016\nSo here we want to ensure\nthat we understand not only\n\n442\n00:24:00.016 --> 00:24:03.277\nthe total cost of ownership for\na service but\n\n443\n00:24:03.277 --> 00:24:08.053\nalso what's the return on investment for\nany service would be.\n\n444\n00:24:08.053 --> 00:24:11.083\nIf I don't perceive something\nas being valued for\n\n445\n00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.100\nmoney, then I'm not gonna pay for it.\n\n446\n00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.640\nIf I'm gonna walk into somewhere and\nthey're gonna charge me $10 for\n\n447\n00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.810\na cup of coffee,\nI don't care how much you entail or\n\n448\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.705\nlike that coffee you're not getting one.\n\n449\n00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:26.520\nBecuase I don't perceive\nthat as being affordable.\n\n450\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.080\nIt's not an affordable mix of\nfeatures it's not value for money.\n\n451\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:36.110\nSo, in order to anticipate\nthe total cost of ownership then\n\n452\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.810\nthe service provider has to know all\nof the things about the support cost,\n\n453\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:45.300\nthe time, the staffing cost etc, but we're\nnot going to pass that onto the customer.\n\n454\n00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.520\nThat's why we say without the ownership\nof specific costs and risks.\n\n455\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.270\nWe don't transfer the ownership\nof the specific costs.\n\n456\n00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.500\nImagine if you went into a coffee shop and\n\n457\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.600\nyou saw the price of coffee of being,\nsay $1.50.\n\n458\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.797\nBut then they asked you for an extra\n$0.25 for the flavor syrup that you want,\n\n459\n00:25:05.797 --> 00:25:09.797\nand an extra $0.50 for\nsome whipped cream on the top.\n\n460\n00:25:09.797 --> 00:25:12.223\nAnd by the way, if you wanted, sorry?\n\n461\n00:25:12.223 --> 00:25:12.830\n&gt;&gt; The cup too.\n\n462\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthey want an extra $0.10 for the cup.\n\n463\n00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.892\nAnd if you want it hot,\nthen it's gonna cost an extra $0.20.\n\n464\n00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.884\nIt gets a bit silly.\n\n465\n00:25:19.884 --> 00:25:21.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n466\n00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.940\n&gt;&gt; Right and we don't do this\nwith our IT services as well.\n\n467\n00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.760\nCan you imagine if we tried to charge for\nsay an email service and\n\n468\n00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.920\nthen we tried to charge for all right\nwell I'm gonna charge you this for\n\n469\n00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.530\nthe laptop and then I'm gonna\ncharge you this for the license.\n\n470\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:34.940\nOr I'm gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Per message even maybe.\n\n471\n00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.376\n&gt;&gt; Sorry?\n&gt;&gt; Per message or even per character.\n\n472\n00:25:36.376 --> 00:25:38.880\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nI'm gonna charge you per message.\n\n473\n00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.550\nI'm gonna charge for the ten minutes that\nit's gonna take that support person to\n\n474\n00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.200\ninstall that on your laptop and then\nI'm going to charge you for the gas or\n\n475\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.990\nthe petrol that's involved in\ngetting that laptop to you.\n\n476\n00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.710\nAnd then I'm gonna charge you per message,\nand I'm going to charge you every time you\n\n477\n00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.835\nreceive something, and I'm gonna charge\nyou every time you update your calendar.\n\n478\n00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:04.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a headache.\n\n479\n00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.235\nAnd it's not even a headache just for\nthe customer.\n\n480\n00:26:06.235 --> 00:26:08.744\nCan you imagine how much\nof a headache that is for\n\n481\n00:26:08.744 --> 00:26:11.980\nthe service provider\nto even work that out?\n\n482\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.490\nAs a general rule of thumb,\nif it's gonna cost us more\n\n483\n00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.800\nIn thinking power and in time to\nactually work out specific costs and\n\n484\n00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.980\nwe certainly don't wanna be\ntransferring them because,\n\n485\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.760\nwe're not actually going to\nget any benefit from that.\n\n486\n00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.476\nIn other words we're not going to\nmake a return on that investment of\n\n487\n00:26:31.476 --> 00:26:32.644\ntime in itself.\n\n488\n00:26:32.644 --> 00:26:38.930\nAnd it's exactly the same with risks and\nwhen we're talking about risks, well.\n\n489\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.130\nThe risk is the uncertainty\nof an outcome and\n\n490\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.690\nthe risk to an IT service are risks\nlike potential network failures.\n\n491\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.930\nIdentifying single points of failure,\npotential licensing failures,\n\n492\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.980\npotential utilization failures.\n\n493\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.887\nAgain, we're not gonna transfer\nthose to the customers,\n\n494\n00:26:56.887 --> 00:26:59.700\nbecause we don't expect our customers and\n\n495\n00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.558\nour users to have that specific knowledge,\non how to handle those risks.\n\n496\n00:27:04.558 --> 00:27:08.793\nSo I should define in a service is\nnot as easy as you might think.\n\n497\n00:27:08.793 --> 00:27:14.274\nThe service definition needs to detail\nthe customer, the preferred value or\n\n498\n00:27:14.274 --> 00:27:19.262\nperceived value, the outcomes\nfacilitated and the costs and risks.\n\n499\n00:27:19.262 --> 00:27:25.710\nThink VOCR, value, outcome,\ncustomer and risks.\n\n500\n00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.416\nAll of these need to be articulated, and\nof course in our service portfolio in\n\n501\n00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:36.095\nconjunction with service level management,\nthis is where we articulate a service.\n\n502\n00:27:36.095 --> 00:27:41.203\nBut it evolves over time, service level\nmanagement and service transition will\n\n503\n00:27:41.203 --> 00:27:46.400\nhelp that service definition evolve\nover time, and it's agreed in the SLA.\n\n504\n00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.980\nAnd then CSI comes along and\nmakes sure that that outcome is\n\n505\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.370\ncontinually aligned to the business vision\nand therefore the service description and\n\n506\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:01.460\ndefinition is continually\naligned to the business vision.\n\n507\n00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.684\nRemember Cherokee changed her mind.\n\n508\n00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:07.430\nShe decided that she didn't just\nwanna make and receive a phone call.\n\n509\n00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:12.080\nShe's now got way too many other\nexpectations on that cell phone.\n\n510\n00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.490\nThat's what CSI is there for.\n\n511\n00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.720\nSo, here is an example of a service.\n\n512\n00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.220\nAnd a virtual learning environment.\n\n513\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.030\nThat would be the title of the service.\n\n514\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.560\nThis would be a service definition.\n\n515\n00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:28.558\nIt increases the speed,\nthere is your value,\n\n516\n00:28:28.558 --> 00:28:32.889\nin which experts can create and\npublish knowledge.\n\n517\n00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:35.360\nThere is your outcome.\n\n518\n00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.560\nWith unhindered access to\nstandardized templates,\n\n519\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.750\nstreamlined publishing,\nunhindered there is your risk okay.\n\n520\n00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.010\nBut also we've got our customer definition\nthere because we said in which experts\n\n521\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.830\ncan create.\n\n522\n00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:57.770\nAnd then what we're actually wanting to\nachieve is facilitating customer sales.\n\n523\n00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.410\nAgain another value statement.\n\n524\n00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:07.370\nThis particular definition\nof a service has a value.\n\n525\n00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.600\nWe talk about increasing\nthe speed in which they can\n\n526\n00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.300\npublish knowledge there's your value.\n\n527\n00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.820\nYou've got your outcomes,\n\n528\n00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.650\nwhich are thereby facilitating\ncustomer sales they're your outcomes.\n\n529\n00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.230\nAnd then your costs, I've not\nmentioned in this particular one, but\n\n530\n00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.550\nwe mentioned our risks unhindered access.\n\n531\n00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.410\nThey're are risks.\n\n532\n00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.892\nSo we know who are customers are,\nthey're are experts.\n\n533\n00:29:32.892 --> 00:29:34.241\nWe've got our value,\n\n534\n00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:38.400\nwhich is our increasing speed in\nwhich we can publish knowledge.\n\n535\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.897\nAnd then we've got our outcomes,\nwhich is facilitating customer sells.\n\n536\n00:29:41.897 --> 00:29:47.475\nAnd we've got our risks,\nwhich is the unhindered access.\n\n537\n00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:52.787\nYou see I look at that and I think\nto myself, that's a well articulated\n\n538\n00:29:52.787 --> 00:29:58.112\ndefinition of a service,\nbecause it mentions all of those elements.\n\n539\n00:29:58.112 --> 00:30:03.100\nBut I wonder how many, and in fact I can't\ntell you how many services I've seen\n\n540\n00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.956\ndefined in the service portfolio\nthat simply turn around and\n\n541\n00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:10.370\nsay, email, the ability to send and\nreceive email.\n\n542\n00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.813\nThat doesn't tell me anything.\n\n543\n00:30:12.813 --> 00:30:17.501\nA service definition has to\ninclude a value statement,\n\n544\n00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:23.088\nthe outcome that's being facilitated,\nwho our customer is, and\n\n545\n00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:30.093\nany reference to any costs and risks that\nare being avoided or that we are assuming.\n\n546\n00:30:30.093 --> 00:30:32.722\nSo now, at this point in time, and\n\n547\n00:30:32.722 --> 00:30:38.165\nas I've already mentioned in our\nintroduction to ITIL practitioner,\n\n548\n00:30:38.165 --> 00:30:42.972\nwe now, are going to ask you to\ndownload your material from this\n\n549\n00:30:42.972 --> 00:30:47.800\nparticular show and\nto undertake the excercise that you have.\n\n550\n00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.419\nAnd do you have an exercise that looks\nat the definition of the service?\n\n551\n00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:56.797\nNow, as with any of our other ITIL shows,\nbut this is very,\n\n552\n00:30:56.797 --> 00:31:00.049\nvery important with this particular show.\n\n553\n00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:04.633\nI'm gonna ask you if you have any\nquestions or you have any feedback,\n\n554\n00:31:04.633 --> 00:31:07.398\nthen please come back\nto us on our forum and\n\n555\n00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:11.050\nI'll be happy to help you and\nguide you wherever I can.\n\n556\n00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:17.922\nThe ITIL practitioner qualification\nrelies very heavily on\n\n557\n00:31:17.922 --> 00:31:21.388\nyour ability to perform these exercises.\n\n558\n00:31:21.388 --> 00:31:26.488\nNow, Cherokee asked in our\nintroduction episode whether we\n\n559\n00:31:26.488 --> 00:31:31.600\ncan maybe skip over the exercises\nbecause well we're okay.\n\n560\n00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.340\nWe've got our ITIL expert and\nwe're doing okay so far.\n\n561\n00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:40.780\nThe fact is what we're doing here is\nwe're testing your understanding and\n\n562\n00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.320\nyour ability to be able to\nadapt the ITIL framework.\n\n563\n00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:49.250\nAnd I can tell you now that there\nis a direct correlation between\n\n564\n00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.950\nthe level of involvement in\nthe exercises and your exam results.\n\n565\n00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.454\nSo, whilst I can't force you to do any,\nI'm not gonna stand over you, [LAUGH] And\n\n566\n00:31:58.454 --> 00:32:00.635\nforce you to do any of your exercises.\n\n567\n00:32:00.635 --> 00:32:02.010\n&gt;&gt; But, I wanna pass!\n\n568\n00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:06.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, you wanna pass then if you want\nto pass then I'm afraid the exercises\n\n569\n00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.870\nare there for you and I will be asking\nyou to perform these exercises.\n\n570\n00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.990\nAnd as I said we're\navailable on the forum so\n\n571\n00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.080\nif you have any queries please,\nplease come back to us.\n\n572\n00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.451\n&gt;&gt; And you know, Jo, I've seen a lot of\ndefinitions and studied terminology for\n\n573\n00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:25.640\nawhile, but I think this is the most\nin-depth definition I have ever seen.\n\n574\n00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.368\nThe way you broke that down for us so\nI really understand, what a service is\n\n575\n00:32:29.368 --> 00:32:32.810\nnow thank you for that, and\nthank you for joining us but stay tuned.\n\n576\n00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.017\nWe're just getting started here.\n\n577\n00:32:34.017 --> 00:32:36.098\nWe have a lot of informaiton\nheaded your way.\n\n578\n00:32:36.098 --> 00:32:37.933\nWe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n579\n00:32:37.933 --> 00:32:39.768\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n580\n00:32:39.768 --> 00:32:40.685\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n581\n00:32:40.685 --> 00:32:43.266\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n582\n00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:49.261\n[MUSIC]\n\n583\n00:32:49.261 --> 00:32:52.472\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.947\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and gentleman\nto your ITIL practitioner series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.510\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.840\n&gt;&gt; In this episode we'll be taking\na look at the CSI approach and no,\n\n8\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.490\nwe're not talking about the show\nCrime Scene Investigations.\n\n9\n00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.420\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n10\n00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.488\nBut you know what?\n\n11\n00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:32.190\nWe have ITIL expert Joe Peacock in\nstudios today to help us with our CSI.\n\n12\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.923\nSo Joe, what are we gonna be looking at?\n\n13\n00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:36.480\n&gt;&gt; It might feel like\nCrime Scene Investigation by the time-\n\n14\n00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is true.\n\n15\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.615\nShe's gonna kill me.\n\n16\n00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm doing fine, Cherokee.\n\n17\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.940\nHow are you?\n\n18\n00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.565\n&gt;&gt; I don't know yet.\n\n19\n00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:45.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ask at the end of the show.\n\n20\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.010\nYeah, ask at the end of the show,\nhow about that?\n\n21\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.580\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe're gonna do an approach to CSI.\n\n22\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're gonna look\n\n23\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.855\nat first of all,\nan approach to crime scene investigation.\n\n24\n00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna\n\n25\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.380\ngo into the forensics today.\n\n26\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.760\nNo, actually what we're\ngonna be looking at is,\n\n27\n00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.340\nwe're gonna start off by just doing\na refresher on the CSI approach.\n\n28\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.000\nWhich is something that everybody\ncovered in your CSI show.\n\n29\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.320\nWe did this in a lot more depth, and\n\n30\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.130\nalso in our foundation recap as\nwell we looked at CSI approach.\n\n31\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.380\nAnd if you're not familiar\nwith the CSI approach,\n\n32\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.150\nI would invite you to go to the CSI show\nand take a look at our approaches and\n\n33\n00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.300\ntechniques and take a look at the episode\nwhere we covered the CSI approach.\n\n34\n00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.210\nIt's gonna be incredibly important.\n\n35\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.810\nBut, again as I've already said in a lot\nof the previous episodes to do with IT\n\n36\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.470\npractitioner, we are adopting and we're\nadopting ITIL in this particular show.\n\n37\n00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.190\nWhich means that there's an understanding\nthat you know the actual techniques and\n\n38\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.020\nthat you know the processes,\n\n39\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.220\nbecause you can't adapt them\nunless you actually know them.\n\n40\n00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.790\nSo I'll say that and\n\n41\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.050\nI'm gonna sorta say that as a warning\nto all of our episodes, really, that\n\n42\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.790\nwe've reached an understanding now that\nyou know this material inside and out.\n\n43\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.660\nAnd what we're doing is\nwe're pulling it apart.\n\n44\n00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.050\nAnd we're actually analyzing it.\n\n45\n00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.940\nAnd we're applying this particular\ninformation, so here we are at the CSI\n\n46\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.400\napproach and you'll see here a slide that\nshould be very, very familiar to you.\n\n47\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.859\nCSI approach is already know it's\nan iterative, a repeatable approach for\n\n48\n00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.400\ncontinual improvement.\n\n49\n00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.119\nNot continuous but continual improvement.\n\n50\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.280\nNow we go over in all of our previous\nsort of CSI episodes the difference\n\n51\n00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.640\nbetween continuous and continual and like\nI say, I'm not going to repeat myself.\n\n52\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.685\nThis is exactly why we are here\nat practitioner level,\n\n53\n00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:48.045\nwe're pulling it all apart, okay.\n\n54\n00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:50.330\nSo were not gonna go over\nthe definitions again.\n\n55\n00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.894\nSo what I want to do now is I\nwant to go through each step.\n\n56\n00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:58.199\nAnd I just want to remind you that\neverything that we do in ITIL,\n\n57\n00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:03.085\nabsolutely everything, is an improvement\nto our current situation.\n\n58\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.690\nNow, I'll have people that have\nsaid things to me like yes, but\n\n59\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.330\nwhen we're doing stress-testing\nwe're trying to break something.\n\n60\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.610\nYes, in the test environment so that it\ndoesn't fail in the live environment.\n\n61\n00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.990\nIn other words, we're trying to\nimprove our live environment.\n\n62\n00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.560\nWe might be stripping out\nfunctionality of a particular service.\n\n63\n00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.130\nWell, yes we do that to align ourselves\nwith the needs of the organization,\n\n64\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.350\nbecause we've been asked to do so.\n\n65\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.460\nSo that is an improvement,\neverything that we do is to improve.\n\n66\n00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.710\nWe need to improve in an iterative way.\n\n67\n00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.770\nWe need to improve in a visible way but\n\n68\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.720\nin a way that we can\nbuild on our improvement.\n\n69\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.560\nNow, a CSI approach starts off with\nunderstanding what our vision is.\n\n70\n00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.780\nAnd that's not just our vision for IT,\nbut that's the organizational vision.\n\n71\n00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.035\nAnd, of course, if we go back to service\nstrategy and we go back to the strategy\n\n72\n00:04:05.035 --> 00:04:08.903\nlifecycle phase, we looked at the three\ntypes of strategy that we had,\n\n73\n00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:12.853\nthe run the business, the grow\nthe business, transform the business.\n\n74\n00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.970\nAnd we also looked at why we would\nhave those types of strategy.\n\n75\n00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.665\nNow, again, this is very important and I\nknow that I've mentioned this in previous\n\n76\n00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:28.635\nepisodes and Cherokee has asked me in\nprevious episodes as well about the exam\n\n77\n00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:34.220\npass rate on this particular exam and\nabout how easy it is to fail this exam.\n\n78\n00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.960\nWell, it's very easy to fail this exam\nbecause if you were to look at this from\n\n79\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.170\nthe perspective of just looking\nat the slides and going yes,\n\n80\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.130\nI understand all of this.\n\n81\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.670\nAnd well, the exam is going to test you\non everything you think you understand.\n\n82\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.690\nSo the exam is actually going\nto ask you the question\n\n83\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.920\nas to when it would be appropriate to\nuse any three of those strategies.\n\n84\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.070\nWell, first of all you need to know what\nthe strategies are and secondly, you need\n\n85\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.900\nto know when it would be appropriate\nto use any three of those strategies.\n\n86\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.850\nSo when, if we've got three strategies of\nrun the business, grow the business, and\n\n87\n00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.430\ntransform the business, I'm going to\nassume though in service strategy,\n\n88\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.740\nyou covered when to use each one.\n\n89\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.560\nAnd that's a huge big assumption,\n\n90\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.550\nbecause you see, I've got two options\nhere when it comes to ITIL practitioner.\n\n91\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.410\nI could go on for absolutely everything,\nwhich then leaves this no different to\n\n92\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.500\na mount course, other than the fact\nthat we're pulling it all apart or\n\n93\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.850\nI can do exactly what we do\nwhen we compile exam questions.\n\n94\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.410\nAnd I can say, okay, I'm going to\nunderstand and assume that you know all of\n\n95\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.980\nthis and therefore we're\nnot going to talk about it.\n\n96\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.400\nSo that's what I'm going to do.\n\n97\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.080\nI'm going to assume that\nyou know all of these and\n\n98\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.020\ntherefore you don't need\nme to highlight this.\n\n99\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.850\nAnd we're not really gonna\ndiscuss this too much.\n\n100\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.070\nOther than we're going to say while you\nneed to understand your organizational\n\n101\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.310\nvision and you need to translate\nthat into a vision for IT.\n\n102\n00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.960\nBut it's really important and it's gonna\nbe brought into your questions and\n\n103\n00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.350\ntherefore, it's gonna be\nbrought into your exercises.\n\n104\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.390\nIt's important that you know\nwhy an organization will use\n\n105\n00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.420\neach type of strategy and when and\nhow long for and for what purpose.\n\n106\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.550\nBecause it's only by our\nasking those questions and\n\n107\n00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.520\nby having the answer to those questions,\n\n108\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.690\nthen you can understand how we can measure\nwhether we're achieving our vision.\n\n109\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.050\nSo a strategy, our vision, would be to\nrun the business or grow the business or\n\n110\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.350\ntransform the business.\n\n111\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.920\nHow do we know when we're achieving that?\n\n112\n00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.490\nIs the growth of an organization\nmeasured just purely in financial terms?\n\n113\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.260\nOr is the growth of an organization for\nyour organization, is it measured in\n\n114\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.990\nreputation, is it measured in number\nof customers, is it measured in\n\n115\n00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.090\ncredibility or is it measured in a lack\nof customer complaints for instance?\n\n116\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.220\nThere could be a number of ways how we\ncould measure whether we are achieving our\n\n117\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.900\nvision and are achieving our strategy.\n\n118\n00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.290\nNow every single organization has\na vision and a mission statement.\n\n119\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.206\nDo you know the difference?\n\n120\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.346\n&gt;&gt; Hold on, hold on, I have to think.\n\n121\n00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:15.312\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's because\n\n122\n00:07:15.312 --> 00:07:16.670\nI know there is a difference.\n\n123\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.317\nLet's see, vision, so One of\n\n124\n00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:29.320\nthose may have a specific details that\nwe need to set on it such as the vision.\n\n125\n00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.650\nMaybe I have a vision by the end of this\nyear to have x amount of customers or\n\n126\n00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.260\nsomething like that.\n\n127\n00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.290\nWhereas my mission statement\ncan be a little more\n\n128\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.780\npermanent as far as the mission.\n\n129\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Mission?\n\n130\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.090\nWhat you've described there is have\nan x amount of customers would generally\n\n131\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.250\nconsider to be a strategy.\n\n132\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.273\nAnd that particular strategy\nwould be to grow the business.\n\n133\n00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:55.191\nAnd that, what you've described,\nthe vision is something that's\n\n134\n00:07:55.191 --> 00:08:00.400\nMore high level and is possibly\nperceived as slightly more ambiguous.\n\n135\n00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.220\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So a vision would, our vision would be\n\n136\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.963\nto be world leaders in online and\nlive training.\n\n137\n00:08:10.963 --> 00:08:12.830\nThat would be our vision.\n\n138\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.070\nAnd then our mission would be\nhow are we going to get there.\n\n139\n00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.090\nSo by,\nI don't know how are we gonna get there.\n\n140\n00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.420\nBy being open and fun and entertaining,\n\n141\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.690\nwe're going to be world leaders\nin online and live training.\n\n142\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.620\nSo what that actually means is\nwe've got our mission statement to\n\n143\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.820\nstart off with and then we've got\nour vision statement there as well.\n\n144\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.520\nSo quite often,\nan organization will combine the two.\n\n145\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.790\nSo we have a vision which\nis what we want to achieve.\n\n146\n00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.910\nAnd then our mission is how\nwe're going to achieve that.\n\n147\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.810\nNow what you described about having\n500,000 new customers every month,\n\n148\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.930\nthen that would be a strategy.\n\n149\n00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.010\nThen that would be a strategy.\n\n150\n00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.460\nThat's something tangible\nthat we want to achieve.\n\n151\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.740\nWhy do we have to know that?\n\n152\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.207\nWell, because we have to ensure\nthat everything that we do then,\n\n153\n00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:03.097\nhere within IT.\n\n154\n00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:07.370\nAnd when in that second bullet point it\nsays what does the vision mean for IT and\n\n155\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.636\nhow do we contribute?\n\n156\n00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:13.179\nWell, we have to say, okay then,\nso if this is vision,\n\n157\n00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:20.180\nis to be world leaders in online and in\nlive training, then how do we contribute?\n\n158\n00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.605\nAnd you know what, sometimes we\nare really, we take a back seat and\n\n159\n00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:28.635\nwe're really sort of ambivalent\nabout the whole, sort of,\n\n160\n00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:31.495\naligning ourselves to the organization.\n\n161\n00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:34.358\nBut in every single decision\nthat we make here at IT,\n\n162\n00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:38.900\nwe should be asking the question,\nis that contributing to the vision?\n\n163\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.680\nIs that helping us to be leaders?\n\n164\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:48.506\nSo for instance,\nif we get a new request from a supplier or\n\n165\n00:09:48.506 --> 00:09:52.895\npartner of ours to upgrade\nour operating system.\n\n166\n00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:56.475\nThen we have to ask ourselves will\nthat contribute to our vision or\n\n167\n00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:58.785\nis that something that they're\njust asking us to do or\n\n168\n00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:02.035\nsomething that we need to do for\nanother reason, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:07.085\nSo we should always be asking what the\norganizational vision means for us in IT.\n\n170\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.060\nAnd how are they going to measure that?\n\n171\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.160\nHow do we measure this?\n\n172\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.480\nIn terms of us?\n\n173\n00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.390\nIn terms of world leaders in what we do.\n\n174\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.220\nHow do we measure that?\n\n175\n00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.720\nDo we measure that in terms\nof numbers of customers?\n\n176\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.680\nDo we measure that in terms\nof lack of complaints?\n\n177\n00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.600\nOr in terms of revenue.\n\n178\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.000\nI don't have an answer to that.\n\n179\n00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.610\nThere is no answer to that and this is why\n\n180\n00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.680\nwe'll tell you that ITIL's gotta be\nadapted to suit your organization.\n\n181\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.570\nI cannot create a vision for\nyour IT organization\n\n182\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.140\nwithout first knowing what your vision\nis for your organization as a whole.\n\n183\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.190\nSo the first thing that\nwe need to understand and\n\n184\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.746\nit's on our next slide are our\nfour Ps of service strategy.\n\n185\n00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:51.961\nNow our four Ps of service\nstrategy are simply looking at\n\n186\n00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:56.901\nthe perspective of the organization\nwhich is that world leader.\n\n187\n00:10:56.901 --> 00:10:59.290\nThe position is where are we right now?\n\n188\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.400\nAnd then we look at our plans for\nthe future.\n\n189\n00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.948\nWhat is going to get the organization\nto become that world leader?\n\n190\n00:11:07.948 --> 00:11:12.527\nAnd it's those plans,\nthose specific plans that therefore drive\n\n191\n00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:17.320\nthe patterns of activity that\nwe have within the organization.\n\n192\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.900\nSo it's our plans, our specific\nplans that drive our patterns.\n\n193\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.840\nSo we know that our plans\nare to be a world leader and so\n\n194\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.220\nwe want to be a world leader\nby being entertaining.\n\n195\n00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.900\nWe know that, so\nthen that drives out pattern and\n\n196\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.780\npart of our pattern is to\nhave an interactive show,\n\n197\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.820\nan interactive episode where\nwe're talking to each other.\n\n198\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.200\nAnd not where I'm standing here\ntalking to a camera on my own.\n\n199\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.510\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n200\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.521\nIt sometimes means that\nCherokee has to wake up.\n\n201\n00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every now and then,\n\n202\n00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:49.261\nI have to nudge her.\n\n203\n00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:50.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But it's all right.\n\n204\n00:11:50.352 --> 00:11:50.934\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:50.934 --> 00:11:55.758\n[LAUGH] So it's the perspective of the\norganization that therefore drives what\n\n206\n00:11:55.758 --> 00:12:00.400\nour specific plans are and\ndrives what our patterns of behavior are.\n\n207\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.890\nNow, in service strategy,\nwe kind of turned that around and said,\n\n208\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.500\nit's the patterns of behavior that tell\nus how we have to plan our IT services.\n\n209\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.720\nSo, we can take right the way back to\nthat perspective in the positions.\n\n210\n00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.460\nBut you see this is iterative in itself.\n\n211\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.948\nBecause it's our patterns of behavior that\ntherefore drive what our perspective and\n\n212\n00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.100\nour position is.\n\n213\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.930\n&gt;&gt; Going back to that idea of evolving\nlike we even saw with our values.\n\n214\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthis is iterative in and of itself.\n\n215\n00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.450\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is an iterative process\n\n216\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.700\njust looking at this four Ps.\n\n217\n00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.290\nAnd so I'm gonna go back here because\nthe next thing we got in here\n\n218\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.580\nIs the orientation worksheet.\n\n219\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:46.340\nNow anything that's in red, and this is\nsomething that I need you to remember.\n\n220\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.930\nAnything that is in red\nmeans that you have\n\n221\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:55.390\na downloadable version of\nthis particular template.\n\n222\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.460\nAnd I mention this because in our\nintroduction, I mentioned to you about\n\n223\n00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.560\nthe ITIL Practitioner Handbook and\nI told you that\n\n224\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.090\nyour test is an open book test and\nyou can, even in your virtual test,\n\n225\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:19.930\nhave your version of the ITIL Practitioner\nHandbook with you during your test.\n\n226\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.180\nNow at the back of that book,\nyou will find a toolkit.\n\n227\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.640\nAnd the toolkit is full\nof useful templates.\n\n228\n00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.640\nAnd in each one of these useful templates\nthat you've got in your toolkit,\n\n229\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.170\nwe have exercises for each of them.\n\n230\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.100\nAnd I'm going to be encouraging you to do\nthese exercises in order to learn how to\n\n231\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.736\nuse these particular templates and\nso you can learn what these are for.\n\n232\n00:13:42.736 --> 00:13:47.776\nSo an orientation worksheet\nallows us to understand what\n\n233\n00:13:47.776 --> 00:13:53.341\nthe organizational vision is and\ntranslated for us here at IT.\n\n234\n00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:56.830\nSo a little bit later on,\nI'm gonna ask you to go ahead and\n\n235\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.990\nundertake the exercise that\ninvolves the orientation worksheet.\n\n236\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.550\nOther things that will\nhelp us contribute or\n\n237\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:09.440\ncontribute towards the vision within IT,\nare our services in the pipeline.\n\n238\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.060\nNow, of course,\n\n239\n00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.870\nwe know these are our ideas that\nare fed into portfolio management,\n\n240\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.940\nthat are int he pipeline, where the\nbusiness case has not yet been approved.\n\n241\n00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:23.100\nAnything else that will help us understand\nour vision is our CSI Register.\n\n242\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.180\nAnd our CSI Register, well, that's a list\nof improvement opportunities that we have\n\n243\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.780\nprioritized and that we are looking\nto assign whether that be to\n\n244\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.830\nassign as a new service or an updated\nservice in our service pipeline or\n\n245\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.100\nwhether that be to assign to\nindividual process owners or\n\n246\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.700\nservice owners or\nmaybe even team leaders to implement.\n\n247\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.680\nSo again, those in red are within our\ntoolkit within our ITIL practitioner book.\n\n248\n00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.620\nSo, let's take a look then now at\nunderstanding our constraints because that\n\n249\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.360\nis part of our vision.\n\n250\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.333\nIn a previous episode, we looked at\nutility and warranty and you see utility\n\n251\n00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:07.818\nand warranty at the top and\nat the bottom of this particular slide.\n\n252\n00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:13.560\nBut our constraints are the constraints\nwithin which we have to work and\n\n253\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.780\nthese are just examples of constraints.\n\n254\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.520\nConstraints such as technology\nconstraints, in other words,\n\n255\n00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.790\nwhat we have right now and\ncan we step outside of those constraints?\n\n256\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.830\nWhen we're coming up with an idea for\na new service,\n\n257\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.970\nthen that acceptable service solution\nmust fit within the constraints.\n\n258\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.280\nIt cannot go outside of the constraints\nunless we're planning on changing\n\n259\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.640\nthe constraints.\n\n260\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.103\nIf we're planning on changing\nthe constraints then that is a strategy\n\n261\n00:15:43.103 --> 00:15:43.697\ndecision.\n\n262\n00:15:43.697 --> 00:15:48.500\nAnd that's generally a decision that's\nmade by either the IT steering group or\n\n263\n00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.940\nmaybe even the board of directors.\n\n264\n00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.118\nWe'll take a look at values of ethics for\ninstance.\n\n265\n00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:57.014\nIt may be a very, very Small\nconstraints in terms of, you know,\n\n266\n00:15:57.014 --> 00:16:01.800\nthe size when we look at that\ncompared to technology constraints.\n\n267\n00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.550\nBut that's really important.\n\n268\n00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.610\nI use the example of recycling.\n\n269\n00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.150\nNow recycling is one that,\nin certain countries around the world,\n\n270\n00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.190\nrecycling of any electrical\nequipment is mandatory.\n\n271\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.980\nIt has to be done and you have to\nprove that recycling has taken place.\n\n272\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.160\nSo what a lot of large,\nglobal organizations will tend to do\n\n273\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.850\nis that they will tend to take that, which\nis a legal minimum in some countries, and\n\n274\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.650\napply that as an ethic around the world,\nin all of the organization.\n\n275\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.380\nCan we change that constraint?\n\n276\n00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.440\nWell if we wanted to change\nthat constraint here within IT.\n\n277\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.810\nAnd I just said that we can change\nsome constraints maybe by going\n\n278\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.630\nto the IT Steering Group.\n\n279\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.020\nWell, can the IT Steering Group\nchange that as a constraint?\n\n280\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.560\nI don't think so it's a legal\nrequirement in some countries.\n\n281\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.750\nSo unless they can actually get to\nthe parliament of those countries and\n\n282\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.700\nlobby for a change in those law, then no.\n\n283\n00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.710\nThat's never going to be changed,\nso bear in mind\n\n284\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.740\nsome of these constraints can be changed,\nsome of them can't be changed.\n\n285\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.330\nYou have to know the difference\nbecause when defining the strategy\n\n286\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.510\nwe have to understand the constraints that\nthe organization are working within and\n\n287\n00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.890\nthe constraints that we're working in.\n\n288\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.760\nIt is absolutely no good to us,\nwe are not going to be delivering value,\n\n289\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.610\nif we try and design a technology solution\nthat falls outside of those constraints.\n\n290\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.470\nYou know, and I say this quite often,\nbut it's so true,\n\n291\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.630\nit doesn't matter where you work.\n\n292\n00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.890\nThere's always somebody knocking\non the door of your CEO,\n\n293\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:41.120\noffering to do your job for\nless money and to a higher quality.\n\n294\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.875\nAnd one of the ways that we can\ndemonstrate that actually we can deliver\n\n295\n00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:49.225\nIT services to a higher quality than\nanybody else, than any of our potential\n\n296\n00:17:49.225 --> 00:17:55.055\ncompetitors is by demonstrating that we\nhave an understanding of the organization.\n\n297\n00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:59.395\nAnd that we have an understanding of\nthe challenges that the organization face.\n\n298\n00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:02.930\nAnd we're able to facilitate\nthe organization in\n\n299\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.900\novercoming these challenges.\n\n300\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.370\nNow I don't want to call\nconstraints challenges.\n\n301\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.930\nBut let's face it,\nwe have to work within these constraints.\n\n302\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.560\nAnd sometimes they can be a challenge.\n\n303\n00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.140\nAnd so we have to demonstrate that we're\nable to work within those constraints.\n\n304\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.100\nWe have to understand in order to do this,\nwhere the constraints come from.\n\n305\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.310\nWe have to understand whether they can\nbe influenced or not because some can't,\n\n306\n00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.750\nas we've already mentioned.\n\n307\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.120\nAnd we might need to use risk assessment\ntechniques in order to do that.\n\n308\n00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.020\nNow we've looked at\nrisk assessment in CSI.\n\n309\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.900\nWe've also looked at risk\nassessment in service strategy, and\n\n310\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:44.530\nwe've looked at risk assessment in a very\nbasic level in service design, as well.\n\n311\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.980\nSo we could take a look at\nany one of those shows and\n\n312\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.750\nwe'll see more about risk assessment\ntechniques, such as management of risk.\n\n313\n00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:57.431\nNow this is not a risk\n[CROSSTALK] analysis show.\n\n314\n00:18:57.431 --> 00:19:00.800\nYeah, we're not going to be\ndoing risk analysis here.\n\n315\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.620\nJust bear in mind that there are different\ntypes of risk management, different types\n\n316\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.610\nof risk analysis, that we have risk in\nterms of risk to the organization and\n\n317\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.230\nrisk to the business of not\nfulfilling their outcomes,\n\n318\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.460\nthey're not being able to\nfulfill their outcomes.\n\n319\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.150\nYou can call that\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n320\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.610\nWe also have risk management\nin terms of us in IT and\n\n321\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:30.640\ntechnological failure and\nwhat risk that would present both to us,\n\n322\n00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.270\nas a service provider and\nalso to the organization as a whole.\n\n323\n00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.480\nSomething else that we have to understand\nwhen we are working out what our\n\n324\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.220\nvision is, is we have to understand\nwho our stakeholders are.\n\n325\n00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.680\nWho are the stakeholders?\n\n326\n00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.110\nA stakeholder is defined in ITIL\nas being an interested party.\n\n327\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.610\nWho are our stakeholders?\n\n328\n00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.980\nAnd what interests do they have?\n\n329\n00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.330\nAnybody can be a stakeholder,\nabsolutely anybody, and\n\n330\n00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.590\nyou have to find out what motivates them.\n\n331\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.600\nAnd we'll talk more about this when\nwe talk about organizational change\n\n332\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.670\nmanagement and\nlooking at techniques like JP Cotter, for\n\n333\n00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.770\ninstance, to create a sense of urgency.\n\n334\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.470\nBecause we're finding out\nwhat influences these people.\n\n335\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.640\nWell, what motivates them,\nwhat influences them?\n\n336\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.570\nAnd what influence did they have?\n\n337\n00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.840\nWe'll talk about stakeholder analysis a\nlittle bit later, and stakeholder mapping.\n\n338\n00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.450\nBut quite frankly there are some\npeople that have a huge influence\n\n339\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.930\nover anything that we're\ntrying to achieve and\n\n340\n00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:36.450\nwe have to make sure that they\nare with us, that they're on board,\n\n341\n00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:41.560\nthat they are behind whatever our\nimprovement initiative is 100%.\n\n342\n00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.630\nBecause if they're not,\nthen they could actually\n\n343\n00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:49.120\nundermine any improvement\ninitiative we're trying to achieve.\n\n344\n00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.000\nWhether we're trying to implement\nsomething really small like maybe just\n\n345\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.820\none small improvement initiative from the\nCSI register or whether we're trying to\n\n346\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.720\nimplement a new service or\nmaybe even bring in a new process.\n\n347\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.570\nAll it takes is one person,\none negative person\n\n348\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.290\nto undermine the motivation and\nthe morale of 500 people.\n\n349\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.480\nSo we have to understand\nwho our stakeholders are.\n\n350\n00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.310\nAnd in order to do that, you have to\nanswer the question what's in it for me?\n\n351\n00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.310\nWhat am I gonna get out of doing this?\n\n352\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.330\nWhat benefit is it to me?\n\n353\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.150\nIf you're just bringing in bureaucracy and\nlet's face it that's how\n\n354\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:33.360\npeople can perceive us bringing in\na process, we're defining the process,\n\n355\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.490\nwe're bringing it in and we're saying\nhere's our new change management process.\n\n356\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.070\nWe'd like you to follow it.\n\n357\n00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.560\nThe question that they are going to ask\neven if they don't ask it out loud is\n\n358\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.620\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n359\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.840\nDo I get any benefit out\nof using this new process?\n\n360\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.380\nBecause if I don't, then I'm not going to.\n\n361\n00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.620\nI'm just gonna bypass it, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.810\nSo, again,\nwe have some items in Word here.\n\n363\n00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:59.750\nIn your templates, in your toolkit,\nyou have a copy of a stakeholder map.\n\n364\n00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.940\nYou have a stakeholder\nanalysis worksheet and\n\n365\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.960\nyou also have a stakeholder\ncommunication plan.\n\n366\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.250\nAnd in your downloadable material,\n\n367\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:14.100\nyou will have exercises on how\nto use each of these templates.\n\n368\n00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.560\nAnd also exercises that look at where\nwe would use each of these templates.\n\n369\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.730\nOur stakeholder map,\nbeing who are stakeholders are and\n\n370\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.640\nwhat their priorities are, and our\nstakeholder analysis worksheet being what\n\n371\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.190\nwe can do with these stakeholders to\ninfluence them and where they need to be.\n\n372\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.790\nAnd then our stakeholder\ncommunication plan\n\n373\n00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.980\nbeing how we communicate\nwith these stakeholders.\n\n374\n00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.820\nHow do you like to be communicated with,\nCherokee?\n\n375\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.820\n&gt;&gt; Email.\n\n376\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.400\n&gt;&gt; Email all the time?\n\n377\n00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Text message secondary.\n\n378\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Text message secondary.\n\n379\n00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.470\n&gt;&gt; I hate the telephone, Jo.\n\n380\n00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.370\nI know we were talking about that earlier,\nbut\n\n381\n00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:51.020\nthat's not my number one\nway to be contacted.\n\n382\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.320\n&gt;&gt; So\nface-to-face then doesn't work for you?\n\n383\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.230\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\nI didn't even think about that.\n\n384\n00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.440\nOf course, that's my favorite, yes.\n\n385\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.970\nThat's probably why I don't like other\nforms of, and don't like on the phone and\n\n386\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.420\nI don't like through social media.\n\n387\n00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.870\nCuz we gotta have this, too.\n\n388\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n389\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.220\nYeah.\n\n390\n00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.800\nAnd you see, different people\nrespond better to different types of\n\n391\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.000\ncommunication.\n\n392\n00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.870\nAnd we'll always tell you that you\nshould always follow up with an email or\n\n393\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.020\nfollow up with something\nthat's in writing.\n\n394\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.320\nBut nevertheless,\nwe should communicate face to face.\n\n395\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.218\nAnd this is why, think about IT people.\n\n396\n00:23:22.218 --> 00:23:28.640\nThey don't respond too well to being\nsat in a classroom and being talked at.\n\n397\n00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.239\n&gt;&gt; Especially when you're shaking\nyour finger and, you know.\n\n398\n00:23:31.239 --> 00:23:31.853\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n399\n00:23:31.853 --> 00:23:33.590\nIT people like to-\n&gt;&gt; Anyways, right?\n\n400\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nIT people like to learn by doing things.\n\n401\n00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try this.\n\n402\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.600\n&gt;&gt; I am the sort of person that I\nnever read an instruction manual.\n\n403\n00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.860\nI don't know about you?\n\n404\n00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.798\nI don't think I've ever\nread one in my life.\n\n405\n00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Just wing it.\n\n406\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly [LAUGH] let's\nfigure it out for ourselves.\n\n407\n00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.549\nAnd this is how IT people learn.\n\n408\n00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:51.050\nWe need to understand that,\n\n409\n00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.363\nwe need to understand who our stakeholders\nare if we need any project to be a success\n\n410\n00:23:55.363 --> 00:23:58.505\nThen we need to understand how\nto communicate with people.\n\n411\n00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:02.290\nSometimes people will want snapshots.\n\n412\n00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.598\nSometimes people will\njust want bullet points.\n\n413\n00:24:04.598 --> 00:24:08.433\nIn the ITIL books when we\nfirst released version,\n\n414\n00:24:08.433 --> 00:24:13.912\nthe version three in 2007 at the ITIL\nbooks I was asked by somebody,\n\n415\n00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:17.400\nwhy we had a lot of bullet\npoints in the books.\n\n416\n00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.254\nAnd I said well, we quite like bullet\npoints because they're clear concise and\n\n417\n00:24:21.254 --> 00:24:22.676\nunambiguous-\n&gt;&gt; Short, to the point?\n\n418\n00:24:22.676 --> 00:24:26.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's all about communication,\nand this person said to me well,\n\n419\n00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:31.150\nI don't like bullet points, I like to\nread paragraphs, and I thought, okay.\n\n420\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.845\n&gt;&gt; You and five other people like you.\n\n421\n00:24:32.845 --> 00:24:38.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The fact of the matter is,\nthough, you see there's one person there.\n\n422\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.830\nAnd that one person, and it just so\n\n423\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:44.800\nhappened that I was doing some\nconsultancy work at the time.\n\n424\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.535\nAnd I actually had probably about 50\npeople in that room at that point in time.\n\n425\n00:24:49.535 --> 00:24:52.119\nAnd you see that one person that spoke up\nand said, well I don't like paragraphs,\n\n426\n00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:54.372\nand so I'm not going to read it-\n&gt;&gt; Were they the CEO?\n\n427\n00:24:54.372 --> 00:24:56.235\n&gt;&gt; No,they weren't, [LAUGH] luckily.\n\n428\n00:24:56.235 --> 00:24:59.075\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that one person undermined\n\n429\n00:24:59.075 --> 00:25:02.495\nthe thoughts and the feelings\nof everybody else in that room.\n\n430\n00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:05.285\nBecause then we polarized\neverybody in that room.\n\n431\n00:25:05.285 --> 00:25:08.035\nBecause you had some of that\nroom that was sitting there\n\n432\n00:25:08.035 --> 00:25:10.940\nliterally saying to themselves,\nwhat on earth is he going on about?\n\n433\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then you had other people\n\n434\n00:25:12.655 --> 00:25:15.530\nin that room who were going,\nactually, he's got a point.\n\n435\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.600\nCompletely polarized the room just by\none particular point that he made.\n\n436\n00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.000\nAnd this is why I say it takes just\none person with a negative attitude\n\n437\n00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.140\nto actually undermine 500 other people and\nit can be one person,\n\n438\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:39.060\nthat one negative voice that can undermine\nthe success of an entire project.\n\n439\n00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.850\nThis is why it's very, very important that\nwe work out who our stakeholders are and\n\n440\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.000\nwe know what motivates them,\nwe know how we can influence them.\n\n441\n00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.270\nAnd then we can work out exactly\nwhat influence they have as well,\n\n442\n00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.610\ncuz you asked a very,\nvery important point.\n\n443\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.510\nAnd that important was, was he the CEO?\n\n444\n00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.270\nIn other words, you just asked\nme what influence did he have?\n\n445\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.320\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n446\n00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so that,\nagain, is really important.\n\n447\n00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.169\nBecause if you've got the CEO who doesn't\nsee the benefit in an improvement project.\n\n448\n00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:08.004\n&gt;&gt; Versus Cherokee, sitting over there.\n\n449\n00:26:08.004 --> 00:26:09.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, [LAUGH],\n\n450\n00:26:09.415 --> 00:26:12.040\nno I didn't wanna say that.\n\n451\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.880\nBut if you've got one person who really,\nreally is influential.\n\n452\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.780\nBut doesn't want to get on board with\nany project, whatever it may be,\n\n453\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.835\nthen that project is destined to failure.\n\n454\n00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.090\nSimple as that.\n\n455\n00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.020\nSo we're gonna tell you then,\nwe're gonna look at in your exercises,\n\n456\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.050\nyour downloadable material.\n\n457\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.360\nWe're gonna tell you that you need to\nuse a stakeholder map at the start of\n\n458\n00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.450\na project when we're thinking about\nwhat our vision is that you need to use\n\n459\n00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:41.010\na stakeholder analysis worksheet and the\nstakeholder communication planner as well.\n\n460\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:44.700\nAnd what we want you to do is prioritize\nyour stakeholders in terms of their\n\n461\n00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.750\ninterest and in terms of their influence\nor their power as it is there.\n\n462\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.670\nThose that have got high interest and\n\n463\n00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.580\nare very influential then you\nneed to manage those closely.\n\n464\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.370\nBecause they're gonna well,\n\n465\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.560\nif we don't keep them happy they're\ngonna undermine the project.\n\n466\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.170\nBut those that have got low interest and\n\n467\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:07.010\nlow power, just keep an eye on them\nbecause they could be, being quite sneaky.\n\n468\n00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.490\nSo be very, very careful.\n\n469\n00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:15.422\nPrioritize your stakeholders and\nthen understand what influence they have.\n\n470\n00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:18.830\nAnd always answer the question,\nwhat's in it for them?\n\n471\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.240\nBecause if you can't\nanswer that question for\n\n472\n00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.320\nthem then they are going to be a negative\ninfluence on any improvement project.\n\n473\n00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.870\nAnd then, of course, one particular\ntype of stakeholder is a sponsor, and\n\n474\n00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:37.880\na sponsor is the guiding force\nbehind your vision for your project.\n\n475\n00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.770\nA sponsor is somebody who literally\nhas influence over their project and\n\n476\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.560\nwho drives that project?\n\n477\n00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:50.250\nSo your call center managers,\nyour steering group members,\n\n478\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.270\nyour CIO, their sponsors.\n\n479\n00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.940\nYou see the examples there,\n\n480\n00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.020\nbusiness leaders and\nsenior management and advocates.\n\n481\n00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.390\nBut there are people that are in\na position to authorize and reject, and\n\n482\n00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.890\nthere are people that are in\na position to influence.\n\n483\n00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:08.040\nSo again, very similar to stakeholders,\na lot of this is more specific.\n\n484\n00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.610\nWe need to use a sponsor diagram and\na roadmap.\n\n485\n00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:15.830\nAnd again, there's an example of them\nwith the new downloadable material, and\n\n486\n00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:21.010\nalso there is an exercise to do with\nusing Sponsor Diagrams and Roadmaps.\n\n487\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.950\nSo what should come out,\nthen, of our vision step?\n\n488\n00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.600\nAnd, already, we just covered\non step in our CSI approach.\n\n489\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.910\nAnd this is what should come out of it.\n\n490\n00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.010\nWe should understand [INAUDIBLE]\nthe inputs into the vision step,\n\n491\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.970\nwhich we already covered in service\nstrategy and we covered in CSI as well.\n\n492\n00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:47.340\nThen this is the outcomes from our\nvision step in our CSI approach.\n\n493\n00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.710\nThe outcomes are a completed\nOrientation Worksheet.\n\n494\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.647\nThe Sponsorship Roadmap.\n\n495\n00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:55.720\nThe Stakeholder Analysis Worksheet.\n\n496\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.046\nAnd if you need to know anything\nmore about setting specific targets,\n\n497\n00:29:00.046 --> 00:29:04.661\nthen I want you to see your vision to\na matrix tree that we're going to look at\n\n498\n00:29:04.661 --> 00:29:06.592\nwhen we look at measurements.\n\n499\n00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:08.751\nAnd again we covered that in our CSI and\n\n500\n00:29:08.751 --> 00:29:11.857\nwe've also covered that in\nservice design as well, so\n\n501\n00:29:11.857 --> 00:29:16.530\nplease take a look at those other shows if\nyou need further clarification of that.\n\n502\n00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.470\nSo for this particular episode then\nwe've just taken a first initial look at\n\n503\n00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.270\nthe CSI approach.\n\n504\n00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.010\nAnd I've highlighted some things in red\n\n505\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.870\nthat I need you to refer to in\nyour downloadable material.\n\n506\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.420\nAt this point in time we're going to\n\n507\n00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.340\nsay that that's it folks for\nepisode one, come back again.\n\n508\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.578\n&gt;&gt; Part two?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do have a part two.\n\n509\n00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:40.281\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n510\n00:29:40.281 --> 00:29:42.811\n&gt;&gt; On the CSI approach, and\nat the end of part two,\n\n511\n00:29:42.811 --> 00:29:44.940\nthen you have some exercises to do.\n\n512\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.060\n&gt;&gt; Always looking forward to those,\njumping jacks, sit ups, push ups,\n\n513\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.641\nyou know it.\n\n514\n00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:49.199\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n515\n00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:50.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, but thank you for\n\n516\n00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.690\nproviding that new approach, Jo.\n\n517\n00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.730\nBut we also have additional\ninformation to cover, so ladies and\n\n518\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.180\ngentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n519\n00:29:57.180 -->

00:00:08.573\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:10.937\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your ITIL Practitioner\nseries, I'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.780\nIn this episode, we'll continue our\ndiscussion about the CSI approach, so\n\n7\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.750\nthis our part two.\n\n8\n00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.695\nAnd back with us today,\nwe have Mrs. Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:25.832\nHow are you today Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:25.832 --> 00:00:27.414\n&gt;&gt; I am feeling great,\nthank you Cherokee, how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:29.906\n&gt;&gt; Good,\nready to wrap-up this concept here,\n\n12\n00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:34.380\nwe're introduced to the CSI approach,\nyou are able to offer a new perspective.\n\n13\n00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.999\nWe may have already been\nfamiliar with the concept, but\n\n14\n00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.082\nhere in this series,\nwe've been putting a new spin on things.\n\n15\n00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm interested in the fact\nthat you used the words wrap up.\n\n16\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.449\nIt's like there's some sort of\nexpectation there that this is it.\n\n17\n00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:48.456\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:51.764\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n19\n00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:52.643\n&gt;&gt; I will have\n\n20\n00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:53.282\n&gt;&gt; She's hopping this is\n\n21\n00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:54.329\nwhat's happening she's hopping.\n\n22\n00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.159\n&gt;&gt; So I didn't have any expectations,\nhow about that?\n\n23\n00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.282\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:00.175\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good.\n\n25\n00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:03.135\nNow in the first episode here\nwe looked at the CSI approach.\n\n26\n00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:08.096\nAnd we didn't look at it from the same\npoint of view and the same perspective\n\n27\n00:01:08.096 --> 00:01:12.771\nas we did in our CSI shows themselves,\nor even in our foundation show.\n\n28\n00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:18.661\nWe're looking at this more from\nthe perspective of being able to implement\n\n29\n00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:24.280\nboth CSI and implement any improvement and\nany process or any service.\n\n30\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.105\nSo in our last episode we\nlooked at our first step and\n\n31\n00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:30.100\nour first step was\nunderstanding the vision.\n\n32\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.540\nAnd now we're going to take a look at\nthe subsequent steps in our CSI approach.\n\n33\n00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.196\nSo we're gonna start off with something\nthat looks a little bit complicated\n\n34\n00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:40.834\nthat you've never seen before\nI will guarantee that.\n\n35\n00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.200\nAnd that is, we're just looking\nat the enhanced CSI approach, and\n\n36\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.912\nI want-\n&gt;&gt; Jo,\n\n37\n00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:47.663\nI thought there were no guarantees in IT.\n\n38\n00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:49.595\n&gt;&gt; That's always right, then, isn't there?\n\n39\n00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:50.980\nThere, it's always mine!\n\n40\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850\nYeah, but you know I didn't say I\nwasn't going to guarantee, right?\n\n41\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.357\nI just, it's not a guarantee.\n\n42\n00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.674\nSo, I'll get it back from this.\n\n43\n00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:04.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's take a look at this CSI approach,\n\n44\n00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.012\nthen, that we have here and\nthis is the enhanced CSI approach.\n\n45\n00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:11.089\nYou'll notice that we\nstarted off at number one,\n\n46\n00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.440\nwith actually where are we right now?\n\n47\n00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.756\nThat's our baseline so that's actually\nour second step in the CSI approach.\n\n48\n00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:22.660\nAnd then we move over to where do we\nwant to be which is our short term goal.\n\n49\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.430\nHow do we get there?\n\n50\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.409\nAnd then did we get there and\n\n51\n00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.070\nthen of course we go on afterwards\nto look at what we do right now.\n\n52\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.760\nSo our mission is our longterm goal,\nthis is our vision.\n\n53\n00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.626\nAnd then we look at where we are right\nnow these are our baselines.\n\n54\n00:02:36.626 --> 00:02:41.142\nAnd a baseline is just a snapshot\nof where we are right now.\n\n55\n00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:44.736\nRemember that a baseline\nhas to be relevant.\n\n56\n00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:47.320\nAnd then we look at, as we say,\nwhere do we wanna be?\n\n57\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.430\nWhere do we wanna be next?\n\n58\n00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.320\nWhat's our next step and\nhow are we going to get there?\n\n59\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.464\nThat's our project plan and\ndid we get there?\n\n60\n00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:56.638\nLet's take a look at these in\na little bit more detail then,\n\n61\n00:02:56.638 --> 00:03:00.720\na baseline as I've already said is just\na snapshot of where we are right now.\n\n62\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.719\nIf you don't measure it to start off with\nthen the first measurement that you do\n\n63\n00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.158\ntake is going to become our baseline.\n\n64\n00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:13.601\nSo let's think about this, let's say\nthat my vision is that I want to,\n\n65\n00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.340\nI'm gonna walk towards\nthat camera over there.\n\n66\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.786\nWell if I start walking without\ntaking note of where I started from,\n\n67\n00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.860\nthen how do I know how far I've got?\n\n68\n00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.857\nI don't.\nHow do I know how far I've got to go?\n\n69\n00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:34.860\nI don't, and the first time that I realize\nthat I haven't measured anything, well,\n\n70\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.534\nthat becomes then my baseline because\nthat's when I suddenly think to myself,\n\n71\n00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:42.199\nI better measure that.\n\n72\n00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.391\nWell I might have already\ngot more than halfway and\n\n73\n00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:49.440\nmade more than halfway in progress,\nbut I don't know.\n\n74\n00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.010\nAnd I've got nothing tangible there to\ndemonstrate that an improvement has been\n\n75\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.230\nmade, and because I think so, yeah,\nthat's not good enough an improvement.\n\n76\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.556\nBut I need to be able to\ndemonstrate improvement.\n\n77\n00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:05.100\nSo a snapshot is a baseline\nof where we are now.\n\n78\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.060\nAnd you can take a baseline\nof absolutely anything,\n\n79\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.590\nwhether it be the process maturity,\nthink CMMI, and\n\n80\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.930\nagain we looked at that in more\nin depth in our CSI shows.\n\n81\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.500\nThen think of our training needs analysis,\nwe looked at that in our previous episode.\n\n82\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.560\nAnd we're gonna look at that in a little\nbit more depth when we start talking about\n\n83\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.650\norganizational change management.\n\n84\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.280\nWe can take a baseline in our tools,\nin our current project.\n\n85\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.990\nWe can even take\na baseline in our culture.\n\n86\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.957\nRemember the assessments\nthat we did in CSI?\n\n87\n00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:39.084\nAnd if you need to know\nmore about assessments,\n\n88\n00:04:39.084 --> 00:04:41.897\nthen please take a look at the CSI show,\nand\n\n89\n00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:47.105\nlook specifically at assessments and\nwhat type of assessments we undertook.\n\n90\n00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:50.995\nAnd the baseline as I've said it's just\na snapshot of where we're right now.\n\n91\n00:04:50.995 --> 00:04:54.407\nAnd it's what we use that for\nthat's very important.\n\n92\n00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:58.575\nAs I've already mentioned, our assessments\nare analyse the current state.\n\n93\n00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:00.525\nSo they take that baseline and\n\n94\n00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:05.955\nthen they compare it to,\nmaybe a methodology, such as CMMI.\n\n95\n00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:08.195\nMaybe they compare it to an industry or\n\n96\n00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:10.679\nto competitive which is\nwhat we call a benchmark.\n\n97\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.620\nMaybe it's a SWOT analysis,\nwhich is that strength, and\n\n98\n00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.113\nweaknesses, and\nopportunities, and threats.\n\n99\n00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:22.570\nSo it's where we at right now,\nthat's our baseline.\n\n100\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.940\nAnd then our baseline then we start,\n\n101\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.160\nthat's our foundation to\nwhere do we want to be.\n\n102\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.570\nSo now I know where I am,\nI need to know exactly where I want to be.\n\n103\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.970\nThis is where in service strategy\nI complete my business case and\n\n104\n00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.340\nthen I investigate my\nalternative solutions.\n\n105\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.297\nBut I have to ensure that where I\nwant to be is a line to my vision,\n\n106\n00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:50.830\nremember I spoke about my\nvision in a previous episode.\n\n107\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.162\nAnd I was very, very clear, and\nI had to be very concise and\n\n108\n00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:58.590\nunambiguous about where my vision is.\n\n109\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.040\nWell, now I have to make sure that\neverything that I do is aligned\n\n110\n00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.920\nto my vision, and that it's achievable\n\n111\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.330\ngiven the constraints that we mentioned\nin the previous episode, as well.\n\n112\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.854\nI have to have my exact goals.\n\n113\n00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:18.619\nAnd so my exact goals are gonna be\nquantified by way of critical success\n\n114\n00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.733\nfactors and my KPIs, as well.\n\n115\n00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:23.496\nThese are my goals for\nmy improvement initiative.\n\n116\n00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:30.360\nGo back to CSI, look at the CSI show,\nand look at the vision to metrics tree.\n\n117\n00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.800\nBecause this tells you how to\ndefine your CSFs and your KPIs.\n\n118\n00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.270\nAnd as I've already mentioned\nwe're not gonna go on for\n\n119\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.690\neverything that we've already done in\nprevious episodes and in other shows.\n\n120\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.070\nI'm just gonna point you\nin the right direction.\n\n121\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.080\nWhat you might want to use\nthough is the KPI checklist.\n\n122\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.074\nAs I've already told you,\nanything that's in red,\n\n123\n00:06:54.074 --> 00:06:57.956\nthat's in your toolkit in your\nITIL practitioner publication.\n\n124\n00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:02.832\nAnd so it's those toolkits\nthat we refer to in the class\n\n125\n00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:06.680\nexercises and also in your exam.\n\n126\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.460\nSo that's incredibly important for\n\n127\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.950\nyou to get yourself familiar\nwith before you sit your exam.\n\n128\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.757\nWe might wanna perform a gap analysis,\nand that gap analysis really\n\n129\n00:07:18.757 --> 00:07:22.985\nis comparing where we are right\nnow to where do we want to be.\n\n130\n00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:25.434\nI said we might wanna perform\na gap analysis, I mean,\n\n131\n00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:27.400\nthere's nothing obligatory about that.\n\n132\n00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.940\nBut I would definitely recommend it,\n\n133\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.370\notherwise how do you know how\nyou're going to get there?\n\n134\n00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.755\nOne thing I will tell you that\nyou definitely should do,\n\n135\n00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.750\nis this improvement categorization matrix.\n\n136\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.229\nAgain, it's in red,\nthat means that it's in your took kit and\n\n137\n00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.710\nit also means it's in your\ndownloadable material.\n\n138\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.557\nThe improvement categorization matrix\nallows you to categorize your improvement,\n\n139\n00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:51.728\nobviously, but\nalso to prioritize your improvement.\n\n140\n00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:54.991\nAnd look at the scalability\nof the improvements as well.\n\n141\n00:07:54.991 --> 00:08:00.194\nAnd then you need an agreement\nbefore you go any further.\n\n142\n00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.788\nYou need to have sponsorship agreement.\n\n143\n00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:08.060\nAnd that needs to be done by way\nof an approved business case.\n\n144\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.370\nAnd also the approved change proposal,\nas well.\n\n145\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.970\nNow, don't forget the difference\nbetween the business case approval and\n\n146\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.830\nthe change proposal approval.\n\n147\n00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.840\nI'm gonna ask you Cherokee, do you know\nthe difference between the business case\n\n148\n00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.660\napproval and the change proposal approval?\n\n149\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.910\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nI'm going to give it my best shot here.\n\n150\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.210\nBusiness case, I'm coming up to you.\n\n151\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.050\nI'm presenting this to you in a way\nthat makes sense to you because\n\n152\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.920\nI need to have that buy in.\n\n153\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.280\nAnd I'm trying to make\nit appealing to you.\n\n154\n00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.730\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; And relate it perhaps to monetary\n\n155\n00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.292\nvalue.\n\n156\n00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:43.050\nI'm trying to establish a business case.\n\n157\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n158\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.570\n&gt;&gt; And then a change approval was the.\n\n159\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.460\n&gt;&gt; Change proposal.\n\n160\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.950\n&gt;&gt; Change proposal, okay.\n\n161\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.570\nSo perhaps I've already started a project,\nor there's already something in the works.\n\n162\n00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.329\nAnd now I want to go back and\nchange something, and I might have to go\n\n163\n00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:01.827\nahead and argue, or at least present as to\nwhy this change would be a good idea and\n\n164\n00:09:01.827 --> 00:09:03.794\nhow it could be beneficial to you.\n\n165\n00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:04.370\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n166\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.299\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:05.897\n&gt;&gt; There we go then, I'm glad\n\n168\n00:09:05.897 --> 00:09:06.555\nwe got that one out of the way.\n\n169\n00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:10.856\n&gt;&gt; That was [CROSSTALK] So\nwhat's the real definition here, Jo?\n\n170\n00:09:10.856 --> 00:09:14.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nlet's start off with a business case.\n\n171\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.630\nA business case is simply me going to you\nand saying can I have some money, please?\n\n172\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.720\nThat's my business case.\n\n173\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.820\nPeople that approve the business\ncase are generally how technical?\n\n174\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.700\n&gt;&gt; Not so much.\n\n175\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.120\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.334\nSo I'm going to you, and I'm asking you\nfor money, and I'm saying, you know what?\n\n177\n00:09:30.334 --> 00:09:33.720\nI want to change all\nof our infrastructure.\n\n178\n00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.733\nI wanna upgrade all of our infrastructure\nto Macs, that's what I want to do.\n\n179\n00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:40.700\nI want to change us all\nto an Apple environment.\n\n180\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.710\nCan I have some money, please?\n\n181\n00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:44.941\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWell the reason I said related in\n\n182\n00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:48.886\na monetary, because if someone's\nnot familiar with IT terms,\n\n183\n00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:50.575\nthen it might save me a lot.\n\n184\n00:09:50.575 --> 00:09:53.279\nMaybe Macs don't have as many\nhardware failures or something.\n\n185\n00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:53.871\n&gt;&gt; Stop.\n\n186\n00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:57.583\n&gt;&gt; Hey, [LAUGH] I'm not going there.\n\n187\n00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:02.023\nBut then I could equate whatever\nmy idea was into a dollar\n\n188\n00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:06.770\namount to present it to\nthe business minded individual.\n\n189\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.200\nAt least that's how I approach things.\n\n190\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.252\nI always try to relate it in something\nthat, money, they would understand.\n\n191\n00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:13.064\nMaybe not in IT terms.\n\n192\n00:10:13.064 --> 00:10:14.760\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwell that's what a business case is about.\n\n193\n00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.767\nA business case is about saying, I want\nmoney because I want to upgrade to Macs.\n\n194\n00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:22.746\nAnd generally what will happen is with\nthe business case, we've got a problem.\n\n195\n00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:24.421\nAnd we want it solving.\n\n196\n00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:26.875\nAnd we want to do something.\n\n197\n00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.935\nRemember what we talked about in\na previous episode about creating that\n\n198\n00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:30.510\nwow factor?\n\n199\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.055\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we want to create that\n\n200\n00:10:32.055 --> 00:10:33.120\nwow factor.\n\n201\n00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.400\nSo I'm gonna go and\nI'm gonna ask for money.\n\n202\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.780\nThat's the business case.\n\n203\n00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.086\nBut the people that approve the business\ncase are generally not that technical.\n\n204\n00:10:43.086 --> 00:10:45.900\nThe change proposal does\nexactly the same thing.\n\n205\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.150\n&gt;&gt; But?\n\n206\n00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.470\n&gt;&gt; But it doesn't go to the people that\napprove the business case for approval.\n\n207\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.490\n&gt;&gt; Change advisory board.\n\n208\n00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.360\n&gt;&gt; It goes to the change advisory board.\n\n209\n00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.076\nYou were right, yeah.\n\n210\n00:10:56.076 --> 00:10:57.171\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n211\n00:10:57.171 --> 00:10:59.800\nwhy does he go to\nthe change advisory board?\n\n212\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.564\n&gt;&gt; Why?\nBecause there should be a formal process\n\n213\n00:11:02.564 --> 00:11:05.251\nfor change management already in place.\n\n214\n00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.374\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\nthat didn't answer the question of why?\n\n215\n00:11:07.374 --> 00:11:08.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n216\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.415\nBecause the other person is too busy\nto deal with all of that other stuff.\n\n217\n00:11:11.415 --> 00:11:15.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, all right.\n\n218\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.280\nSo the reason that a business\ncase goes to our board for\n\n219\n00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.180\napproval Is because we want money.\n\n220\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.350\nBut the board aren't very technical.\n\n221\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.318\nSo at the same time as we\ncompile the business case and\n\n222\n00:11:28.318 --> 00:11:33.250\nthat goes the board, we compile a very\nhigh, hang on, she's getting excited now.\n\n223\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.410\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't know if I really know.\n\n224\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.110\nBut to make sure it doesn't conflict with\nother resources that my be ongoing or\n\n225\n00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.330\nin my environment, projects?\n\n226\n00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.320\n&gt;&gt; Kind of, eh?\n\n227\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.124\nNo, just to make sure it's\ntechnically possible.\n\n228\n00:11:44.124 --> 00:11:44.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n229\n00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.876\n&gt;&gt; Right, so when I,\nsee the business case,\n\n230\n00:11:46.876 --> 00:11:50.740\npeople that approve the business case\naren't technically minded at all.\n\n231\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.810\nSo they're just gonna say, okay, I see\nwe've got a problem, This looks like this\n\n232\n00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.550\na recommendation to resolve that problem,\nso yes I'm gonna sign it off.\n\n233\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:04.540\nOr maybe, here I have a proposal for a wow\nfactor, and I'm just gonna sign that off.\n\n234\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.980\nSo at the same time that that happens\nthe change proposal is raised, and\n\n235\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.830\nit goes to the change advisory board.\n\n236\n00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.410\nAnd the change advisory board look at\nit from a technical point of view, and\n\n237\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.060\nthey give it a technical sanity check.\n\n238\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.870\nBecause sometimes,\n\n239\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.580\nyou know what, our board will approve\nthings that just aren't feasibly possible.\n\n240\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.355\nAnd that aren't just feasible, they'll\napprove things that, let's face it, we\n\n241\n00:12:23.355 --> 00:12:27.199\nwouldn't necessarily want to do, or maybe\nthey go against our technical strategy.\n\n242\n00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.640\nSo that's the reason why we\nhave the change proposal.\n\n243\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.832\n&gt;&gt; I think I need\na technical sanity check.\n\n244\n00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:35.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] After all this.\n\n245\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well, you know what?\n\n246\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.164\nI'm not saying anything to that.\n\n247\n00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:41.518\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, let's move on.\n\n248\n00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:43.820\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, yes,\n\n249\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.430\nat this point in time then, when we're\nlooking at where do we want to be, we're\n\n250\n00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:53.350\ncompiling our business case, and we're\ncompiling our change proposal, as well.\n\n251\n00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.780\nAnd they go to the relevant parties for\napproval.\n\n252\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.670\nBear it in mind though,\nwith the change proposal,\n\n253\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.790\nwhile it's a technical sanity check,\nit's only ever gonna come back and\n\n254\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.200\nsay yes, this is possible or yes,\nit's in line with our current strategy.\n\n255\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.140\nIt's never actually going to\ngive that high-level director\n\n256\n00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.475\napproval that says yes you could do this.\n\n257\n00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:16.062\nThey're just gonna approve\nto say yes it's possible,\n\n258\n00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:19.350\nthey're not gonna say yes\ngo ahead with the project.\n\n259\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.060\nBoth of these are done\nbefore we start the project.\n\n260\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.870\nAnd then, once they have been approved,\n\n261\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.730\nwhich is why it's the last bullet point\non that slide cuz now this is when we're\n\n262\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.730\nmoving the, well, it says at\nthe top there, how do we get there?\n\n263\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.820\nThis is where we get to that time to plan.\n\n264\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.465\nWe're gonna use the CSI Guiding Principles\nwhen we are applying, or\n\n265\n00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:42.667\nwhen we're implementing,\nany new initiative.\n\n266\n00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:45.410\nAnd we're gonna come to\nthat in another episode.\n\n267\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.690\nJust remember, we have our\nCSI Guiding Principles which are,\n\n268\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.660\ndon't reinvent the wheel and\nkeep it simple.\n\n269\n00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.940\nI've mentioned that in a lot of previous\nother episodes when we've looked at\n\n270\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.130\nimprovements and when we've looked at\nimplementing processes in other episodes,\n\n271\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.610\nin other life cycle phases and\nin our intermediates as well.\n\n272\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.920\nKeep it simple, don't reinvent the wheel.\n\n273\n00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.163\nAnd only plan for\nthe short term in detail.\n\n274\n00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:14.138\nIt's the longer term goals\nthat you plan at high level,\n\n275\n00:14:14.138 --> 00:14:17.250\nnot at great detail because\nyou'll be wasting your time.\n\n276\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.111\nCuz your long term goals are gonna be\ncompletely dependent on your ability to\n\n277\n00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.753\nachieve your short term goals.\n\n278\n00:14:22.753 --> 00:14:24.930\nKinda makes sense really.\n\n279\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.150\nNow many project management methodologies,\nand what I want to say to you,\n\n280\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.781\nI know I've said this to you\nin previous episodes and\n\n281\n00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.980\nour intermediates,\nI just want to remind you.\n\n282\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.270\nAgile is the buzzword at the moment\nwhen it comes to project management.\n\n283\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.401\nBut we also have PMP, and\nwe also have Prince2.\n\n284\n00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:46.272\nNow, for those of you that\nhaven't heard of either of those,\n\n285\n00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:48.410\nlet me just give you a quick update.\n\n286\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.165\nPrince2 is the sister\npublication from Itil.\n\n287\n00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:56.243\nPrince2 came out of the UK government\nin the same way that Itil did.\n\n288\n00:14:56.243 --> 00:15:01.143\nAnd therefore it is the project management\nmethodology that's most widely used in\n\n289\n00:15:01.143 --> 00:15:04.650\nEurope, and also in Australia and\nSouth Africa, as well.\n\n290\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:09.184\nAnd so it's a project management\nmethodology that you might find\n\n291\n00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.003\nreferred to in your test.\n\n292\n00:15:11.003 --> 00:15:14.021\nIt's certainly not something that\nwe're going to ask you about, but\n\n293\n00:15:14.021 --> 00:15:17.510\nI need you to know that if you see\nthe word Prince2, that's what it is.\n\n294\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:24.030\nNow for those of you that aren't in\nAmerica, then PMP is the most commonly\n\n295\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.610\nused project management methodology\nwithin the US, and in Canada, as well.\n\n296\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Issued by PMI,\nProject Management Institute.\n\n297\n00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is,\nPMI comes out of the PMI, you're right.\n\n298\n00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.220\nSo, again,\njust be aware that both of those exist and\n\n299\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.645\nthat both of those could be\nreferred to in your test.\n\n300\n00:15:42.645 --> 00:15:46.400\nSo when you are implementing any\nnew project and any new initiative,\n\n301\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.245\nit doesn't matter how large or\nhow small it is.\n\n302\n00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:53.007\nBearing in mind that we're talking about\nimplementing sort of Itil itself and\n\n303\n00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:54.323\nimplementing processes.\n\n304\n00:15:54.323 --> 00:15:58.503\nYou have to consider the impact with\nany other improvement initiative.\n\n305\n00:15:58.503 --> 00:16:00.278\nYou've got to involve your stakeholders.\n\n306\n00:16:00.278 --> 00:16:05.330\nNow, there is a RACI matrix\nmentioned there, and there is.\n\n307\n00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.750\nIt's in red, so it is available\nin your downloadable material.\n\n308\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.430\nYou covered the RACI matrix in great\ndetail in ITIL foundation material.\n\n309\n00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.840\nYou've covered it in every\nsingle intermediate and\n\n310\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.110\nyou've covered it in Malk as well.\n\n311\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.700\nSo I do not need to cover AC Matrix again.\n\n312\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.410\nI've already mentioned the stakeholder\ncommunication plan and\n\n313\n00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.080\nthe training needs analysis.\n\n314\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.010\nThis is the time when we\nplan this in great detail.\n\n315\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.610\nWe want to plan for visible, quick wins.\n\n316\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.200\nAnd we might even hypothesize,\nwe might use experimentation.\n\n317\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.310\nWe might use modeling techniques.\n\n318\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.700\nWe can use any one of those when\nwe're planning for an improvement.\n\n319\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.030\nThe one thing that I will tell you,\n\n320\n00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.360\nis that you really should\nuse a project methodology.\n\n321\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.060\nWhether it's Princeton, whether it's PMP,\nwhether it's Azure, I want to see\n\n322\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:01.330\nwith any implementation, I want to see\na consistent structured implementation.\n\n323\n00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.850\nI don't want to see everybody running\naround like headless chickens,\n\n324\n00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.164\nthat's not going to get us anywhere.\n\n325\n00:17:05.164 --> 00:17:07.516\nI want to see published gantt charts,\n\n326\n00:17:07.516 --> 00:17:10.971\nI want to see major progress,\nI want to see milestones,\n\n327\n00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:16.450\nand we want to see consistency in the way\nwe implement absolutely everything.\n\n328\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.090\nYou sounded like you were gonna\nsay something there Cherokee.\n\n329\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.521\n&gt;&gt; No,\nwould you like me to say something, Jo?\n\n330\n00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:25.102\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you really want me to answer\n\n331\n00:17:25.102 --> 00:17:26.050\nthat honestly?\n\n332\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:26.965\n&gt;&gt; We'll keep rolling.\n\n333\n00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:31.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so as I said, I want to see these\n\n334\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:37.170\ndefined roles and responsibilities as\nwell, again, think about RAC Matrix.\n\n335\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.680\nSo once we've decided how\nwe're going to do it,\n\n336\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.410\nthen now is the time to\nimplement the improvement.\n\n337\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.380\nDon't forget organizational change\nmanagement, OCM as we like to call it.\n\n338\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.840\nWe're gonna talk about that\nin a different episode.\n\n339\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.670\nWe might want to remember\nKotter's eight steps.\n\n340\n00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.990\nKotter's eight steps to\norganizational change management.\n\n341\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.550\nThis means visible quick wings that helps\nbuild morale, and helps motivate people.\n\n342\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:10.100\nAnd I love this quote, and\nI really wish I knew who said this, so\n\n343\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.948\nI am going to say it was me.\n\n344\n00:18:11.948 --> 00:18:15.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Remember yea you can't lift\n\n345\n00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:19.734\na thousand kilograms but you can lift\none kilogram a thousand times, and\n\n346\n00:18:19.734 --> 00:18:21.602\nthat actually makes sense.\n\n347\n00:18:21.602 --> 00:18:25.540\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, lots of small iterative\n\n348\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:31.450\nimprovements, visible quick wins that\nhelp build momentum and to build morale.\n\n349\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.360\nDon't forget though, you have to measure.\n\n350\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.090\nBecause, I think so,\nis not a good measurement.\n\n351\n00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.010\nYou want to measure with\nevery single improvement and\n\n352\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.190\nmeasure with every single step.\n\n353\n00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.170\nAnd you know what,\nif your improvements are visible,\n\n354\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.970\nyou're gonna keep your stake holders\nengaged, but always keep them involved,\n\n355\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.440\nand that's exactly the same\nwith your sponsors as well.\n\n356\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:58.640\nThey have got to be involved, they've got\nto be behind you all of the way and then\n\n357\n00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.020\nonce we've implemented any improvement,\njust validate that it's worked.\n\n358\n00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.660\nCompare it against your baseline.\n\n359\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.293\nYour baseline is your starting point.\n\n360\n00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:08.552\nSo compare it against your baseline, and\n\n361\n00:19:08.552 --> 00:19:12.310\nremember that benefits aren't\nalways visible immediately.\n\n362\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.450\nSo don't just measure something the minute\nyou've implemented it and say, yes,\n\n363\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.550\nthat's great, we did it.\n\n364\n00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.940\nNo, you've got to measure\nit on a regular basis.\n\n365\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.180\nMaybe for three months,\nmaybe for six months.\n\n366\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.720\nOne of things that we talk\nabout in Kotter's 8 Steps,\n\n367\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.860\nis embedding any improvement and\nembedding a change.\n\n368\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.890\nIn other words,\nmaking it part of real life and\n\n369\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.900\npart of real world and business as usual.\n\n370\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.590\nWe don't want to revert back\nto where we were before.\n\n371\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.680\nWe always want to move forward.\n\n372\n00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.580\nSo at a pertinent point in time,\nand I will tell you at least twice.\n\n373\n00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.500\nMaybe straight after the implementation,\nand then maybe three months or\n\n374\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.280\nsix months down the line, complete\nthe benefits realization template, okay?\n\n375\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.010\nAnd then, compare against the achievement\nof business case objectives in\n\n376\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.530\nyour CSFs, okay?\n\n377\n00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.120\nSo, your benefits realization template,\nagain,\n\n378\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.920\nit's in red,\nit's in your downloadable material.\n\n379\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.720\nAnd guess what?\n\n380\n00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.190\nWe've got an exercise for you.\n\n381\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:13.360\nAnd that achievement of ROI, well,\nhere is just a simple calculation,\n\n382\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.943\nvery simple calculation and\nachievement of ROI.\n\n383\n00:20:16.943 --> 00:20:20.962\nIn that,\nwe simply take the program objectives,\n\n384\n00:20:20.962 --> 00:20:26.870\nwe collect data on say, what we\nspent on the actual project itself.\n\n385\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.660\nAnd then, we look at the visible\neffects of the program.\n\n386\n00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.130\nWe do that monetary conversion, and\nwe calculate the ROI, and therefore,\n\n387\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.420\nwe identify any quality as\nwell as quantity benefits, and\n\n388\n00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.580\nthen we communicate our results.\n\n389\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.858\nIt really is that simple.\n\n390\n00:20:41.858 --> 00:20:43.620\n[LAUGH] Was that simple?\n\n391\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Very simple.\n\n392\n00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n393\n00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.220\nWho are you gonna get to\nhelp you with this one?\n\n394\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Are you trying to recruit me?\n\n395\n00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.120\nIs that what's happening here?\n\n396\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.040\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no,\nthat wasn't a recruitment drive.\n\n397\n00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.700\nNo, no, no,\nI'd put a better advert out on that.\n\n398\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.859\n[LAUGH] No, who we're gonna get is,\nwe're gonna get financial management.\n\n399\n00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:05.770\nFinancial management is service strategy\nthat's the role that's going to\n\n400\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.410\nperform this for us.\n\n401\n00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.625\nThere is no way, we're in IT, okay?\n\n402\n00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:13.403\nWe are not the worlds greatest\nat financial management,\n\n403\n00:21:13.403 --> 00:21:17.729\nwe have to accept that, this is why\nwe have a process in place, and\n\n404\n00:21:17.729 --> 00:21:21.825\nservice strategy to help us\nwith financial management.\n\n405\n00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:26.815\nSo financial management will take\nresponsibility for undertaking this.\n\n406\n00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:29.693\nMaking sure that we have\na visible achievement of our ROI.\n\n407\n00:21:29.693 --> 00:21:34.015\nAnd then,\nwe have to look at what happens next.\n\n408\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.360\nWhat do we do now?\n\n409\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.310\nYou don't just stop.\n\n410\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:43.900\nWe've got to have visible, iterative,\nrepeatable, ongoing improvements.\n\n411\n00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.500\nCuz you know what, we've already looked\nat the fact in the previous episode,\n\n412\n00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.190\nthe value dismisses over time.\n\n413\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:56.180\nJust think, if when that phone had been\nreleased ten years ago, then that was it.\n\n414\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.310\nBut nothing else was released,\nnothing further was released.\n\n415\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.450\nJust think what would have happened.\n\n416\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.540\nThat company would've sort of\njust disappeared into obscurity.\n\n417\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.510\nWe have to ensure that there are visible\nimprovements, iterative improvements.\n\n418\n00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.290\nWhich means doing things like\nrevisiting the CSI Register,\n\n419\n00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.480\nlooking at requests from customers.\n\n420\n00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.276\nChecking again alignment against\nour organizational vision and\n\n421\n00:22:20.276 --> 00:22:23.111\nagainst the industry\nsector maybe it's moved.\n\n422\n00:22:23.111 --> 00:22:28.481\nWhat are the gaps are identified when we\ndid the assessment on did we get there?\n\n423\n00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:31.943\nDid we achieve what we needed to achieve?\n\n424\n00:22:31.943 --> 00:22:35.176\nAnd not forget about going\nback to our stakeholders and\n\n425\n00:22:35.176 --> 00:22:38.700\nfinding out what they want to\nachieve in the future as well.\n\n426\n00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.399\nMaybe they weren't quite 100%\nhappy with what we did last time,\n\n427\n00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:44.970\nmaybe they see even more\nopportunities there.\n\n428\n00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.570\nCSI has to be embedded\ninto our way of life.\n\n429\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.540\nAnd in fact if you go and you research,\nnow look at our CSI show,\n\n430\n00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.050\nand you will see a section\nthere on assessments.\n\n431\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.760\nOr if you go and\nresearch CMMI, itself, and\n\n432\n00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.640\nprocess maturity, you will see that\nthe pinnacle of process maturity,\n\n433\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.880\nis ensuring that we've got CSI\nembedded into each process.\n\n434\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.986\nSo this is about having a culture for CSI.\n\n435\n00:23:15.986 --> 00:23:17.920\nCSI is a way of life.\n\n436\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.260\nAlways wanting to do better,\nalways wanting to improve,\n\n437\n00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.260\nmaking sure that that culture is\nembedded into the organization and\n\n438\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.970\nthat change is seen as a good thing,\nnot as something that has to happen,\n\n439\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.500\nnot as something that we have to drag\npeople along kicking and screaming.\n\n440\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.860\nAnd of course we're actually going\nto look in subsequent episodes at\n\n441\n00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.680\nour CSI guiding principles, and\nat organizational change management,\n\n442\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.290\non how we actually convince people\nthat change is a good thing.\n\n443\n00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.800\nBecause improvements are going\nto be visible to everybody and\n\n444\n00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.610\nif they are visible to everybody and\n\n445\n00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:58.220\nwe can embed them as a way of life, then\nchange is always seen as a good thing.\n\n446\n00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.060\nSo for now what I want you to do,\n\n447\n00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.002\nis I want you to go to your\ndownloadable material.\n\n448\n00:24:04.002 --> 00:24:09.260\nAnd in your downloadable material,\nyou have exercises relating to\n\n449\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.590\neverything that you have seen in red,\non the slides in front of you.\n\n450\n00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:19.420\nNow I've already told you, right at the\nvery beginning of this particular show,\n\n451\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:26.255\nthat this show was based on\naround about 65 to 75% exercises.\n\n452\n00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:33.220\nSo far in these episodes, we've covered\naround about one hour worth of show.\n\n453\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.000\nThat means that you have about an hour and\n\n454\n00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.730\na half to two hours worth of exercises\nnow, based on the CSI approach.\n\n455\n00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.000\nAnd utilizing all of those\ntemplates that we went through,\n\n456\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.130\nthroughout the last two episodes.\n\n457\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:54.190\nI'd like you to go away now and\nI'd like you to complete those exercises.\n\n458\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.540\nAnd if you have any queries, then\nobviously come back to us via the forum,\n\n459\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.410\nand I will be happy to help\nyou in any way that I can.\n\n460\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.580\nAnd then, when we return for a subsequent\nepisode, we will be picking up where we\n\n461\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.030\nleft off, and we'll be looking at\nthe guiding principles to CSI.\n\n462\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.015\nDon't worry guys, she tells me all\nthe time she'd like me to go away as well.\n\n463\n00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:17.570\n[LAUGH] But, she's right.\n\n464\n00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.900\nYou've got a lot of work to do, but\nwe're going to be here waiting for\n\n465\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.310\nyou when you're finished,\nso don't worry about that.\n\n466\n00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.270\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n467\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.870\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n468\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:27.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n469\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.629\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n470\n00:25:29.629 --> 00:25:36.091\n[MUSIC]\n\n471\n00:25:36.091 --> 00:25:38.616\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

from\n\n3\n00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:05.685\nSan Francisco California.\n\n4\n00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:06.706\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.322\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:11.892\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:14.835\n&gt;&gt; Welcome ladies and\ngentlemen to you ITIL Practitioner series,\n\n8\n00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.490\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at CSI guiding principles.\n\n10\n00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.430\nAnd well, to guide us through this\nepisode, we have ITIL expert, Mrs.\n\n11\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.140\nJo Peacock.\n\n12\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.430\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n13\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.430\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great Cherokee, how are you?\n\n14\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.830\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing lovely.\n\n15\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.390\nI'm staying indoors preparing for\nour solar eclipse today.\n\n16\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.885\nI don't know about you, but\nI'll be spending my day with you, Jo.\n\n17\n00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:40.416\nWell, I've already survived\none in England, so\n\n18\n00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:43.504\nanother one isn't really gonna\nmake that much difference.\n\n19\n00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:44.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I was going blind,\n\n20\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.740\nit's because I'm old.\n\n21\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.605\nIt's got nothing to do\nwith watching the sun.\n\n22\n00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:49.500\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n23\n00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.150\nwe'll go ahead and just take our\nchances here and stick with ITIL.\n\n24\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.390\nWe know that that's a tried and\n\n25\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.700\ntrue methodology, and\nthat's what I'm counting on today.\n\n26\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.540\nSo what will we be looking\nat within this episode, Jo?\n\n27\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.302\n&gt;&gt; So you're telling me that this is\nyour escape from the solar eclipse?\n\n28\n00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:04.409\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what you're telling me right?\n\n29\n00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.571\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Saved by ITIL.\n\n30\n00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:06.427\n&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.\n\n31\n00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:08.466\n[LAUGH] Saved by ITIL.\n\n32\n00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.992\nOkay, you're not the first person to\nsay that, so I'm all right with that.\n\n33\n00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:14.117\n[LAUGH] CSI guiding principles.\n\n34\n00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:17.687\nA lot of stuff in ITIL is\nreally just about common sense.\n\n35\n00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:18.199\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n36\n00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:20.590\n&gt;&gt; And\npeople will tell me this all the time.\n\n37\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.670\nThey'll say yes, but\nthis just all makes sense.\n\n38\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.290\nAnd that's exactly what ITIL is.\n\n39\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.287\nThink about where ITL came from.\n\n40\n00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:29.410\nWe sent out a group of academics\ninto the big wide world.\n\n41\n00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.300\nAnd they came back with\na set of best practices,\n\n42\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.730\nwhat works and what didn't work.\n\n43\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.440\nAnd they articulated it, and they\narticulated it by way of the ITIL library.\n\n44\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.990\nAnd so this, to be perfectly honest,\nis just no more than common sense.\n\n45\n00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.424\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\n\n46\n00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.707\nis we're just gonna articulate\ncommon sense in this.\n\n47\n00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:55.590\nAnd our CSI guiding principles\nare very much focused on the common\n\n48\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.175\nsense aspect of implementation.\n\n49\n00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.940\nAnd whether that's\nan implementation of a service,\n\n50\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.593\nwhether it's an implementation\nof a new process.\n\n51\n00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:06.063\nWhether it's a implementation or\n\n52\n00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:11.609\nreorganization of a particularly\nhierarchical structure, for instance.\n\n53\n00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.980\nJust makes common sense.\n\n54\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.889\nTake a look at what they are right now.\n\n55\n00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:19.093\nWe talk about things like keeping\nit simple, and being transparent,\n\n56\n00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:21.130\nand observing directly.\n\n57\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.990\nAnd yeah, it's just common sense.\n\n58\n00:02:24.175 --> 00:02:25.355\n&gt;&gt; All right, so number one.\n\n59\n00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.071\nI know we've talked\nabout value quite a bit,\n\n60\n00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:29.071\nwe're taking a look here\nat focusing on that value.\n\n61\n00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.455\nWe kinda wanna say,\nlike you said, common sense,\n\n62\n00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:34.195\nstay focused on what our goal is here,\nright?\n\n63\n00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.915\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nlet's take a look at focus on value then.\n\n64\n00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:41.016\nSo, we've aready gone into great\nlengths in a lot of the other episodes,\n\n65\n00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.278\na lot of the other shows as well on value.\n\n66\n00:02:43.278 --> 00:02:47.726\nAnd in fact if we look at the episodes\nwhere we looked at the definition of\n\n67\n00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:51.845\na service, we talked about value,\nas you say, at great length.\n\n68\n00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:56.230\n[LAUGH] And so I'm not going to\ngo into this in any more detail,\n\n69\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.510\nother than the fact that when\nyou are implementing anything,\n\n70\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.620\nno matter what it is, whether it's a new\nprocess, whether it's a new service,\n\n71\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.850\nwhether it's rearranging your\norganizational chart itself.\n\n72\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.551\nYou've got to think about\nwhat the customer wants,\n\n73\n00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:11.910\nthink about what they value.\n\n74\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.410\nThink about the, well, it says\nthey're an affordable mix of features.\n\n75\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.780\nPeople always want to perceive that\nthey're getting value for money,\n\n76\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.900\nthey always want to ensure that\nthey're not wasting money.\n\n77\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.079\nNow, obviously, there are gonna be things,\n\n78\n00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.574\nthere are gonna be times when\ncertain sort of audits come around.\n\n79\n00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:36.387\nWhen it's tax season, for instance,\n\n80\n00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:40.230\nwhen you have regulations\nthat you have to adhere to.\n\n81\n00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:44.140\nYou're gonna have to adhere to those,\nand sometimes they cost money.\n\n82\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.200\nAnd we have to implement the services,\nthe systems.\n\n83\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.327\nWe have to implement processes that\nare gonna help us to achieve those as\n\n84\n00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:51.860\nan organization.\n\n85\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.903\nAnd sometimes, people don't necessary\nperceive value for money in that,\n\n86\n00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.570\nthey think of that as\na necessary evil sometimes.\n\n87\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.800\nThat's the, but we've got to do this.\n\n88\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.109\nBut nevertheless,\nit's still valuable to the organization.\n\n89\n00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.210\nIt's still value to the business.\n\n90\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.070\nWe have to think about both utility and\nwarranty.\n\n91\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.857\nWe have to think about the fact it's not\njust doing what we're supposed to do,\n\n92\n00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:17.410\nbut it's how we do it as well.\n\n93\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.764\nSo, if we're talking about\nvalue from money, we've gotta\n\n94\n00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:24.860\nbring in the difference between\na customer and a user, for a start.\n\n95\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.900\nThink about that service definition again,\n\n96\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.700\ngo back to one of those episodes,\nyou see what a customer values is.\n\n97\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.022\nWell, they just want to\nget what they paid for.\n\n98\n00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:39.098\nBut what are user values is generally\nsomething completely different,\n\n99\n00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:43.840\nwhich is that warranty, which is\nabout the usability of any service.\n\n100\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.690\nSo think about both,\nthey both have to be incorporated.\n\n101\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.260\nAlso, remember the value\ndiminishes over time.\n\n102\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.670\nLet me go back to\nthe definition of a service.\n\n103\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.480\nA service is a means of delivering value,\nby facilitating outcomes\n\n104\n00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.980\nthat customers want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n105\n00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.940\nSo it's a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating an outcome.\n\n106\n00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:16.050\nSo the outcome that we wanna facilitate,\nthen, when we buy a new cellphone,\n\n107\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.390\nis we want to make a phone call and\nreceive a phone call, right?\n\n108\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n109\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.722\n&gt;&gt; We talked about this and yeah.\n\n110\n00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:23.046\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n111\n00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:24.816\nWell if I gave you, then,\n\n112\n00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:28.337\na cell phone from ten years ago,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:30.368\n&gt;&gt; How much value would you perceived\n\n114\n00:05:30.368 --> 00:05:31.639\nin that cellphone?\n\n115\n00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.331\n&gt;&gt; Geez, it depends, we were just\ntalking about this the other day.\n\n116\n00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:38.669\nEspecially it feels like, I don't even\nknow, a palm pilot with the stylus and\n\n117\n00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.060\nhopefully it will work.\n\n118\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.693\nHopefully I can dial that phone number,\nbut yeah by today's standards,\n\n119\n00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:45.582\nI'm not gonna be satisfied, sorry.\n\n120\n00:05:45.582 --> 00:05:48.827\n&gt;&gt; No, but then it still\nfacilitates that same outcome.\n\n121\n00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:49.860\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n122\n00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we have to bear in mind\nthe value does diminish over time.\n\n123\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.058\nIt says that it changes over time, but\nlet's face it, let's be honest about this.\n\n124\n00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:01.080\nValue diminishes over time.\n\n125\n00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.610\nEven though something from ten years ago\nwill still facilitate the same outcome,\n\n126\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.180\nit doesn't mean that\nit's going to be valued.\n\n127\n00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.150\nSo when we talk about focus on value, just\nremember that life is going to change.\n\n128\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.943\nSee, this sounds like\na philosophy lesson now.\n\n129\n00:06:14.943 --> 00:06:20.075\n[LAUGH] But we concentrate a lot in\nIT on keeping everything all up and\n\n130\n00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:25.217\nrunning, and we forget about\nthe fact that things need to change.\n\n131\n00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:29.340\nEspecially ITIL came from the government,\noriginally.\n\n132\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.820\nAnd you know what, in government circles,\nin military circles,\n\n133\n00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.090\nanywhere that's public sector, we don't\nlike to change cuz that involves money.\n\n134\n00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.880\nIt also involves potential\nimpact on stability.\n\n135\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.250\nAnd so\nwe don't necessarily want to change.\n\n136\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.720\nBut we have to,\nwe have to change over time.\n\n137\n00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.910\nBecause when people are coming into\nthe office and are sitting down, and\n\n138\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.171\nI'm talking about your customers and\nyour users.\n\n139\n00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:54.961\nWhen they're coming in and\nthey're sitting down, and they're\n\n140\n00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:58.171\nlooking at their screen and saying,\nwell, I can do more than this at home.\n\n141\n00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:00.800\nThat's the time when you\nneed to be changing.\n\n142\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.420\nBusiness relationship management as\na process, now we found that it's service\n\n143\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.270\nstrategy, that's going to\nhave a lot to do with this.\n\n144\n00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.377\nThat's gonna influence\nyou in value perception,\n\n145\n00:07:10.377 --> 00:07:13.060\nand in actually being\nable to define value.\n\n146\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.220\nSo then we talk about our next\nprinciple is designing, for experience,\n\n147\n00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.020\nthat CX, or the moments of truth,\nas we call it.\n\n148\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.580\nEvery single interaction with IT\nis what we call a moment of truth.\n\n149\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.363\nSo Cherokee,\nI'm gonna ask you a question now.\n\n150\n00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:32.021\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n151\n00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:35.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm deliberately\ngonna trip her up.\n\n152\n00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:36.409\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n153\n00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:37.350\nBecause I like being me.\n\n154\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.810\n&gt;&gt; It's okay.\nIt's like other everyday thing here.\n\n155\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n156\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.370\nhow do you send an email Cherokee?\n\n157\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo.\n\n158\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.520\nSo I'm gonna have a better answer\nthan the one I've given before.\n\n159\n00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.372\nBut with my computer,\nI am going to log in.\n\n160\n00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:57.313\nI am going to connect to my network,\nI'm gonna utilize network protocols\n\n161\n00:07:57.313 --> 00:08:02.354\nto go ahead and send that transmission,\nand Hit Enter, Send, whatever.\n\n162\n00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:04.641\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, really,\n\n163\n00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:06.810\ndid you understand any of that?\n\n164\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.361\nSeriously, did you understand any of that?\n\n165\n00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:11.930\nWhat she actually meant was hey,\n\n166\n00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.464\nshe's gonna plug in her computer,\nshe's gonna open it.\n\n167\n00:08:16.464 --> 00:08:19.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Then she's gonna log in and\n\n168\n00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:23.420\nshe's gonna press Enter when she logs in,\nand these gonna connect to the network.\n\n169\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.897\nShe don't need to know anything\nabout network protocols,\n\n170\n00:08:25.897 --> 00:08:27.441\nit's gonna connect to the network.\n\n171\n00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.767\nAnd then she's going to click on\nthat little icon icon that says\n\n172\n00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:31.905\nMicrosoft Outlook.\n\n173\n00:08:31.905 --> 00:08:36.587\nAnd then that's going to come up, and then\nat that point in time, she's going to look\n\n174\n00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:40.768\nfor and identify the icon that says new\nemail and she's gonna click on that.\n\n175\n00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:43.246\nThen she's going to add\na name into the To field and\n\n176\n00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:46.408\nthen she's gonna type something\ninto the subject field.\n\n177\n00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:49.891\nThen she's gonna type\nthe body of her email and\n\n178\n00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:55.268\nshe might actually attached a document and\nthen she's gonna hit Send.\n\n179\n00:08:55.268 --> 00:09:00.100\nSee the difference in what I said\ncompare to what Cherokee said?\n\n180\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.295\nCuz Cherokee is looking at this\nfrom a technical perspective.\n\n181\n00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:06.331\nCherokee is looking at this\nfrom the IT perspective.\n\n182\n00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:08.990\nWe're delivering value to customers and\nend users.\n\n183\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.070\nAnd to be perfectly honest,\n\n184\n00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.411\nwe don't care about what happens\nin the background, right?\n\n185\n00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:16.310\nWe're interested in the moments of\ntruth from the customer perspective.\n\n186\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.398\nAnd from the customer perspective,\nwe need to identify\n\n187\n00:09:21.398 --> 00:09:26.930\nexactly what they're interactions\nare with the computer.\n\n188\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.830\nBecause we have to design for\n\n189\n00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.800\nthose interactions and\nmake them as painless as possible.\n\n190\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.247\nI have a Mac, and sometimes,\n\n191\n00:09:37.247 --> 00:09:42.207\nwhen I'm trying to attach\nmaybe a photo to an email,\n\n192\n00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:46.291\nit's not quite as easy as you might think.\n\n193\n00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.960\nCuz sometimes you are able to drag and\ndrop, and\n\n194\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.510\nsometimes you're not able to drag and\ndrop.\n\n195\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.891\nWhat relevance does that\nhave on all of this?\n\n196\n00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:57.151\nWell, because we're designing for\nexperience and\n\n197\n00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:00.450\nwe're implementing an improvement and\nhere we are in ITIL practitioner.\n\n198\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.291\nAnd so if we're designing for experience\nI need to know what doesn't work and\n\n199\n00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.255\nI need to know what the pain points are.\n\n200\n00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:10.482\nAnd I need to know the points in time when\nmy customer is gonna be sitting there\n\n201\n00:10:10.482 --> 00:10:13.956\nwith their screens going for\nheavens sake this needs to work.\n\n202\n00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:15.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why won't this work?\n\n203\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.978\nSo I need to be able to identify those\nmoments of truth as we call them.\n\n204\n00:10:22.978 --> 00:10:28.072\nThe interactions, the customer\nexperience because when I'm implementing\n\n205\n00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:33.005\nan improvement, the bits those periods\nin time when I'm standing there,\n\n206\n00:10:33.005 --> 00:10:37.590\nscreaming at my PC,\nthat's what IT have got to design for.\n\n207\n00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.126\nI don't care what network protocol we use.\n\n208\n00:10:40.126 --> 00:10:42.290\nThat's down to our\ntechie guys to sort out.\n\n209\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.059\nThey're gonna sort this out, they're gonna\nmake sure the exchange service's working\n\n210\n00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:50.697\nokay, they are going to be looking\nat all of the technical aspects.\n\n211\n00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:55.107\nWhat we're interested in when we're\ndesigning for experiences, we're\n\n212\n00:10:55.107 --> 00:11:00.830\ninterested in the customer experience,\nbecause remember, value is perceived.\n\n213\n00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.832\nThat's what we're interested in.\n\n214\n00:11:02.832 --> 00:11:07.975\nSo we have to ensure, and\nthis happens way back in service strategy,\n\n215\n00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:12.620\nit happens in the portfolio that\nwe map out our service model.\n\n216\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.278\nAnd our service model is not just about\nthe components that make up a service, but\n\n217\n00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:19.687\nit's also about those moments of truth.\n\n218\n00:11:19.687 --> 00:11:25.570\nIt's about understanding\nthe interactions in our service itself.\n\n219\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:33.345\nIt's about understanding exactly how\na customer will send and receive an email.\n\n220\n00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:35.290\nIt's about understanding\nthe moments of truth.\n\n221\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.938\nAnd again, business relationship\nmanagement, it's gonna help us with this.\n\n222\n00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:41.684\nYou'll see as we go through\nthis particular section,\n\n223\n00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:45.340\nthat business relationship management\nhave a huge role to play in this.\n\n224\n00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.952\nBecause business relationship management\ntell us what the customer is thinking.\n\n225\n00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:53.818\nThey tell us what the customer values and\nwhat the users value and\n\n226\n00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:55.618\nwhat the users are thinking.\n\n227\n00:11:55.618 --> 00:11:59.590\nSo we will utilize things like surveys for\ninstance.\n\n228\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.883\nAnd we will utilize other\ntechniques such as interviews etc.\n\n229\n00:12:04.883 --> 00:12:08.010\nBut business relationship management\nare gonna help us a huge amount.\n\n230\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.944\nNow our next CSI principle, then our\nguiding principle which is the common\n\n231\n00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:19.548\nsense approach to implementing\nany improvement any big change,\n\n232\n00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.823\nstart exactly where we are now.\n\n233\n00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:25.280\nIn our last episodes, in our last show,\n\n234\n00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.448\nwe look at the CSI approach\nin a lot more detail and\n\n235\n00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:36.070\nyou will see CSI approach again as we look\nat a CSI show in our life cycle phase.\n\n236\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.860\nWe have to start where we are right now.\n\n237\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.660\nWe take a baseline and that baseline tells\nus where we are, and we start there.\n\n238\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.726\nWe don't reinvent the wheel, we don't\nstart with a blank piece of paper and\n\n239\n00:12:46.726 --> 00:12:48.920\nwe don't rip everything out.\n\n240\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.252\nI mean, when was the last time you started\nwith a blank piece of paper when you're\n\n241\n00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:53.332\nmaking any improvement?\n\n242\n00:12:53.332 --> 00:12:55.079\nYou don't, not anymore.\n\n243\n00:12:55.079 --> 00:13:00.028\nWay back in 1980 was probably about\nthe last time you started with\n\n244\n00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:01.770\na blank piece of paper.\n\n245\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.498\nAnd in 1980,\nwe didn't have all of the network and\n\n246\n00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:07.240\neverything else already in place,\nbut you know what?\n\n247\n00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.052\nFor the past 20 years,\nwe've already had things in place.\n\n248\n00:13:11.052 --> 00:13:16.169\nSo when you're making an improvement,\nmaybe you are bringing in a new service,\n\n249\n00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:19.857\nwell, you've already got\nan existing infrastructure,\n\n250\n00:13:19.857 --> 00:13:24.150\nyou've already got existing laptops,\nPCs, desktops, etc.\n\n251\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.546\nYou've already got existing people and\nsupport people in place and\n\n252\n00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:30.945\nexisting developers potentially.\n\n253\n00:13:30.945 --> 00:13:34.670\nYou see, we don't start off\nwith a blank piece of paper.\n\n254\n00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.475\nWe have to start where we are right now,\n\n255\n00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:39.000\nwhich means that we have to\nknow where we are right now.\n\n256\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.167\nThat's why we take a baseline, so\n\n257\n00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:44.466\nthat we can identify exactly\nwhere we are right now.\n\n258\n00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:49.081\nNow, service asset configuration\nmanagement will help us with that because\n\n259\n00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:53.770\nof course, they provide us with\nthe snapshot of our configuration items.\n\n260\n00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.775\nHow everything hangs together and\nall of their relationships.\n\n261\n00:13:56.775 --> 00:14:01.591\nBut don't forget what's also in our\nservice portfolio, or more specifically,\n\n262\n00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.649\nin our pipeline.\n\n263\n00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:05.200\nThese are the new ideas\nthat are coming in, and\n\n264\n00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.220\nwhat's coming in through\nchange management as well.\n\n265\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.690\nCuz we need to know what other\nnew initiatives there are.\n\n266\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.620\nSo don't reinvent the wheel, there's\na lot of duplication involved in that.\n\n267\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.144\nThe service portfolio is really\nimportant because in the pipeline we\n\n268\n00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:24.189\nhave all of our new ideas for\nour new services.\n\n269\n00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:26.120\nAnd again don't reinvent the wheel.\n\n270\n00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.111\nIf somebody else has already\ncome up with a new idea and\n\n271\n00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:35.256\nthat's being progress through\nthe best case and through the project\n\n272\n00:14:35.256 --> 00:14:40.059\nmanagement itself,\nthen we don't need to be doing this again.\n\n273\n00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.138\nSo think about duplication.\n\n274\n00:14:42.138 --> 00:14:45.820\nRemember, ITIL,\nit's about efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n275\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.779\nAnd then that brings us\ninto working holistically.\n\n276\n00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:55.961\nWhich means that we consider\nabsolutely everything including\n\n277\n00:14:55.961 --> 00:15:02.230\nwhat we call the ABC of IT which is\nthe Attitude, Behavior and Culture of IT.\n\n278\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.656\nAnd we'll talk more about that\nwhen we look at our episodes in\n\n279\n00:15:05.656 --> 00:15:10.238\norganizational change management and\nwe look at the emotional cycle of change.\n\n280\n00:15:10.238 --> 00:15:12.740\nBut we have to consider people.\n\n281\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.367\nPeople are going to either deliver\nthe success of any new implementation and\n\n282\n00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:20.759\nany improvement.\n\n283\n00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:25.743\nOr people are going to cause any\nimprovement to fail because people\n\n284\n00:15:25.743 --> 00:15:27.570\nhave to do the work.\n\n285\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.413\nAnd as much as we want to automate we\nstill have to get people on board so\n\n286\n00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:36.850\nyou have to consider attitude,\nyou have to consider culture.\n\n287\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.399\nYou also have to consider the fact that\nwe talked about just now about getting\n\n288\n00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:46.020\na baseline, well you have to consider\nthat there are other improvements that\n\n289\n00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.320\nare also happening.\n\n290\n00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.663\nThere are other services\nthat are already out there.\n\n291\n00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:52.518\nThere are other teams that\nare already out there and\n\n292\n00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.521\nwe have to incorporate all of them.\n\n293\n00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:58.074\nSo again we work holistically.\n\n294\n00:15:58.074 --> 00:16:03.437\nBeing transparent is very important,\nand we'll talk about that in a moment,\n\n295\n00:16:03.437 --> 00:16:08.327\nbut being transparent is going to\nhelp with the working holistically.\n\n296\n00:16:08.327 --> 00:16:11.340\n[SOUND] I sigh, because in IT,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n297\n00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:12.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n298\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:17.006\nIn IT traditionally,\nwe've got a lot of people in IT, and\n\n299\n00:16:17.006 --> 00:16:22.465\nI know that you've all come across them,\nand I've come across too many,\n\n300\n00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:28.036\n[LAUGH] the sort people that want to\nhold on to their own personal knowledge.\n\n301\n00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n302\n00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.210\n&gt;&gt; They don't want to share.\n\n303\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:30.872\n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately.\n\n304\n00:16:30.872 --> 00:16:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we call them empire builders.\n\n305\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.627\nThe people that wanna build their own\nlittle empire, and they don't wanna share\n\n306\n00:16:37.627 --> 00:16:41.565\nany information, and they really don't\nwanna help train anybody else, and so\n\n307\n00:16:41.565 --> 00:16:44.730\nbecause, you know, if-\n&gt;&gt; Their job is safe.\n\n308\n00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.140\nThat's what they feel.\n\n309\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.306\nIn my opinion, they feel like hey,\nI know how to do this.\n\n310\n00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:50.580\nIf it breaks, they're gonna be calling me.\n\n311\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.760\nI'll be employed.\n\n312\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n313\n00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.024\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n314\n00:16:54.024 --> 00:16:57.736\nIt's all about the fact that I've got\nthe specialist knowledge in this, and\n\n315\n00:16:57.736 --> 00:17:01.007\nIf I train somebody else to do it,\nthen that means that I'm sort of-\n\n316\n00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:02.175\n&gt;&gt; Not as special.\n\n317\n00:17:02.175 --> 00:17:04.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not as special, right.\n\n318\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.186\nQuite simply, I might not be here\nnext week, and this is awful, and\n\n319\n00:17:08.186 --> 00:17:13.122\nwe're gonna talk about this when we look\nat organizational change management,\n\n320\n00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:16.389\nabout how we can overcome\nsome of those feelings, but\n\n321\n00:17:16.389 --> 00:17:19.460\nultimately we've got these\ntype of people in IT.\n\n322\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.610\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna bring a couch on set?\n\n323\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.138\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna,\n\n324\n00:17:22.138 --> 00:17:23.421\nno we are not gonna bring a couch-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:24.186\n&gt;&gt; We might need one.\n\n326\n00:17:24.186 --> 00:17:26.005\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tell me about your feelings.\n\n327\n00:17:26.005 --> 00:17:28.792\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We might need one.\n\n328\n00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:31.663\nBut these people, we've got to do\nsomething with these, and they,\n\n329\n00:17:31.663 --> 00:17:33.505\nwe've got to acknowledge that they exist.\n\n330\n00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:36.095\nOne of the biggest mistakes that we make,\n\n331\n00:17:36.095 --> 00:17:40.165\nwhen it comes to making any sort\nof change, is ignoring that, and\n\n332\n00:17:40.165 --> 00:17:45.050\nforgetting that it doesn't, or trying\nto dismiss the fact that it's there.\n\n333\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.530\nTrying to just gloss you over it, and\ntrying to deny it, and so we will be\n\n334\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.479\ntalking about that in other episodes in\norganizational change management, but\n\n335\n00:17:52.479 --> 00:17:56.330\nthat's part of working holistically is\nlooking at the people side of things.\n\n336\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.060\nWell it's not just about\nimplementing technical aspects.\n\n337\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.160\nYou can't just implement\ntechnical aspects and\n\n338\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.990\nthen expect everything else just\nto fall into place, it won't.\n\n339\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.340\nOkay, so\nsomething else that we look at then,\n\n340\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.640\nanother one of our guiding principles\nis that progress it iteratively.\n\n341\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.410\nRemember, the CSI approach is continual\nservice improvement, it's not continuous.\n\n342\n00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:25.560\nContinual means iterative improvements,\nit's like walking one step after another.\n\n343\n00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.415\nSo think agile,\nthink incremental improvements,\n\n344\n00:18:29.415 --> 00:18:34.241\nincremental releases, and\nwe can run more than one in parallel.\n\n345\n00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:39.163\nBut with incremental improvements we\ncan actually see visible improvements,\n\n346\n00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:41.420\nand that's what we want to do.\n\n347\n00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.335\nWe want to see visible improvement, and\n\n348\n00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:45.657\nthen we consolidate all\nof those improvements.\n\n349\n00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:48.524\nThere's also something to be said for\nthe moral and\n\n350\n00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:51.950\nmotivation when it comes to\nsmall visible improvements.\n\n351\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.917\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you could see progress, and\n\n352\n00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:56.355\nyou can measure progress,\nand it's visible progress,\n\n353\n00:18:56.355 --> 00:18:59.350\nthen it's something that you've\nachieved that you can tick off, and\n\n354\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.315\nyou can say, yes-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n\n355\n00:19:00.315 --> 00:19:01.481\n&gt;&gt; I've done that,\n\n356\n00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:04.380\nnow I can move on to the next thing.\n\n357\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.188\nYou know what it's life yourself, and\na lot of this is psychological, but\n\n358\n00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:11.937\nyourself, when you're trying to do\n15 different things all at once and\n\n359\n00:19:11.937 --> 00:19:13.881\nyou achieve absolutely none of them.\n\n360\n00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.365\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's quite demoralizing, right?\n\n361\n00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:17.927\n&gt;&gt; I know, I get stressed out, and\nI'm just like my gosh, there's no way,\n\n362\n00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:19.260\nI'm never gonna be able to do all this.\n\n363\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.815\nSo I have multiple lists.\n\n364\n00:19:21.815 --> 00:19:25.665\nActually, Dr. Tara Swart, when she was\ntalking about different types of project\n\n365\n00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:29.440\nmanagement, she showed me a really cool\nway to break it down into little chunks.\n\n366\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.102\nSo, like hey, this is what I\nneed to do to make myself happy,\n\n367\n00:19:32.102 --> 00:19:34.190\nthis is what I need to to\ndo to make others happy,\n\n368\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.217\nthis is what I need to do today,\nthis is what I need to do this week, and\n\n369\n00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:40.772\njust really think about that, so you're\nnot having that anxiety or anything.\n\n370\n00:19:40.772 --> 00:19:45.107\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's exactly what we say,\nyou've got to progress iteratively,\n\n371\n00:19:45.107 --> 00:19:49.250\nyou've got to break it down into small\nmanageable chunks that you have got to\n\n372\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.651\neither allocate, delegate to somebody\nelse, or that you can manage yourself,\n\n373\n00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:58.053\nbecause visible improvements are something\nthat, not only make you feel good,\n\n374\n00:19:58.053 --> 00:20:01.160\nand make you feel as though\nyou're making progress, but\n\n375\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.247\nit's something that\nthe organization can use as well.\n\n376\n00:20:04.247 --> 00:20:07.875\nNow, one of the, one of the big\nchallenges to a lot of implementations,\n\n377\n00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:12.280\nespecially when people try and implement a\nwhole new service, or maybe they're trying\n\n378\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.031\nto restructure the IT team, is that\nthey're trying to do everything all at\n\n379\n00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:19.530\nthe same time, and that's why we\ncan't do this in a phase approach.\n\n380\n00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.390\nWe've got to do this in a big bang way.\n\n381\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.145\nThe problem with that is that it's very,\nvery unsettling for\n\n382\n00:20:26.145 --> 00:20:30.932\npeople, and it's very unsettling for the\nIT services themselves, the IT systems.\n\n383\n00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:35.695\nIf you're making one change is going to\nimpact something else, and to be perfectly\n\n384\n00:20:35.695 --> 00:20:40.660\nhonest, you end up with chaos, and for the\nperiod of time whilst it's going through,\n\n385\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.401\nthings are in such turmoil that by\nthe time you reach the end of it,\n\n386\n00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:49.040\nthere's no sense of achievement, and\nthere's no sense of satisfaction.\n\n387\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.567\nWhat there is is a huge,\nbig sense of relief, and that's it.\n\n388\n00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:53.930\nIt's just relief.\n\n389\n00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.578\nIt's not satisfaction, and so\nwhat we wanna do is deliver value,\n\n390\n00:20:57.578 --> 00:20:59.673\nwhich means customer satisfaction.\n\n391\n00:20:59.673 --> 00:21:04.469\nSmall manageable chunks, think agile, and\nfor anybody that would say that, well,\n\n392\n00:21:04.469 --> 00:21:09.335\nagile's project management methodology,\nI'll tell you that's okay, cuz that's\n\n393\n00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:13.740\nthe first thing that we will tell you\nwhen it comes to managing projects.\n\n394\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.330\nYou've got to use a project\nmanagement methodology.\n\n395\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.274\nYou can't just do it in an ad hoc\nhaphazard way, and it doesn't matter what\n\n396\n00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:23.533\nthe scale of the organization is, a\nproject management methodology does work,\n\n397\n00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:27.857\nand it does apply, because all project\nmanagement methodologies are completely\n\n398\n00:21:27.857 --> 00:21:31.802\nscalable, and if you think that there's\ntoo much bureaucracy in a project\n\n399\n00:21:31.802 --> 00:21:36.050\nmanagement methodology,\nthen that's cuz you're applying it wrong.\n\n400\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:41.160\nSimple as that, because there's not,\nall project methodology such as Agile,\n\n401\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.580\nsuch as PRINCE2, such as PMP,\nthey are completely scalable.\n\n402\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.683\nIt just depends on how you scale them.\n\n403\n00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:51.400\nNow this one I like.\n\n404\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.864\nThis is one of my favorite\nguiding principles.\n\n405\n00:21:54.864 --> 00:21:56.440\nIt says here observe directly.\n\n406\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.960\nI have another name for this.\n\n407\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.762\nI give this another title,\nit's called get off your bum.\n\n408\n00:22:01.762 --> 00:22:03.100\nThat's what it means.\n\n409\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.104\nGet off your bum.\n\n410\n00:22:05.104 --> 00:22:08.330\nIt says here metrics are only\ngoing to reveal so much.\n\n411\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:15.072\nThey can be skewed, but\nlet's just think about this logically.\n\n412\n00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:16.726\nSo Cherokee, we have,\n\n413\n00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:19.353\nwithout revealing too much here,-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:22:19.353 --> 00:22:20.410\n&gt;&gt; We've been out, and\n\n415\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.829\nwe've eaten a meal before.\n\n416\n00:22:21.829 --> 00:22:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so we'll talk about the food,\n\n418\n00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.610\nas we're sitting there eating it, and\nthen a server comes up to the table, and\n\n419\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.945\nsays to us, is everything okay with\nyour meal, and what do we say?\n\n420\n00:22:33.945 --> 00:22:37.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It depends on how the meal was.\n\n421\n00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:41.393\n[LAUGH] Usually you're like hey,\nit's great, thank you.\n\n422\n00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:44.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, even when it's not, right?\n\n423\n00:22:44.247 --> 00:22:45.110\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes.\n\n424\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] The problem is that we\nare, just by nature, we're always gonna\n\n425\n00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:55.573\nturn around and say, yeah, yeah, yeah\neverything is fine, even though it's not,\n\n426\n00:22:55.573 --> 00:22:59.991\nand when you're sitting in a restaurant\nthat meal has to be really,\n\n427\n00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:04.745\nreally bad before you're ever gonna\nopen your mouth and say something.\n\n428\n00:23:04.745 --> 00:23:09.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] meal, service,\nsomething like that, exactly.\n\n429\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so this is why we'll say,\nget off your bum, because in IT,\n\n430\n00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.080\nif I wanna find out whether a customer has\na pain point, or I wanna find out what\n\n431\n00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.980\nsomebody values, if I ask them a question\nwhether it's a survey that I've emailed\n\n432\n00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:27.535\nto them or whether it's me going up and\nasking them hey, is everything okay?\n\n433\n00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:32.803\nThe first response is always gonna be,\nyeah,it's great.\n\n434\n00:23:32.803 --> 00:23:35.020\nJust think about this,\nwhen you say hello to somebody,\n\n435\n00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.201\nthe first thing you say is hello,\nhow are you, right?\n\n436\n00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:38.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, small talk.\n\n437\n00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.196\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nwhat do you expect them to say back?\n\n438\n00:23:41.196 --> 00:23:45.829\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] My cat died, you know,\nI'm behind on my bills.\n\n439\n00:23:45.829 --> 00:23:48.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, it's usually just great, thanks,\n\n440\n00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:48.558\nhow are you?\n\n441\n00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:51.432\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nyou don't expect them to turn around and\n\n442\n00:23:51.432 --> 00:23:54.871\ntell them that the cat died, and\nwe're way behind with the bills.\n\n443\n00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:58.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're never gonna find that\ninformation out unless you as I say,\n\n444\n00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:03.358\nget off your bum and go find out, because\nthe simple answer is, yeah I'm fine,\n\n445\n00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.810\neverything is great.\n\n446\n00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we expect.\n\n447\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.220\nAnd it's the same one we go\ninto our organization and\n\n448\n00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.370\ninto our business we go and\nwe'll say, hey how's IT working for\n\n449\n00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.330\nyou and it's like,\nyeah yeah yeah, it's great.\n\n450\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:21.250\nEven though we know\nthat there's a problem.\n\n451\n00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.346\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n452\n00:24:23.346 --> 00:24:26.709\n&gt;&gt; From like the Six Sigma standpoint, I\njust remember this term like a Gemba walk,\n\n453\n00:24:26.709 --> 00:24:27.706\nthe getting out there.\n\n454\n00:24:27.706 --> 00:24:30.991\nGet off your bum like Jo says and\neven, this one girl,\n\n455\n00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:34.428\nI remember I was doing a process\nimprovement project and\n\n456\n00:24:34.428 --> 00:24:37.990\nshe was such a nice girl,\nbut she was a little shy.\n\n457\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.140\nAnd she had some really great ideas, but\njust no one had ever asked her about.\n\n458\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.540\nAnd so here we have these great ideas and\n\n459\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.450\nthis resource that was\njust being underutilized.\n\n460\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it happens all the time.\n\n461\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.090\nWhich is why we'll say you've got to\nget off your bum, you've got to go and\n\n462\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.900\nobserve directly, you know.\n\n463\n00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.870\nYou've got to be able to,\nI mean if we take a look at the slide.\n\n464\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.460\nYou know, identify blockages,\nidentify red tape.\n\n465\n00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.410\nHow do our customers\nreally use their services?\n\n466\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.639\nAnd it's funny, cuz we go back to that\nprevious slide and I said, how do you use,\n\n467\n00:25:10.639 --> 00:25:12.380\nwhat about your customer experience?\n\n468\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.800\nHow do you send an email.\n\n469\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.520\nThen you came out with all\nsorts of different things.\n\n470\n00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.890\nAnd yet what I observed when I got off my\nbun was completely different to what you\n\n471\n00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:21.410\ntold me.\n\n472\n00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n473\n00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.751\n&gt;&gt; The other thing about\nobserving directly, or\n\n474\n00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:27.100\ngetting off your bum is\nidentify sources of resistance.\n\n475\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.225\nCuz I can only really find out\nyour attitude if I talk with you.\n\n476\n00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:33.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I don't talk to you,\n\n477\n00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:40.510\nI don't get any sort of inclination as to\nyour attitude by looking at the survey.\n\n478\n00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.640\nI only find out what your\nattitude is by talking to you.\n\n479\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.570\nSo again, observing directly or getting\noff your bum, really, really important.\n\n480\n00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.140\nSo let's take a look then at some\nof our other guiding principles.\n\n481\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.630\nAnd I love this one,\nthe being transparent guiding principle.\n\n482\n00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.880\nWe should do visible in\neverything that we do.\n\n483\n00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.951\nNow I'm not saying that you take top\nsecret information and tell everybody\n\n484\n00:26:07.951 --> 00:26:11.930\nabout the top secret information but\nthat third bullet point down.\n\n485\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.850\nAnd we're gonna talk about this in a later\nsection in our communications section.\n\n486\n00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.129\nThe things that happens in secret,\nthis is when the rumors start and\n\n487\n00:26:20.129 --> 00:26:22.540\nthis is how you demoralize your team.\n\n488\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.240\nHow many changes have been implemented\n\n489\n00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.590\nby the CIO of somebody seeing you stand\nup and say hey we are going to do this.\n\n490\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.230\nAnd then you don't hear anything else.\n\n491\n00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.470\nAnd a year later,\nsomething finally changes.\n\n492\n00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.832\nWell, by that time you kinda switched\noff and forgotten all about it and\n\n493\n00:26:39.832 --> 00:26:42.987\nsomething suddenly happens and\nyou go, where did that come from?\n\n494\n00:26:44.556 --> 00:26:47.735\nThings that happen in secret,\nthings that happen behind closed doors,\n\n495\n00:26:47.735 --> 00:26:49.800\nthat's how rumors start.\n\n496\n00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.030\nSo we need frequent communication but\nnot too frequent.\n\n497\n00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.350\nWe need to make sure that in order to get\npeople on board that we reward success.\n\n498\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.660\nAnd we don't just take people\noutside with a base ball bat and\n\n499\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.640\nbeat them when they're doing something\nwrong that we actually acknowledge when\n\n500\n00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.810\nthey're doing something right.\n\n501\n00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.330\nThis is part of the all of\nthe principles to be perfectly honest is\n\n502\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.990\nthat collaboration,\ngetting people working together and\n\n503\n00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.000\nagain we've got communication\nhere that's really important.\n\n504\n00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.772\nSo we wanna use things like workshops and\nmeetings and\n\n505\n00:27:22.772 --> 00:27:26.120\nbrainstorm sections to get collaboration.\n\n506\n00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.760\nWe'll talk about this in OCM, but\n\n507\n00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.280\nif you don't get people on board,\nif you don't get people on your side\n\n508\n00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.870\nthen your implementation is\nnot going to be a success.\n\n509\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.990\nAnd the easiest way to get\npeople on your side is to\n\n510\n00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:45.110\nget them the responsibility is\nto empower them to take action.\n\n511\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:51.460\nIf we don't empower them to take action\nand to take responsibility, then,\n\n512\n00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.680\nwe're not gonna have them involved and\nif we don't have them involved they could\n\n513\n00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.590\npotentially be a source of resistance and\nthat's something that we don't want.\n\n514\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.840\nTake notice of the bottom bullet point,\n\n515\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.700\nyou've heard that saying too\nmany cooks spoil the broth.\n\n516\n00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.786\nToo much collaboration\ncan result in chaos, so\n\n517\n00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:10.718\nyou don't want everyone running\naround like headless chickens.\n\n518\n00:28:10.718 --> 00:28:14.798\n&gt;&gt; So ours is a lot like [LAUGH] I\nhaven't heard that saying since like\n\n519\n00:28:14.798 --> 00:28:16.776\ntoo many cooks in the kitchen.\n\n520\n00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:17.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, okay.\n\n521\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.488\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of shortened, I guess.\n\n522\n00:28:19.488 --> 00:28:21.152\nWe don't need to many\ncooks in the kitchen.\n\n523\n00:28:21.152 --> 00:28:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, we say too many cooks for\nall the broth, yeah,\n\n524\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.695\ncuz everybody's adding something in.\n\n525\n00:28:26.695 --> 00:28:29.450\nAnd by the time-\n&gt;&gt; You don't know what's in there.\n\n526\n00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:30.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n527\n00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.525\nAnd it probably tastes disgusting\ncuz everybody's added salt into it.\n\n528\n00:28:33.525 --> 00:28:37.190\n[LAUGH] So, yeah,\nwe don't wanna overcollaborate.\n\n529\n00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.610\nWe wanna make sure, and this is where\nproject management comes into it again and\n\n530\n00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.350\nthis is where the being\ntransparent comes into it.\n\n531\n00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.888\nBecause the project management means\nthat everything is planned and\n\n532\n00:28:46.888 --> 00:28:48.420\neverything else is managed.\n\n533\n00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:54.363\nAnd one person will know the involvement\nand the input from everyone else,\n\n534\n00:28:54.363 --> 00:29:00.240\nbut also it means that nobody is\ntreading on anybody else's toes as well.\n\n535\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.700\nAnd so that we have everybody involved but\nonly up to a certain level.\n\n536\n00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.030\nAnd another one of my, and I keep saying\nabout, you know this one's my favorite and\n\n537\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.550\nget off your bum's favorite.\n\n538\n00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.660\nBut this one, okay,\nthis one is glaringly obvious.\n\n539\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.610\nDon't over engineer things.\n\n540\n00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.890\nKeep it simple.\n\n541\n00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:24.450\nWe want to be efficient and\nwe want to be effective.\n\n542\n00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.810\nThe objective is always to deliver\nvalue for our customers, always.\n\n543\n00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.620\nNo matter what we're doing.\n\n544\n00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.130\nAnd whether we're implementing\nan improvement to reorganize our teams,\n\n545\n00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.560\nwhether we're implementing\nan improvement in a process,\n\n546\n00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.090\nwhether we're working towards CMMI for\nprocess maturity.\n\n547\n00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.464\nWhatever we're doing,\nwe want to deliver value and\n\n548\n00:29:45.464 --> 00:29:49.710\nover engineering anything is\nnever going to deliver value.\n\n549\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.940\nIf I have to as an end user,\nhave to sit and\n\n550\n00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.164\nwork out how I'm going to do\nsomething every single time,\n\n551\n00:29:56.164 --> 00:30:00.266\nthen I'm gonna get fed up and I'm not\ngoing to do with it's as simple as that.\n\n552\n00:30:00.266 --> 00:30:04.830\nI'm not going to follow procedures and\nprocesses if I have to figure out what\n\n553\n00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.720\nthose procedures and\nprocesses are every time I use it.\n\n554\n00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.690\nAnd think about DIKW for\nknowledge management, data, information,\n\n555\n00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.040\nknowledge and wisdom.\n\n556\n00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:22.178\nAgain, we always say with every single\nreport, absolutely every single report,\n\n557\n00:30:22.178 --> 00:30:27.503\nif I can't make a decision from it,\ndo I actually need to have that report?\n\n558\n00:30:27.503 --> 00:30:29.790\nAnd the answer to that is no.\n\n559\n00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.890\nSimple as that.\n\n560\n00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.490\nNo, if you cannot make\na decision from that report,\n\n561\n00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.940\nyou shouldn't be producing it.\n\n562\n00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.660\nAnd that's the same with any document.\n\n563\n00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.430\nIt's not just about reporting,\nit's about any document that you produce.\n\n564\n00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.980\nAm I going to use this\ndocument in the future?\n\n565\n00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.140\nIf I'm not going to use it in the future,\nthen why on Earth are you writing it?\n\n566\n00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.940\nI've mentioned already that\nwe're using common sense here.\n\n567\n00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.930\nAnd these principles\nare just common sense.\n\n568\n00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.880\nAnd so they should be applied\nto absolutely everything.\n\n569\n00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.210\nBut of course, you have to plan.\n\n570\n00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.110\nAnd that second bullet point about\napplying principles doesn't mean\n\n571\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.640\nthat you omit the planning.\n\n572\n00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.020\nNo, you have to plan,\notherwise you can't use the principles,\n\n573\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.620\nbecause otherwise you\nwill end up with chaos.\n\n574\n00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:15.110\nAs I've already mentioned\nwe should be looking at\n\n575\n00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.060\ncollaboration with all of our\nother methodologies as well.\n\n576\n00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.930\nDon't forget about the scale too.\n\n577\n00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.210\nOkay, so\nthat was our CSI guiding principles.\n\n578\n00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.720\nNow you will have, you do have\nan exercise on CSI guiding principles.\n\n579\n00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.180\nSo at this point in time,\n\n580\n00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.090\nI would like you to take a look at\nyour downloadable exercise material.\n\n581\n00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:40.260\nAnd if you have any questions, any queries\nabout those exercises then as per usual,\n\n582\n00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.640\nplease join us in the forum and I'll be\nhappy to help you with anyway that I can.\n\n583\n00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for your time Jo,\nand thank you for being here as well.\n\n584\n00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.970\nBut we do have a lot left to cover here\nwith your ITIL practitioner series.\n\n585\n00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:52.540\nStay tuned.\n\n586\n00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.530\nFor this show will go ahead and sign out.\n\n587\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.940\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n588\n00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.698\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n589\n00:31:56.698 --> 00:31:59.160\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:16.960\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.521\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at metrics and measurements.\n\n8\n00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:24.883\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have ITIL expert, Mrs. Jo Peacock..\n\n9\n00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:26.190\nHow you doing today Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.414\n&gt;&gt; I am doing absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:28.720\nThank you Cherokee, how are you?\n\n12\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful,\n\n13\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.565\nnow that I've just had some Celsius and\nFahrenheit conversion explanation.\n\n14\n00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:37.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Kind of ironic that we'll be talking\n\n15\n00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:39.478\nabout metrics and\nmeasurements here in this show.\n\n16\n00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:41.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.440\nAnd of course, 24 hours as opposed\nto just 12 hours in a day.\n\n18\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.990\nThat sort of thing, yup.\n\n19\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.585\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n20\n00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:48.476\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n21\n00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:51.652\nhere we reference it\nsometimes as military time.\n\n22\n00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.169\nWhereas, the rest of world\njust references it as time.\n\n23\n00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:55.481\n&gt;&gt; Time.\n[LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:57.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.326\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially here in IT,\n\n26\n00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.679\nit's just time, isn't it, yeah?\n\n27\n00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.236\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n28\n00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.930\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, cuz I don't mind\nit being called military time.\n\n29\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.906\nI spent a lot of time on military bases,\nso I'm okay with that,\n\n30\n00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:11.716\nI'm quite happy with that.\n\n31\n00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:15.396\nOkay, so let's start our\nmeasurements then and metrics,\n\n32\n00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:20.177\nbecause what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna take it at a very sort of quick\n\n33\n00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:23.286\nrecap in some ways over\nour foundation material.\n\n34\n00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:26.772\nWhere we looked at our measurements and\nour metrics and foundation.\n\n35\n00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:30.864\nWe're also going to dive a little\nbit further into CSI as well.\n\n36\n00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:35.122\nSo in our CSI Show, we looked at metric\nand measurements in great depth.\n\n37\n00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:38.899\nSo we're gonna just take a little\nbit more of a delve into that,\n\n38\n00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.250\nbecause we're actually looking at how we,\nof course,\n\n39\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.173\nhere in ITIL practitioner,\nhow we implement our processes, and\n\n40\n00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:50.975\nimplement new services, and how we\nimplement any new initiative as well.\n\n41\n00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:53.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay Jo, so what are we\ngonna be looking at first here?\n\n42\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, well the first thing that we'll\nlook at is really simple recap from our\n\n43\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.040\nfoundation material as we said, and\nthese are the four reasons why we measure.\n\n44\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.240\nAnd the four reasons why we measure,\nwe measure to validate.\n\n45\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.220\nValidate that we're going\nin the right direction.\n\n46\n00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.920\nSo validate that our improvements are\nactually hitting their mark is it were,\n\n47\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.970\nthat we are going in the right direction.\n\n48\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.892\nAnd we also measure to justify.\n\n49\n00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:19.708\nNow I call that the,\nsee I told you so metric,\n\n50\n00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.944\nthe I told you we needed more money.\n\n51\n00:02:21.944 --> 00:02:23.651\nAnd I told you we needed more people.\n\n52\n00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:26.040\nAnd I told you we needed more training.\n\n53\n00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.800\nThat's the, I told you so\nmetric, to justify.\n\n54\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.490\nAnd then we measure to direct and\nto intervene.\n\n55\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.900\nLet's go back to our service design shows.\n\n56\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.455\nAnd in service design,\nwe looked at service level management.\n\n57\n00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.379\nAnd in service level management,\nwe had the concept of our our SLAM charts,\n\n58\n00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.973\nour service level agreement\nmanagement charts.\n\n59\n00:02:44.973 --> 00:02:48.560\nSo service level agreement\nmonitoring charts, sorry.\n\n60\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.410\nAnd SLAM charts who are rank charts are\nred, amber, green traffic light charts.\n\n61\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.515\nSo I think Cherokee,\nwe call that red, yellow, green.\n\n62\n00:02:56.515 --> 00:02:57.672\nIsn't that what you mentioned, yeah?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n63\n00:02:57.672 --> 00:02:59.016\n&gt;&gt; A rouge charts.\n\n64\n00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:04.399\n[LAUGH] A traffic light charts,\nIf we are looking at amber or yellow,\n\n65\n00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:09.130\nthen that is to direct,\nwe want to direct attention there.\n\n66\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.950\nAnd of course, the red,\nwell, that's intervention.\n\n67\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.980\nSomething is going wrong, so\nwe measure because we want to intervene.\n\n68\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.090\nSo there are four reasons why we measure.\n\n69\n00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.885\nNow what I will do now is, I'm just going\nto give you a little sort of warning,\n\n70\n00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:28.400\nthat when it comes to your exercises, and\n\n71\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.420\ncertainly when it comes to your\ntest itself for ITIL practitioner,\n\n72\n00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.980\nyou are going to be tested on metrics and\nmeasurements.\n\n73\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.890\nWithout a shadow of a doubt,\nyou're gonna get between 6 and\n\n74\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.470\n12 questions out of the 40 in your\ntest on metrics and measurements.\n\n75\n00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.040\nAnd they're going to be looking for\nbalance in your metrics and measurements.\n\n76\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.357\nSo we're going to be looking for, when we\nlook at the four reasons why we measure,\n\n77\n00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:57.250\nwe're gonna be looking for a balance\nin why we're taking measurements.\n\n78\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.073\nWe're going to look for\na balance in our strategy.\n\n79\n00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.430\nWe're going to look for a balance\nin our justification measurements.\n\n80\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.550\nWe're going to look for balance with\nthe direction and the intervention.\n\n81\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.860\nSo we're going to look for\nbalance in those metrics.\n\n82\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.502\nSo how do we define a metric\nthen then to start off with?\n\n83\n00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.338\nSo right in front of us then, we got\nwhat we call a vision to metric tree.\n\n84\n00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:23.446\nAnd our vision to metric tree is\nreally what we use to start and define\n\n85\n00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:29.817\na critical success factor, our CSF and\nour KPIs, our Key Performance Indicators.\n\n86\n00:04:29.817 --> 00:04:32.473\nLet's just take a look at it\nfrom the top downward then.\n\n87\n00:04:32.473 --> 00:04:35.143\nOur vision, that's the vision for\nthe organization.\n\n88\n00:04:35.143 --> 00:04:40.011\nAnd the vision for the organization maybe\nsomething to do with being number one\n\n89\n00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:43.348\nin the industry or\nbeing a world class organization.\n\n90\n00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:49.460\nSo maybe our vision is to be\na world class provider in training,\n\n91\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.308\nthe world premiere training organization.\n\n92\n00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:54.990\nAnd our vision is going to tell\nus how we're going to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.880\nSo that's by okay,\nwe always use that word.\n\n94\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.120\nBy delivering world class training, or\n\n95\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.010\nby delivering our best online\ntraining content in the world.\n\n96\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.230\nSo the vision and mission,\ngenerally combined in most organizations.\n\n97\n00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.541\nThe vision is generally to\nbe a world class training\n\n98\n00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:18.091\norganization by delivering\nquality content online.\n\n99\n00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.821\nThat's our vision and our mission.\n\n100\n00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.943\nThat then feeds down into\nindividual goals for our teams and\n\n101\n00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:28.410\nour departments within the organization.\n\n102\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.745\nAnd I'd expect to have goals for\nour sales organization.\n\n103\n00:05:34.745 --> 00:05:38.395\nI expect to have goals for\nour IT Department.\n\n104\n00:05:38.395 --> 00:05:43.290\nI expect to have goals from our\nMarketing Department, goals for\n\n105\n00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.780\nour content providers for instance.\n\n106\n00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.028\nAll of our individual\ndepartments will have goals.\n\n107\n00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:50.960\nAnd then we'll also all have objectives.\n\n108\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.930\nAnd our objectives are at a team level,\nand we'll individual objectives.\n\n109\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.924\nAnd underneath those\nindividual objectives,\n\n110\n00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.879\nwe'll have those critical success factors.\n\n111\n00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.010\nAnd we'll have then KPIs that tell us\nwhether we're achieving those critical\n\n112\n00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.019\nsuccess factors.\n\n113\n00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:09.327\nAnd then on a regular basis,\nwe'll actually take the metrics and\n\n114\n00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.060\nthe individual numbers.\n\n115\n00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.970\nThose are measurements that will tell\nus whether we're achieving those KPIs.\n\n116\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.300\nWe've looked at this in our CSI\nlife cycle phase, in our CSI shows.\n\n117\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.470\nAnd we've looked at them\nin a lot more depth there.\n\n118\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.670\nNow bare in mind that what we\nare doing as an ITIL practitioner is,\n\n119\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.570\nwe are applying ITIL,\nwe are implementing ITIL.\n\n120\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.535\nSo it is based on a knowledge everything\nthat's in our life cycle shows.\n\n121\n00:06:37.535 --> 00:06:40.392\nSo if you do need more\ninformation about this,\n\n122\n00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:43.263\nthen please go back to\nour CSI lifecycle show.\n\n123\n00:06:43.263 --> 00:06:46.770\nBut essentially what this should\nlook like is a tree root.\n\n124\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.370\nIt should look like a simple\ntree where we have one vision.\n\n125\n00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.270\nAnd then that feeds down into our mission.\n\n126\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.330\nThen underneath that,\nwe'll have a goals for each department.\n\n127\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.320\nAnd then underneath each department goal,\nthere will be an number of objectives.\n\n128\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.850\nAnd underneath each objective,\nthere will be a number of CSF.\n\n129\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.380\nAnd underneath each CSF,\nthere will be a number of KPIs, etc, etc.\n\n130\n00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.270\nSo it should filter down and\nlook like a tree root.\n\n131\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.250\nAnd if we follow the red arrows on the\nright-hand side, the achievement of each\n\n132\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.210\nlower level will tell us whether\nwe are achieving the upper level.\n\n133\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.848\nSo in other words,\nif we have three KPIs per CSF,\n\n134\n00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:36.603\nthen if we achieve each of\nthese KPIs then that will\n\n135\n00:07:36.603 --> 00:07:40.243\ntel us whether we have achieved a CSF.\n\n136\n00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:44.435\nNow we've got examples on\nthe next page of say, CSF.\n\n137\n00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:47.197\nAnd a CSF is generally fairly ambiguous.\n\n138\n00:07:47.197 --> 00:07:51.859\nAnd then, we'll have at least\ntwo to three KPIs per CSF.\n\n139\n00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:52.451\nAnd so,\n\n140\n00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:57.871\nan example there is a KPI of attempts\nat increasing customer satisfaction.\n\n141\n00:07:57.871 --> 00:07:59.952\nGot a couple of things to say about KPIs.\n\n142\n00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:03.663\nKPIs have to be SMART.\n\n143\n00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:06.124\nIn other words, they have to be specific.\n\n144\n00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:08.143\nThey have to be measurable.\n\n145\n00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:11.197\nThey have to be achievable.\n\n146\n00:08:11.197 --> 00:08:13.330\nThey have to be realistic.\n\n147\n00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.394\nNow I know some people use\nthe word relevant in there.\n\n148\n00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:18.690\nOkay, we can use either of those.\n\n149\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.590\nAnd they have to be timely or time bound.\n\n150\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.160\nThis is very important.\n\n151\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.200\nYou're gonna be tested on this.\n\n152\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.650\nI can tell you that now.\n\n153\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.960\nI will promise you that.\n\n154\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.057\nIt's not often I promise anybody anything,\nbut I'm gonna promise you this, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:32.057 --> 00:08:35.221\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are going to be tested in your\n\n156\n00:08:35.221 --> 00:08:36.900\npractitioner test.\n\n157\n00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.820\nYou're gonna be tested on KPIs.\n\n158\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.040\nYou're going to be tested on metrics.\n\n159\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.640\nI want you to be able to\nrecognize a good KPI.\n\n160\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.050\nAnd I want you to be able\nto recognize a bad KPI.\n\n161\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:55.010\nSo if I take a look at that KPI, a 10%\nincrease in customer satisfaction for\n\n162\n00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.820\nhandling incidents over the next\nsix months, that is a good KPI.\n\n163\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.610\nWe've got realistic or relevant in there.\n\n164\n00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.780\nWe've got time bound in there as well.\n\n165\n00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.050\nSo a KPI that doesn't have any mention\nof time, that's not a good KPI.\n\n166\n00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.520\nSo I need you to be very, very clear\non what constitutes a good KPI and\n\n167\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.440\nwhat is considered to be a bad KPI.\n\n168\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.739\n&gt;&gt; So even Jo, if I were to say I wanted\nto improve the efficiency on responses\n\n169\n00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:30.525\nto a ticketing system, I might say\nthat my tickets are addressed or\n\n170\n00:09:30.525 --> 00:09:34.899\nresponded to in less than one hour,\nor something like that.\n\n171\n00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:36.209\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n172\n00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:40.390\n[LAUGH] But you know,\nthis is why we have these discussions.\n\n173\n00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.819\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz these discussions are really\n\n174\n00:09:41.819 --> 00:09:42.690\nimportant.\n\n175\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.520\nFor a start,\nin ITIL we don't have tickets.\n\n176\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.509\nSo if you ever see the word ticket\nin ITIL, that's the wrong answer.\n\n177\n00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:51.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have a record.\n\n178\n00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.710\nWe don't have a ticket.\n\n179\n00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.739\nSecondly, responding within one\nhour over what period of time?\n\n180\n00:09:57.739 --> 00:10:01.483\nThat would be a priority one response for\ninstance within one hour or\n\n181\n00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:04.230\nmay priority two response within one hour.\n\n182\n00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.370\nBut there's a difference between, and\n\n183\n00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.090\nthis is where it can get quite difficult\nto explain, there's a difference between\n\n184\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:16.160\nshowing achievement of a KPI and\nthe actual time within the KPI.\n\n185\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.290\nSo what you're doing is,\n\n186\n00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.440\nyou want to measure against\neffectiveness and efficiency.\n\n187\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.956\nSo you want to see that we're being\nefficient, and you want to see that\n\n188\n00:10:26.956 --> 00:10:30.481\nwe're being effective,\nwhich means that response within one hour.\n\n189\n00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:38.110\nHowever, you haven't given me a time\nframe to say, is this working, yes or no?\n\n190\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.230\nAnd that's what the over\nthe next six months is.\n\n191\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.700\nIs this working, yes or no?\n\n192\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.084\nSo we want to have a time period to be\nable to prove that something is working\n\n193\n00:10:48.084 --> 00:10:48.591\nor not.\n\n194\n00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:49.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n195\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.950\n&gt;&gt; This is what we mean by time bound.\n\n196\n00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.980\nWhat you're referring to is the actual,\nthat's probably a service level target.\n\n197\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.630\nAnd if you want more information about\nservice level targets, then obviously go\n\n198\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.360\nto service level management in our\nservice design life cycle phase.\n\n199\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.884\nBut what we're looking at is we're\nlooking at proving that a critical\n\n200\n00:11:07.884 --> 00:11:10.197\nsuccess factor has been achieved.\n\n201\n00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:10.767\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n202\n00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:14.700\n&gt;&gt; And the achievement of a critical\nsuccess factor is not a yes or no.\n\n203\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.000\nIt's something that happens over time.\n\n204\n00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.430\nYou don't just measure sort of today,\nand say yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.570\nHey look, we're working.\n\n206\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so more appropriately\nit should say something like,\n\n207\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.300\nover the past six months after\nwe've implemented this new system,\n\n208\n00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.730\nwe're able to respond\nwithin x amount of minutes.\n\n209\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.180\n&gt;&gt; Right, and it gets actually a little\nbit more complicated than that as well, or\n\n210\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.270\na little bit more involved in that.\n\n211\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.460\nBecause when we consider that we're\nimplementing improvements here,\n\n212\n00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.480\nthat's what we're doing in partitioning.\n\n213\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.151\nWe're implementing the processes or\nnew services, etc.\n\n214\n00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:52.130\nAnd when we do that, we don't just\nsum the implement and say that's it.\n\n215\n00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.270\nIt went live last week.\n\n216\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.390\nLet's measure we've got\na key performance indicator.\n\n217\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.080\nAnd if we do, then that's it.\n\n218\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.520\nGreat, we've achieved our CSFs.\n\n219\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.900\nOf course you don't do that.\n\n220\n00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.276\nYou might want to measure as soon as\nyou've implemented something, but\n\n221\n00:12:05.276 --> 00:12:07.612\nthen you've got to measure\nover a period of time.\n\n222\n00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:12.246\nYou can't measure the success on\nanything based on its performance in\n\n223\n00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:15.280\nthe first week or in the first months.\n\n224\n00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.638\nIt's a bit like when you buy a new car,\nright, when you buy a new car.\n\n225\n00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:20.700\nAnd I'm British, okay.\n\n226\n00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.450\nAnd I can tell you now that I'm\nconcerned about things like petrol or\n\n227\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.800\ngas prices, all right,\ncertainly in England anyway.\n\n228\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.176\nBecause right now the equivalent\ngas price I think is about 11,\n\n229\n00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:36.180\n$12 per gallon.\n\n230\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.020\nYep.\nBelieve it or not now, highly.\n\n231\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.723\nYeah, I live in South Carolina and\n\n232\n00:12:39.723 --> 00:12:42.614\nI can tell you even now it's\njust over the $2 per gallon.\n\n233\n00:12:42.614 --> 00:12:46.530\nSo anyway, [LAUGH] I'm very concerned.\n\n234\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.890\nIf I'm in England, I'm very,\nvery concerned about my miles per gallon.\n\n235\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.810\nThen when I go and buy a new car,\nif I bought a new car in England,\n\n236\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:56.570\nI can't measure the miles per\ngallon in the first week.\n\n237\n00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.520\nI'm gonna measure that\nover a period of time.\n\n238\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.210\nI'm gonna go and buy a new car and\n\n239\n00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.340\nit might tell me that it can\nachieve 45 miles per gallon.\n\n240\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.781\nOkay, but under what conditions?\n\n241\n00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:11.030\nAnd I've gotta work out what conditions\nI'm going to be using the car in.\n\n242\n00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.990\nAnd then I have to then measure\nthem over a period of time\n\n243\n00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.110\nto see whether I'm achieving that.\n\n244\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.830\nI know many many many years ago I bought a\ncar that claimed to be able to do 40 miles\n\n245\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.270\nper gallon.\n\n246\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.250\nYeah, all right,\nit managed 40 miles per hour.\n\n247\n00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.180\nIf I drove everywhere at 20 mile an hour,\nit would do great.\n\n248\n00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.704\nBut given that I've got quite a heavy\nright foot and I drive everywhere at 100\n\n249\n00:13:31.704 --> 00:13:35.300\nmiles an hour, guess what, it was\naveraging about 22 miles per gallon.\n\n250\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.530\nSo it didn't actually\nachieve anything at all.\n\n251\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.350\nIt didn't help that I drive it down\nat the South of France at a 100 mile\n\n252\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.700\nan hour all the way there either.\n\n253\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.750\nSo you have to measure\nover a period of time.\n\n254\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.370\nYou cannot just measure the minute\nyou've implemented something.\n\n255\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.168\nAnd that's the challenge with KPIs.\n\n256\n00:13:53.168 --> 00:13:58.055\nKPIs have gotta be smart, but you also\ngot to employ common sense as well, okay.\n\n257\n00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:03.945\nSo now let's go into, cuz I talked\nabout in this particular section here,\n\n258\n00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:08.035\nwe're gonna look at lots of other\nfactors when it comes to measurements.\n\n259\n00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:11.044\nAnd we mentioned KPIs and this I've said,\n\n260\n00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:14.482\nwe need to have at least\ntwo to three KPIs per CSF.\n\n261\n00:14:14.482 --> 00:14:18.492\nPersonally I would tell you that\nI'm expecting to see at least\n\n262\n00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:20.402\nthree KPIs per CSF.\n\n263\n00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.702\nAnd if we go back to that\nparticular slide there,\n\n264\n00:14:22.702 --> 00:14:25.821\nyou'll see that our CSF\nis fairly intangible.\n\n265\n00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:27.711\nIt's fairly ambiguous.\n\n266\n00:14:27.711 --> 00:14:32.061\nIt's about improving quality, or\nit's about reducing costs, for instance.\n\n267\n00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:34.964\nAnd these are two different examples,\none based on quality and\n\n268\n00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:36.070\none based on quantity.\n\n269\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.891\nBut the KPI is very specific,\nvery specific.\n\n270\n00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:41.821\nIt's smart.\n\n271\n00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:48.990\nAnd so what we want to make sure that we\ndo when we are defining our KPI is that\n\n272\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:55.270\nwe have a spread of KPIs so that that will\ntell us whether we are achieving that CSF.\n\n273\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.450\nAnd we can add on to the KPIs as we\nprogress throughout any implementation.\n\n274\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.630\nYou might start off with maybe three.\n\n275\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.802\nAnd over a period of the next six months,\nyou might actually expand that to\n\n276\n00:15:06.802 --> 00:15:11.064\nhave six or seven KPIs that will tell\nus whether we're achieving that CSF.\n\n277\n00:15:11.064 --> 00:15:15.039\nWhat you get is another reason why you\ndon't actually measure that you've\n\n278\n00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:18.560\nachieved a CSF immediately\nafter any implementation.\n\n279\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.350\nCuz you might find that the KPIs\nthat you originally defined\n\n280\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.400\ndidn't quite cover the whole picture.\n\n281\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.380\nAnd so we might want to add on to those.\n\n282\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.650\nOne thing that we have to do is that we've\nlooked at the four reasons why we measure.\n\n283\n00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.880\nWe measure to validate.\n\n284\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.540\nWe measure to justify,\nto direct, and to intervene.\n\n285\n00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.310\nWe also want to ensure that we've got\na balance in our measurements as well.\n\n286\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.760\nAnd again, I'm thinking about a slam\nchart and our right charts here and\n\n287\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.310\nwe'll use something called\nthe Balanced Scorecard.\n\n288\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.410\nAnd a Balanced Scorecard is something\nthat was developed in the 1990s by Kaplan\n\n289\n00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.970\nand Norton.\n\n290\n00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.435\nIt's just about a strategic approach.\n\n291\n00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:59.635\nIt's about a strategic\nview to our metrics.\n\n292\n00:15:59.635 --> 00:16:02.663\nAnd it looks at metrics from\nfour different perspectives.\n\n293\n00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:08.410\nSo when I see any particular\nreport When I see a slam chart,\n\n294\n00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:13.925\nwhen I see a set of service\nlevel targets in service level\n\n295\n00:16:13.925 --> 00:16:18.987\nagreement, I want to see\na balance between money.\n\n296\n00:16:18.987 --> 00:16:23.334\nAnd I know that I'm working from\nthe bottom here upwards, but\n\n297\n00:16:23.334 --> 00:16:28.101\nI wanna see a balance between money And\nthe customer perspective and\n\n298\n00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:32.451\nthe process perspective itself and\nthe learning and growth or\n\n299\n00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:35.810\nas we call that in IT\ninnovation perspective.\n\n300\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.891\nAnd so here on our next slide,\nwhat we've got here is our ITIL,\n\n301\n00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:44.669\nan adaptation of the Kaplan-Norton\nscore card, so you'll see here that\n\n302\n00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:49.545\nwe're looking for KPIs then, so\nagainst any CSF, I want to see a balance.\n\n303\n00:16:49.545 --> 00:16:53.129\nAnd I want to see a KPI that\nlooks at value for money.\n\n304\n00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:59.610\nIf I go two slides back,\nthere you'll see that we wanted to have\n\n305\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.340\na 10% reduction in the cost\nof handling incidents.\n\n306\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.480\nThere you go, there's my financial\nperspective if I'm reducing IT costs.\n\n307\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.080\nBut I wanna have balance.\n\n308\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.540\nSo I probably want to have another\nKPI that looks at the customer\n\n309\n00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.570\nperspective here.\n\n310\n00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.480\nAnd here we go, If we look at\nquality example there I see our\n\n311\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.680\nCSF isn't on improving IT service quality.\n\n312\n00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.620\nBut we also want to have\nbalance that looks at internal.\n\n313\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.605\nSo this is the one that covers our\nbusiness process in the bottom right hand\n\n314\n00:17:29.605 --> 00:17:34.102\ncorner there that shows maybe our skilled\nstaff, that shows maybe our expertise,\n\n315\n00:17:34.102 --> 00:17:37.723\nthat shows whether we can actually\nmanage to achieve the process.\n\n316\n00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:44.520\nAnd then also we want to have one that\nlooks forward, and that's innovation.\n\n317\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.110\nWhat are we doing in the future and\n\n318\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.420\nso this is what we call\na balanced score card.\n\n319\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.460\nWhen we display any sort of slam\nchart out to the organization,\n\n320\n00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:03.890\nwe need to ensure that the display\nwe've given, that the report\n\n321\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:09.180\nwe're producing for our customers\ncontains that particular balance.\n\n322\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.900\nA balance between money.\n\n323\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.480\nWe've got to have to do\nsome reports with money.\n\n324\n00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.790\nWe've got to have some reports that\nthe customers are interested in.\n\n325\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.040\nWe've got to have reports\nthat are internal to us.\n\n326\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.630\nAnd of course think about language and\ncommunication and\n\n327\n00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.210\nthey'll be in our language.\n\n328\n00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.270\nAnd then we've got to have reports that\nshow what we're doing in the future,\n\n329\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.960\ncuz we don't want to stagnate.\n\n330\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.110\nAnd there's a lot to think about\nwhen it comes to reporting.\n\n331\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.790\nAlso, think about the types of\nmetrics that we're going to have.\n\n332\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.950\nSo technology metrics, well,\nif I go back to this particular diagram,\n\n333\n00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.520\ntechnology metrics are going to be\nan internal metric, aren't they?\n\n334\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.880\nOr are they?\n\n335\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.520\nCuz technology metrics will include\nfailure, for instance, of our laptops and\n\n336\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520\nour desktops.\n\n337\n00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.440\nThat would be a technology metric.\n\n338\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.510\nHow often does something fail?\n\n339\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.980\nWhereas, a process would be how\nquickly does incident management\n\n340\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:09.560\nrespond to that failure or how quickly do\nwe restore service after that failure?\n\n341\n00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.580\nSo surely,\n\n342\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.120\nif I go back to the balance score card,\nthen both of them are customer views.\n\n343\n00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.070\nBut they're also internal views\nbecause there's technology view there.\n\n344\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.480\nNow what about the cost of the incident?\n\n345\n00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.053\nWell, that would be a process metric, but\n\n346\n00:19:24.053 --> 00:19:27.295\nthat would be if\na financial metric as well.\n\n347\n00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:31.015\nAnd then an innovation metric would\nbe okay, so what I'm I going to doing\n\n348\n00:19:31.015 --> 00:19:35.065\nin terms of actually preventing\nthis from happening again?\n\n349\n00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:37.435\nI might be replacing that laptop.\n\n350\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.630\nThere's a balance to be had.\n\n351\n00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.460\nAnd we talk about tension.\n\n352\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.920\nIn other words having a balance\nbetween people and money and\n\n353\n00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.730\nhaving a balance with functionality and\nhaving a balance with time.\n\n354\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.670\nBut ultimately what you will see,\nand this is where it can get quite\n\n355\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.570\nconfusing for everybody, is that what you\nwill see is that we've got a balance not\n\n356\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.270\nonly between technology and process and\ntherefore the end to end service.\n\n357\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.530\nBut also, we've got a balance\nbetween our views as well.\n\n358\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.860\nAnd then we've got to consider\nthe reasons why we measure.\n\n359\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.310\nWe haven't even started\ntalking about metrics yet,\n\n360\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.450\nbecause there's still a lot more to cover.\n\n361\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.120\nSo right now then, we've looked at so\n\n362\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.790\nfar, in this episode,\nwe've looked at why we measure.\n\n363\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.030\nWe've looked at having a balanced\nview on what we measure and\n\n364\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.880\nthe tension metrics ensuring\nwe maintain that balance.\n\n365\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.690\nAnd we've looked at the types of metric,\nbut then look else why we measure,\n\n366\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.580\nwhich is we measure because\nwe want to show progress and\n\n367\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.960\nwe might show progress on a project.\n\n368\n00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.610\nThis is why we have a Gantt chart,\nfor instance in project management.\n\n369\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.467\nWe measure because we\nwant to show compliance.\n\n370\n00:20:52.467 --> 00:20:56.690\nWe also measure because we want to\nshow efficiency of our processes and\n\n371\n00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.400\nefficiency of our services.\n\n372\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.110\nAnd we also measure it because\nwe want to show effectiveness.\n\n373\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:08.470\nAlso in other words, does a service\ndo what it's supposed to do?\n\n374\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:12.430\nSo for now, what I'd like you to do for\nthis particular episode\n\n375\n00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.650\nis I would like you to review\nin your downloadable material.\n\n376\n00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.165\nI would like you to review\nthese slides again.\n\n377\n00:21:20.165 --> 00:21:22.500\nI'd like you to review this material,\n\n378\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:27.453\nbecause when we come back in a subsequent\nepisode, in episode two on the metrics and\n\n379\n00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:31.480\nmeasurements we're actually going\nto look at more definitions.\n\n380\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.880\nAnd we're going to look at more\nterminology to do with metrics.\n\n381\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.030\nAnd we're going to expand that view\nof the balance even more in depth.\n\n382\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:45.560\nAs I said, you're going to be tested\non this in your IT practitioner test.\n\n383\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.720\nBut more importantly than that,\nif you're trying to implement metrics,\n\n384\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.320\nif you're trying to implement ITIL or\nany new service or any new process or\n\n385\n00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.420\njust improve an existing service, you've\ngot to think about knowledge management.\n\n386\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.930\nYou've got to think about data,\ninformation, knowledge and wisdom and\n\n387\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.490\nthe fact that we have to be\nable to do something with\n\n388\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.100\nthe measurements that we're taking.\n\n389\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.590\nWe have to be able to make\nan informed decision.\n\n390\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.640\nSo so far, in this particular episode,\nwe've only looked at half the view.\n\n391\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.790\nAnd in our next episode,\n\n392\n00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.320\nwe're gonna look at the other half\nof that view on metrics as well.\n\n393\n00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, sounds like a plan.\n\n394\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.000\nSo ladies and gentlemen,\nstay tuned for more metrics and\n\n395\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.160\nmeasurements headed your way.\n\n396\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.550\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n397\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.910\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n398\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:29.780\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n399\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.068\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n400\n00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:38.188\n[MUSIC]\n\n401\n00:22:38.188 --> 00:22:40.899\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV\n\n",

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:14.569\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back to your\nITIL Practitioner series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.626\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.042\nThis is actually a Part Two,\n\n7\n00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:21.411\na continuation where we were looking\nat metrics and measurements.\n\n8\n00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.110\nAnd back with us today in studios\nwe have ITIL expert, Jo Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.280\nHow's it going today, Jo?\n\n10\n00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.291\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great.\n\n11\n00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.850\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI ask you that all the time.\n\n12\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But seriously?\n\n13\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.980\nI know this is a part two.\n\n14\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.010\nWe're picking up.\n\n15\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.090\nSo exactly where did we leave off?\n\n16\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.845\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nWell,\n\n17\n00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:40.830\nin our previous episode we started off by\nlooking at the reasons why we measure.\n\n18\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.730\nAnd I'm just going to bring\nthe slides up very,very quickly.\n\n19\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.645\nWe looked at the reasons why we measure,\nand those reasons were because well,\n\n20\n00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:51.854\nwe want to validate, that we're going in\nthe right direction, we want to justify,\n\n21\n00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:54.490\nyou now that's the see I told you so\nin measurement.\n\n22\n00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.610\nAnd then we want to direct and\nto intervene.\n\n23\n00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030\nThat's the amber and\nthe red in our slam charts.\n\n24\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.835\nAnd, we started off with defining\nour measurements using our vision to\n\n25\n00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.105\nmetrics tree.\n\n26\n00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:06.207\nNow, this is really,\n\n27\n00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.705\nreally important because obviously\nhere we are in Practitioner.\n\n28\n00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:12.765\nWe are actually applying\nITIL principles and\n\n29\n00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:16.497\nwe are implementing an ITIL based\nframework at this point in time.\n\n30\n00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:20.682\nWhile we are implementing ITIL base\nprocesses or maybe a new service.\n\n31\n00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:24.427\nSo, we need to understand how we\nactually measure whether that service is\n\n32\n00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:25.667\nworking on not.\n\n33\n00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:31.479\nSo, we looked at our vision to metrics\ntree, and then we looked at CSF and KPIs.\n\n34\n00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.079\nAnd actually how we would come up\nwith the KPIs that will tell us\n\n35\n00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.744\nwhether we are achieving our CSFs.\n\n36\n00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:42.540\nFrom then,\nwe looked at a balanced scorecard.\n\n37\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.420\nOur balanced scorecard means that\nwe have to demonstrate a balance in\n\n38\n00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.170\nall of the metrics that we take.\n\n39\n00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.876\nIt started off really simply by looking at\nthat relationship between CSFs and KPIs.\n\n40\n00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:57.515\nAnd we said,\n\n41\n00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:02.340\nwell, we have to have some KPIs that will\ntell us whether we are achieving our CSF.\n\n42\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.630\nAnd then we kinda go into the scorecard.\n\n43\n00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.020\nAnd we said, and these KPIs have got\nto be from these four perspectives.\n\n44\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.630\nAnd then that we looked\nat the types of metrics.\n\n45\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.890\nSo we said, well, okay those KPIs have\ngotta be from these four perspectives.\n\n46\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.010\nAnd they've gotta be based on\neither technology or on processes.\n\n47\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.690\nAnd we've also got to measure because\nwe want to measure progress or\n\n48\n00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.840\nbecause we wanna measure compliance.\n\n49\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.180\nOr efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n50\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.230\nWe've gotta have a balance\nbetween all of those.\n\n51\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.960\nAll of those have got to be a balance.\n\n52\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.100\nAs well as the balance on the scorecard\n\n53\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.660\nin order to demonstrate whether\nwe are achieving those CSFs.\n\n54\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.620\nSo that's where we ended\nin our last session And\n\n55\n00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.025\nyou're probably thinking to yourselves\nright now that's way too much information.\n\n56\n00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:56.040\nThat's way too much in\nthe way of definitions, etc.\n\n57\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680\nWell, guess what?\n\n58\n00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.710\nWe've got some more to come.\n\n59\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.655\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm ready.\n\n60\n00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:02.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if you say that by\n\n61\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.460\nthe end of this.\n\n62\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.010\nSo when we looked very quickly a balance,\n\n63\n00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.440\nnow we're gonna carry on looking at\nbalance and all of the different balances.\n\n64\n00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.883\nAnd so let's take a look at then\nleading and trailing metrics.\n\n65\n00:03:17.883 --> 00:03:21.280\nA trailing metric,\nis a metric that's backwards looking.\n\n66\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.184\nAnd in our previous session Cherokee,\nwe looked at, you mentioned the KPI to me,\n\n67\n00:03:26.184 --> 00:03:29.750\nand you talked about a KPI\nbeing resolved within one hour?\n\n68\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.650\nThat's what we consider\nto be a trailing metric.\n\n70\n00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I said to you that\n\n71\n00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.910\nall metrics have to be time bound.\n\n72\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.600\nThey have to be smart.\n\n73\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.585\nAnd so we have to say over\na period of say, six months, etc.\n\n74\n00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:44.530\nBut these are backward looking.\n\n75\n00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.530\nThese are what we call trailing metrics.\n\n76\n00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.020\nDemonstration of achievements.\n\n77\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.780\nWhat we've done?\n\n78\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.060\n&gt;&gt; Will this exercise type metrics?\n\n79\n00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.921\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so post implementation metrics,\nwe do that when we implement any project.\n\n81\n00:03:57.921 --> 00:03:59.491\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:01.200\n&gt;&gt; That's what we've achieved.\n\n83\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.780\nBut then we have what we\ncall leading metrics and\n\n84\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.480\nleading metrics are predictions.\n\n85\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n86\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.760\n&gt;&gt; Can you think of any metrics that you\nmight take that might be a prediction of\n\n87\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.145\nfuture behavior?\n\n88\n00:04:13.145 --> 00:04:16.052\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:17.177\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n90\n00:04:17.177 --> 00:04:22.260\nwhen we look at watching the news for\nthe weather perhaps?\n\n91\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.130\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Meteorology?\n\n92\n00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNo, that's very very true actually.\n\n93\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.970\nIt's a prediction of a future behavior and\nthat's exactly what we should be doing.\n\n94\n00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.873\nNow, you kinda looked to me in exactly\nthe same way as everybody always looks\n\n95\n00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:36.956\nat me.-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:04:36.956 --> 00:04:37.856\n&gt;&gt; When I say you've\n\n97\n00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:41.766\ngot to predict the future because people\ngot but how on earth can we do we that?\n\n98\n00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:45.190\nThis is IT and yet this is so simple.\n\n99\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.730\nBecause we do that every\ntime we create a plan.\n\n100\n00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.590\nIf we go back to service design and\nthen and in our service design life cycle\n\n101\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.454\nphase, we looked at planning for\ncapacity requirements and planning for\n\n102\n00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:59.026\navailability and\nwe looked at risk management.\n\n103\n00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:01.115\nWell, that's planning for\nthe future, right?\n\n104\n00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:05.420\nThey're leading metrics\npredicting what might happen?\n\n105\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.920\nWe do this all the time in financial\nmanagement way back in service strategy,\n\n106\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.870\nthat's what a budget is.\n\n107\n00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.660\nA budget is a leading metric, it's\n\n108\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.350\nhow much money we've got to spend over\nthe next year or over the next six months.\n\n109\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.710\nSo a leading metric is\nlooking at the future.\n\n110\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.649\nSo a leading metric is predicting say, how\nmany people we need on our service desk?\n\n111\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.420\nAnd we do that by looking\nat our previous trends.\n\n112\n00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.677\n&gt;&gt; Historical data and analyze from there?\n\n113\n00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:34.421\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n114\n00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo, this is just trend analysis,\n\n115\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.630\nexactly that.\n\n116\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.710\nSkills, what skills we're\ngoing to need in the future?\n\n117\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.360\nWe don't do that by trend analysis.\n\n118\n00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.160\nWe do that by looking at\nour project portfolio.\n\n119\n00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.456\nAnd then look at what's in\nour pipeline and say, okay,\n\n120\n00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:52.650\nwhat skills do our people need?\n\n121\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.200\nWe do that by analyzing our\ntraining needs analysis.\n\n122\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.420\nOf course, we conduct and we've already\nlooked at this in previous episodes.\n\n123\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.638\nWe conduct a training needs analysis\nwhenever we have a new implementation.\n\n124\n00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:11.351\nWhether it's a new process, whether it's a\nnew service, we conduct this training and\n\n125\n00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:12.430\nits analysis.\n\n126\n00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.216\nThese are then leading metrics.\n\n127\n00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:17.352\nThat's the result of these exercises.\n\n128\n00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:19.800\nThat shows us what we'll\nneed in the future.\n\n129\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.490\nSo whilst we might consider that it's\nreally difficult to predict the future.\n\n130\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.000\nAnd in fact,\n\n131\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.428\nthe weather forecasters will tell us that\nit's very difficult to predict the future.\n\n132\n00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:32.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because they always get it wrong.\n\n133\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.900\nThere was a famous one, a famous one\nback in, I think it was the 1980s.\n\n134\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.780\nAnd I know that somebody's gonna\nconvince me, tell me that I'm wrong.\n\n135\n00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.280\nBut in England, there was a rather famous\nprediction that went disastrously wrong,\n\n136\n00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.250\nwhere the weather forecaster stood up and\nsaid,\n\n137\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.710\nno, there's not going to\nbe a hurricane tonight.\n\n138\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.620\nAnd there was a hurricane.\n\n139\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.485\nAnd just about half of South London\nwas completely demolished.\n\n140\n00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:55.453\nSo [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Whoa.\n\n141\n00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:59.534\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, we know that it's not\nthat easy to predict the future.\n\n142\n00:06:59.534 --> 00:07:03.255\nHowever when it comes to IT we've\nalways got historical information and\n\n143\n00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.360\nwe know what's in our pipeline.\n\n144\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.770\nThat's the entire aim of service strategy.\n\n145\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.930\nSo it's really easy actually\nto generate leading metrics.\n\n146\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.750\nNow, I'm telling you that\nyou've got to have a spread.\n\n147\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.429\nYou've got to have a balance between\ntrailing and leading metrics.\n\n148\n00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:21.900\nSo what percentage do you\nthink then that should be?\n\n149\n00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.240\nWe've got to have a balance.\n\n150\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.173\nSurely a balance means 50-50, right?\n\n151\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:29.503\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I don't know because some,\nI would say less than that for\n\n152\n00:07:29.503 --> 00:07:33.405\nleading metrics but you're the expert so.\n\n153\n00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:34.783\n&gt;&gt; I see, I see [LAUGH].\n\n154\n00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:35.647\nThat's called deflection.\n\n155\n00:07:35.647 --> 00:07:39.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's go with 30% Alex.\n\n156\n00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:42.631\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:43.935\nI would say less than that.\n\n158\n00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:44.447\n&gt;&gt; Less than that?\n\n159\n00:07:44.447 --> 00:07:45.367\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n160\n00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:46.023\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n161\n00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:48.220\nI would say definitely less than that.\n\n162\n00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.960\nYou're talking about maybe 10 to-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n163\n00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.463\n&gt;&gt; No more than 20% leading metrics.\n\n164\n00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:54.884\nI'm not saying that you\nshouldn't have leading metrics.\n\n165\n00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:59.290\nOf course you should But we don't all\nhave a crystal ball on our desks and\n\n166\n00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.430\nwe don't need one, to be honest.\n\n167\n00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.341\nWe have to predict and\nit depends on the circumstance.\n\n168\n00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.920\nA capacity plan, well,\nthat's entirely forward looking.\n\n169\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.910\nAnd that's planning.\n\n170\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.040\nAnd so yes,\nthat's going to be 100% predictive.\n\n171\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.012\nBut then, if we're talking about maybe\nstaffing for the service desk, well,\n\n172\n00:08:17.012 --> 00:08:20.506\nif you take a look at all of the metrics\nthat we take on our service desk,\n\n173\n00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:21.537\nwe'll maybe have-\n\n174\n00:08:21.537 --> 00:08:22.186\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Difficult.\n\n175\n00:08:22.186 --> 00:08:25.671\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one or two reports that look to\nthe future, ones to do with trading and\n\n176\n00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:28.510\none's to do with staffing levels,\nand that would be it.\n\n177\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.680\nThe majority of our reports\nfrom the service desk,\n\n178\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.575\ncertainly at least 85 to 90% of reports\nthat are produced on a service desk,\n\n179\n00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:39.520\ngot to do with incident management,\nthey're to do with changed schedules.\n\n180\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.380\nThey're to do with time to\nanswer phone calls, etc.,\n\n181\n00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.340\nand most of those are training metrics.\n\n182\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.610\nSo that brings me into another balance\nthat we've got to look at, as well.\n\n183\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.942\nAnd all of these are factors\ninto our metrics, and so\n\n184\n00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:55.840\nthis is what you're gonna be tested on.\n\n185\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.085\nAnd this is what you have to do.\n\n186\n00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:02.508\nYou have to be able to deliver these when\nwe are implementing a new service or\n\n187\n00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:04.250\na new process.\n\n188\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.000\nAnd these are the different\nviews on our metrics.\n\n189\n00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.620\nAnd these are outside-in or inside-out.\n\n190\n00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:18.320\nOutside-in, well, these are metrics that\nare customer based, customer focused.\n\n191\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.280\nIn other words if you were outside of IT,\nthis is what you are interested in.\n\n192\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.879\nSo people that are outside of IT,\nthese are our customers and our users.\n\n193\n00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:31.625\nThey're interested in how quickly\nyou answer the telephone.\n\n194\n00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:35.450\nThey're interested in how\nquickly you will respond to, and\n\n195\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.380\nyou will resolve an incident.\n\n196\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.072\n&gt;&gt; How quickly we get that\nprinter back up and running?\n\n197\n00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:43.410\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what they're interested\nin, so that's a customer view.\n\n198\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.661\nSo customers who are interested\nin satisfaction, etc.\n\n199\n00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:48.697\nThere are inside-out metrics.\n\n200\n00:09:48.697 --> 00:09:52.240\nThere are internal metrics,\nthey're internal to IT.\n\n201\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.680\nI mean, you've got to mention there,\nof MTBF, Mean Time Between Failures.\n\n202\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.290\nThat's reliability and resilience.\n\n203\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.000\nYou're talking about\ntransaction throughput rates.\n\n204\n00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.856\nWe're talking about bandwidth,\nperformance, etc.\n\n205\n00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:07.360\nAnd as it says,\noften in a technical language.\n\n206\n00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.150\n&gt;&gt; And people usually outside the IT\ndepartment could care less about that.\n\n207\n00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.669\nThey're really looking for\nthat, outside-in, outside-in.\n\n208\n00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:18.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't expect\nthe people that are outside of IT to care.\n\n209\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.440\nAnd I wouldn't expect the people\nthat are outside of IT\n\n210\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.560\nto really understand\nthose type of metrics.\n\n211\n00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.350\nAnd that's okay.\n\n212\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.810\nThese are our internal metrics.\n\n213\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.732\nWe don't actually want to,\nand bearing in mind,\n\n214\n00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:34.850\ndon't forget these are our guiding\nprinciple of being transparent.\n\n215\n00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.460\nWe don't want to keep these from our\nend users and our customers, but\n\n216\n00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.342\nwe don't necessarily need to\nbroadcast these to our customers.\n\n217\n00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:43.462\nSo they're available if they want to see.\n\n218\n00:10:43.462 --> 00:10:44.710\nBut you know what?\n\n219\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.892\nWe're gonna talk about organizational\nchange management in a moment.\n\n220\n00:10:47.892 --> 00:10:52.810\nAnd we're gonna talk about in a subsequent\nepisode, about an attitude and\n\n221\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.110\nbehavior in a culture.\n\n222\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:01.064\nAnd we don't want to keep these things\nfrom our customers and from our users.\n\n223\n00:11:01.064 --> 00:11:04.554\nBut if we stop publishing technical\ninformation to our customers and\n\n224\n00:11:04.554 --> 00:11:08.886\nour users, they quite often think that\nwe're being patronizing, to be honest, and\n\n225\n00:11:08.886 --> 00:11:10.350\nso we don't want to do that.\n\n226\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.690\nAnd we certainly don't want to\nnurture any bad feeling between us.\n\n227\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:21.094\nSo we have to think that we need to have\na spread, a balance between outside-in and\n\n228\n00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:25.030\ninside-out metrics and\nhave that spread between customer-facing,\n\n229\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.620\nwhich is what would appear\nin our SLAM charts and\n\n230\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.000\nin our RAG charts to do with\nour service level agreements.\n\n231\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.200\nBut then, the inside-out metrics would\nbe those metrics that would appear in\n\n232\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.390\nthe SLAM charts to do with\nthe service level target in our OLAs,\n\n233\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.390\nin our Operational Level Agreements.\n\n234\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.280\nWe've got to be able to report on\nthe end-to-end service itself,\n\n235\n00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.940\nand this is specifically with services.\n\n236\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.860\nAnd what we've covered up until now is\nwell, they could be reports on processes.\n\n237\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.730\nThey could be reports on services.\n\n238\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.480\nThey could even be reports on our\nteams and our team performance.\n\n239\n00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.920\nBut what we have to be able to do is to\nreport on all of our services as well.\n\n240\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.030\nAnd to be honest,\n\n241\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.570\nwe're talking about both internal\nmetrics and those outside-in metrics\n\n242\n00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.790\nbecause our customers are interested\nin the availability of our services.\n\n243\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.580\nAnd they're interested in the reliability\nof our services as well, and\n\n244\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.390\nhow well they're performing.\n\n245\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.427\nSo a lot of performance metrics\nare gonna be inside-out metrics.\n\n246\n00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.394\nBut what we need to do is we need\nto ensure that we provide a view of\n\n247\n00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:31.515\nthe end-to-end service.\n\n248\n00:12:31.515 --> 00:12:36.004\nA service is a means of delivering\nvalue by facilitating outcomes\n\n249\n00:12:36.004 --> 00:12:38.300\nthat customers want to achieve.\n\n250\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.000\nSo we're delivering value to customers\nby facilitating their outcomes.\n\n251\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.560\nThat means that we have to be able\nto demonstrate our ability to\n\n252\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.210\ndeliver value, and our ability to\nfacilitate in a customer language.\n\n253\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:59.111\nWe have to articulate it in a customer\nlanguage as well as an internal language,\n\n254\n00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:03.171\nand this particular slide\nwill show that a lot better.\n\n255\n00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:07.610\nYou see right at the very,\nvery bottom we have our component metrics.\n\n256\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.240\nAnd these are internal.\n\n257\n00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.290\nIn fact, everything from this particular\nline downwards are going to be internal.\n\n258\n00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.421\nThey're going to be what\nwe call inside-out metrics.\n\n259\n00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:23.846\nBut then, here you'll see,\nthat we've got on, from there abovewards,\n\n260\n00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:26.460\nfrom the KPI, abovewards, is that a word?\n\n261\n00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.640\nIt's not.\nIt is now.\n\n262\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.710\n&gt;&gt; We can use that.\n\n263\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n264\n00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.378\nI have I just create a new word.\n\n265\n00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:37.380\n[LAUGH] And from our KPIs above, then we\nhave our scorecard, and our dashboard.\n\n266\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.750\nOur dashboard is our\nreal-time information.\n\n267\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.320\nThis is what's happening right now.\n\n268\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.985\nThis is our dashboard.\n\n269\n00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:46.765\nA scorecard is pointing time information.\n\n270\n00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:50.262\nSo our scorecard will show say,\nthe previous month, for instance,\n\n271\n00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.860\nwhat's been happening\nover the previous month?\n\n272\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.135\nOr what's been happening\nover the last six months?\n\n273\n00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:59.705\nAnd that feeds into our IT scorecard.\n\n274\n00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:04.040\nSo that's our internal scorecard, and\nwe've got to make sure that again,\n\n275\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.250\nwe've got a balance on what's\nbeen displayed in that scorecard.\n\n276\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.020\nIt's not all just about\none particular service or\n\n277\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.840\none particular component of a service.\n\n278\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.350\n&gt;&gt; So Jo, just to be clear here.\n\n279\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.220\nThis maybe a silly question, but you\njust mentioned an internal IT scorecard.\n\n280\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.070\nThis is something separate\nfrom a balance scorecard or\n\n281\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:27.000\nare we talking about that quadrant\nthat's located on that platform?\n\n282\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking about\nall of that balance scorecard.\n\n283\n00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And what we are saying here is that,\n\n284\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.875\nthese scorecards and these dashboards\nthat you have in front of you right now,\n\n285\n00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.690\nthey've got to be from\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n286\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.147\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So you are going to have a dashboard on\n\n287\n00:14:40.147 --> 00:14:42.683\nyour current finances, for instance.\n\n288\n00:14:42.683 --> 00:14:44.783\nHow much money have I spent?\n\n289\n00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.381\nWhen you log on to your bank account,\n\n290\n00:14:46.381 --> 00:14:49.071\nit tells you how much money\nyou've got in there right now?\n\n291\n00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:49.770\nYeah.\n\n292\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's your dashboard.\n\n293\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.850\n&gt;&gt; Brace yourself.\n\n294\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] that's the one.\n\n295\n00:14:52.898 --> 00:14:54.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's your dashboard.\n\n296\n00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:58.900\nWhereas if you were to wait for\nyour statement to come every month, well,\n\n297\n00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.170\nyour statement, that's your scorecard.\n\n298\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.980\nThat's your point in time information.\n\n299\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.540\nBut that doesn't give you\nan accurate reflection as to what's\n\n300\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.020\nhappening right now.\n\n301\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.100\nThat's told you what's happening over\na period of time, like a month, but\n\n302\n00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.020\nit doesn't tell you how much money\nyou've got in there right now.\n\n303\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.288\nSo we've gotta look at that-\n&gt;&gt; We'll just wing it.\n\n304\n00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:18.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, we'll just talk to it.\n\n305\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.328\nWait until the card gets refused,\n\n306\n00:15:20.328 --> 00:15:21.613\nthat's always-\n&gt;&gt; My strategy, right?\n\n307\n00:15:21.613 --> 00:15:22.386\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n308\n00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:24.583\nthat's my strategy when it comes to that.\n\n309\n00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:26.470\nAnd so that's exactly what we want to,\n\n310\n00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.040\nwe want to make sure that we've\ngot right the finance perspective.\n\n311\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.650\nAnd that we've got all of the other\nperspectives, such as the innovation\n\n312\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.180\nperspective and the internal perspective\nand the customer perspective, as well.\n\n313\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.160\nSo all of these feed into our scorecard,\nall of these.\n\n314\n00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:48.311\nWhen it comes to reporting, we have\nto have a policy for our reporting.\n\n315\n00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:51.927\nI'm gonna take you back to service\ntransition to that particular\n\n316\n00:15:51.927 --> 00:15:55.608\nlife cycle phase, and\nto that particular at shows, those shows,\n\n317\n00:15:55.608 --> 00:15:59.500\nbecause In service transition,\nwe looked at knowledge management.\n\n318\n00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.064\nAnd knowledge management is about\nensuring that we can make an informed\n\n319\n00:16:04.064 --> 00:16:09.021\ndecision from all of our reports and\nfrom all of the information that we have.\n\n320\n00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:11.505\nSo we'll have a policy for reporting.\n\n321\n00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:16.541\nAnd that policy will include\nwhat reports we're producing.\n\n322\n00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.353\nHow often we're gonna\nproduce those reports.\n\n323\n00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:21.531\nWho should have access to those reports.\n\n324\n00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:23.420\nWhat do we do about those reports?\n\n325\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.800\nRemember what I said about\nmaking an informed decision?\n\n326\n00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.450\nMaybe we need to have a meeting to discuss\nwhat decisions we're gonna be making\n\n327\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.690\nfrom those reports.\n\n328\n00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.650\nWe sometimes forget about that.\n\n329\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:38.460\nAnd what happens is you just get a pile of\nreports that land on your desk every month\n\n330\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.793\nor land in your inbox every month, and\nyou just look at them and go [SOUND].\n\n331\n00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.480\n[LAUGH] Right, great.\n\n332\n00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.310\nWe need to discuss what decisions\nwe're going to make for those reports.\n\n333\n00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.225\nThose reports have got to be in\nthe appropriate language, and\n\n334\n00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:53.690\nthe language of the audience.\n\n335\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.630\nEverybody, when they pick up any form of\ncommunication whether it's a nice pretty\n\n336\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.580\npicture by way of the report or\nwhether it's an email,\n\n337\n00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.930\nthey're gonna ask the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n338\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.947\nSo your reporting has to be relevant.\n\n339\n00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:11.906\nAnd we have to make sure that we've\ngot a framework in place to be\n\n340\n00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:15.649\nable to deliver reporting\non a regular basis but\n\n341\n00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:20.530\nthat that is subject to review,\nso that it remains relevant.\n\n342\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.700\nWe also have to ensure, and let's face it,\nwe're in the 21st century now,\n\n343\n00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.170\nso it shouldn't be difficult.\n\n344\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.960\nWe should ensure the reporting\ncan be customized.\n\n345\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.920\nDifferent people have different\naspects that they want to look at.\n\n346\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.620\nAs a service desk manager, you will have\none aspect that you want to look at.\n\n347\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.476\nYou wanna look at incident management and\nthe performance of certain services,\n\n348\n00:17:47.476 --> 00:17:50.762\nas far as incident\nresolution is concerned.\n\n349\n00:17:50.762 --> 00:17:55.690\nBut as the desktop support manager, you\nmight be looking at a different aspect.\n\n350\n00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:59.130\nAnd as a customer, you'll be looking at\na completely different aspect as well.\n\n351\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.680\nSo make sure that your\nreporting is customizable.\n\n352\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.690\nWe also want to ensure that we\nhave got a common framework for\n\n353\n00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.950\nwell, doing something with those reports.\n\n354\n00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.870\nIn other words,\nmaybe we want to undertake assessments.\n\n355\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.870\nSo what do we do with all of\nthese reports then that we take?\n\n356\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.834\nI said about making an informed\ndecision from reports, well-\n\n357\n00:18:24.834 --> 00:18:26.807\n&gt;&gt; Or making paper airplanes.\n\n358\n00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:27.732\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n359\n00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.956\n&gt;&gt; Yeah making paper airplanes,\n\n360\n00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:32.185\nuse them to decorate the room.\n\n361\n00:18:32.185 --> 00:18:36.261\nWe might wanna do, well,\na number of things, we might wanna perform\n\n362\n00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:41.135\nassessments or gap analysis or benchmarks,\netc, with the reports that we take.\n\n363\n00:18:41.135 --> 00:18:47.510\nA report is a snapshot over a period\nof time, a scorecard, or a dashboard.\n\n364\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.170\nIt's to do with performance.\n\n365\n00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.640\nAnd as we've seen,\nwe've got to get all of that balance.\n\n366\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.960\nIt's to do with progress and\n\n367\n00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.060\nmaybe compliance and\nefficiency and effectiveness, etc.\n\n368\n00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.090\nWell, what do we do with\nall of that information?\n\n369\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.980\nWe might want to make an assessment.\n\n370\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.430\nAn assessment is a formal\nmechanism as it says,\n\n371\n00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.710\nfor comparing where we are right\nnow against a particular standard.\n\n372\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.429\nSo for instance, CMMI.\n\n373\n00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:14.363\nNow, if you don't know\nanything about CMMI.\n\n374\n00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:19.910\nCMMI is an assessment for the maturity.\n\n375\n00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.100\nIt's a framework for\nthe maturity of processes.\n\n376\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:29.260\nAnd so you might choose to assess against\nthe CMMI model for processing maturity.\n\n377\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.920\nNow, feel free to look\nthat up on the Internet.\n\n378\n00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.053\nCMMI is just a complementary\n[INAUDIBLE] to ITIL.\n\n379\n00:19:36.053 --> 00:19:41.980\nAnd we might even assess some of\nthe processes according to their maturity.\n\n380\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.900\nAnd so, we might choose to do this.\n\n381\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.130\nWe might want to assess\nagainst a formal framework.\n\n382\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.910\nWe might want to what we call benchmark.\n\n383\n00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.850\nAnd benchmark means comparison to\neither an industry standard or\n\n384\n00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.079\nto our competitors, for instance.\n\n385\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.880\nAn assessment will give us an objective\nperspective, as it says here,\n\n386\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.140\nof our current state.\n\n387\n00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.767\nAnd we might use something like CMMI\nwhich is a commonly accepted or\n\n388\n00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:13.554\na universally accepted framework.\n\n389\n00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:18.783\nBut it's only gonna give you a point\nin time assessment of where we are.\n\n390\n00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:23.012\nSo if you want to actually use that to\nmake an improvement, then you have to\n\n391\n00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:27.260\nassess before, which is our baseline,\nbefore we make any improvement.\n\n392\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.440\nAnd we assess after we've made\nthe improvement to see whether we have\n\n393\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.950\nactually made that improvement.\n\n394\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.614\nJust be really, really careful because\nif you're doing an assessment and\n\n395\n00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:40.761\nthat's an assessment against a framework.\n\n396\n00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:44.111\nThen you might be trying\nto skew the figures,\n\n397\n00:20:44.111 --> 00:20:49.040\nto make it look as though you're\nbetter than you really are.\n\n398\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.030\nOr even to make it look\nworse than you really are.\n\n399\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.020\nAnd I've seen that happen as well,\nso be really careful.\n\n400\n00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.870\nAnd sometimes with these assessments, we\nwill advise and again, there are pros and\n\n401\n00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:01.710\ncons, advantages and\n\n402\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.551\ndisadvantages in using an internal person-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n403\n00:21:04.551 --> 00:21:07.295\n&gt;&gt; To perform an assessment or\na benchmark.\n\n404\n00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:09.231\n&gt;&gt; Just to remain totally objective there.\n\n405\n00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:12.680\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, an internal person's\nnot going to remain totally objective.\n\n406\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.349\nThey're always going to\napproach an assessment with\n\n407\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.860\nsome form of objective in mind.\n\n408\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.840\nSo it's going to be very,\n\n409\n00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.770\nvery subjective, whereas an external\nperson is gonna cost more.\n\n410\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.241\nAnd the problem with an external person is\nthat they don't understand your business\n\n411\n00:21:27.241 --> 00:21:27.880\nenvironment.\n\n412\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.940\nHowever, an external person performing\nan assessment is always going to give you\n\n413\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.560\na completely objective view.\n\n414\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.514\nSo you're going to get an accurate view\nand a realistic view of where you are.\n\n415\n00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:41.778\nI mean,\nyou might use all of this information,\n\n416\n00:21:41.778 --> 00:21:44.033\nthese reports to perform a gap analysis.\n\n417\n00:21:44.033 --> 00:21:48.570\nAnd a gap analysis is just really a form\nof assessment which is where we take our\n\n418\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.240\nbaseline and\nwe then compare it to where we want to be.\n\n419\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.520\nIn other words, let's say for\nprocess maturity,\n\n420\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.110\nwe're at level two on a CMMI scale.\n\n421\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.797\nAnd level two is just that, well,\nwe have some formal procedure in place and\n\n422\n00:22:03.797 --> 00:22:06.226\nit's being followed most of the time.\n\n423\n00:22:06.226 --> 00:22:08.090\n&gt;&gt; And we start at a level one, right?\n\n424\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.185\n&gt;&gt; We start at level zero.\n\n425\n00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:12.233\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And then it goes up to five, and\n\n426\n00:22:12.233 --> 00:22:14.950\nfive would be what we'd want to achieve?\n\n427\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.732\n&gt;&gt; Five is where a process is subject\nto continual service improvement.\n\n428\n00:22:18.732 --> 00:22:23.832\nSo five is where our process is so\nmature that we are actively looking for\n\n429\n00:22:23.832 --> 00:22:27.324\nways to improve that\nprocess on a regular basis.\n\n430\n00:22:27.324 --> 00:22:28.175\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n431\n00:22:28.175 --> 00:22:30.587\n&gt;&gt; So we have various different, and\n\n432\n00:22:30.587 --> 00:22:34.665\nby all means look it up on the Internet-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've talked about this,\n\n433\n00:22:34.665 --> 00:22:36.592\nI just wanted to kind of remember because,\nyeah.\n\n434\n00:22:36.592 --> 00:22:45.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and CMMI is not something that\nwe would tell you that you have to use.\n\n435\n00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.600\nBut it's another improvement\ntechnique that you can use.\n\n436\n00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.590\nIt's for assessments, as we say.\n\n437\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.380\nAnd it's available freely on the Internet,\n\n438\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.380\nso there's no reason why\nyou wouldn't use it.\n\n439\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.560\nIt's not something that you\nwould have to have training in.\n\n440\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.870\nIt's not something that you have\nto sort of attend a class for\n\n441\n00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.000\nthree weeks or whatever and then achieve\na certain level of qualification in.\n\n442\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.310\nIt's really simple in that we will use it\n\n443\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.620\njust to give us a snapshot of where\nwe are right now with our processes.\n\n444\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.958\nAnd it will tell us that actually, we're\nonly on a level between a level one and\n\n445\n00:23:22.958 --> 00:23:25.603\nlevel two and\nthat our process is fairly ad hoc.\n\n446\n00:23:25.603 --> 00:23:28.025\nAnd we know that really\nwhere we need to be for\n\n447\n00:23:28.025 --> 00:23:30.570\nour organization is\nprobably at level four.\n\n448\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.000\nWhere we don't necessarily need\nCSI in place right now but\n\n449\n00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.105\nwe do need to have a process\nthat everybody's aware of,\n\n450\n00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:39.790\nthat it's communicated and\neverybody's following it.\n\n451\n00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.720\nAnd it's measured and managed.\n\n452\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.670\nSo that would give us\nthen that gap analysis.\n\n453\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.548\nAnd the gap analysis is just looking\nat where we are right now and\n\n454\n00:23:47.548 --> 00:23:49.676\nthen comparing it against\nwhere we want to be.\n\n455\n00:23:49.676 --> 00:23:52.045\nJust shows us how much\nwork we've got to do.\n\n456\n00:23:52.045 --> 00:23:54.570\nAnd you can do a gap analysis-\n&gt;&gt; Identifying the gap, yeah.\n\n457\n00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.752\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyou can do a gap analysis on people.\n\n458\n00:23:57.752 --> 00:23:59.791\nOur skills, that's a gap analysis.\n\n459\n00:23:59.791 --> 00:24:04.424\nYou can do a gap analysis on our\nprocesses and on our technology as well.\n\n460\n00:24:04.424 --> 00:24:08.795\nAny improvement, there's gonna be some\nform of gap analysis there because even\n\n461\n00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:12.908\nwith the CSI approach, we looked at\nthis in a previous episode, with the CSI\n\n462\n00:24:12.908 --> 00:24:17.520\napproach, we work out where are we\nright now and where do we want to be?\n\n463\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.290\nOkay, and now, how am I gonna get there?\n\n464\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:25.112\n&gt;&gt; So when we're sitting in yoga class,\nwe can just be like, gap analysis.\n\n465\n00:24:25.112 --> 00:24:26.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe.\n\n466\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.100\n&gt;&gt; Whether we wanna be.\n\n467\n00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.224\nYeah, but some of us don't\nactually sit in yoga class.\n\n468\n00:24:30.224 --> 00:24:30.841\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't either.\n\n469\n00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:33.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n470\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.590\nwe might want to and\nI've already mentioned this benchmark.\n\n471\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.520\nA benchmark is a comparison\nagainst our competitors or\n\n472\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.095\na comparison against an industry standard.\n\n473\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.495\nWhen I will tell you.\n\n474\n00:24:46.495 --> 00:24:49.565\nAnd our next slide looks at\nthe benefits of benchmarking.\n\n475\n00:24:49.565 --> 00:24:54.585\nIt really is about us gaining an objective\nview, objective being the key\n\n476\n00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:59.785\nword in this, and comparing it to\nothers within the industry and\n\n477\n00:24:59.785 --> 00:25:03.585\nto say whether it's competitors or\nwhether it's an industry standard.\n\n478\n00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:05.245\nIt has to be objective.\n\n479\n00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:08.215\nAnd I will always,\nalways add in this huge,\n\n480\n00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:10.555\nbig caveat when it comes to benchmarking.\n\n481\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.400\nWe can do an assessment for\ninstance against,\n\n482\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.640\nlet's say our incidence\nmanagement process.\n\n483\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.260\nAnd we can assess that our incidence\nmanagement process is on level\n\n484\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.800\nthree of the CMMI scale.\n\n485\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.000\nAnd then we might benchmark that\nagainst industry standards for\n\n486\n00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.610\nour particular industry.\n\n487\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.530\nAnd we might say that everybody else in\nour industry is showing a level two and\n\n488\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:37.370\na half against the CMMI scale, but\n\n489\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.380\njust because we're showing a level\nthree doesn't that we're any good.\n\n490\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.500\nIt just means that we're doing\nbetter than everybody else.\n\n491\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:49.980\nAnd if we're showing a level two,\nwell it doesn't mean that we're bad.\n\n492\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.330\nIt just means that we're\nworse than everybody else.\n\n493\n00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:59.650\nYou've got to be very careful because\nthe benchmark could be your basis for\n\n494\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:01.690\nboosting self-confidence as it says there.\n\n495\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:06.898\nIt could be a basis for giving our\ncustomers trust and evidence that we're\n\n496\n00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:12.280\nactually doing really well because\nwe're better than our competitors.\n\n497\n00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.590\nBut it can also have\nthe opposite effect as well.\n\n498\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.120\nYou've got to be really careful because,\njust cuz a benchmark tells you that you're\n\n499\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.130\ndoing better than your competitors doesn't\nactually mean that you're doing well.\n\n500\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.930\nAnd just because a benchmark tells you\nyou're doing worse than your competitors\n\n501\n00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.840\ndoesn't really mean that you're\ndoing particularly badly either.\n\n502\n00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.580\nSo be careful with benchmarking.\n\n503\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:39.920\nBenchmarking is about being\nable to compare maybe costs,\n\n504\n00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.310\nmaybe comparing efficiency,\nmaybe comparing effectiveness.\n\n505\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.200\nBut all I would tell you\nis that benchmarking well\n\n506\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.770\nIf you're going to do it,\nconsider the relevance.\n\n507\n00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.020\nConsider the reasoning\nbehind the benchmarking.\n\n508\n00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.840\nAnd think about objectively what it\nis you're trying to achieve from that\n\n509\n00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.070\nbenchmark before you undertake\nthe benchmarking process itself.\n\n510\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.220\nBecause benchmarking,\nit's not insignificant.\n\n511\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.610\nIt's something that's gonna\ntake some time to do.\n\n512\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.340\nSo think about what you're trying to\nachieve before you undertake the exercise.\n\n513\n00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.770\nSo now we've looked at metrics and\nwe've looked at measurements and\n\n514\n00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.540\nwe've looked at assessments and we've\nlooked at having balance in our metrics.\n\n515\n00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.940\nYou have,\nwithin your downloadable materials,\n\n516\n00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.610\nquite a few exercises now looking\nat metrics and measurements.\n\n517\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.720\nNow I can tell you and I already have,\nthat from a standpoint of your exam,\n\n518\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.840\nyou're going to get between six and\n12 questions on metrics and measurements.\n\n519\n00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.420\nAnd they're going to test that you\nunderstand how important it is\n\n520\n00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.790\nto have that balance between\nall of your metrics.\n\n521\n00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.348\nAnd insure that you do have\na balance between inside-out and\n\n522\n00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:53.430\noutside-in, and leading and trailing.\n\n523\n00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.280\nAnd that you're able to display\nmetrics and obtain metrics from\n\n524\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:03.780\na balanced score card view and that you'll\nmeasure progress and compliance and\n\n525\n00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.280\neffectiveness and efficiency and\nyou understand why you're measuring.\n\n526\n00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:14.720\nSo my recommendation to you now is\nto review our previous two episodes,\n\n527\n00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.970\nlast episode and this episode, again.\n\n528\n00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.100\nTake a look at the slides that you have\ndownloaded in your downloadable material\n\n529\n00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:29.290\nand then undertake the practice exercises\nwithin your downloadable material.\n\n530\n00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.950\nIf you have any questions at all, then\nplease get in touch with us via the forum.\n\n531\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.260\nAnd I will be happy to help\nyou out as best as I can.\n\n532\n00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.920\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Jo.\n\n533\n00:28:37.920 -->

management.\n\n8\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.570\nAnd back in studios with us\ntoday we have Mrs. Joe Peacock.\n\n9\n00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.620\nHow's it going Joe?\n\n10\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely great, thank you Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.780\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing excellent.\n\n13\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.417\nThank you.\n\n14\n00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:32.490\nNow I know a lot the different\ntopics that we've discuss Joe,\n\n15\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.386\nwe've taken it we might have\nseen this topics before, but\n\n16\n00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:38.870\nhere we're looking at it from\na practitioners perspective.\n\n17\n00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.665\nSo how does that really affect when\nwe're looking at organizational change\n\n18\n00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:43.382\nmanagement?\n\n19\n00:00:43.382 --> 00:00:46.380\nAnd what would be some of these\nbig discrepancies or differences?\n\n20\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well the first thing you've got\nto do is understand what organizational\n\n21\n00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.470\nchange management is.\n\n22\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.324\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea.\n\n23\n00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:52.759\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n24\n00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.777\nThere is a huge big difference between\norganizational change management and\n\n25\n00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:58.765\nchange management that we know in IT.\n\n26\n00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:03.344\nAnd change management that we\nlooked at in service transition,\n\n27\n00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:08.003\nwe looked at the change to a configuration\nitem of CI or a service or\n\n28\n00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:12.435\nthe change to perhaps a process,\nor change to a document etc.\n\n29\n00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:15.553\nNow all of those would be\ncovered by change management.\n\n30\n00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:20.512\nIn all of those instances and examples we\nwould raise an RFC request for change,\n\n31\n00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:24.215\nwhich would be recorded and\ndocumented as change record.\n\n32\n00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:25.864\nAnd I call login system, and\n\n33\n00:01:25.864 --> 00:01:30.560\nthen it would be progressed through that\nparticular life cycle of that process.\n\n34\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.090\nThis is completely different.\n\n35\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.510\nOrganizational change management\nis all about actually looking at\n\n36\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.390\nthe people side of changes.\n\n37\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's about understanding people, and\n\n38\n00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.180\nit's about managing people through change.\n\n39\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.840\nAnd really just to understand in\nthe people either make or break a change.\n\n40\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.879\nPeople will either be the success or\nfailure to any change.\n\n41\n00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.080\nAnd so we've got to accept that and\nwe've got to deal with that.\n\n42\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.750\nWay too often in IT we look at\nthe technical side of things and\n\n43\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.150\nwe might even look at the process and\nthe documentation.\n\n44\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.390\nI mean let’s face it we've all got control\nin place for updating documentation.\n\n45\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.470\nWe've got controls in place for\nthe updating of our services.\n\n46\n00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.050\nSo when we wanna update a document,\nwe never overwrite the previous version.\n\n47\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.280\nWe take a copy of it and\nwe save it as something else.\n\n48\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.160\nWe do the same with our files on our PCs.\n\n49\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.570\nWe do exactly the same when\nwe're bringing in a new service.\n\n50\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.980\nWe don't ever change version one\nof any particular application.\n\n51\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.430\nWe'll take a copy of version one and\nthen we'll make the changes to it and\n\n52\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.960\nwe'll save that as version 2 or\nis version 1.1, depending on\n\n53\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.450\nour naming convention and depending on\nwhat it is that we've actually changed.\n\n54\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.390\nSo we look at the technical\naspect to any change but\n\n55\n00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.180\nwe never really spend any time looking\nat the people aspect of change,\n\n56\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.740\non the people aspect of any\nimplementation at all, and yet,\n\n57\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.190\nit's the people that we're\nexpecting to do the work.\n\n58\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.470\nWhen it's the people that\nwe're expecting to what,\n\n59\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.480\njust miraculously be on board with\nwhatever it is you're trying to achieve.\n\n60\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n61\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is that what you're doing,\nbecause in a sense that's exactly what we\n\n62\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.657\ndo in IT, we forget about the people,\nand we just think that if we've\n\n63\n00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:21.239\ngot the right processes in place,\nthen the people are just gonna come along.\n\n64\n00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.775\n&gt;&gt; I've actually been in a situation Joe\nwhere our superior literally just handed\n\n65\n00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:27.602\nus the book and move my cheese and\n\n66\n00:03:27.602 --> 00:03:32.430\nthat was about it That was the extent of\ntheir organizational change management.\n\n67\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.599\n&gt;&gt; Let me tell you a little secret then.\n\n68\n00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.270\n[LAUGH] Because I have something,\nI have something to tell you on that.\n\n69\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.629\nI was working a few years ago now, I was\nactually doing some work in Los Angeles.\n\n70\n00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.965\nAnd now I'm British in case you\nhadn't guessed by the accent, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:48.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n72\n00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:53.470\nwe tend to be a little more matter of\nfact than you guys are, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.990\nTend to get too much involved in the hype,\netc.\n\n74\n00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.710\nAnd one morning, I'd walked into the\noffice, and it was probably about 7:30.\n\n75\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.430\nAnd I'd walked into my office, and\n\n76\n00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.200\nI found sitting on my desk\nin my office was this book.\n\n77\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.491\nWho moved my toys?\n\n78\n00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:10.905\n&gt;&gt; You got that too.\n\n79\n00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:13.150\n[LAUGH] This is great.\n\n80\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.419\n&gt;&gt; So I picked this thing up, and I looked\nat it and thought what on earth actually,\n\n81\n00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.349\nthat wasn't the exact word I used.\n\n82\n00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.210\nBut it was like,\nwhat on earth am I gonna do with this?\n\n83\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.397\nAnd so\nI went downstairs into the cafeteria and\n\n84\n00:04:28.397 --> 00:04:32.668\nsome of my colleagues were there and\neating breakfast.\n\n85\n00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:38.160\nAnd I went downstairs and I said,\nI don't even really don't believe this.\n\n86\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000\nSomebody's left this book on my desk,\n\n87\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000\nwhat on earth do they think\nI'm going to do with that?\n\n88\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.630\nAnd one of the other managers\nthat looked at me and he said,\n\n89\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.410\nI know isn't it great Joe?\n\n90\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.900\nAnd I went [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.540\n&gt;&gt; Is there something wrong with you?\n\n92\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.802\nYeah.\nSo, we don't really go in for\n\n93\n00:04:55.802 --> 00:04:59.505\nthat type of motivation and\nstuff in the UK.\n\n94\n00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.550\nWe're a little bit more matter of fact.\n\n95\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.483\nYou don't wanna be in an environment where\nthere's a Brit in charge, put it that way.\n\n96\n00:05:06.483 --> 00:05:10.017\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not anything against\nthe bucket per say, it's just I mean,\n\n97\n00:05:10.017 --> 00:05:12.754\nyou need some kind of, hey,\nthis is what's happening,\n\n98\n00:05:12.754 --> 00:05:16.775\nthis why I'm giving you this book,\nand not just put it on someone's desk.\n\n99\n00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.420\n&gt;&gt; We tend to approach things\nfrom a much more practical sense.\n\n100\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.805\n[LAUGH] We tend to say, okay,\nthis is going to happen, but\n\n101\n00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:26.625\nthis is how you deal with it, and\nwe tend to be a lot more matter of fact.\n\n102\n00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.755\nBut then, with the organization\nof changed management you\n\n103\n00:05:29.755 --> 00:05:32.310\nhave to find some balance\nsomewhere in the middle.\n\n104\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.872\nYou don't just wanna dump a book on\nsomebody's desk and say, hey you go.\n\n105\n00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:40.564\nBut you have to respond to your\nindividual team and your people and\n\n106\n00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:46.625\nthat in itself makes a really good example\nabout understanding the organization and\n\n107\n00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:49.320\nwhat can make or break it, a change.\n\n108\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.020\nBecause, you put a book like that\non somebody's desk who's British.\n\n109\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.044\nAnd they're probably just going to look\nat it with just complete horror on\n\n110\n00:05:57.044 --> 00:05:57.592\ntheir face.\n\n111\n00:05:57.592 --> 00:05:59.420\nAnd they're probably just\ngonna turn around and say,\n\n112\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.900\nwhat on earth have you done that for?\n\n113\n00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.280\nWhere as you're more\ninclined to read that book.\n\n114\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.787\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYou're more inclined to look at\n\n115\n00:06:05.787 --> 00:06:07.985\nthat book and go.\n\n116\n00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:10.050\nSomebody's left a book for me.\n\n117\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.800\nOkay, let me take a look at it.\n\n118\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.690\nIt's about understanding your people.\n\n119\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.330\nAnd that's what organizational change\nmanagement is about it's about\n\n120\n00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.760\nunderstanding your people and\nwhat they respond to.\n\n121\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.660\nIf you put a book on my desk.\n\n122\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.293\nI'm just gonna look at it and go I don't\nknow what you want me to do with this, but\n\n123\n00:06:26.293 --> 00:06:29.496\nI'm certainly not reading it, and\nyet you put a book on your desk, and\n\n124\n00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:30.720\nyou're going to read it.\n\n125\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.221\nYou're gonna think it's a pretty\ncool way of managing it, but\n\n126\n00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.818\nnevertheless you're\nstill going to read it.\n\n127\n00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:38.810\nWe won't [LAUGH].\n\n128\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.040\nDon't do that to a British person okay,\nsit down and talk to them [LAUGH].\n\n129\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.280\nPlease don't just dump a book\non their desk, that won't work.\n\n130\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.740\nBut this is what organizational\nchange management is about,\n\n131\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.990\nit's really about understanding\nthe people aspect to change.\n\n132\n00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.610\nOne of the first things that you've got\nto understand is who your people are,\n\n133\n00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.520\nand we talk about the ABC of ICT,\n\n134\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.657\nand it just sounds good but it\n&gt;&gt; Like alphabet soup there.\n\n135\n00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:03.506\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:10.330\nIt's just really the ABC of IT, which is\nthe attitude, behavior and culture of IT.\n\n137\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.840\nAttitudes drive behavior and the general\nbehavior of absolutely everybody\n\n138\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.150\nis what denotes the culture of the\norganization and the culture of the team.\n\n139\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.370\nAnd so, we have to understand the ABC of\n\n140\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.580\nus in our IT and\nthe ABC of our environment.\n\n141\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.550\nThen it's not just within our environment.\n\n142\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.780\nIf we're implementing an organizational\nwide change, then it's the attitude,\n\n143\n00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.885\nthe behavior, the cultural of absolutely\neverybody in the organization,\n\n144\n00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:41.455\neverybody that's going to\nbe affected by that change.\n\n145\n00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:47.415\nSo what organizational change management\ndoes then is it looks at the culture and\n\n146\n00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:50.285\nit looks at the behavior and\nit looks at attitude.\n\n147\n00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.886\nWe have to acknowledge that,\nwe don't like using that word.\n\n148\n00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:56.543\nWhen it comes to IT, when it comes\nto training we like to think of that\n\n149\n00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:59.827\nas something to do with HR and\nwe don't like to use that word.\n\n150\n00:07:59.827 --> 00:08:06.300\nBut attitude exists, and attitude's gonna\nhave a huge, big impact on any change.\n\n151\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.140\nTake a look at this third bullet\npoint down in this particular slide.\n\n152\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.598\nWe've got to actively seek\nout sources of resistance.\n\n153\n00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:17.390\nThat's what OCM does, we seek out\nsources of resistance, and we look for\n\n154\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.530\nways to overcome that resistance,\nand it's all about the soft skills.\n\n155\n00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.210\nThis is not about a technical skill,\nthis is about the soft skill.\n\n156\n00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.760\nIt talks about overcoming resistance,\nand we're gonna talk about,\n\n157\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.270\na little bit later in this section,\nseeking out sort of active resistance.\n\n158\n00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.390\nIt's not just enough to\novercome resistance.\n\n159\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.468\nWe don't just wanna drag people along,\nkicking and screaming.\n\n160\n00:08:41.468 --> 00:08:44.460\nIt's never gonna be a good\nidea just to ensure that\n\n161\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.560\npeople just don't say anything.\n\n162\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.780\nAll right, the kind of attitude of,\nwell, just sit there and\n\n163\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.230\nshut up is not going to work,\nthat's not what we want.\n\n164\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.320\nWe actually want to get people\nactively engaged in any change and\n\n165\n00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.470\nin any implementation.\n\n166\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.396\nThis is not gonna work.\n\n167\n00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:04.280\nImplementing an ITIL-based framework,\n\n168\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.990\nimplementing an improvement, implementing\na new service is not going to work\n\n169\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.650\nif you've got people that\nare actively resisting.\n\n170\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.480\nOr, people that are just sitting back,\nand sort of folding their arms and\n\n171\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.420\ngoing, yeah, all right.\n\n172\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.820\nAnd you know, right, and I'll talk to\nevery single one of you out there, because\n\n173\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.640\nyou all know that there is somebody in\nyour office that's doing that right now.\n\n174\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.630\nThere is somebody in your office that's\nsitting there with their arms folded\n\n175\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.690\ngoing, yeah, okay then.\n\n176\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.250\n&gt;&gt; We already have done it this way for\nso long.\n\n177\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.540\nWhy do we have to do it differently?\n\n178\n00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.335\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's a sort of resistance,\nthe people that say, hey, you know what,\n\n179\n00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:38.930\nwe've already done it this way.\n\n180\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:44.313\nSo we've done it this way since the year\ndot, and therefore, I don't care.\n\n181\n00:09:44.313 --> 00:09:46.515\nThis is the way we're gonna carry on,\nand it works, right?\n\n182\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.992\nIt really is based on the fact that\nthe success of any change is, well,\n\n183\n00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:59.563\nit's going to happen, whether we like\nit or not, in a lot of instances.\n\n184\n00:09:59.563 --> 00:10:04.369\nBut nevertheless,\nwe can hugely influence every single\n\n185\n00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:08.890\nimplementation, just with our attitude.\n\n186\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.310\nI mentioned in a previous episode\nabout visible ongoing sponsorship.\n\n187\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.990\nAnd the fact that it's not just enough for\nmanagement to stand up at the beginning\n\n188\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.920\nof any new project and at the beginning of\nany new implementation and say, hey, look,\n\n189\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.680\nthis is gonna happen, it's a great idea.\n\n190\n00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.810\nThat's not good enough, because then what\nhappens is that management disappear,\n\n191\n00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.400\nthe importance is therefore lost.\n\n192\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.770\nNobody really understands\nthe importance of any implementation,\n\n193\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.986\nbecause as far as they're concerned,\nmanagement have forgotten about it.\n\n194\n00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:44.490\nAnd so this is when rumors start, and this\nis what fosters a really bad attitude.\n\n195\n00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:49.080\nHave you ever heard phrases like, yeah,\n\n196\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.420\nit was PMP last month, and\nit was lean the month before that,\n\n197\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.405\nand now it's ITIL,\nit'll be something else next month?\n\n198\n00:10:56.405 --> 00:11:01.582\nRight, we've all heard that, and\nwe've heard that in various, different\n\n199\n00:11:01.582 --> 00:11:06.160\nsort of environments, various, different\nsituations, but we've all heard it.\n\n200\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.780\nIt's gonna be something else next month,\njust sit back and watch.\n\n201\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.553\nAnd that's a source of resistance, and\nthat's something that we've not just got\n\n202\n00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:17.184\nto overcome, it's not something\nthat we've got to iron out.\n\n203\n00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:20.570\nBut we've literally got to\nturn these people around.\n\n204\n00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.100\nWe've got to identify\nthe sources of resistance, and\n\n205\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.510\nthen we've got to work out what\nwe're going to do about it.\n\n206\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.890\nThis is not just a case of saying,\nhey, look,\n\n207\n00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.590\nwe're gonna take you outside with\na baseball bat if you don't comply.\n\n208\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.382\nThat's not good enough.\n\n209\n00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:39.020\nWe've gotta get people on board, and\nit's all about clear communication, and\n\n210\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.670\nit's about effective communication.\n\n211\n00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.155\nAnd we do have another episode\nthat talks about communication,\n\n212\n00:11:44.155 --> 00:11:48.765\nand good communication within IT,\nand also outside of IT as well.\n\n213\n00:11:48.765 --> 00:11:52.380\nYou see, let's think about this.\n\n214\n00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.169\nEverybody is affected by any change and\n\n215\n00:11:56.169 --> 00:11:59.824\nany implementation in\na completely different way.\n\n216\n00:11:59.824 --> 00:12:03.050\nThey've all got a completely\ndifferent perspective.\n\n217\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.800\nGood communication not only is in\nthe language of the audience, so\n\n218\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.920\nwhen I talk to you, I'm gonna talk to\nyou in a language that you understand.\n\n219\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.460\nWe've already had a discussion\nabout the alphabet,\n\n220\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.954\nand a discussion about spelling,\nand the fact that I'm right.\n\n221\n00:12:16.954 --> 00:12:18.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n222\n00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.245\nwe've already had that discussion.\n\n223\n00:12:20.245 --> 00:12:23.677\nAnd communication must be in\nthe language of the audience, but\n\n224\n00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:27.711\ncommunication's also got to answer\nthe question, what’s in it for me?\n\n225\n00:12:29.998 --> 00:12:33.510\nAnd so\nwhen it comes to implementing any change,\n\n226\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:39.980\nunless you can answer that question,\nyour change is not going to be successful.\n\n227\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.430\nIf I'm making a change to the way\nthat we work, then it’s not going to\n\n228\n00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.850\nsuccessful if I haven't answered\nthe question, what’s in it for me?\n\n229\n00:12:49.242 --> 00:12:53.460\nAnd in exactly the same way, if people ask\nme to do something completely different,\n\n230\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.110\nunless they can answer that question,\nwhat's in it for\n\n231\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.660\nyou, then maybe I'm not\ngoing to be on board.\n\n232\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.833\nI have to understand how\nit's going to affect me,\n\n233\n00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:05.166\nand that's exactly\nthe same with any change.\n\n234\n00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:10.270\nWe have to understand how it's going\nto affect me if we don't comply.\n\n235\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.520\nBut compliance is not just\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n236\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.284\nWe're looking to get\npeople actively on board.\n\n237\n00:13:16.284 --> 00:13:19.387\nSo we have to understand\nwhat's important to everybody,\n\n238\n00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:24.760\nbecause what's important to Cherokee is\nnot necessarily what's important to me.\n\n239\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.110\nAnd so if somebody's trying to implement a\nchange that's going to affect both of us,\n\n240\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.610\nthen we've both gotta be\nreally happy with this.\n\n241\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.810\nAs it says, an improvement for me is not\nan improvement for you, necessarily.\n\n242\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.420\nAnd an improvement for you, I might\njust shrug my shoulders and say, well,\n\n243\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.440\nI couldn't care less about that.\n\n244\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.419\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n245\n00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:47.910\nwe have to consider how we're\ngoing to engage people.\n\n246\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.650\nIt's not just about convincing\npeople that it's a good idea,\n\n247\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.150\nyou've got to bring them on board.\n\n248\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.080\nThey've got to be supported,\nthey've not just got to be convinced.\n\n249\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.300\nSo we generally do that by way of, well,\nas I said, communication, but also,\n\n250\n00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.090\nwe do that by good marketing,\nabout selling ourselves.\n\n251\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.550\nThat's something that we're\npretty poor at in IT.\n\n252\n00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.470\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n253\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.810\n&gt;&gt; We are absolutely terrible\nat selling ourselves.\n\n254\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.380\nWe would not make very\ngood used car salesmen.\n\n255\n00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can only speak for myself,\ncuz it's definitely not my strong suit.\n\n256\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.381\nYou have to nurture it and improve it,\n\n257\n00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:27.897\njust like with other different types\nof social skills and things like that.\n\n258\n00:14:27.897 --> 00:14:30.394\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in IT, we generally don't.\n\n259\n00:14:30.394 --> 00:14:32.389\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We kinda like to stick to ourselves,\n\n260\n00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:34.994\nand we're not really good\nat selling ourselves.\n\n261\n00:14:34.994 --> 00:14:38.420\nWe're not really good at\nthe marketing side of things.\n\n262\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.910\nWe just know that, hey, look,\nthis is what we are good at,\n\n263\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.180\nthese are our technical skills.\n\n264\n00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.910\nAnd therefore, if you don't like it, okay\nthen, [LAUGH] and that's the way we are.\n\n265\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:50.479\nThis is what we deliver for you,\n[LAUGH] this is the value that we deliver.\n\n266\n00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:52.520\nIf you can't see that,\nthen that's your problem, right?\n\n267\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.350\nThat's the way we look at it.\n\n268\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.970\nThat's not the case,\nwe've gotta better at marketing ourselves.\n\n269\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.370\nI think about, there are some service\nproviders out there, and I know of\n\n270\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.880\none service provider, specifically, that's\nvery, very good at marketing themselves.\n\n271\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.838\nThat's very, very good at understanding\nwho their customer base is, and is\n\n272\n00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:19.196\nabsolutely really good, and well, amazing\nat appealing to their customer base.\n\n273\n00:15:19.196 --> 00:15:20.382\n&gt;&gt; Are you talking about Starbucks?\n\n274\n00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:21.247\n&gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Starbucks,\nno, no, no.\n\n275\n00:15:21.247 --> 00:15:24.023\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually, I wish I was,\n\n276\n00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:24.956\nnow you mention that.\n\n277\n00:15:24.956 --> 00:15:27.500\nNow I need coffee, right, gee,\nthanks for that, Cherokee.\n\n278\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.940\n&gt;&gt; I've been thinking\nabout that unicorn drink.\n\n279\n00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.354\nEw, it's nothing but sugar and sugar, and\nthen everyone wanted one, it seems like.\n\n280\n00:15:33.354 --> 00:15:35.483\n&gt;&gt; Everyone wanted one, right, yeah.\n\n281\n00:15:35.483 --> 00:15:38.044\n[LAUGH] Yeah, no,\nI'm thinking about Apple.\n\n282\n00:15:38.044 --> 00:15:40.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Steve Jobs, great storyteller.\n\n283\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so think about this,\nand we call this, by the way,\n\n284\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.440\nthe Gartner hype cycle.\n\n285\n00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.535\nGartner came up with this hype cycle,\nand it's so true, so so true.\n\n286\n00:15:50.535 --> 00:15:54.805\nJust think about this, every year now,\nwe expect a new product launch from Apple,\n\n287\n00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:55.426\ndon't we?\n\n288\n00:15:55.426 --> 00:15:56.282\nA new cellphone.\n\n289\n00:15:56.282 --> 00:15:57.074\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n290\n00:15:57.074 --> 00:15:58.244\n&gt;&gt; Every single year, we expect it.\n\n291\n00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:00.005\n&gt;&gt; What the new feature's gonna be?\n\n292\n00:16:00.005 --> 00:16:01.122\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n293\n00:16:01.122 --> 00:16:04.086\n&gt;&gt; Are we gonna have a charging\nport this time around?\n\n294\n00:16:04.086 --> 00:16:05.369\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n295\n00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:07.650\nApple are absolutely fantastic at this.\n\n296\n00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.564\nAnd I look at this Gartner Hype Cycle and\nI just think to myself, this is my life.\n\n297\n00:16:11.564 --> 00:16:14.606\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is my life.\n\n298\n00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:19.460\nA few years ago, Apple launched\nthis piece of wearable technology.\n\n299\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.618\nAbsolutely amazing, I thought.\n\n300\n00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:25.400\nAnd here, here was my sort of here it is,\nmy technology trigger.\n\n301\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.190\nThis is when they launched that\npiece of wearable technology.\n\n302\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.630\nWhen they announced it and they said, and\nthis is what it's going to do for you.\n\n303\n00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.449\nSo by the time that it had been released,\nwell,\n\n304\n00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:41.236\nI was sorry if ever I had this\nwatch-shaped hole in my life.\n\n305\n00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:43.012\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I really did.\n\n306\n00:16:43.012 --> 00:16:43.709\n&gt;&gt; I get it.\n\n307\n00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:47.020\n&gt;&gt; But [LAUGH] so I was expecting this.\n\n308\n00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.570\nIt was gonna read my texts for me.\n\n309\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.230\nIt was gonna tell me where to go because\nit would synchronize in my phone.\n\n310\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.270\nAnd when I put something into the Maps,\nit was gonna tell me where to go.\n\n311\n00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.110\nIt was going to do absolutely\neverything for me.\n\n312\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.700\nIt was going to pay for\nmy Starbucks for me.\n\n313\n00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.989\nIt was going to make me a cup of tea\nevery morning when I got out of bed.\n\n314\n00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:11.867\nI had this, what we call,\nthis inflated peak of expectations.\n\n315\n00:17:11.867 --> 00:17:13.747\nAnd then I bought it.\n\n316\n00:17:13.747 --> 00:17:19.308\nAnd here we are, straight away down\nto my trough of disillusionment\n\n317\n00:17:19.308 --> 00:17:20.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.863\n&gt;&gt; When I realized [LAUGH]-\n\n319\n00:17:21.863 --> 00:17:23.500\n&gt;&gt; That's why I hang out most of the time.\n\n320\n00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.684\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n321\n00:17:24.684 --> 00:17:28.353\n[LAUGH] It's the story of my life because\nthis is when I realize that actually,\n\n322\n00:17:28.353 --> 00:17:30.836\nmaybe this is watch could\ndo all of those things, but\n\n323\n00:17:30.836 --> 00:17:32.999\nit was absolutely no good for\nme whatsoever.\n\n324\n00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:35.254\nBecause you know I'm getting\non a bit in years now and\n\n325\n00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.750\nI couldn't see anything anyway.\n\n326\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.684\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n327\n00:17:37.684 --> 00:17:41.680\nthe fact that it did have my texts for\nme, that was absolutely amazing.\n\n328\n00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.208\nI couldn't read them,\nbut it had them anyway.\n\n329\n00:17:44.208 --> 00:17:45.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n330\n00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:48.644\nthe fact that it would pay for\nmy Starbucks for me was absolutely great.\n\n331\n00:17:48.644 --> 00:17:52.348\nBut again, I couldn't actually get to my\nStarbucks app because the icon was too\n\n332\n00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:53.297\nsmall on the thing.\n\n333\n00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:53.978\nSo really,\n\n334\n00:17:53.978 --> 00:17:58.138\nI didn't know whether I had enough\nmoney in my Starbucks account or not.\n\n335\n00:17:58.138 --> 00:17:59.689\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n336\n00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:04.090\nI ended up in this trough\nof disillusionment.\n\n337\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.262\nAnd this is what happens if we mis-sell.\n\n338\n00:18:07.262 --> 00:18:09.158\nIf we mis-sell any change,\n\n339\n00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:14.065\nthen your customers will end up [LAUGH]\nin this trough of disillusionment.\n\n340\n00:18:14.065 --> 00:18:15.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n341\n00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:18.221\nit takes a little bit of time\nbefore I realize that actually,\n\n342\n00:18:18.221 --> 00:18:20.904\nI can get my apps to work\nbecause I can set it to vibrate.\n\n343\n00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:22.933\nSo now, when I come up to a junction,\n\n344\n00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:25.955\nit's gonna vibrate at me to\ntell me that I need to turn.\n\n345\n00:18:25.955 --> 00:18:30.098\nAnd it'll open my front door before I\nactually get to the front door of my\n\n346\n00:18:30.098 --> 00:18:32.044\nhouse, it'll unlock it for me.\n\n347\n00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:35.032\nAnd it can do a lot of things.\n\n348\n00:18:35.032 --> 00:18:38.155\nThere were some things that it\ncan't do that I wanted it to do.\n\n349\n00:18:38.155 --> 00:18:40.733\nAll right,\nno matter what font type I put it on,\n\n350\n00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:43.390\nI still never be able to read text on it.\n\n351\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.582\nBut I can talk to Siri on it,\nso that's great.\n\n352\n00:18:45.582 --> 00:18:50.093\nSo I end up going through this slope\nof enlightenment where I learn\n\n353\n00:18:50.093 --> 00:18:55.680\nexactly what it can do before I\nreach this plateau of productivity.\n\n354\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.234\nOkay, that's a funny example,\nbut it's my life, by the way.\n\n355\n00:18:59.234 --> 00:19:01.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be funny, but\n\n356\n00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:03.301\nit's true [LAUGH].\n\n357\n00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:06.266\nBut this is so true, and\nif we get it wrong, and\n\n358\n00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:11.228\nI always talk about Apple as being really,\nreally good at service strategy.\n\n359\n00:19:11.228 --> 00:19:12.865\nThey're fantastic at strategy.\n\n360\n00:19:12.865 --> 00:19:17.937\nCuz when it comes to the pipeline and\nit comes to identifying areas for\n\n361\n00:19:17.937 --> 00:19:22.749\nimprovement, and it comes to\nidentifying new opportunities and\n\n362\n00:19:22.749 --> 00:19:27.140\nnew technology,\nthey're absolutely fantastic at that.\n\n363\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.880\nAnd they understand their customers.\n\n364\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.000\nHowever, look at this\ntrough of disillusion.\n\n365\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.240\nRemember the iPhone 4?\n\n366\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.900\nThe iPhone 4,\n\n367\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:42.490\nwhere remember a service is a means of\ndelivering value by facilitating outcomes.\n\n368\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.820\nWasn't it the iPhone 4, the outcomes it\nneeded to facilitate was to be able to\n\n369\n00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.280\nmake and receive a phone call,\nand that one couldn't?\n\n370\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.991\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the antenna placement\nwas all out of whack.\n\n371\n00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.871\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so you had to go and\n\n372\n00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:58.384\nbuy a bumper [LAUGH] in order to put\na bit of plastic or silicone to go around\n\n373\n00:19:58.384 --> 00:20:03.880\nthe phone in order to be able to make\na phone call or receive a phone call.\n\n374\n00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.480\nSo we've gotta be careful in IT.\n\n375\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.880\nWe gotta make sure that\nthis doesn't happen.\n\n376\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.540\nThis is kind of a warning.\n\n377\n00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.180\nThis shouldn't be real life,\nbut unfortunately,\n\n378\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.490\nthe Gartner Hype Cycle tends to be\nreal life with a lot of IT changes.\n\n379\n00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.800\nAnd as we become more mature, then we\nreach that plateau of productivity.\n\n380\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.420\nBut really, we need to make sure that\nwhen we implement any change within IT,\n\n381\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.420\nand especially when we're deploying\nthe change into the live environment and\n\n382\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.840\nwith our customers, that this is reality,\nand that this does exist.\n\n383\n00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.680\nSo we've gotta try and\neven out this particular curve.\n\n384\n00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.462\nWe gotta reduce that inflated peek of\nexpectation, and we've also gotta try and\n\n385\n00:20:44.462 --> 00:20:47.662\nreduce that trough of\ndisillusionment as well.\n\n386\n00:20:47.662 --> 00:20:49.350\nWe wanna go straight from\n\n387\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.500\nthe technology trigger through\nto that plateau of productivity.\n\n388\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.900\nAnd that's what we wanna try and achieve.\n\n389\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.475\nThe next slide, though,\nis also my life, and it's this.\n\n390\n00:21:01.475 --> 00:21:03.742\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, what?\n\n391\n00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:05.066\nThis is a lot of squiggly, Jo.\n\n392\n00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:05.889\nWhat's going on here?\n\n393\n00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:06.898\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n394\n00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:10.020\nThat mess in the middle is\nwhat we call the neutral zone.\n\n395\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.420\nAnd the next slide looks at\nthe emotional cycle of change.\n\n396\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.265\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n397\n00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:19.770\nthis is really all about acknowledging\nthat people are comfortable.\n\n398\n00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.605\nLook at that, that comfort,\nthe little smiley face at the bottom.\n\n399\n00:21:22.605 --> 00:21:24.894\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; People are comfortable with doing what\n\n400\n00:21:24.894 --> 00:21:26.370\nthey're doing right now.\n\n401\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:30.120\nAnd when you tell them that\nsomething is going to change,\n\n402\n00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.340\nthey're going to be uncertain,\nthey're gonna be uncomfortable.\n\n403\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.000\nThey're going to suffer a period of\n\n404\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.540\nloss where they feel that something's\nbeen taken away from them.\n\n405\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.490\nAnd so what we've gotta make sure is that\nthis neutral zone that's in the middle,\n\n406\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.988\nthis squiggly mess that's in the middle,\nwe gotta try and even that out.\n\n407\n00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:52.345\nAnd we've gotta recognize though\neven when we deploy a new service,\n\n408\n00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:56.326\neven though it's something that\nthey may be really eager for,\n\n409\n00:21:56.326 --> 00:21:59.349\nthere's gonna be some\nelement of discomfort.\n\n410\n00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:01.427\n&gt;&gt; Especially if, yeah,\nyou're disrupting any kind of schedule or\n\n411\n00:22:01.427 --> 00:22:03.483\nanything like that they're set in,\nlike we were talking about.\n\n412\n00:22:03.483 --> 00:22:07.096\n&gt;&gt; Right, people like to,\neven though they want change, and\n\n413\n00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:09.570\nthis is the strange thing about people.\n\n414\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.120\nAnd this is why we gotta get to\nunderstand people a little bit more.\n\n415\n00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.460\nEven when they're eager for change,\nthey're still wary of change.\n\n416\n00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.170\nWe're all desperate.\n\n417\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.567\nEvery single year now, we're all desperate\nfor that latest cellphone to come out.\n\n418\n00:22:22.567 --> 00:22:25.130\nAnd no matter what your allegiance is,\nyou're desperate for\n\n419\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.619\nthat latest cellphone to come out.\n\n420\n00:22:26.619 --> 00:22:32.050\nAnd then you get the thing, and then\nyou realize that you've got to try and\n\n421\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.442\nimport all your photos and\nimport all your contacts, etc.\n\n422\n00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:39.980\nNow, it might be something as simple\nas just plugging it into your laptop,\n\n423\n00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.300\nbut you still have to\ngo through all of that.\n\n424\n00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.700\nThere's still new functionality that\nyou've got to get used to using.\n\n425\n00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.205\nAnd so what we need to do is make sure\nthat in IT, whenever we release anything,\n\n426\n00:22:51.205 --> 00:22:56.860\nthat this particular neutral zone\nis as easy as possible for people.\n\n427\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.990\nLook at this emotional\ncycle of change here.\n\n428\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:06.410\nThese are the emotions that people\ngo through when there is any change.\n\n429\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:10.090\nAnd the bigger the change,\nthe more exaggerated these emotions are.\n\n430\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.610\nYou start off with denial.\n\n431\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.160\nIt's not happening to me.\n\n432\n00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.334\nNope, they're not really gonna do that.\n\n433\n00:23:17.334 --> 00:23:20.166\nThen, anger, are you kidding me?\n\n434\n00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:22.710\nAnd then, we go through the bargaining.\n\n435\n00:23:23.942 --> 00:23:26.100\nOkay, well, what if we do it like this?\n\n436\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.960\nHow about, I didn't like that, but\nhow about if we do it like this?\n\n437\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.980\nThrough to the,\nI can't believe you're doing this to me.\n\n438\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.095\nAre you serious?\n\n439\n00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:35.464\nReally, seriously?\n\n440\n00:23:35.464 --> 00:23:41.000\nAnd then, eventually, it will get to the,\nit's not too bad, it's kind of okay.\n\n441\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.254\nBefore you get through again to that\nsort of plateau of productivity,\n\n442\n00:23:45.254 --> 00:23:48.077\nwhere, okay, yeah, I'm liking this.\n\n443\n00:23:48.077 --> 00:23:51.459\nAnd again, you have to understand\nthat these are the emotions\n\n444\n00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:53.488\nthat people are going to go through.\n\n445\n00:23:53.488 --> 00:23:58.894\nIf you forget about all of these, I like\nthe diagrams and I like the nice squiggly\n\n446\n00:23:58.894 --> 00:24:04.319\nlines I know I like that garden hype cycle\ncuz it gives you something to think of.\n\n447\n00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:08.903\nAnd it gives you something in your mind to\nsay well we gotta avoid that because we\n\n448\n00:24:08.903 --> 00:24:10.845\ndon't want it to happen.\n\n449\n00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:13.780\nCuz imagine if we went back\nto this particular slide\n\n450\n00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.350\nimagine how much money is wasted\nfrom a business perspective here.\n\n451\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.790\nHow much money is wasted in there,\nwhat we call the Neutral Zone.\n\n452\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.590\nThere's a lot of money wasted there.\n\n453\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.840\nImagine how much money is wasted\ntrying to fight against the anger and\n\n454\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.140\nthe bargaining and the depression.\n\n455\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:35.830\nWe waste a lot of business money\nin trying to fight against that.\n\n456\n00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:41.345\nWhen in fact we can actually, we could not\nnecessarily eliminate it completely but\n\n457\n00:24:41.345 --> 00:24:44.832\nwe can certainly get over that very,\nvery quickly.\n\n458\n00:24:44.832 --> 00:24:47.350\nSo we have a tool at our fingertips.\n\n459\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.560\nAnd this is a tool that is\nmentioned in the CSI book.\n\n460\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.048\nIt's also mentioned in our\nservice strategy book.\n\n461\n00:24:53.048 --> 00:24:56.364\nAnd it's also mentioned in\nour ITIL practitioner book.\n\n462\n00:24:56.364 --> 00:24:59.402\nAnd that tool is Kotter's 8 steps,\n\n463\n00:24:59.402 --> 00:25:03.914\nJP Kotter is one of the fellows\nat Harvard University.\n\n464\n00:25:03.914 --> 00:25:07.910\nAnd he created 8 steps to\ntransformational change.\n\n465\n00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.060\nAnd you might think to yourself, well this\nis just common sense but then as we know.\n\n466\n00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.848\nIn terms of ITIL, a lot of this is\njust a case of articulating common\n\n467\n00:25:17.848 --> 00:25:20.941\nsense it's articulating best practice.\n\n468\n00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:24.700\nThe first thing that we've gotta do is\nanswer that question, what's in it for me?\n\n469\n00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.341\nIt's about creating a sense of urgency.\n\n470\n00:25:29.341 --> 00:25:32.685\nRemember what I told you\nearlier about Apple had,\n\n471\n00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:35.120\nthey've got me hooked completely.\n\n472\n00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.685\nI desperately wanted this watch.\n\n473\n00:25:36.685 --> 00:25:41.359\nI hadn't even seen the thing and, yet,\nI really, really wanted it because they\n\n474\n00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:45.330\nare absolutely fantastic at\ncreating that sense of urgency.\n\n475\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.920\nCreating a need before I even knew I\nneeded it, they'd created that need.\n\n476\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.450\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll have\na guiding coalition formed we for\n\n477\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:00.800\na guiding coalition a set of people\nwho are going to act as sponsors and\n\n478\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.830\nwho are going to guide along any change.\n\n479\n00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.811\nSenior people with those\nthat are gonna be affected,\n\n480\n00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:11.709\nwill feel safe with that\nthey can find comfort with.\n\n481\n00:26:11.709 --> 00:26:13.860\nAnd then we form a vision.\n\n482\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.712\nA vision that is applicable\nnot just to the change, but\n\n483\n00:26:17.712 --> 00:26:22.426\na vision that everyone can relate to,\nand that's communicated.\n\n484\n00:26:22.426 --> 00:26:26.514\nAnd then remember that If I got in\nprinciple about collaboration empower\n\n485\n00:26:26.514 --> 00:26:27.405\nothers.\n\n486\n00:26:27.405 --> 00:26:31.740\nGive them something to do, but you've got\nto do this in the right chronological\n\n487\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.687\norder because you see if you empower\nothers before you've communicated\n\n488\n00:26:35.687 --> 00:26:40.171\nthe vision, then you're just gonna empower\nthem to maybe go of on the wrong road.\n\n489\n00:26:40.171 --> 00:26:45.177\nSo we empower others to create,\nremember that progressing\n\n490\n00:26:45.177 --> 00:26:50.285\niteratively visible short-term\nimprovements, building\n\n491\n00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:56.407\none on another to then consolidate\nthose to make one large improvement.\n\n492\n00:26:56.407 --> 00:26:58.880\nDon't try and do everything all at once.\n\n493\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.734\nVisible short term improvements,\nand then we embed the change, and\n\n494\n00:27:02.734 --> 00:27:06.323\nthat doesn't mean taking people\noutside with a baseball bat and\n\n495\n00:27:06.323 --> 00:27:09.991\nmaking sure that they don't revert\nto previous ways of working.\n\n496\n00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.470\nWhat it actually means is that\nencourage the new way of working.\n\n497\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.237\nBut what it also means is that we do\nmake it difficult to go back as well.\n\n498\n00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:23.783\nWe want to ensure that,\nthat is now the adopted and\n\n499\n00:27:23.783 --> 00:27:31.650\naccepted standard way of working before we\nthen implement any further improvement.\n\n500\n00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.610\nRemember visible short\nterm improvements and\n\n501\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.820\nwe build on the last\niterative improvements.\n\n502\n00:27:40.388 --> 00:27:44.757\nSo as I've already mentioned one of are\nthings that we have to do is well we have\n\n503\n00:27:44.757 --> 00:27:46.853\nto identify sources of resistance.\n\n504\n00:27:46.853 --> 00:27:51.537\nAnd these next two slides here just\nlook at potential sources of resistance,\n\n505\n00:27:51.537 --> 00:27:54.010\nsuch as perceived loss of control.\n\n506\n00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:59.200\nIn a previous episode, I talked about the\nfact that some people are empire building.\n\n507\n00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.740\nSome people don't like\nto part with their well,\n\n508\n00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.650\ntheir feeling of their skills that\nonly they have that are really unique.\n\n509\n00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.141\nAnd they don't want to import those.\n\n510\n00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:13.970\nThey don't want to share\nthose with anybody else.\n\n511\n00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:20.024\nBecause they might lose their importance\nor they might have a loss of control.\n\n512\n00:28:20.024 --> 00:28:22.910\nWhat about personal uncertainty?\n\n513\n00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.660\nThere's nothing more disconsolting to\nsomebody than not being sure whether your\n\n514\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.700\njob is safe or not.\n\n515\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.770\nSo reassure people don't surprise\nthem even a good surprise is\n\n516\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.932\nnot a good surprise we don't\nsurprise people in business okay.\n\n517\n00:28:37.932 --> 00:28:38.649\nWe prepare people.\n\n518\n00:28:38.649 --> 00:28:41.499\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's so true,\n\n519\n00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:44.638\nyou don't need to surprise\npeople in business\n\n520\n00:28:44.638 --> 00:28:49.466\neven when it comes to launching new\nproducts you don't need to surprise\n\n521\n00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:53.825\npeople you can tell people that\nthere's a new launch coming up.\n\n522\n00:28:53.825 --> 00:28:58.632\nAnd it's not just about the work,\nit's about absolutely every aspect of\n\n523\n00:28:58.632 --> 00:29:02.275\nsomebody's life if you\nchange somebody's job title,\n\n524\n00:29:02.275 --> 00:29:06.241\nthen you might actually change\nthe work that they have to do.\n\n525\n00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:10.581\nThat means that you have to change their\nworking hours, which means that the things\n\n526\n00:29:10.581 --> 00:29:14.301\nthat they used to do on an evening now\nis part of that work right balance,\n\n527\n00:29:14.301 --> 00:29:15.740\nthey might have to change.\n\n528\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.160\nSo think about those implications because\nthat'll be a source of resistance if you\n\n529\n00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:21.662\ndon't.\n\n530\n00:29:21.662 --> 00:29:25.468\nAnd of course there is\na loss of face as well.\n\n531\n00:29:25.468 --> 00:29:28.690\nAnd that's something that you\ndesperately need to consider.\n\n532\n00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.474\nWhen it comes to if you're\nchanging roles for certain people.\n\n533\n00:29:33.474 --> 00:29:36.133\nThen it could be perceived as being maybe\n\n534\n00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.660\na step down-\n&gt;&gt; If it's emotion yeah like\n\n535\n00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.930\nyou're embarrassed.\n\n536\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Right, a sideways step,\nsomething like that.\n\n537\n00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.585\nSo be very aware of that.\n\n538\n00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:46.436\nAnd then there's always that fear,\n\n539\n00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:49.370\nregarding sort of the competence\nlevel of that as well.\n\n540\n00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.329\nYou're doing this because I'm\nnot very good at my work?\n\n541\n00:29:52.329 --> 00:29:54.125\nIs that why you're doing this?\n\n542\n00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:59.473\nNow, the ripples effect,\nwhen I talk about Ripples,\n\n543\n00:29:59.473 --> 00:30:05.402\nwhat I actually mean here is\nthe fact that if I'm uncertain,\n\n544\n00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:11.099\nif I'm really,\nreally weary about the safety of my role,\n\n545\n00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:13.914\nthen I'm gonna talk to you.\n\n546\n00:30:13.914 --> 00:30:17.860\nAnd if I'm talking to you about the fact\nthat I'm feeling slightly uncomfortable-\n\n547\n00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.452\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna wonder about my job.\n\n548\n00:30:19.452 --> 00:30:21.491\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna wonder about yours, and\n\n549\n00:30:21.491 --> 00:30:23.847\nthen you're gonna go\ntalk to somebody else.\n\n550\n00:30:23.847 --> 00:30:26.529\nAnd that person might talk to two or\nthree people, and then they might talk,\n\n551\n00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:27.910\n&gt;&gt; It's like an infection yeah.\n\n552\n00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.920\n&gt;&gt; Right and that's why we call it,\nit's that ripple effect.\n\n553\n00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.750\nIt's like that stone dropping in the pond,\nthat just creates ripples out.\n\n554\n00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.220\nAnd the problem is that if it's that\none bad room and you see one person.\n\n555\n00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:46.230\nOne negative person can\nundermine the attitudes\n\n556\n00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.870\nof 500 people within the organization.\n\n557\n00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.320\nSo we've gotta be very\ncareful in our communication.\n\n558\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.385\nWe've gotta get that message right, and\n\n559\n00:30:55.385 --> 00:30:58.046\nwe've got to overcome these\nsources of resistance.\n\n560\n00:30:58.046 --> 00:31:02.570\nWe've also got to overcome any of\nthe emotional cycle of change as\n\n561\n00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.140\nquickly as possible.\n\n562\n00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:05.981\nSo we've got to know about this.\n\n563\n00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:11.175\nPeople wonder about things that\nam I not gonna have more to do?\n\n564\n00:31:11.175 --> 00:31:13.660\nAnd don't forget past resentments as well.\n\n565\n00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.130\nI don't wanna work with you I mean no\noffense but I really don't like you and\n\n566\n00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.490\nI don't wanna work with you.\n\n567\n00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.180\nAnd the fact that we're\nbeing put together in a team\n\n568\n00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.160\nnow with each other really\nwhat do they expect from us?\n\n569\n00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.324\nI mean come on get real this could happen.\n\n570\n00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:31.394\nWe want to work in an efficient and\neffective way.\n\n571\n00:31:31.394 --> 00:31:34.004\nIt's never gonna be an efficient\nway to put Cherokee and\n\n572\n00:31:34.004 --> 00:31:35.400\nI together on team all right.\n\n573\n00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.452\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n574\n00:31:37.452 --> 00:31:38.710\nSo, think about this.\n\n575\n00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:46.010\nYou know, personal conflict and personal,\nhow do we say this, attitudes etc.\n\n576\n00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:50.870\nAs much as management can turn around and\nsay, you're both adults,\n\n577\n00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.250\nyou should both get over this.\n\n578\n00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:57.064\nThe simple fact of the matter is,\nthat if you are managing a change,\n\n579\n00:31:57.064 --> 00:32:01.963\nif you are managing an implementation and\nyou put two people together\n\n580\n00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:06.890\nwho don't work together,\nwho don't really get on with each other.\n\n581\n00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.422\nThen I don't care how much\nyou might wanna sit back and\n\n582\n00:32:09.422 --> 00:32:13.680\nsmugly think to yourself, it's okay\nthey're adults they can deal with this.\n\n583\n00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.070\nThe simple fact of the matter is you're\nnot gonna get 100% out of them so\n\n584\n00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.890\nwhy are you going it?\n\n585\n00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.780\nThink about this.\n\n586\n00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.830\nThe responsibility is on\nyou as the project manager.\n\n587\n00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.527\nThe responsibility is not on\nthe two of them because you\n\n588\n00:32:28.527 --> 00:32:32.215\nknew about that issue before you did this.\n\n589\n00:32:32.215 --> 00:32:36.310\nAnd just turn around to people inside\nyou're gonna have to get along with each\n\n590\n00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.701\nother is not good enough.\n\n591\n00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:40.599\nAnd then of course there\nare the real threats, and\n\n592\n00:32:40.599 --> 00:32:43.510\nsometimes the real spread as well.\n\n593\n00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:48.044\nThey can get lost in all\nof the supposed threats.\n\n594\n00:32:48.044 --> 00:32:52.650\nThey can get lost in all of the rumors\nwell we don't know nobody can workout\n\n595\n00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:57.333\nwhat's real and what's not real and\nit leads to speculation and rumors and\n\n596\n00:32:57.333 --> 00:33:01.480\nthat could be very,\nvery not just disconcerting for people.\n\n597\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:07.209\nBut that can have a real effect on the\nmind and success of any implementation.\n\n598\n00:33:07.209 --> 00:33:11.378\nIn our next section, we're going to go\na little bit further into communication.\n\n599\n00:33:11.378 --> 00:33:16.095\nAnd we're going to talk more about how\nwe actually communicate with people and\n\n600\n00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:19.238\nhow we try and\navoid the emotional cycle of change and\n\n601\n00:33:19.238 --> 00:33:22.660\nhow we avoid that neutral\nzone that we saw.\n\n602\n00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.910\nBecause communication\nis key to all of this.\n\n603\n00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.613\nBut nevertheless in this particular\nsection, we've looked at the people\n\n604\n00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:35.236\nside of things and I want you to bear\nin mind that the people side of things,\n\n605\n00:33:35.236 --> 00:33:38.295\nhas to be a huge big part\nof any implementation and\n\n606\n00:33:38.295 --> 00:33:41.302\nof any improvement initiative and\nany change.\n\n607\n00:33:41.302 --> 00:33:45.704\nAnd if you ignore the people side of\nthings, then your implementation and\n\n608\n00:33:45.704 --> 00:33:47.979\nyour change will simply not succeed.\n\n609\n00:33:47.979 --> 00:33:50.481\nSo we have to consider this.\n\n610\n00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:53.010\nSo for our next section,\nas I've already said,\n\n611\n00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:57.082\nin our next episode we're gonna take\na look further at communication and how we\n\n612\n00:33:57.082 --> 00:34:01.630\nactually communicate with each other and\nour communication principles within ITIL.\n\n613\n00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.920\nBut for now,\n\n614\n00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.040\nwe're just going to leave organizational\nchange management exactly where we are.\n\n615\n00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea Jo,\n\n616\n00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.620\nthank you for taking the time to\nexplain to us that difference.\n\n617\n00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.253\nAnd thank you for joining us as well but\n\n618\n00:34:13.253 --> 00:34:15.561\nstay tuned we have more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n619\n00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:18.110\nWe'll go ahead and sign out for this show.\n\n620\n00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.325\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n621\n00:34:19.325 --> 00:34:20.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n622\n00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:22.657\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n623\n00:34:22.657 --> 00:34:28.617\n[MUSIC]\n\n624\n00:34:28.617 --> 00:34:31.889\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.962\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:15.249\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back ladies and gentlemen\nto your ITIL practitioner series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.403\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:22.108\nIn this episode,\nwe will be talking about communication.\n\n7\n00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:24.845\n[LAUGH] I feel like SpongeBob,\nI should have a little rainbow.\n\n8\n00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:26.896\nCommunication.\n\n9\n00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:28.716\n[LAUGH] I don't know if you\nknow what I'm talking about.\n\n10\n00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:29.435\n&gt;&gt; I haven't got a clue.\n\n11\n00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:30.350\n&gt;&gt; But anyways-\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n\n12\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.144\n&gt;&gt; I'm really hoping that you\ncan enlighten me on this.\n\n13\n00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.267\nBecause it is a pretty broad topic,\nand it is a really important one.\n\n14\n00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.484\nSo exactly,\nwhat will we be focusing in on?\n\n15\n00:00:38.484 --> 00:00:40.182\n&gt;&gt; Well, in that particular instance,\n\n16\n00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:42.896\nyour communication was not in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n17\n00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.673\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I hadn't got a clue what you were\n\n18\n00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:47.119\ntalking about there.\n\n19\n00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.133\n&gt;&gt; SpongeBob Squarepants,\nthe little fish who lives in a pineapple.\n\n20\n00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.900\n&gt;&gt; You've got sponge, under the sea.\n\n21\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.985\nYou've got kids.\n\n22\n00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:57.235\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's all I can say.\n\n23\n00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:02.153\nMine grew up a long time ago,\nI think, apparently.\n\n24\n00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:02.996\nSo I've been told.\n\n25\n00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.486\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd probably watch it even if\n\n26\n00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:04.990\nI didn't have kids.\n\n27\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.331\nIt's a good one.\n\n28\n00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:06.892\n&gt;&gt; Dear.\n\n29\n00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:07.885\nOkay, moving on.\n\n30\n00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:10.892\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We are gonna talk about\n\n31\n00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:12.143\ncommunication, yes.\n\n32\n00:01:12.143 --> 00:01:14.074\nWe're going to look at really,\n\n33\n00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.800\nit's a follow-on from\norganizational change management.\n\n34\n00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.480\nAnd we're going to look at the fact that\n\n35\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.730\ncommunication is key to\nabsolutely everything.\n\n36\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.950\nIt's about how we talk,\nwe're communicating all the time,\n\n37\n00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.210\nin everything that we do.\n\n38\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.850\nIn our body language,\nin the words that we use,\n\n39\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.589\nin the way that we talk,\nin the tone of our voice.\n\n40\n00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:36.242\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n41\n00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:39.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In our facial expressions.\n\n42\n00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:43.042\nAbsolutely everything that we do really\nwe're communicating absolutely all\n\n43\n00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:43.572\nthe time.\n\n44\n00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:48.964\nSo when we are gonna talk about\ncommunication and it's role within IT.\n\n45\n00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:52.835\nBecause everything we do, as I've already\nsaid, is a form of communication.\n\n46\n00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.223\nIn other words, our body language and\nour facial expressions and\n\n47\n00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:00.914\njust our attitude,\nthat's a form of communication.\n\n48\n00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:03.450\nEverything that we write\nis a form of communication.\n\n49\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.820\nEvery single telephone call\nthat we make and receive,\n\n50\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.953\nthat's a form of communication.\n\n51\n00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:11.122\nEverything that we text.\n\n52\n00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:14.420\nIt's something else that we've written,\nthat's a form of communication.\n\n53\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.375\nSo we have some basic communication\nprinciples here within ITIL.\n\n54\n00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:22.158\nBut we have to remember,\nas we make any major change,\n\n55\n00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:26.362\nas we implement any new process,\nas we update any process,\n\n56\n00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.979\nas we implement any new\nimprovement opportunity,\n\n57\n00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.871\nwe have to remember these\ncommunication principles.\n\n58\n00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:37.885\nAnd we've got five communication\nprinciples that are on the screen right in\n\n59\n00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:38.645\nfront of you.\n\n60\n00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:39.540\nSee, look at that.\n\n61\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.025\nThat's a form of communication,\nvery effective.\n\n62\n00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:43.641\n[LAUGH] It just happened.\n\n63\n00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:46.355\nIt appeared as if by magic.\n\n64\n00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:50.044\nSo we're gonna look at the fact that\ncommunication is a 2-way process,\n\n65\n00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:54.029\nthat we are communicating all the time,\nthat timing and frequency matter, and\n\n66\n00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.545\nthat there is no single\nmethod of communication.\n\n67\n00:02:56.545 --> 00:02:59.984\nAnd of course the message is in the media.\n\n68\n00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:06.126\nSo, the first one here then,\ncommunication is a 2-way process.\n\n69\n00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:09.280\nCommunication, as we've already said, it's\ngotta be in the language of the audience.\n\n70\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.725\nBut you know what,\nas the communicator in this instance,\n\n71\n00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:17.458\nit's my job to make sure\nthat you understand me.\n\n72\n00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:19.245\nAnd in the case of Cherokee,\n\n73\n00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:23.868\nit's her job to make sure that I\nunderstand her when she's talking to me.\n\n74\n00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:28.051\nSo talking to me about something\nthat I don't understand at all,\n\n75\n00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:31.330\nnot exactly effective in\nterms of communication.\n\n76\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.371\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.503\n&gt;&gt; It is my job, it's the communicator's\n\n78\n00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:41.303\nresponsibility to make sure\nthat the message is understood.\n\n79\n00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:46.087\nIt is not just good enough for\nme put on the end of an email,\n\n80\n00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:52.202\ndid you get that, is that okay,\nlet me know if you've got any problems.\n\n81\n00:03:52.202 --> 00:03:55.853\nBecause that's not checking understanding.\n\n82\n00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:58.580\nLet's just think about this,\njust for a moment.\n\n83\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.122\nAnd I'm gonna start and\nplay with some language here,\n\n84\n00:04:02.122 --> 00:04:04.666\nbecause I like playing with language.\n\n85\n00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:09.400\nThe word revise,\nwhat does that word mean to you?\n\n86\n00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.116\nIf I sent you an email, Cherokee,\nand I told you to go away.\n\n87\n00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:16.253\nAnd I'd sent you a set of course notes.\n\n88\n00:04:16.253 --> 00:04:20.276\nAnd I told you to go away and\nrevise that set of course notes.\n\n89\n00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:21.454\nWhat would you do?\n\n90\n00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:22.962\n&gt;&gt; Update them.\n\n91\n00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:27.815\n&gt;&gt; Right, wrong,\n[LAUGH] cuz what I'd actually want\n\n92\n00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:31.636\nyou to do is I'd want you to study them.\n\n93\n00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do remember you telling\nme this before, the difference.\n\n94\n00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.788\n&gt;&gt; There are two dictionary\ndefinitions of the word revise.\n\n95\n00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:42.498\nOne means to study and\nthe other means to update.\n\n96\n00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:47.645\nOf course, we have revision history for\ninstance, in our documentation.\n\n97\n00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:51.552\nIn the UK,\nwe use the word revise to mean study,\n\n98\n00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:55.970\nbecause we use one dictionary definition.\n\n99\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.714\nHere in the US, we use a completely\ndifferent dictionary definition.\n\n100\n00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:01.220\nNeither one of them are wrong.\n\n101\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.640\nIt's just that we use\nthem both differently.\n\n102\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.637\nSo if I send you an email with\nan attached presentation,\n\n103\n00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:12.560\nand I said to you,\ncould you revise this for tomorrow?\n\n104\n00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.134\nThen you would make changes.\n\n105\n00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:19.797\nAnd what would actually happen, is I\ncould put at the bottom of that email,\n\n106\n00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:22.770\nlet me know if you understand,\nor is that okay?\n\n107\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.677\nAnd you would still come back to me and\nsay, yes, that's fine.\n\n108\n00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:29.131\nBut you would've taken one\ninterpretation away, and\n\n109\n00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.420\nI would have meant something\ncompletely different.\n\n110\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.840\nSo it's not just enough to write at\nthe bottom of an email, is that okay,\n\n111\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.967\nbecause the interpretation\ncould still be wrong.\n\n112\n00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.994\n&gt;&gt; Be like yeah, that's great,\nI'll send them to you later and\n\n113\n00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:44.867\nthen they'll be like, wait, what?\n\n114\n00:05:44.867 --> 00:05:49.665\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so this is not just good\nenough to make sure that you've\n\n115\n00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:53.869\nread it and\nthat you've actually understood the words.\n\n116\n00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:57.150\nI need to make sure that you've\nunderstood the meaning behind the words.\n\n117\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.437\n&gt;&gt; Get the proper context of writing.\n\n118\n00:05:58.437 --> 00:06:02.759\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this is why we say that\nthe responsibility of communications it\n\n119\n00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.405\nis in the hands of the person\nthat's doing the communicating.\n\n120\n00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:10.896\nSo it's my responsibility to talk to\nyou in a language that you understand.\n\n121\n00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:15.549\nSo it's my responsibility to make sure\nthat I use your words and your meaning.\n\n122\n00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:19.066\nNow, we all know the difference\nbetween petrol and gas for instance.\n\n123\n00:06:19.066 --> 00:06:23.714\nThat one's a fairly obvious one, but\nthat word revise is not fairly obvious.\n\n124\n00:06:23.714 --> 00:06:26.908\nWhat about a simple little things\nlike a biscuit, for instance.\n\n125\n00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:29.005\nWhat's a biscuit to you?\n\n126\n00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:31.728\n&gt;&gt; A fluffy piece of southern goodness.\n\n127\n00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:35.591\n&gt;&gt; Right, [LAUGH] looks more like a scone.\n\n128\n00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:36.925\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\n129\n00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:41.135\nA biscuit to me is something that's\nquite hard that I dunk in my tea.\n\n130\n00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:42.227\nThat's a biscuit.\n\n131\n00:06:42.227 --> 00:06:43.716\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n\n132\n00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.806\n&gt;&gt; We've got differences that\nwe know about about, but\n\n133\n00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.950\nthen there are differences\nthat we don't know about.\n\n134\n00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.940\nAnd so it's definitely,\nit's in my responsibility to make sure\n\n135\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.121\nthat I communicate in\na language that you understand.\n\n136\n00:06:57.121 --> 00:07:00.972\nAnd so you will notice me throughout\nall of these ITIL classes,\n\n137\n00:07:00.972 --> 00:07:04.182\nyou will notice me use two\ndifferent types of words.\n\n138\n00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:06.010\nAnd I'll always use maybe one word for\n\n139\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.507\none thing, and then I'll say something\ncompletely different as well.\n\n140\n00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:13.597\nBecause I want to make sure, like I've\nnever called something a tickbox.\n\n141\n00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:18.658\nI'll always say either a tick or a check,\nbecause it depends on where in the world\n\n142\n00:07:18.658 --> 00:07:23.365\nyou are as to what you perceive to be\nthat little symbol that goes like that.\n\n143\n00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:27.150\nBecause to me it's a tick, but to you-\n&gt;&gt; A tick is something I don't want.\n\n144\n00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.373\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:33.851\n[LAUGH] So communication is a 2-way\nprocess, and what that means is that we've\n\n146\n00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:39.100\nboth got to understand exactly what's\nbeing meant by that communication.\n\n147\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.363\nNow, our next slide looks at\nwe're communicating all the time.\n\n148\n00:07:45.363 --> 00:07:46.483\nAnd that's really simple.\n\n149\n00:07:46.483 --> 00:07:51.489\nAs I've already said, talk about body\nlanguage, talk about a facial expression\n\n150\n00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:56.437\nand everything that we do, even silence,\nis a form of communication as it says.\n\n151\n00:07:56.437 --> 00:07:57.033\n&gt;&gt; You bet.\n\n152\n00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:59.406\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, but\nI'm not talking to you.\n\n153\n00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:01.610\nYou better believe there's\nsomething wrong, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.980\nAnd what I also want you to do is,\n\n155\n00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.120\nI want you to take note of this\nstakeholder communication plan.\n\n156\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.680\nNow, that's something that we\nlooked at earlier on during\n\n157\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.730\nour sessions in previous episodes.\n\n158\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.890\nAnd the stakeholder communication plan, as\nI've already said, anything that's written\n\n159\n00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.200\nin red, that means that it's in our ITIL\nbook, in our ITIL practitioner book.\n\n160\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.836\nSo we make use of the stakeholder\ncommunication plan to\n\n161\n00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:29.568\nhelp us formally communicate.\n\n162\n00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:32.951\nAnd then let's look,\nexcuse me, let's look at this.\n\n163\n00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:36.289\nTiming and frequency matter.\n\n164\n00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.537\nDon't over or under communicate.\n\n165\n00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:42.977\nCherokee, have you ever had\nan email that you've deleted before\n\n166\n00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:44.681\nyou've even opened it?\n\n167\n00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:46.102\n&gt;&gt; Probably, every day.\n\n168\n00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:48.551\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But all of them.\n\n169\n00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:52.989\n[LAUGH] No, I've got to admit\nthat will probably delete.\n\n170\n00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:56.540\nI have a special Email folder which\nis where all my junk email goes.\n\n171\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.618\nAnd I just go in and\nI just delete it without even opening it.\n\n172\n00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:03.637\nBecause sometimes, you'll get two or\nthree emails a day from the same company.\n\n173\n00:09:03.637 --> 00:09:05.198\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:09.600\n&gt;&gt; Too frequent communication, people\njust do not see the relevance in that.\n\n175\n00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600\nThey do not see the importance in there.\n\n176\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.413\nInfrequent communication, well,\n\n177\n00:09:13.413 --> 00:09:16.339\nthat actually suggests that\nthere is a lack of importance.\n\n178\n00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:22.140\nAnd yet, again, people don't see the\nrelevance in that type of communication.\n\n179\n00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.320\nNow, the second from the last\nbullet point there, and\n\n180\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.580\nI don't know if we can expand that slide.\n\n181\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.499\nYeah, that second from last bullet\npoint there about communicating\n\n182\n00:09:34.499 --> 00:09:37.483\nat times of critical business activity.\n\n183\n00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:39.111\nYeah, don't do that.\n\n184\n00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't want to communicate.\n\n185\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.286\nIf somebody's busy with something else,\n\n186\n00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:48.007\nyou can communicate\na critical business activity.\n\n187\n00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:49.883\nBut let's face it, at the end of the day,\n\n188\n00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:52.950\nthat communication is not gonna be\ntaken any notice of whatsoever.\n\n189\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.430\nSo that bullet point there, then, the one\nthat's just up from the bottom one there,\n\n190\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.700\nthe don't communicate at times\nof critical business activity.\n\n191\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.260\nWell, I mean, again, a lot of this,\nas I've already said, is common sense, and\n\n192\n00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.960\nthis one goes without saying as well.\n\n193\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.823\nIf you're communicating to somebody at\na time when they're busy with something\n\n194\n00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:14.626\nelse, then they're not gonna\nread your communication.\n\n195\n00:10:14.626 --> 00:10:17.659\nSo think about the timing.\n\n196\n00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.876\nDon't communicate when\nsomebody's already busy.\n\n197\n00:10:19.876 --> 00:10:23.070\n[LAUGH] Right, because, like I said,\nthey're not going to read it.\n\n198\n00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.980\nOr they might read it and\n\n199\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.060\nmight not understand the severity\nof your communication.\n\n200\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.200\nAnd it's the same when somebody's\ncommunicating at a time when you have got\n\n201\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.337\nsomething critical going on yourself.\n\n202\n00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:36.440\nYou don't read it,\nyou don't take any notice of it.\n\n203\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.595\nOr you might think to yourself,\nI'll get back to that and\n\n204\n00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:43.300\nnot actually really understand\nwhat the content of that email is.\n\n205\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.872\nWhat about those times when you don't\npick up the telephone because you're in\n\n206\n00:10:46.872 --> 00:10:49.160\nthe middle of doing something else?\n\n207\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.590\nThat's a key point.\n\n208\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.321\nDon't communicate when there's\nsomething else going on, leave it.\n\n209\n00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:56.688\nCommunicate either before or\nperhaps afterwards,\n\n210\n00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:59.570\nwhen everything's had\na chance to settle down.\n\n211\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.710\nAnd just remember that there's\nno single way of communication.\n\n212\n00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.620\nThere's no method that's gonna work for\neverybody.\n\n213\n00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.442\nSome people will respond better to face\nto face communications because you\n\n214\n00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:10.983\ncan see body language.\n\n215\n00:11:10.983 --> 00:11:14.394\nOther people will respond\nbetter to telephone calls.\n\n216\n00:11:14.394 --> 00:11:17.457\nSome people respond better to emails.\n\n217\n00:11:17.457 --> 00:11:21.650\nUse a mix of communication methods, yeah?\n\n218\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.952\nDon't just send an email.\n\n219\n00:11:23.952 --> 00:11:25.814\nConfirm it via a telephone call.\n\n220\n00:11:25.814 --> 00:11:27.425\nDon't just make a telephone call.\n\n221\n00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:29.736\nConfirm it via an email.\n\n222\n00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:33.590\nWhat about the medium that\nwe're using right now, video?\n\n223\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.758\nThink about this, what I will do is,\n\n224\n00:11:37.758 --> 00:11:42.874\nwe will communicate now,\nover a TV episode.\n\n225\n00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:45.400\nAnd then,\nI give you a set of exercises to do.\n\n226\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.846\nAnd I'll say to you, okay, do these\nexercises because I need to know that\n\n227\n00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:53.170\nyou've understood what we've talked about.\n\n228\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.669\nAnd then, I'll give you\nanother form of communication.\n\n229\n00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:59.386\nBecause I'll say to you,\nif you've got any questions,\n\n230\n00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:03.075\nif you didn't quite understand anything,\nthen come back to us on the forum.\n\n231\n00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:05.711\nRemember, that 2-way process,\ncome back to me.\n\n232\n00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.717\nCome back to me on the forum, and I will\nanswer any questions that you may have.\n\n233\n00:12:09.717 --> 00:12:13.690\nAnd so at that point in time,\nI've used three methods of communication.\n\n234\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.970\nI've communicated with you face to face,\nnow, over video.\n\n235\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.700\nThen I've communicated with you through\nthe exercises because I have given you\n\n236\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.170\nsomething to think about.\n\n237\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.760\nAnd then I'm asking you to communicate\nback to me via chat, for instance, or\n\n238\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.550\nover whatever misunderstandings\nthat you might have, or\n\n239\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.200\nwhatever confusions that you may have.\n\n240\n00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.890\nSo we use a mix of communication methods.\n\n241\n00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.135\nBut we have to remember that not\neverything works for every single person.\n\n242\n00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:46.549\nAnd you have to use the right mix\nin order to be able to get through\n\n243\n00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:48.265\nto absolutely everybody.\n\n244\n00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:51.840\nAnd, of course, think about the severity\nof your communication as well.\n\n245\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.031\nOkay, the method has got to be\nappropriate to the scale and\n\n246\n00:12:56.031 --> 00:12:58.273\nto the impact of that\ncommunication as well.\n\n247\n00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:02.195\nYou don't tell somebody that\nthey've been laid off via a text.\n\n248\n00:13:02.195 --> 00:13:04.284\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n249\n00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:04.910\n&gt;&gt; I hope not, yeah.\n\n250\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.809\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, I mean, it's kind of\nthe one that I've used before in the past.\n\n251\n00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.094\nNo, you can't dump anybody via text.\n\n252\n00:13:13.094 --> 00:13:14.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n253\n00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:17.530\njust simply unfriend them on Facebook,\nright?\n\n254\n00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.570\nIsn't that the way it goes?\n\n255\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n256\n00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:21.644\n&gt;&gt; You can't do that, okay.\n\n257\n00:13:21.644 --> 00:13:24.902\nYou have to think about the appropriate\nmethod of communication.\n\n258\n00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:29.049\nAnd it has to be relevant to the scale and\nto the impact of any improvement\n\n259\n00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:32.350\ninitiative that you're\ntrying to undertake.\n\n260\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:37.235\nYou don't need to send a huge big\nemail when only two words will do.\n\n261\n00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:41.514\nBut you don't want to put anything severe,\nsuch as restructuring,\n\n262\n00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:43.080\nin a text either, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.668\nIt has to be appropriate.\n\n264\n00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:47.587\nAnd just remember that written\ncommunication can be misinterpreted.\n\n265\n00:13:47.587 --> 00:13:48.929\nWe've already spoken about this.\n\n266\n00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.943\nThink of that word revise, okay?\n\n267\n00:13:50.943 --> 00:13:53.830\nSo remember that communication\nis a 2-way process.\n\n268\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.710\nWhat you have to do is we have to\ncreate what we call a stakeholder\n\n269\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.580\ncommunication plan.\n\n270\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.730\nAnd we've already seen that in\ntwo of our previous slides.\n\n271\n00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.210\nIt's been written in red.\n\n272\n00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.790\nThat means that if it's written in red,\n\n273\n00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.060\nit's in our toolkit within\nour ITIL practitioner book.\n\n274\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.057\nAnd we have to ensure that every\nsingle stakeholder is covered so\n\n275\n00:14:15.057 --> 00:14:17.705\nthat we identify all of our stakeholders.\n\n276\n00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:21.345\nAnd we should do that right at the very\nbeginning of any improvement initiative\n\n277\n00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:24.140\nwhen we're planning out that project.\n\n278\n00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.560\nAnd we need to ensure that once we've\ngot all the stakeholders written down,\n\n279\n00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.190\nthat we're able to identify what\ncommunication methods are relevant for\n\n280\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.560\nthose particular stakeholders.\n\n281\n00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.580\nAnd you've got to answer the question,\nwhat's in it for me?\n\n282\n00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.700\nRemember all of your communication\nprinciples, such as timing and\n\n283\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.630\nfrequency matter.\n\n284\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:51.985\nDon't communicate by way of a meeting\ntwice a week when you're communicating to,\n\n285\n00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:57.909\nsay, an external third party, a supplier,\nor maybe an external customer.\n\n286\n00:14:57.909 --> 00:15:01.740\nBecause, perhaps they won't want\nto have a meeting twice a week.\n\n287\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.638\nPerhaps they don't have time.\n\n288\n00:15:03.638 --> 00:15:07.936\nSo think about your communication and\nplan your communication.\n\n289\n00:15:07.936 --> 00:15:10.550\nAnd then make sure you\nhave got a method for\n\n290\n00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.170\nfeedback of that communication as well.\n\n291\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.370\nDifferent types of communication\nthat we have are all listed here.\n\n292\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:24.080\nThis is not necessarily a list of\nall of the types of communication.\n\n293\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.050\nYou'll decide how best to\ncommunicate with your team.\n\n294\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:34.420\nI've seen sort of town hall meetings, etc,\nthat are done via a video communication\n\n295\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.438\nmethod that are sort of beamed around the\nworld, as it were, all at the same time.\n\n296\n00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:42.334\nWhat about simulation games?\n\n297\n00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:47.666\nThat's something that's now moving into\nour common workplace environment where\n\n298\n00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:52.704\nwe actually perform simulation or\nthe gamification of some training as well.\n\n299\n00:15:52.704 --> 00:15:55.928\n&gt;&gt; We even integrate that here at\nITProTV with badges and stuff.\n\n300\n00:15:55.928 --> 00:15:59.998\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, yeah, this is something\nthat we would encourage is being\n\n301\n00:15:59.998 --> 00:16:02.209\ninteractive with our communication.\n\n302\n00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:06.408\nBecause when we can encourage that\ninteractiveness, then that means that we\n\n303\n00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:10.420\nare able to identify whether\na message has been understood or not.\n\n304\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.824\nAnd I know that we'll give you exercises\nto do with your ITIL training prior to\n\n305\n00:16:14.824 --> 00:16:17.279\nyour certification, prior to your exam.\n\n306\n00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:21.418\nBut, nevertheless,\nit's still not fully interactive.\n\n307\n00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:26.269\nBecause we're not fully interacting live,\nright now, with you to identify\n\n308\n00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:30.460\nwhether you've understood or\nwhether you haven't understood.\n\n309\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.280\nSo that's why we use those exercises\nto come back to us at a later date.\n\n310\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.594\nAnd then we can feedback to you as to\nwhether you're on the right track, or\n\n311\n00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:44.761\nmaybe whether you kinda missed the point\non something, cuz it's perfectly feasible.\n\n312\n00:16:44.761 --> 00:16:48.336\nThink about how you're gonna communicate,\nand think about at\n\n313\n00:16:48.336 --> 00:16:53.510\nwhat stage during your improvement\ninitiative you're going to communicate.\n\n314\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:59.360\nSo here we have an example, to get from\nour current state to our predicted state,\n\n315\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.930\nlook at what we have to communicate and\nwhen.\n\n316\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.005\nFirst thing that we've got to do,\nwe already know, is identify the vision.\n\n317\n00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:08.930\nAnd then,\nwe communicate at various stages,\n\n318\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.838\nsuch as when we've got our\nleadership team and our sponsors.\n\n319\n00:17:12.838 --> 00:17:17.221\nThen we'll communicate when we\nare establishing who our contributing\n\n320\n00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:18.470\ngroups are.\n\n321\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.120\nIn other words,\ncan you get involved with this?\n\n322\n00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.160\nWe'd really like you to.\n\n323\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.370\nWe'll communicate targets, and\nthen once we've implemented\n\n324\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.100\nour improvement initiative,\nthen we'll communicate that as well.\n\n325\n00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.100\nAll of these are just\nexamples of timings for\n\n326\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.420\ncommunication, but there's no right or\nwrong to communication at all.\n\n327\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.940\nWe can communicate whenever we need to and\nas frequently as we need to.\n\n328\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.250\nBut just remember that we\ndon't over communicate.\n\n329\n00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:55.170\nSo now then, well, we have come to\nthe end of our course materials for\n\n330\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.170\nour ITIL practitioner show.\n\n331\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.271\nAnd at this point in time, this is\nwhen I ask you to review everything,\n\n332\n00:18:02.271 --> 00:18:06.756\nall the principles that we have learned\nthroughout our previous episodes and\n\n333\n00:18:06.756 --> 00:18:10.770\nto undertake the exercises that\nare in your downloadable material.\n\n334\n00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.545\nNow, as I already mentioned,\nright in the very first episode of\n\n335\n00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:20.412\nITIL practitioner, the ITIL\npractitioner course itself is made\n\n336\n00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:25.454\nup of a minimum of 50% exercises\nthat you will perform yourself,\n\n337\n00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:31.760\nto ensure that you've understood\nthe principles that we've discussed.\n\n338\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.542\n&gt;&gt; So we've reached the end of our\nshows and our episodes right now.\n\n339\n00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:40.395\nBut now, you've got about 10-12 hours\nworth of exercises that you will\n\n340\n00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:45.270\nneed to undertake in order to ensure\nunderstanding of all of the principles.\n\n341\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.830\nNow, that doesn't include the 2 hours and\n\n342\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.030\n15 minutes worth of sample paper\nthat you also have to undertake.\n\n343\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.130\nIn subsequent episodes, we're going to\nlook a little bit further at the exercises\n\n344\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:02.970\nthemselves and what I'm expecting\nfrom you in those exercises.\n\n345\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.694\nAnd we'll also be doing a review session,\nor a few episodes, really,\n\n346\n00:19:07.694 --> 00:19:12.287\nof review sessions, on the ITIL\npractitioner tests, themselves.\n\n347\n00:19:12.287 --> 00:19:17.225\nSo at this point in time,\nthis is where I leave it up to you.\n\n348\n00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:22.215\nAnd I'll see you in some subsequent\nepisodes to review what you\n\n349\n00:19:22.215 --> 00:19:27.027\nhave covered in your exercises\nas also in your sample paper.\n\n350\n00:19:27.027 --> 00:19:29.824\n&gt;&gt; All right, Jo, so it's looks like\nwe've got some homework to do here.\n\n351\n00:19:29.824 --> 00:19:31.009\nBut definitely come back,\n\n352\n00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:33.542\nbecause we do have some more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n353\n00:19:33.542 --> 00:19:35.648\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n354\n00:19:35.648 --> 00:19:37.291\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n355\n00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:38.202\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Jo Peacock.\n\n356\n00:19:38.202 --> 00:19:40.964\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n357\n00:19:40.964 --> 00:19:47.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n358\n00:19:47.062 -->

00:00:08.112\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.865\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Welcome back ladies and gentlemen\nto your ITIL Practitioner series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.580\nThis is actually a special episode.\n\n8\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.050\nWe're gonna be taking a look at\nsome exercises, some special ones,\n\n9\n00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.780\nthat Jo has planned for us.\n\n10\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.067\nSo Jo,\nwhat are we gonna be looking at here?\n\n11\n00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:32.402\n&gt;&gt; Well, as I've said in a previous\nepisode, the ITIL practitioner course\n\n12\n00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:38.353\nmaterial itself, only covers around about\na day and a half's worth of material.\n\n13\n00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:42.202\nThe rest of the time throughout an ITIL\npractitioner class you are actually going\n\n14\n00:00:42.202 --> 00:00:43.640\nto be doing exercises.\n\n15\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.050\nSo of course we have some\nexercises prepared for you.\n\n16\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.174\nAnd what I really wanna do in this\nsession is just take you through very,\n\n17\n00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:55.548\nvery briefly cuz, of course,\nit's down to you to do the exercises.\n\n18\n00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:57.560\nI just wanna take you\nthrough the exercises and\n\n19\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.560\njust let you know what the expectation\nis of these exercises.\n\n20\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.165\nSo the first thing that I\nwanna point out to you, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:08.181\nI mentioned this to you right at the\nbeginning of our ITIL practitioner shows.\n\n22\n00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:12.126\nThe first thing that I wanna do is point\nout to you that it says, here in your\n\n23\n00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:16.460\ndownloadable exercise material, that\nyour ITIL practitioner publication and\n\n24\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.460\nyour case study, should be referred to for\nall of the exercises in this section.\n\n25\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.869\nRight, well y our ITIL practitioner\npublication that's this.\n\n26\n00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.930\nLook at this nice, purple book.\n\n27\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.620\nCan you see this?\n\n28\n00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.120\nIsn't it wonderful?\n\n29\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.290\nThe thing that's gonna be\nreally useful to you very,\n\n30\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.751\nvery useful to you is right at\nthe back you have Section 7.\n\n31\n00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:40.130\nAnd you'll notice that in\nSection 7 is your toolkit.\n\n32\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.172\nYour toolkit is simply a list of,\nwell, look at this templates.\n\n33\n00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:51.023\nTemplates for things like a CSI register\nof your orientation worksheet for\n\n34\n00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:54.260\na CSF worksheet,\nbenefits realization review.\n\n35\n00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.560\nNow, we're gonna be covering all of\nthese templates in your exercises.\n\n36\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560\nHere's a slam chart, for instance.\n\n37\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.432\nThat's your red, amber, green, or\nas Cherokee likes to call it, a red,\n\n38\n00:02:04.432 --> 00:02:05.364\nyellow, green.\n\n39\n00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:08.985\nBut it's not a root chart,\nit's a rag chart.\n\n40\n00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:14.530\n[LAUGH] So we've got examples of all\nof these types of templates etc,\n\n41\n00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.116\nhere in Chapter 7.\n\n42\n00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:21.880\nNow, Chapter 7, your tool kit is actually\ngoing to be the most useful part of\n\n43\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.180\nthis particular book for\nyour test and for these exercises.\n\n44\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.640\nBut this is something that you can use\nin your day to day environment as well.\n\n45\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.620\nWhen somebody says to you,\ndo you have a template for x,\n\n46\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.070\nyou can say, yes here you go.\n\n47\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.970\nI've got a template to hand.\n\n48\n00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.372\nAnd this is something that I can\nuse in my real world environment.\n\n49\n00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:47.340\nNow, we already know that\nthe ITIL practitioner exam is\n\n50\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.200\nthe only exam that is open book.\n\n51\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.345\nSo you will need to have\na copy of this book in order\n\n52\n00:02:55.345 --> 00:03:00.376\nto be able to take your\nITIL practitioner test.\n\n53\n00:03:00.376 --> 00:03:02.150\nNow, I've said you will need it.\n\n54\n00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.010\nIt's to your own advantage if you get one,\nyou don't have to have it for you test.\n\n55\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.220\nBut you can use it,\nit's the only ITIL test that is open book.\n\n56\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.980\nSo I would certainly recommend\nthat you get it, and\n\n57\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.770\nthen you can refer to it during your test.\n\n58\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.440\nI certainly don't see any reason for\nyou to give yourself a disadvantage by not\n\n59\n00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.510\ngetting it,\nwhen you can refer to that book.\n\n60\n00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440\n&gt;&gt; But, Jo, we're definitely not gonna be\nusing this as a crutch and just act like,\n\n61\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.936\nI don't need to study, I can use my book.\n\n62\n00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:33.310\nBecause you showed us,\na lot of it is tools, and\n\n63\n00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.450\nwe already need know how to be\nusing those tools accordingly.\n\n64\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.486\n&gt;&gt; Look, if you wanna use this\nas a crutch then go for it.\n\n65\n00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:41.123\nBut you've got 2 hours and\n15 minutes for your test, and trust me,\n\n66\n00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:41.984\nyou don't have time.\n\n67\n00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:42.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n68\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.534\n&gt;&gt; You have to know the material, and\ncertainly if you don't know where to go\n\n69\n00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:49.920\nto in the book to actually study\nthat particular piece of material.\n\n70\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.519\nI mean sure,\n\n71\n00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.847\nthere's an index at the back of the book,\nthere is with every ITIL book.\n\n72\n00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:58.912\nBut you don't have time, you've got 40\nquestions in 2 hours and 15 minutes.\n\n73\n00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:01.978\nYou don't have time to be reading\nthe entire sections of that book.\n\n74\n00:04:01.978 --> 00:04:04.665\nSo if you wanna use it as a crutch,\nthen good luck.\n\n75\n00:04:04.665 --> 00:04:05.600\n[LAUGH].\n\n76\n00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.260\nBut the reality of it is,\nyou don't have the time to be doing that.\n\n77\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.490\nWhich is why I always highlight Section 7,\n\n78\n00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.200\nwhich is your toolkit, because that's\ngonna be important during your test.\n\n79\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.670\nIt's gonna be useful as just a blank\nset of templates during your test, and\n\n80\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.750\nit could be useful in your\nreal world experience too.\n\n81\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.690\nThe fact of the matter is that\nwhen it comes to a question,\n\n82\n00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.730\nif you get asked a question about\nmaybe a stakeholder analysis, or\n\n83\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.250\nmaybe a training needs analysis,\nfor instance.\n\n84\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.848\nIf you get asked a question about that,\nyou might think to yourself,\n\n85\n00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:41.231\nI know what that is, but\nI can't remember exactly what it includes.\n\n86\n00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.356\nThen, you could look it up in the toolkit.\n\n87\n00:04:43.356 --> 00:04:47.515\nAnd so it will act as a prompt for\nyour memory but that's it.\n\n88\n00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:48.434\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n89\n00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:50.610\n&gt;&gt; That's all it will act as.\n\n90\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.523\nSo the other thing that I\nmentioned is your case study.\n\n91\n00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:57.888\nNow, in the beginning of your\nexercise section here on you\n\n92\n00:04:57.888 --> 00:05:01.733\ndownloadable material\nyou'll have a case study.\n\n93\n00:05:01.733 --> 00:05:04.513\nYou'll have three pages\nworth of case study.\n\n94\n00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:07.917\nAnd it starts off right at the very\nbeginning with a very, very\n\n95\n00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:12.449\nsimple organization chart on how these\nparticular organizations fit together.\n\n96\n00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.248\nThat's cruise along cars, the partner UOB,\n\n97\n00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:19.570\nand then driveyou.com and\nnever go on state department of transport.\n\n98\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.659\nAnd so you will see all of\nthe interactions between these\n\n99\n00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.620\norganizations including\nglobal CIT services.\n\n100\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.948\nNow, all of the exercises that we've\ngot in this particular section and\n\n101\n00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:39.045\nall of the questions in your\ntest will use this case study.\n\n102\n00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:42.350\nMy recommendation is to\nknow this case study.\n\n103\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.463\nYou've got 2 hours 15 minutes for\nyour actual test itself.\n\n104\n00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:53.310\n2 hours 15 minutes to do 40 questions\nis not an insignificant amount of time,\n\n105\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.591\nyou might think.\n\n106\n00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:57.292\nBut in reality,\nit's gonna go very, very quickly.\n\n107\n00:05:57.292 --> 00:05:58.812\n&gt;&gt; So if I can look at this,\n\n108\n00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:03.676\nmull it over ahead of time before I'm\nactually being on a time restriction.\n\n109\n00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:06.813\n&gt;&gt; Right, you cannot print this\ncopy of your case study and\n\n110\n00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:09.637\ntake it with you to your test,\nyou can't do that.\n\n111\n00:06:09.637 --> 00:06:12.877\nYour case study is going to be,\nyour test is going to be online and\n\n112\n00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:16.682\ntherefore the materials that they\ngive you, they're going to be online.\n\n113\n00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:19.780\nThey're gonna be visible\nto you in PDF format.\n\n114\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.726\nWhich means that in your actual test\nitself, you're gonna have to have a copy\n\n115\n00:06:24.726 --> 00:06:29.003\nof the case study loaded in front of you,\nwhich they will give you.\n\n116\n00:06:29.003 --> 00:06:33.013\nYou're going to have your question booklet\nloaded in front of you, along with\n\n117\n00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:37.097\nsupplemental information for each\nquestion, or scenario for each question.\n\n118\n00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:41.636\nAnd then you're also going to have\nthe answer sheet in front of you as well.\n\n119\n00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:45.988\nThat's three PDFs that you're going to\nhave in front of you on your screen,\n\n120\n00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.560\nthat's a lot.\n\n121\n00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.449\nYou're either gonna have to do a lot of\njumping around between those windows.\n\n122\n00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.394\nOr, if you can remember as much of your\ncase study as possible in between now, and\n\n123\n00:06:56.394 --> 00:07:01.120\nduring your test, then you'll only\nhave two to jump around with.\n\n124\n00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.596\nThat will be the question booklet\nwith the additional scenarios,\n\n125\n00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:07.895\nthe supplemental information,\nand the answer sheet as well.\n\n126\n00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:10.096\nSo my recommendation is always,\n\n127\n00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:14.979\nalways get to know your case study\nbefore your test, as much as possible.\n\n128\n00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:19.580\nYou shouldn't be in a position where\nyou are referring to this case\n\n129\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.160\nstudy a lot during your test itself.\n\n130\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.180\nSo this is the case study that\nwe're using for our exercises.\n\n131\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.352\nAnd this is the case study that you're\ngoing to be using in your test as well.\n\n132\n00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:35.474\nOne thing that I want to say, while\nwe're just talking about case study and\n\n133\n00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:37.837\nwhile we're talking about books as well.\n\n134\n00:07:37.837 --> 00:07:41.160\nIn your case study,\nthis is your case study.\n\n135\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.540\nPrint it off and you can make as many\nnotes on this case study as you want.\n\n136\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.318\nYou will not be able to\ntake this to your test.\n\n137\n00:07:47.318 --> 00:07:52.930\nNow, in this particular book you\nwill be able to use for your test.\n\n138\n00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.675\nI have been asked many times whether\nyou could make notes in your test.\n\n139\n00:07:56.675 --> 00:08:01.150\nYou'll see that in my book,\nI've got tabs on the side of my book.\n\n140\n00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.260\nAnd I've been asked, as I said,\n\n141\n00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.070\na number of times as to whether\nyou can make notes in your book.\n\n142\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.644\nOfficially no, you can't.\n\n143\n00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:12.331\nI have known of some people that have\nbeen advised that they cannot use\n\n144\n00:08:12.331 --> 00:08:16.230\ntheir book because they've highlighted\ncertain things in their book.\n\n145\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.740\nAnd because they've taken\nnotes in their books.\n\n146\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.001\nAnd I have known some people that have\nbeen allowed to use their book with\n\n147\n00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:25.428\nhighlights and with notes in that book.\n\n148\n00:08:25.428 --> 00:08:28.448\nI cannot answer that question for you now.\n\n149\n00:08:28.448 --> 00:08:34.000\nIt's up to the proctor at the time,\nas to whether that is allowed or not.\n\n150\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.628\nWhat I would advise you to do is\nany notes that you want to take,\n\n151\n00:08:38.628 --> 00:08:41.666\nuse tabs that you can then just peel off.\n\n152\n00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:45.632\nOr, if you're going to make notes,\nthen make them on a piece of paper and\n\n153\n00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:49.078\nsimply insert them into that\nparticular place in the book, and\n\n154\n00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.360\nthen you can remove them before your test.\n\n155\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.694\nWhen you do your test,\n\n156\n00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:57.355\nyou will have to do your test on\na PC with a camera in front of it.\n\n157\n00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:02.025\nAnd you may be asked to simply fan the\nbook and show that book to the proctor at\n\n158\n00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:08.120\nthe other side of the camera, so they can\nsee whether you've made any notes, etc.\n\n159\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.795\nThat's my advice to you.\n\n160\n00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:15.165\nAnd whether you choose to heed that or\nnot, that's entirely up to you.\n\n161\n00:09:15.165 --> 00:09:19.809\nBut I don't want to run the risk\nof having your book refused at\n\n162\n00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.827\ntest because you've made notes in it.\n\n163\n00:09:22.827 --> 00:09:25.692\nSo let's take a look at the exercises,\nthen, that we've prepared.\n\n164\n00:09:25.692 --> 00:09:31.720\nNow, as I've already mentioned in\nprevious episodes, the ITIL class,\n\n165\n00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.373\nitself, well, this course is made\nup at least 50% of exercises.\n\n166\n00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:42.807\nSo we've got some exercises that we\nhave prepared for you to undertake\n\n167\n00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:48.535\nin order to help you gain an understanding\nof the actual course material.\n\n168\n00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.557\nNow, a couple of things\nI want you to notice.\n\n169\n00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:56.710\nAnd the first thing we have right at the\nvery top, in the blue banner at the top,\n\n170\n00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:03.064\nI have implemented or input a recommended\ntiming for this particular exercise.\n\n171\n00:10:03.064 --> 00:10:05.914\nSo for each exercise,\nwe've got a recommended time.\n\n172\n00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:10.476\nThis is how long I expect you to take\nto be able to complete this exercise.\n\n173\n00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:15.178\nAnd some of them, for instance, there's\na question here on the concept of adopting\n\n174\n00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:18.700\nan ITIL framework and\nadapting to suit your environment.\n\n175\n00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.421\nThis one should take five minutes, and\nthe answer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n176\n00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:26.932\nThe next one,\non the description of a service.\n\n177\n00:10:26.932 --> 00:10:31.603\nWell again, this is based on the episode\nwhere we looked at the service\n\n178\n00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:35.680\ndescription, and\nthe answer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n179\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.010\nAnd this should take you five minutes.\n\n180\n00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:43.047\nThis one here looks and\ncompleting an orientation worksheet.\n\n181\n00:10:43.047 --> 00:10:45.683\nNow, wherever you see anything in red, and\n\n182\n00:10:45.683 --> 00:10:51.039\nI've already highlighted this in previous\nepisodes throughout this particular show.\n\n183\n00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.201\nWherever you see something in red,\n\n184\n00:10:53.201 --> 00:10:56.594\nit's in the toolkit at the back\nof this book Section 7.\n\n185\n00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.648\nThis says, complete the orientation\nworksheet for a project.\n\n186\n00:11:01.648 --> 00:11:04.313\nThis is gonna take you about 15 minutes,.\n\n187\n00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:08.141\nSo I want you to take the template\nfrom this toolkit, and\n\n188\n00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:13.109\nI want you to complete an orientation\nworksheet including answering all\n\n189\n00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:15.810\nof those five questions there.\n\n190\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.531\nThat's an orientation worksheet.\n\n191\n00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:20.232\nAnd that'll take you about 15 minutes.\n\n192\n00:11:20.232 --> 00:11:25.046\nAnd this exercise which is an excercise\nin building a business case,\n\n193\n00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:28.542\nand that will take you\naround about 45 minutes.\n\n194\n00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:33.854\nAnd so, here you are submitting\na business case to secure finances,\n\n195\n00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:37.095\nand then I'll put my teeth in in a minute.\n\n196\n00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:41.250\n[LAUGH] You are submitting a business case\nto secure finances, cuz you know that\n\n197\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.810\na business case is a justification for\na significant item of expenditure.\n\n198\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.100\nAnd you're submitting it to the board.\n\n199\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.823\nSo what I need you to do is to compile\na business case, and include all of\n\n200\n00:11:52.823 --> 00:11:58.369\nthe questions that have been asked of you,\nquestions 1 through to questions 8.\n\n201\n00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:02.130\nAnd again, if you need any prompts,\nthen go back to your book.\n\n202\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.010\nAnd that'll take you\naround about 45 minutes.\n\n203\n00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.371\nOur next excercise is on\nour CSI guiding principles.\n\n204\n00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:13.353\nAnd as we looked at that in our previous\nepisodes, we have 9 guiding principles.\n\n205\n00:12:13.353 --> 00:12:18.132\nAnd you are looking to ensure that\nthese principles are followed in\n\n206\n00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:20.103\nthis particular project.\n\n207\n00:12:20.103 --> 00:12:24.785\nSo what I'm looking for at this\nparticular excercise is I'm looking for\n\n208\n00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:29.930\nyou to tell me, just imagine that\nit's me that's asking this question.\n\n209\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:36.040\nI am looking for you to tell me how you're\ngoing to ensure that we work holistically?\n\n210\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.520\nHow are you going to ensure\nthat we progress iteratively?\n\n211\n00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.300\nIn our next exercise, I'm looking for\nyou to do a Sponsor Diagram and\n\n212\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.130\na Sponsor Roadmap as well.\n\n213\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.384\nAgain, they're in red, they're in our\nbook, okay, they're in our toolkit.\n\n214\n00:12:50.384 --> 00:12:54.660\nThis one's going to take you around\nabout 30 minutes to complete.\n\n215\n00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.070\nAgain, we're starting off\nwith a blank piece of paper,\n\n216\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.590\nas we are with most of these exercises.\n\n217\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.398\nSo that's gonna take you about\nhalf an hour, 30 minutes, and\n\n218\n00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:04.889\nthen a Stakeholder Map.\n\n219\n00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.804\nSo this is, using our\nStakeholder Prioritization Matrix,\n\n220\n00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:13.350\nworking out which stakeholders\nare the most influential to us.\n\n221\n00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.760\nAnd then we need to map\nthose stakeholders.\n\n222\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.165\nIn other words, we need to ascertain\nwhether those stakeholders have the right\n\n223\n00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:21.423\nlevel of commitment.\n\n224\n00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:26.121\nAnd what level of commitment\nwe need them to have.\n\n225\n00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:31.008\nAll of these exercises, as I've already\nsaid, are based on your case studies.\n\n226\n00:13:31.008 --> 00:13:36.597\nSo the answer to these exercises are\neither to be found in the case study or\n\n227\n00:13:36.597 --> 00:13:38.900\nto be found in your ITIL book.\n\n228\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.973\nYou're going to get your templates\nfrom your ITIL book, but you're going\n\n229\n00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:48.654\nto get the answers, the information,\nthe meat to go on those bones.\n\n230\n00:13:48.654 --> 00:13:51.718\nEverything that needs to\nbe in those templates,\n\n231\n00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:56.576\nyou're gonna find from your case study,\nor maybe from previous questions,\n\n232\n00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:59.580\nbecause each exercise\nbuilds on the previous.\n\n233\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.860\nThen we've got\nthe Training Needs Analysis.\n\n234\n00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.128\nAgain, the template for\nwhich you're gonna find in your ITIL book.\n\n235\n00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:09.302\nAnd you need to complete\nthe training needs analysis for\n\n236\n00:14:09.302 --> 00:14:13.500\nall of the stakeholders that you've\nidentified in a previous exercise.\n\n237\n00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.870\nAnd you'll need to complete that for\nthis particular project.\n\n238\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.941\nAnd that's gonna take\nyou about 30 minutes.\n\n239\n00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:23.300\nAnd then we're going to be creating\na Stakeholder Communication Plan.\n\n240\n00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.140\nSo planning your communication for\nthis particular project,\n\n241\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.410\nyour communication to everybody\nthat's listed in your case study that\n\n242\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.440\nyou've identified in your\nstakeholder analysis templates.\n\n243\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.413\nAnd then we're going to\ndefine some metrics,\n\n244\n00:14:42.413 --> 00:14:45.925\nwe're gonna define critical\nsuccess factors and KPI's.\n\n245\n00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:50.545\nUsing the templates that are again\ncontained in your ITIL books,\n\n246\n00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:54.581\nwhat I need you to do is to\ncreate a balance set of metrics.\n\n247\n00:14:54.581 --> 00:14:58.035\nSo a balance set of CSS and KPI's.\n\n248\n00:14:58.035 --> 00:15:00.836\nNow I need you to draw on all\nthe information that we covered\n\n249\n00:15:00.836 --> 00:15:03.997\nin the two episodes where we looked\nat metrics and measurements.\n\n250\n00:15:03.997 --> 00:15:08.868\nBut then you also need to use the CSF\nworksheet, and KPI worksheet,\n\n251\n00:15:08.868 --> 00:15:13.070\nthat are identified and\noutlined here in your ITIL books.\n\n252\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.820\nAnd taking the information from\nour previous exercises, and\n\n253\n00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.770\nfrom the case study, in order to do that.\n\n254\n00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.860\nAnd then we're going to complete\na Benefits Realization.\n\n255\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.730\nSo we're at the end of the project now.\n\n256\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.831\nThe project's been implemented, and\n\n257\n00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:31.148\nnow I need you to complete\na Benefits Realization worksheet.\n\n258\n00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:35.487\nIn other words, did that project actually\ndeliver what it was supposed to do?\n\n259\n00:15:35.487 --> 00:15:39.927\nAnd this one's going to take you,\nagain, about 30 minutes to do.\n\n260\n00:15:39.927 --> 00:15:44.860\nNow, all of these exercises,\nthey're going to take you some time.\n\n261\n00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.846\nThere are a good few hours\nworth of exercises here.\n\n262\n00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:52.684\nAnd then once you've completed that,\nfeel free to

is the time to take your sample paper.\n\n268\n00:16:06.751 --> 00:16:12.049\nAnd in subsequent episodes, we will\nbe going over the sample paper that\n\n269\n00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:17.640\nis in the downloadable material and\ngetting you ready for your real test.\n\n270\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.641\nSo good luck.\n\n271\n00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:20.929\n&gt;&gt; All right thank you Jo, for\nall that guidance there but\n\n272\n00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:23.700\nit looks like we have some\nwork to do on our own now.\n\n273\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.541\nSo thank you joining us as well.\n\n274\n00:16:25.541 --> 00:16:29.136\nAnd get ready for some more\nstudying material headed your way.\n\n275\n00:16:29.136 --> 00:16:30.824\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:15.397\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.397 --> 00:00:18.290\nYou're watching\nthe ITIL Practitioner show.\n\n5\n00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.840\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're doing an exam introduction here.\n\n6\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.380\nAnd here to help us out is going to,\nwell, Miss Jo Peacock.\n\n7\n00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.600\nAnd she's actually gonna\ndo a sample paper with us.\n\n8\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.180\nSo, Jo, welcome to the studios.\n\n9\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for\nhaving me, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.860\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.990\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, Jo.\n\n12\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.980\nNow as we take a look at this sample\npaper, It should help us to prepare for\n\n13\n00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860\nthe ITIL practitioner exam.\n\n14\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.430\nSo Jo, where are we gonna begin?\n\n15\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.982\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, yes you're right,\nthis is exactly what we want to do.\n\n16\n00:00:43.982 --> 00:00:49.084\nWe just want to prepare for your real\nexam, and I just really wanna spend this\n\n17\n00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:54.202\nsession, very, very short session,\njust going over some hints and tips.\n\n18\n00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.577\nAnd what you need to look out for as you\nnot only prepare to take your sample\n\n19\n00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:02.140\npaper, but\nalso prepare to take your real exam.\n\n20\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.320\nSo let's start off with then, well,\nwhat are the resources that you need?\n\n21\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.690\nThe resources that you have\nactually at your fingertips.\n\n22\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.270\nThis particular qualification, the ITIL\npractitioner qualification is unlike\n\n23\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.460\nany of the other ITIL qualifications in\nthat this particular test is open-book.\n\n24\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.290\nIt is the only ITIL\ntest that is open-book.\n\n25\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.320\nWhen I mean open book,\nI mean this book here.\n\n26\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.260\nThis is your purple ITIL Practitioner,\nyour official ITIL guidance, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.688\nIt's come from AXELOS,\n\n28\n00:01:39.688 --> 00:01:44.186\nwell actually it says here that it's\nproperty of Her Majesty's Government!\n\n29\n00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:46.609\n&gt;&gt; Ooh!\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it's not even yours.\n\n30\n00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.160\n[LAUGH] It is, it's okay, it's yours.\n\n31\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.300\nSo this ITL book, well the most useful\nthing about this ITL book that you're\n\n32\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.240\ngoing to find certainly during your test,\nis going to be section number 7,\n\n33\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.680\nand you can see.\n\n34\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.840\nAnd this is your toolkit.\n\n35\n00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.500\nNow remember as we went\nthrough our course.\n\n36\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.940\nAnd as we went through all of the episodes\nwhere we looked at your exercises as well.\n\n37\n00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.710\nWell, here we outlined,\n\n38\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.030\nI outlined the tool kit and what was\nin the toolkit which was templates.\n\n39\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.289\nLots and lots of templates for you to use\nduring your test, and also throughout\n\n40\n00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:28.560\nyour real-world experience of ITIL\nwhen you're implementing ITIL as well.\n\n41\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.590\nThese are templates for all of\nthe techniques that we looked at, and also\n\n42\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.110\nthings like the CSI register, and as we've\ngot here, a KPI worksheet, for instance.\n\n43\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.210\nThis test is open-book.\n\n44\n00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.240\nNow your sample paper\nis open book as well.\n\n45\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.240\nI have already given you a warning in the\nsection where we looked at the exercises.\n\n46\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.480\nNow I'll mention it again that in terms\n\n47\n00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.340\nof the official use of your\nbook during your online test.\n\n48\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.790\nYour book should be unmarked, so\nplease don't make any notes in your book.\n\n49\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.527\nThere is no guarantee that the proctor\nwill allow you to use your\n\n50\n00:03:06.527 --> 00:03:08.933\nbook if they see notes within your book.\n\n51\n00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:13.168\nSo I would always as\na recommendation use these tabs,\n\n52\n00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:18.260\nremovable tabs then you can take\nthem off just before your test.\n\n53\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.040\nSo your test, and\nthis applies to your sample test as well,\n\n54\n00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.161\nwe're going to start off looking at your\ncase study, this test is case study based.\n\n55\n00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:31.528\nAnd here you have,\nin your downloadable material,\n\n56\n00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:36.660\nit's at the start of your exercises,\nyou have a copy of the case study.\n\n57\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.730\nThis is the case study that\nwill be used during your test.\n\n58\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.050\nNow, you can not print off this case\nstudy to use during your real life test.\n\n59\n00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.950\nYou can print off this case study\nto use during your sample paper.\n\n60\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.860\nAnd obviously I want you to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.150\nBut, this case study you can not\nprint off during your real life test.\n\n62\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.829\nThey will provide you with another\nversion of that case study.\n\n63\n00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.431\nIt'll be exactly the same case study,\nbut you won't be able to print it off.\n\n64\n00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:07.205\nAnd you won't be able to make notes.\n\n65\n00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:13.640\nSo you are not allowed to take\nanything printed into your test.\n\n66\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.860\nNothing at all other than this book.\n\n67\n00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.778\nAnd this book does not\ncontain the case study.\n\n68\n00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:23.546\nNow, I've already said this at\nthe beginning of the exercises and\n\n69\n00:04:23.546 --> 00:04:26.250\nI'm going to say this again to you,\nright now.\n\n70\n00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.820\nDon't forget you're going to have\na case study on your screen.\n\n71\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.520\nYou're also going to have a question\nbooklet on your screen in front of you.\n\n72\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.736\nYou're also going to have an answer\nsheet on your screen as well.\n\n73\n00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:44.880\nThat means you have to have three\ndifferent Windows opened on your screen.\n\n74\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.160\nSo if I were you, I'd give myself\na little bit of a head start and\n\n75\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.169\nI'd get to know my case\nstudy before my test.\n\n76\n00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.529\nThe case study as I've said it's\nat the start of the exercises and\n\n77\n00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.290\nit's three pages long at\nthe start of the exercises.\n\n78\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.130\nYou have your flow chart that shows\nhow the company and the subsidiaries\n\n79\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.880\nhang together, then you have information\nabout CruiseAlong cars and DriveYou.com.\n\n80\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.480\nAnd then you have information\nabout the UOB, and\n\n81\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.250\nGlobal City IT Services,\nand NSDOT as well.\n\n82\n00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.575\nGet to know that case study.\n\n83\n00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:25.567\nGet to know it like the back of your hand,\nso then you don't have to refer to it\n\n84\n00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:29.710\ntoo much during your test,\nthe best advice that I can give you.\n\n85\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.184\nYour test is two hours and\n15 minutes in length.\n\n86\n00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:42.280\nYour test is 40 questions long,\n4-0, not 14, it's 4-0.\n\n87\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.556\nUnlike the intermediates that were eight\nquestions long or MALC that was ten,\n\n88\n00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:47.347\nthis is 40.\n\n89\n00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:52.370\nVery, very similar to foundation but\nthat's where the similarity lies.\n\n90\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.056\nYou will also get at the beginning\nof the each what I call section you\n\n91\n00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.735\nwill get the attached.\n\n92\n00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:01.627\nWhat you can see in front of you now for\n\n93\n00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:07.810\nevery six questions you will have what\nwe call supplemental information.\n\n94\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.230\nSee here it says additional\ninformation for questions 1 to 6.\n\n95\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:19.470\nThat supplemental information is for\nthose questions that are mentioned only.\n\n96\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.920\nIt's not for any other questions.\n\n97\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.089\nIn this case, it mentions questions\n1 to 6, or 1 through to 6.\n\n98\n00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.880\nThis supplemental information\nis not relevant for\n\n99\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.180\nany other questions,\nthat's incredibly important.\n\n100\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.119\nSo you will need to refer\nto both the case study and\n\n101\n00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.727\nto the supplemental information to\nanswer questions 1 through to 6.\n\n102\n00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:46.946\nNow the question format is very,\n\n103\n00:06:46.946 --> 00:06:52.030\nvery similar to the question format\nin the ITL foundation material.\n\n104\n00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.860\nHowever, they're not testing your\nability to be able to remember.\n\n105\n00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.959\nIn this particular test, they're testing\nyour ability to be able to implement ITIL.\n\n106\n00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.570\nThey're testing your ability\nto be able to improve ITIL.\n\n107\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.260\nIt's very important that you\nunderstand the objectives and\n\n108\n00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.740\nthe purpose of each of your ITIL\nprocesses before you go into this test.\n\n109\n00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.160\nNow we didn't go over these during\nITIL practitioner episodes.\n\n110\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.950\nWe only went over\nthe implementation of ITIL.\n\n111\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.720\nSo I need you in preparation for your test\nand in preparation for this sample test to\n\n112\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.090\nreview your objectives and your purposes\nfor all of your ITIL processes.\n\n113\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.170\nAnd then doing your test refer to\nthis additional information, and\n\n114\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.670\nrefer to the case study as well.\n\n115\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.140\nYou have two hours and 50 minutes, and\nit seems like a huge amount of time.\n\n116\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.480\nYou think I've got 40 minutes.\n\n117\n00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.000\nSo I've got 40 questions and\ntwo hours and 50 minutes.\n\n118\n00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.180\nI've got a huge amount of time,\nbelieve me, it will go very, very quick.\n\n119\n00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.434\nSo please make sure that every question is\nanswered, that you don't leave one blank.\n\n120\n00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:02.451\nYou know if you leave one blank,\n\n121\n00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:06.647\nthen you've got 100% chance of\ngetting that question wrong.\n\n122\n00:08:06.647 --> 00:08:10.364\nIf you put one answer in there,\neven if you're not sure of the answer,\n\n123\n00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:14.090\nyou've got at least a 25% chance\nof getting the right answer.\n\n124\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.130\nSo don't leave anything blank,\nuse common sense.\n\n125\n00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.610\nThere are gonna be some questions\nthat you're going to have to think.\n\n126\n00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.530\nYou're going to have to sit there and\n\n127\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.940\nwork out the answer,\npossibly by process of elimination.\n\n128\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.970\nSo leave yourself enough time to do that.\n\n129\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.290\nIf you get to a question where you're\nnot sure immediately of the answer\n\n130\n00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.440\nmove on to the next one and\nthen come back to that one at the end.\n\n131\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.780\nJust make sure that every single\nquestion does have an answer in it.\n\n132\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.180\nThere are gonna be those that\nare going to seem straight forward and\n\n133\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.390\nyou're going to say,\nit really can't be that simple, yes it is.\n\n134\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.050\nThe ones that seem straight forward,\nare straight forward.\n\n135\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.839\nGo with your gut instinct and\ndon't change your answer.\n\n136\n00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.030\nWell over 90% of people that change their\nanswers, change them to the wrong ones.\n\n137\n00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.560\nSo, let's not change any answers, okay.\n\n138\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.650\nRead the full question.\n\n139\n00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:15.000\nRemember my acronym, when it comes to\ntesting RTFQ, read the full question.\n\n140\n00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.460\nThere are no words in those questions\nthat aren't meant to be there.\n\n141\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.508\nSo don't try and\nskim read through the questions.\n\n142\n00:09:20.508 --> 00:09:24.560\nDon't try and skip any words,\nread the full question.\n\n143\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.520\nAnd as long as you read the full question\nand you go with your gut instinct\n\n144\n00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.590\nthen you should hit on the right\nanswer without any problem whatsoever.\n\n145\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:38.450\nDon't try and second guess yourself,\ndon't try and overcomplicate things,\n\n146\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.630\ngo with the answer that seems obvious\nto you and then at the end of your test\n\n147\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.130\nthen you simply when you're doing your\nlive test you click on submit and\n\n148\n00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.330\nyou can submit your test.\n\n149\n00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.082\nOr as soon as you finish your sample paper\nthen I would like you to tune back in and\n\n150\n00:09:54.082 --> 00:09:58.979\nto watch the episode on the exam review\nwell we'll spend a couple of episodes just\n\n151\n00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:00.871\ngoing over all the questions.\n\n152\n00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:05.250\nAnd why they are the relevant answers\nthe correct answers to those particular\n\n153\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.310\nquestions.\n\n154\n00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.990\nBut for now what I am going to say\nto you is print off your case study,\n\n155\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:16.400\nmake sure that you read\nthe supplemental information at\n\n156\n00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.830\nthe top of each section and\ncheck what questions it's relevant for.\n\n157\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.250\nMake sure that you have your\nbook to hand and good luck.\n\n158\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.280\nAnd I'll see you in the next episode when\nwe're going to review how you went on.\n\n159\n00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.300\n&gt;&gt; All right Joe, thank you again for\nhelping us at least,\n\n160\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.426\nto get everything situated in our mind.\n\n161\n00:10:38.426 --> 00:10:41.787\nAnd to emphasize the fact that,\nknowing that case study is gonna be\n\n162\n00:10:41.787 --> 00:10:45.928\nthe most beneficial thing that we can do\nright now, as we get ready to prepare, and\n\n163\n00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:48.828\nto do not only the sampling paper,\nbut also for the exam.\n\n164\n00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:51.664\nIt's a great place to also\nend this episode then,\n\n165\n00:10:51.664 --> 00:10:54.849\nsigning off from ITPRO.TV I'm\nyour host Ronnie Wong.\n\n166\n00:10:54.849 --> 00:10:55.940\n&gt;&gt; And I am Jo Peacock.\n\n167\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.572\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the ITIL

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.626\n[SOUND] Hi, I'm Jo Peacock with ITPRO.TV.\n\n2\n00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:11.585\nAnd so, congratulations because by\nnow you have completed your ITIL\n\n3\n00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.738\npractitioner sample paper.\n\n4\n00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:18.660\nSo now is the time when we want to go\nover that sample paper with you and\n\n5\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.130\njust see how you did.\n\n6\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.910\nAnd just give you a few pointers\nhere on the answers to some of\n\n7\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.400\nthe questions that you know hopefully\nyou didn't struggle too much with.\n\n8\n00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.070\nSo the first thing then that we're gonna\ntake a look at is that case study, okay.\n\n9\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.530\nYou have been given your case study, and\n\n10\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.080\nyour case study is the same case study\nyou're gonna use in your real life test.\n\n11\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.180\nSo here is just your case study for\nyour sample paper.\n\n12\n00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.090\nAnd it just looks at right at the very\nbeginning our flow chart of all of\n\n13\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.920\nour organizations including\nCruise Along Cars and\n\n14\n00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.700\ntheir partner University of Backstein and\ndriveyou.com, the subsidiary, and\n\n15\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.200\nthe the service provider\nGlobal City IT services.\n\n16\n00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.257\nAnd then Ever Gone State Department\nof Transport who are working with you\n\n17\n00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:06.596\non driveyou.com etc.\n\n18\n00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:12.798\nSo by now, if you've taken time to\nobserve all of the relationships here\n\n19\n00:01:12.798 --> 00:01:18.289\nbetween all of these organizations,\nand their subsidiaries,\n\n20\n00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:25.017\nthen that should give you an insight\ninto exactly what this organizations do.\n\n21\n00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:28.020\nAnd the relationships\nbetween each of them.\n\n22\n00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.550\nSo here's your case study,\nyou have three pages of case study.\n\n23\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.684\nAnd then for\nthe first set of six questions,\n\n24\n00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:39.085\nyou've got this supplementary information.\n\n25\n00:01:39.085 --> 00:01:44.397\nAnd so the questions that you will be\nasked will be based on your case study and\n\n26\n00:01:44.397 --> 00:01:49.388\nthe supplementary information that\napplies only to those questions.\n\n27\n00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:53.950\nSo those are questions 1 through to 6.\n\n28\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.710\nSo we know that we've got\ncentralization of IT functions,\n\n29\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380\ncalls to the services have grown.\n\n30\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.450\nAnd there's initiative on the way to\nimprove problem management to reduce\n\n31\n00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.300\nincidents that's proactive\nproblem management.\n\n32\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.292\nRemember this from your ITIL foundation.\n\n33\n00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:18.286\nAnd I said to you when we looked at the\nepisode where we did the preparation for\n\n34\n00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:19.623\nyour sample paper.\n\n35\n00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:24.465\nAnd I told then that what I needed you\nto do was to review your foundation\n\n36\n00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:27.432\nobjectives and purposes of each process.\n\n37\n00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:33.960\nAnd it's needed straight away in\nquestion 1 in the sample paper.\n\n38\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.720\nRecent problems mean that\nwe've got difficulty for\n\n39\n00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.100\nstudents connecting to the WiFi and that\nkey card management service failures have\n\n40\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.810\ncreated a long delays in revoking access,\nokay.\n\n41\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.284\nSo in question 1 then,\n\n42\n00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:50.440\nwhat are the BEST steps to start\nimproving problem management.\n\n43\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.537\nWell, the answer to this one is d.\n\n44\n00:02:54.537 --> 00:02:58.910\nd is to identify commonly recurring\nincidents, develop work-arounds, and\n\n45\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.442\ninvestigate root causes.\n\n46\n00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:05.740\nBecause that is the purpose of\nproactive problem management.\n\n47\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.880\nNot only is it that, but it also relates\ndirectly back to that supplemental\n\n48\n00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.090\ndocumentation, the supplemental\ninformation that you have there.\n\n49\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.190\nRemember, you don't implement ITIL\nproblem management because ITILs\n\n50\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.545\nnot plug and play.\n\n51\n00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:23.280\nITILs not something that you can\njust take out of the book, and\n\n52\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.750\nyou can just implement.\n\n53\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.240\nSo d refers directly to\nproactive problem management.\n\n54\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.330\nSo which problem then do we\nthink has the highest priority?\n\n55\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.570\nWell, it's the keycard management\nproblem because it's gonna\n\n56\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.550\nresult in significant risk.\n\n57\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.610\nBecause we've had problems because\nof this in revoking access.\n\n58\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.374\nThat's significant risk to the university,\nokay.\n\n59\n00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:50.111\nIn terms of significant cost,\nif you picked an answer that\n\n60\n00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:54.707\nlooked at significant cost,\nthat would be an assumption I'm afraid.\n\n61\n00:03:54.707 --> 00:04:01.642\nCuz there's no mention of significant\ncost to the organization at all,\n\n62\n00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:06.680\nwhereas we know that security\nwill be a risk, okay.\n\n63\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.040\nSo what about number 3 then?\n\n64\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.097\nProblem management is being implemented,\n\n65\n00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:12.102\nwhat is the purpose of\nthe did we get there?\n\n66\n00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:15.054\nThat step in the CSI approach.\n\n67\n00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:19.023\nDid we get there is a look back to see\nwhether we've achieved what we set out to\n\n68\n00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:19.880\nachieve.\n\n69\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.860\nSo that is to ensure that\nproblem management has been\n\n70\n00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.290\nimplemented effectively.\n\n71\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.780\nNumber 4, I love this question,\nthis is my favorite question.\n\n72\n00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.170\nThe question says, and\n\n73\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.560\nI always give you this acronym,\nRTFQ, Read The Full Question.\n\n74\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.575\nAnd there's a reason for this, and\nquestion 4 will highlight this.\n\n75\n00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:44.625\nBecause it tells you that this is an\nextract from benefits realization review\n\n76\n00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:49.155\nand I know that in your particular sample\npaper that you've downloaded then you have\n\n77\n00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:51.575\nseen this in form of a table.\n\n78\n00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:55.615\nAnd it gives you baseline value and\nexpected result and achieved results.\n\n79\n00:04:55.615 --> 00:05:01.050\nThe question asks you RTFQ,\nRead The Full Question.\n\n80\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.990\nThe question asks you,\nis this a valid use of the template?\n\n81\n00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.380\nThe question does not ask you whether\nyou have achieved a benefit or not.\n\n82\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.336\nThe question just asks you\nwhether the template is valid.\n\n83\n00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:22.922\nRemember you should only answer\nthe question that's being asked of you and\n\n84\n00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:25.774\nnot the question that\nyou think you've read.\n\n85\n00:05:25.774 --> 00:05:28.579\nAnd the answer here is a, because yes,\n\n86\n00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.920\nthe template shows whether\nthe benefit was achieved or not.\n\n87\n00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.942\nIt didn't ask you whether\nthe benefit was achieved.\n\n88\n00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:40.705\nIt's asking you whether it's\na valid use of the template.\n\n89\n00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:43.900\nAnd the answer to this is, yes it is.\n\n90\n00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.720\nIt's a valid use of the template,\nremember to read the full question.\n\n91\n00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:51.105\nSo what about number 5 then?\n\n92\n00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:55.125\nWhen assessing complaints,\nwhat's the BEST approach to start with?\n\n93\n00:05:55.125 --> 00:06:01.045\nRemember our CSI guiding principles, and\nour guiding principles especially the one,\n\n94\n00:06:01.045 --> 00:06:04.802\nmy favorite one which is\nthe Gget off your bum.\n\n95\n00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:10.042\nRemember what I said in the episodes when\nwe talked about getting off your bum.\n\n96\n00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:14.572\nAnd I said how many times if\nsomebody asks you a question and\n\n97\n00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:17.342\nyou are sat in a restaurant and\nsomebody comes up to you and\n\n98\n00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:21.292\nsays how was your meal, you're going\nto say, yeah it's fine thank you.\n\n99\n00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.470\nYou have to get up and\nsee because asking a question\n\n100\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.000\nis not necessarily going to\nget you the right result.\n\n101\n00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.565\nSo, as we've all ready said,\nget off your bum, it's c,\n\n102\n00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:39.060\ngo and sit in operation and\nsee what's really going on.\n\n103\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.160\nAnd then number 6 then, improving problem\nmanagement, we want to use skills and\n\n104\n00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.730\nknowledge held across teams.\n\n105\n00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.990\nSo this is about collaboration, and\nthis is also about transparency.\n\n106\n00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.210\nSo how do we apply our guiding principles?\n\n107\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.710\nWell, it's about sharing\nvisibility of incidents and\n\n108\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.980\nproblems, it's about transparency.\n\n109\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.400\nSo now then we move into question 7 and\n\n110\n00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.230\nyou'll see that our supplementary\ninformation has changed.\n\n111\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.120\nAnd UoB has a satellite campus that's\nserved by an internal service desk\n\n112\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.610\nwith three service desk analysts\nthat have been using Excel.\n\n113\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.800\nWe need to transition that service\ndesk to use the corporate tool,\n\n114\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.570\nto improve data sharing and transparency.\n\n115\n00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:27.270\nNow, this is very important, the UoB\nservice desk manager is accountable,\n\n116\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.500\nbut the local manager is responsible.\n\n117\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.720\nBecause it's his team that need\nto actually make the transition.\n\n118\n00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.891\nSo what is OCM?\n\n119\n00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:39.511\nWell we know that OCM is the approach for\nmanaging the people aspect.\n\n120\n00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:44.270\nSo we know that OCM is about the people,\nso the answer here is b.\n\n121\n00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.590\nWhich activity then identifies\nareas of weakness for the analysts?\n\n122\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.130\nWell, that's a training needs analysis.\n\n123\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.650\nIt's analyzing those\ntraining needs it's a TNA.\n\n124\n00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.022\nAgain it's a template that\nyou would find in your book,\n\n125\n00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:02.840\nin your ITL practitioner\nbook in the tool kit.\n\n126\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.190\nNumber 9, we know that the service desk\nanalysts are likely to resist the change.\n\n127\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.110\nHow do we overcome this?\n\n128\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.400\nAgain, we meet with them,\nwe get off our bums, we go and\n\n129\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:22.270\nmeet the service desk analysts, and we\nanswer the question what's in it for me.\n\n130\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.900\nThat's the question\nthat we have to answer.\n\n131\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.240\nWhat's in it for me?\n\n132\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.445\nSo what about number 10 then?\n\n133\n00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:31.987\nNumber 10 you have a diagram,\n\n134\n00:08:31.987 --> 00:08:37.082\na hierarchical diagram that is\nin your downloadable material.\n\n135\n00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:40.890\nWhich is what I expect you to have\nsee in your actual question booklet.\n\n136\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.750\nBut which roles in that diagram\nare the reinforcing sponsors?\n\n137\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.810\nReinforcing sponsor, as you remember\nfrom what we covered in our material,\n\n138\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.370\nis a manager that will guide you.\n\n139\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.497\nIt's a manager that reinforces the vision.\n\n140\n00:08:55.497 --> 00:09:00.406\nAnd that would be the UoB service task\nmanager because he has accountability.\n\n141\n00:09:00.406 --> 00:09:04.956\nAnd the local manager because he has\nresponsibility to ensure that in\n\n142\n00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:09.410\nthat particular improvement initiative,\nthat change happens.\n\n143\n00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.750\nAnd according to the scenario then,\n\n144\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.290\nwhich combination of roles\nhave been mapped correctly?\n\n145\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.290\nWhich combination of roles\nhave been mapped correctly\n\n146\n00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.140\naccording to this scenario?\n\n147\n00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.880\nAnd the following RACI matrix\nto reflect the high level?\n\n148\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.490\nWell, take a look at this one,\nthe local manager in Kuala Lumpur, well,\n\n149\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.920\nis he accountable for any of these?\n\n150\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.110\nNo, he's not, we know that the UoB\nservice manager is accountable.\n\n151\n00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.167\nWe also know, and it tells us in\nthe supplementary information,\n\n152\n00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:46.657\nthat the local manager in\nKuala Lumpur is responsible.\n\n153\n00:09:46.657 --> 00:09:51.534\nIn which case then, the service\ndesk analysts are consulted, and\n\n154\n00:09:51.534 --> 00:09:54.683\nthe UoB manager, IT manager is informed.\n\n155\n00:09:54.683 --> 00:09:58.589\nBecause if we've got the accountability\nand the responsibility right,\n\n156\n00:09:58.589 --> 00:10:00.169\nthen the answer can only be b.\n\n157\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.037\nIn our stakeholder map then who's going\nto fit into the significant stakeholder\n\n158\n00:10:07.037 --> 00:10:08.380\ncategory?\n\n159\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.460\nBecause they've got high interest,\nbut they've got low power.\n\n160\n00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.230\nWell, that would be\nthe service desk analysts.\n\n161\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.343\nThey have a huge amount of interest,\nand they could still influence,\n\n162\n00:10:18.343 --> 00:10:22.958\ncertainly en masse, because these\nare the people that are making the change.\n\n163\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:29.035\nSo they have high interest, but they don't\nhave any power unfortunately in this.\n\n164\n00:10:29.035 --> 00:10:31.505\nDespite the fact that,\nas I've already said,\n\n165\n00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:34.790\nthese are the people that\nare making the change.\n\n166\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.200\nThey're actually performing\nthis change themselves.\n\n167\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.630\nSo now we move through into questions 13\nto 20, and again you'll see that we've got\n\n168\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.850\nsupplementary information here for\nquestions 13 through 20.\n\n169\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.850\nAnd they've decided to\nconsolidate their service desks.\n\n170\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:56.781\nThe goal is to, well reduce cost, deliver\na consistent service for roaming users.\n\n171\n00:10:56.781 --> 00:11:00.297\nThese are very important,\nit's to improve service quality, and\n\n172\n00:11:00.297 --> 00:11:02.442\nthey've appointed a project manager.\n\n173\n00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:06.230\nWho is planning an assessment\nof the current state.\n\n174\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.697\nSo the project manager is\ndefining CSFs and KPIs, so\n\n175\n00:11:11.697 --> 00:11:14.365\nwhat hierarchical approach do we use?\n\n176\n00:11:14.365 --> 00:11:20.405\nWell we know that we use the vision to\nmetrics tree to define CSFs, and KPIs.\n\n177\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.207\nAnd which approach then,\n\n178\n00:11:24.207 --> 00:11:28.560\nso which one of these CSFs is to\nprovide a more consistent service?\n\n179\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.510\nWhich KPIs would best underpin this?\n\n180\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:36.403\nWell, we want reduction in incidents\nbeing re-opened by roaming users\n\n181\n00:11:36.403 --> 00:11:39.783\nbecause we know that roaming\nusers have an issue.\n\n182\n00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:45.209\nThey're looking for consistency, and\nthen we want number 2 which a 25%\n\n183\n00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:50.234\nincrease in satisfaction ratings\nat call closure for roaming users.\n\n184\n00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:53.450\nBecause again, we know that\nthey're looking for consistency.\n\n185\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.480\nNumber 3 is not valid because we know that\nthe roaming users aren't looking for cost.\n\n186\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.600\nAnd customer satisfaction for\nan annual survey,\n\n187\n00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.790\nwell that's just a one off measurement.\n\n188\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.175\nAnd that's not really going to\ndemonstrate consistency, is it?\n\n189\n00:12:07.175 --> 00:12:11.741\nIt's just going to demonstrate\nwhere we are at a snapshot in time.\n\n190\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.310\nSo let's take a look then at number 15.\n\n191\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.362\nThe project manager has\nproposed the following KPIs\n\n192\n00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:24.327\nto measure service quality,\nare these balanced?\n\n193\n00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:29.288\nThis can be a tough question, and\nbecause you don't know what balance it is\n\n194\n00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:34.426\nthey're looking for you know that we've\ngot inside out and outside in KPIs.\n\n195\n00:12:34.426 --> 00:12:39.098\nYou've got leading and trailing KPIs,\nyou've got the balance score card approach\n\n196\n00:12:39.098 --> 00:12:42.915\nwhere we're looking at innovation and\nwe're looking at finance and\n\n197\n00:12:42.915 --> 00:12:47.000\nwe're looking at processes, and\nwe're looking at customer view.\n\n198\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.610\nYou don't know what balance\nit is they're looking for.\n\n199\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.500\nAre they looking for balance across\ntechnology and process metrics, for\n\n200\n00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.740\ninstance?\n\n201\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:59.230\nWe don't know, but\nlet's take a look at the answers.\n\n202\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:06.645\nThe answer could be a, So\nlet's put a question mark next to it.\n\n203\n00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:10.880\nWell, let's take a look at b, no,\nbecause there are no leading KPIs.\n\n204\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.300\nThe KPI that's leading is\na KPI that's looking forwards.\n\n205\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.280\nAre there any leading KPIs?\n\n206\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.590\nNo, there are not.\n\n207\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.740\nSo, we know that that's a true statement.\n\n208\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.895\nSo let's put a tick next to that,\nor a check mark next to that.\n\n209\n00:13:23.895 --> 00:13:27.159\nLet's look at c, and\nc says there are no processed KPIs.\n\n210\n00:13:27.159 --> 00:13:33.293\nBut there are processed KPI's,\nthe bottom two are processed KPI's.\n\n211\n00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:36.778\nAnd look d then,\nthere are no inside out KPI's,\n\n212\n00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:39.842\nwell inside out KPIs are internal KPI's.\n\n213\n00:13:39.842 --> 00:13:43.107\nAnd the increase in knowledge\nresolved by incident,\n\n214\n00:13:43.107 --> 00:13:46.570\nby knowledge base that's an internal KPI.\n\n215\n00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.340\nSo we know that d is not\na true statement either.\n\n216\n00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.580\nSo c and d aren't true but\nwe know that b is true.\n\n217\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.550\nIf b is true then the answer can't be a,\nso it has to be b.\n\n218\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.200\nBecause the answer is no cuz b is true.\n\n219\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.230\nWe have to get to that one by\na process of elimination, and\n\n220\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.940\nI know that some of you\nwere tripped up by that.\n\n221\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.230\nBut we get to the answer but\nprocess of elimination.\n\n222\n00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.470\nSo let's take number 16 then.\n\n223\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.410\nWe need to understand how\nthe service desks are working and\n\n224\n00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:21.520\nthe best course of action,\nas always we know is to get off your bomb.\n\n225\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.280\nHowever we've gotta be\nrealistic in this as well.\n\n226\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.848\nBecause this one here says, visit\na representative sample of service desks,\n\n227\n00:14:28.848 --> 00:14:32.180\nand surely d says visit all service desks,\ndoesn't it?\n\n228\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.200\nBut think about where\nthe service desks are.\n\n229\n00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:42.310\nTake a look at your case study and\nyou will see where the service desks are.\n\n230\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:47.015\nAnd they are global service desks\nin which case it's not practical to\n\n231\n00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:48.809\nvisit all service desks.\n\n232\n00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:51.683\nSo we'd visit a representative sample, but\n\n233\n00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:55.473\nwhat we make sure is that we\nare consistent in our approach.\n\n234\n00:14:55.473 --> 00:15:02.154\nAnd that we will get the same data\nfrom all of our service desks.\n\n235\n00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:06.510\nSo then what about number 17 then?\n\n236\n00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.870\nThe project manager has\naccessed the service desks and\n\n237\n00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.880\nhe's written that following report.\n\n238\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.830\nAnd that report, as you can see,\nit says all of the following.\n\n239\n00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.470\nAnd what it does ask though is,\n\n240\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.580\ndoes that report enable a decision\nto be made on the next action.\n\n241\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.030\nYes it does, because it tells us\nthat there are no consistent KPIs.\n\n242\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.806\nThe bottom bullet point there,\n\n243\n00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:30.367\nthere are no consistent KPIs to\nenable an adequate comparison.\n\n244\n00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:35.203\nSo the decision that we can\nmake on the next action is\n\n245\n00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:40.040\nvery simply that we need to get so\nmore data to be able\n\n246\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.660\nto support a decision,\nwe need consistent KPI.\n\n247\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.759\nSo yeah, the answer is yes,\nwe make a decision to get better reports.\n\n248\n00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:53.512\nAnd that's the decision that we make.\n\n249\n00:15:53.512 --> 00:15:56.437\nSo number 18 then,\nKPIs have been established,\n\n250\n00:15:56.437 --> 00:15:58.700\nall have been defined to established.\n\n251\n00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.263\nDid we get there?\n\n252\n00:16:00.263 --> 00:16:01.984\nAre these KPIs SMART?\n\n253\n00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:06.667\nRemember specific, measurable,\nachievable, realistic or relevant,\n\n254\n00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:08.018\nare they time bound?\n\n255\n00:16:08.018 --> 00:16:11.260\nAnd it says here the answer is no\nbecause one of them's not time bound.\n\n256\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.390\nOne of them talks about the annual\nsurvey but the other one doesn't.\n\n257\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.200\nIt doesn't give a period of time and so\n\n258\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.630\nknow that second one is definitely,\ndefinitely not time bound.\n\n259\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.070\nSo number 19 then,\nduring the consolidation project,\n\n260\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.565\nit's clear that some people do\nnot understand the need for CSFs.\n\n261\n00:16:29.565 --> 00:16:33.995\nThat's the critical success factors, and\nthey believe that KPIs are sufficient.\n\n262\n00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:40.100\nThe project manager says, no,\nwe've got to have CSFs and KPIs.\n\n263\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.500\nIs he right?\n\n264\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.700\nAnd the answer, of course, is yes.\n\n265\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:48.229\nCuz if we focus just on the stats,\nif we focus just on the reporting,\n\n266\n00:16:48.229 --> 00:16:53.954\nthen people will do whatever they\ncan to make the reporting look good.\n\n267\n00:16:53.954 --> 00:16:58.868\nSo then question 20 then,\nquestion 20 looks at the most relevant\n\n268\n00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:02.692\nquality metric for\nthe service desk consolidation.\n\n269\n00:17:02.692 --> 00:17:07.810\nWe're talking about quality,\ncost is not quality.\n\n270\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.190\nAnd so it's either going to\nbe network availability or\n\n271\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.100\nit's going to be incident resolution time.\n\n272\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.732\nWell of course, we know from foundation\nthat the service desk own incident\n\n273\n00:17:17.732 --> 00:17:23.263\nmanagement, and so therefore, the quality\nmetric is going to be incident resolution.\n\n274\n00:17:25.531 --> 00:17:32.210\nAnd so now we covered half of\nthe ITIL practitioner test.\n\n275\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:37.220\nAnd so for this particular episode,\nwe're going to just wrap this up and\n\n276\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.120\nwhen you come back, and\nplease join us for our next episode.\n\n277\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.119\nAnd in our next episode,\nwe will look at questions 21 through\n\n278\n00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:47.823\nto questions 40 on the ITIL\npractitioner sample paper.\n\n279\n00:17:47.823 -->

Part 2 of your\nITIL Practitioner sample paper review.\n\n4\n00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.150\nAnd in our previous episode,\n\n5\n00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630\nwe went through questions\none through to questions 20.\n\n6\n00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.990\nAnd now we're going to go through\nquestions 21 through to question 40.\n\n7\n00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.728\nSo let's start off with question 21.\n\n8\n00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:30.711\nAnd with question 21 we've got additional,\nsupplemental information that tells\n\n9\n00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.069\nus that Global City IT Services have\nidentified the needs to textualize and\n\n10\n00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.610\nconsolidate to offer a more\ncoordinated approach.\n\n11\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.859\nThere are several teams,\neach with their own director.\n\n12\n00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.393\nAnd they're going to run an improvement\nprogram to consolidate and centralize,\n\n13\n00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:48.830\nwhich will require collaboration.\n\n14\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.320\nSo, question 21 talks about an ongoing\ncommunication plan that includes regular\n\n15\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.750\nemails and face to face meetings,\nand briefings.\n\n16\n00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.330\nAnd the communication principle for\n\n17\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.180\nthis is that there is no single\ncorrect method of communication.\n\n18\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.680\nBecause the messages in\nthe medium as we know, and so\n\n19\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.170\nno single communication method works for\nabsolutely everybody.\n\n20\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.620\nSo question number 22 then.\n\n21\n00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.550\nAnd which of these is the best\nexample of the messages in the medium?\n\n22\n00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.520\nWell, it's a selection.\n\n23\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960\nPresentations and web analysis to\ncommunicate these new policies.\n\n24\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.631\nWhat about question 23,\nwhat's the most important reason for\n\n25\n00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:32.347\nusing a workshop and meeting action plan?\n\n26\n00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:37.520\nWell an action plan make sure\nthe workshop covers its objectives.\n\n27\n00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.130\nIt's not an exact agenda.\n\n28\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.950\nThere's not necessarily an exact\nagenda for workshop delegates.\n\n29\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.190\nCuz a workshop is where\nwe work through things.\n\n30\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.240\nSo I don't expect to see\nan exact agenda with timings.\n\n31\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.100\nI expect to see an action plan.\n\n32\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.908\nAnd so what about the number 24?\n\n33\n00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:59.186\nThe consolidation process has produced\nsome initial discovery information to\n\n34\n00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:01.010\nidentity scope.\n\n35\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.020\nProject manager is going to create\na business case which will most\n\n36\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.680\nhelp the project manager ensure\nthe business case is fit for purpose.\n\n37\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.610\nIt's writing in the style that's\nfamiliar to senior management.\n\n38\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.100\nNow at this point in time\n\n39\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.750\nremember we've got the language\nof the audience there, with this.\n\n40\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.730\nAnd I've always said this.\n\n41\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.960\nYou communicate in\nthe language of the audience.\n\n42\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.673\nAt this point in time, I just want to\npoint out, in case you haven't noticed,\n\n43\n00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:35.761\nthat in every single section\nyou are tested on a different,\n\n44\n00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:40.849\nlet's just say a different principle,\nor you are tested on\n\n45\n00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.396\na different topic within the ITIL\npractitioner course itself.\n\n46\n00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:52.900\nSo in every single section you are tested\non a different episode as it were.\n\n47\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.107\nSo hopefully that's going to help you\nbecause you know right at this particular\n\n48\n00:02:57.107 --> 00:03:01.627\nminute in time in these sets of questions\nyou're being tested on communication, and\n\n49\n00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:03.219\ncommunication principles.\n\n50\n00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.050\nAnd there will be another section on\nmetrics and measurements, there were.\n\n51\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.640\nThere will be another section on\norganizational change management,\n\n52\n00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.170\nwhich there was.\n\n53\n00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.400\nSo hopefully that should help you to\nidentify the right answer, as well.\n\n54\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.855\nThis will carry on through your live test,\ntoo.\n\n55\n00:03:20.855 --> 00:03:22.210\nSo let's take a look at 25, then.\n\n56\n00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.250\nThey've signed up for business case now.\n\n57\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.160\nAnd so the project manager needs to\ncreate a stakeholder communication plan.\n\n58\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.550\nAnd what are the best steps?\n\n59\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.370\nWell, the best steps are to establish\ninitial schedule for delivery messages.\n\n60\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.280\nTo identify the communication channels for\neach target and\n\n61\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.990\nto ensure that stakeholders\nare included for as targets.\n\n62\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.350\nSo we want to make sure that people\nfrom each team are included in this.\n\n63\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.754\nThe answer here is 3, 4 and 5.\n\n64\n00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.650\nAnd if GCITS want to gather current state\ninformation about existing systems and\n\n65\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.920\nservices, what's the most relevant\ncommunication principle to ensure they get\n\n66\n00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.840\nan accurate understanding?\n\n67\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.850\nWell, it's to get their information from\nas many different places as possible.\n\n68\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.160\nSo there is no single correct\nmethod of communication.\n\n69\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.610\nThere's currently a lack\nof team cooperation,\n\n70\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.120\nwhich might affect\nthe success of consolidation.\n\n71\n00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.860\nWhat's the best way for\nthem to develop collaboration?\n\n72\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.150\nWell, it's about acting\nconsistently inline.\n\n73\n00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.050\nRemember, we don't really\nencourage those managers\n\n74\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.060\nthat tell us to do one thing,\nbut then act in a different way.\n\n75\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.930\nNo, everybody needs to be\nfollowing exactly the same plan.\n\n76\n00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930\nAnd senior management need\nto be setting an example.\n\n77\n00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.830\nAnd it's the best way to develop\na collaborative culture, as we'd say.\n\n78\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.110\nWe have to bring together\na number of complex systems.\n\n79\n00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.430\nAnd the project manager needs\nto communicate progress to\n\n80\n00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.490\nthe whole organization.\n\n81\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.420\nAnd if it's to the whole organization,\nthen of course it has to be non-technical.\n\n82\n00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.710\nAnd we want to do this on a regular basis.\n\n83\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.040\nRemember, timing and frequency matter.\n\n84\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.805\nIt shouldn't be ad hoc, cuz ad hoc then\nwould suggest that there is a lack of\n\n85\n00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:22.980\nimportance placed on this\nparticular improvement initiative.\n\n86\n00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.890\nSo now we have additional information for\n\n87\n00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.880\nour next set of questions which were\nquestions 29 through to question 34.\n\n88\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.210\nJust remember that this\nadditional information\n\n89\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.720\nis relevant only to those\nquestions that are mentioned.\n\n90\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.490\nIt's not relevent to any other questions.\n\n91\n00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.718\nSo please ensure that you treat\nall of these in isolation.\n\n92\n00:05:45.718 --> 00:05:49.906\nSo they've got increased amount for\ncloud services support here, and\n\n93\n00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:54.303\nthey want to create a more automated\napproach to release and deployment and\n\n94\n00:05:54.303 --> 00:06:00.150\ncapacity management to address unplanned\ndown time, and increased support costs.\n\n95\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.869\nUnplanned down time and\nincrease support costs.\n\n96\n00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.670\nThere are many different services and\ncomponents.\n\n97\n00:06:08.078 --> 00:06:11.356\nSo the CIOs decided to continue\nusing ITIL guidance, but\n\n98\n00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:13.962\nhe also wants to consider\nother frameworks.\n\n99\n00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:17.822\nAnd he's asked an ITIL SME\nto lead the improvement, and\n\n100\n00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:20.160\nbegin with a CSI approach.\n\n101\n00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.215\nSo what's the best example of\nusing the concept adopt and adapt?\n\n102\n00:06:25.215 --> 00:06:31.609\nWell, we're adopting an ITIL framework but\nwe are adapting it to our environment,\n\n103\n00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:36.020\nwhich means that we enhance our\nprocesses based on that gap\n\n104\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.080\nanalysis of where we are right now\nagainst the required benefits.\n\n105\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.110\nIn other words, where we need to be.\n\n106\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.670\nOn which of these elements\nare the most important to improve?\n\n107\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.200\nWell, they mentioned in the additional\ninformation, it's cost and risk.\n\n108\n00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.990\nNow this particular question\nhere you're going to have\n\n109\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.390\nto map the output to the CSI approach.\n\n110\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.879\nA completed stakeholder map\nlooks at where we are right now.\n\n111\n00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.700\nIt's a map of who your stakeholders are.\n\n112\n00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.460\nAnd planned release and\ndeployment processes,\n\n113\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.350\nwell if it's planned\nit's where we want to be.\n\n114\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.720\nAgreement on priorities for improvement,\n\n115\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.400\nwell that's part of where we want to be,\ncertainly not how do we get there.\n\n116\n00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.590\nAnd a detailed plan of action for\nthe improvement is how do we get there.\n\n117\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.720\nCertainly not, where do we want to be.\n\n118\n00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.270\nSo actually the rows that best\ndescribe will have the best answers,\n\n119\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.680\nthat's 1 and 2.\n\n120\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.338\nSo the answer there is a.\n\n121\n00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:42.934\nAnd so, for this particular one then,\nwhich of these is the correct entry for\n\n122\n00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:45.650\nthe extract from the CSI register?\n\n123\n00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.510\nWell, take a look back of what it\nis which we are trying to achieve.\n\n124\n00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.471\nAnd we know that we\nare concentrating on down time.\n\n125\n00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:55.512\nSo automated software release and\n\n126\n00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:59.935\ndeployment management should give\nus a reduction in down time.\n\n127\n00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:04.820\nIt's in the supplemental information\ntherefore your answer here is C.\n\n128\n00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.880\nSo what's the best way then to\nchoose a design for release and\n\n129\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.850\ndeployment management.\n\n130\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.550\nWell, we know that we possibly\nneed to experiment, and so\n\n131\n00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.160\nwe want to test various options,\ncompare the results to what we need,\n\n132\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.800\nto what what our expectations are and\nthen we select the best.\n\n133\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.020\nIf we take a look at the other\noptions that we have in front of us,\n\n134\n00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.830\nidentify constraints.\n\n135\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.209\nWell that's not release and\ndeployment management,\n\n136\n00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:38.347\nthat's just allowing us to plan.\n\n137\n00:08:38.347 --> 00:08:42.171\nI'm comparing our current processes to\nITIL, well we know that ITIL is not plug\n\n138\n00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.360\nand play, so\nthat's never going to be the right answer.\n\n139\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.200\nAnd identifying proof and opportunities\nand selecting the best option, but\n\n140\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.140\nthat's certainly not going to help\nus to design and develop release and\n\n141\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.110\ndeployment management.\n\n142\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.700\nThe answer could only be d.\n\n143\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:04.720\nAnd what about the KPIs that\nidentify where we are right now?\n\n144\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.340\nWell, think about the relevance to\nthe actual supplementary information,\n\n145\n00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.000\nand downtime posed by software releases,\nand cost\n\n146\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.820\nof under utilized infrastructure these\nwere the two issues that were mentioned.\n\n147\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.880\nTherefore it is b, it is 2 and 3.\n\n148\n00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.591\nAnd so now we get into our last section.\n\n149\n00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:36.038\nThe supplemental information, where\ndriveyou.com has acquired noimpact.com,\n\n150\n00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:41.332\na small R&amp;D company that owns several\npatrons, interesting patrons, one's for\n\n151\n00:09:41.332 --> 00:09:46.740\nsatellite navigation technology used\nto stare at me cold without a driver.\n\n152\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.950\nSo, noimpact.com consists of 20\nresearchers who are used to working\n\n153\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.160\nindependently.\n\n154\n00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.340\nAnd the real value of the company is in\ntheir knowledge and not in the patrons.\n\n155\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.150\nAnd now they're merging.\n\n156\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.877\nSo which of these is the correct\ndefinition of OCM and\n\n157\n00:10:01.877 --> 00:10:03.750\nITIL change management?\n\n158\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.290\nOf course it's a.\n\n159\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.840\nCuz OCM we know is about\nmanaging the people.\n\n160\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.600\nIt's about managing people.\n\n161\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.858\nSo the answer there is a.\n\n162\n00:10:14.858 --> 00:10:18.200\nAnd 36 sorry, what about sponsorship?\n\n163\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.520\nWhat is sponsorship?\n\n164\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:25.380\nWell, sponsorship is about having support\nfrom management and business leaders.\n\n165\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.060\nSo the answer here is b.\n\n166\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.990\nSponsorship is about\nsenior management support.\n\n167\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.060\nAnd what about the stakeholder\nanalysis worksheet?\n\n168\n00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.392\nWhich looks at how much impact and\nhow much interest our stakeholders have.\n\n169\n00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:43.800\nWhich rows are correctly input?\n\n170\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.919\nWell, it is b.\n\n171\n00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:46.050\nIt is 2 and 3.\n\n172\n00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.474\nThe Drive You researchers, well,\nthey have medium impact but\n\n173\n00:10:50.474 --> 00:10:56.164\nthey've got high power because they going\nto work with a No Impact researchers.\n\n174\n00:10:56.164 --> 00:11:00.345\nThe cruise along car's owners,\nwell they've got medium interest and\n\n175\n00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:02.405\nthey've got medium power.\n\n176\n00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:05.387\nThey need to have oversight,\nbut that's it.\n\n177\n00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:08.435\nThey're certainly not going\nto be directly involved.\n\n178\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.877\nThere is a driveyou.com manager\nleading the initiative, though, and\n\n179\n00:11:13.877 --> 00:11:17.162\nwhat are the best steps for\nhim to identify who's resistant to change?\n\n180\n00:11:17.162 --> 00:11:19.119\nWell, feedback forms, we know,\n\n181\n00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:22.550\nwe've already discussed\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n182\n00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.400\nWe know that just asking somebody\na question is not going to get\n\n183\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.540\nthe right answer.\n\n184\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.310\nSo we need to get off our bum.\n\n185\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.992\nAnd get off our bum includes 2 and 3.\n\n186\n00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:35.826\nNow, number 4,\nwell we get off our bum with number 4, but\n\n187\n00:11:35.826 --> 00:11:37.980\nwe're only meeting with management.\n\n188\n00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.535\nSo that's not going to identify\nsources of resistance.\n\n189\n00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.520\nThe answers are 2 and 3.\n\n190\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.556\nThe answer here is b.\n\n191\n00:11:45.556 --> 00:11:53.269\nWe have to go and meet people to\nidentify sources of resistance.\n\n192\n00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:58.059\nOkay, so now we're trying to well,\ncombat the fact that some nullimpact.com\n\n193\n00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:03.000\nresearchers are carrying out research\nwithout the oversight of form or project.\n\n194\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.130\nNow how did we get them under\nproject management control?\n\n195\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.310\nWell again, get off our bum and go and\n\n196\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.730\nencourage people to work\nwithin project guidelines.\n\n197\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.680\nSending emails to somebody,\nthey're just gonna get deleted.\n\n198\n00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.880\nAnd arranging the meeting\nbetween the researchers and\n\n199\n00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.750\nthe CEO of CruiseAlong Cars what,\nare we taking a baseball bat with us?\n\n200\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.538\nAnd the same with d, isn't it?\n\n201\n00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:29.945\nA blog from the CEO saying that\nthey must follow procedures.\n\n202\n00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:34.691\nLet's use a baseball bat again\nbecause that really works, doesn't it?\n\n203\n00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:40.220\nNo, you need to answer the question with\nany deployment, what's in it for me?\n\n204\n00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.950\nThat means understanding who it\nis that you're communicating to,\n\n205\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.750\nand creating that sense of urgency.\n\n206\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.670\nRemember Cotter's eight steps.\n\n207\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.745\nAnd you can only do that by understanding\nwho your stake holders are and\n\n208\n00:12:54.745 --> 00:12:59.220\nunderstanding what is in for them and\ncreating a sense of urgency for them.\n\n209\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:06.210\nSo let's go on to our last question for\nthis particular exam paper.\n\n210\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.680\nSix months after they've reverted\nback to their old ways of working.\n\n211\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.340\nAnd what is the best\napproach to reinforce?\n\n212\n00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.430\nTheir needs to adopt\nthe new working practice.\n\n213\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.140\nWell, not a baseball bat put it that way.\n\n214\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.680\nSo, b is definitely wrong.\n\n215\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.980\nAnd C, it kinda looks as though\nwe're trying to push in blame and\n\n216\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.850\npoint fingers, and d, we're not talking\nabout burying our heads in the sand.\n\n217\n00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.390\nSo I think here that the answer can\nonly be a, we like to reward and\n\n218\n00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.790\nwe like to recognize those people\nthat are doing really well.\n\n219\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:42.030\nAnd the others, well,\nthey seem a little bit too dictatorial, so\n\n220\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.810\nthe answer here is definitely a.\n\n221\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.310\nNow at this point and time,\n\n222\n00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:53.490\nyou should be able now to look at your\nanswers and to calculate your score.\n\n223\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:58.540\nRemembering that you need 28\nto be able to pass your test.\n\n224\n00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.220\nAnd you should also feel as though\nyou are prepared for your real test.\n\n225\n00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:08.910\nIf you do have any questions in\nbetween now and your real test,\n\n226\n00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.400\nthen please feel free to come\nback to us on our forum and\n\n227\n00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.700\nI will be happy to answer any\nqueries that you may have.\n\n228\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.394\nBut for now, I would wish you\ngood luck and well, let's hope so\n\n229\n00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:24.508\nat a term, you get 100% on that test.\n\n230\n00:14:24.508 --> 00:14:28.544\n[SOUND]\n\n",
