Well, PPO, Planning Protection &amp;\nOptimization is one of the capability\n\n7\n00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:26.036\nmodules designed by the ITIL\naccredited curriculum and\n\n8\n00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:28.090\nit focuses on five processes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.480\nCapacity management, availability\nmanagement, continuity management,\n\n10\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.190\nsecurity management and demand management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.060\nThose five processes, four of them\nthat is, come from service design,\n\n12\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.140\none of them comes from service strategy.\n\n13\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.520\nAnd it looks at those in a combined way;\nhow they interact with each other, and\n\n14\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.110\ndives deep into the specific\nactivities of each of those processes.\n\n15\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.620\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, now,\n\n16\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.975\ncould you give us an idea of who the\nintended audience for this exam would be?\n\n17\n00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.295\nWell, one, yeah, one key audience\nmember is going to be someone\n\n18\n00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.125\nperhaps on the path of getting\ntheir ITIL expert credential.\n\n19\n00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.835\nThis is a capability module,\nit's worth four credits, so\n\n20\n00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:09.175\nif you pass that exam you get four credits\ntoward the collection of credits you need\n\n21\n00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:13.355\nto sit the Capstone exam which is called,\nManaging Across the Life Cycles.\n\n22\n00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.500\nSo four credits await with successful\ncompletion of the exam and\n\n23\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.650\noperationally speaking, the audience\nis gonna be those that are involved in\n\n24\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.530\nstrategic and design activities for\nthe IT service organization.\n\n25\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.440\nSo demand management\nplays out in strategy,\n\n26\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.470\nthe other four play out in design as\nrelates to planning, protection and\n\n27\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.980\noptimization, you really are trying\nto build effective services\n\n28\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.230\nthat are resilient to change, and\nare capable of growing with the business.\n\n29\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.002\nSo business focus, service designed\nactivities is the primary focus of PPO.\n\n30\n00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:49.392\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, and now we have an idea\nof who might be watching this.\n\n31\n00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:52.670\nObviously, there's exam takes\nwho are part of that group.\n\n32\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.130\nWhen it comes to the exams, could you\ngive us an idea of what is like to\n\n33\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.120\nget registered or just what it's\ngonna be like to take the exam.\n\n34\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm here, I represent PassionIT\nGroup which is a portal passionitgroup.com\n\n35\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.490\nyou can go there and get information\nabout exams at a very specific level,\n\n36\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.000\nyou can order your exam vouchers there at\na discount and through PassionIT Group,\n\n37\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.780\nyou also get access to other\nresources like course materials.\n\n38\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.370\nAs you sign up for this course,\nas you're taking the curriculum,\n\n39\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.630\nthere is a wealth of information\nin a zip file that has exam prep,\n\n40\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.690\nactivities, knowledge check activities,\nas well as specific instructions for\n\n41\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.930\nhow you get those vouchers ordered and\nhow you get your exam scheduled.\n\n42\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.290\nThe exam itself is a little bit different\nthan the foundation exam If you've\n\n43\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.770\nhad an intermediate Excel book exam\nbefore you'll find it very similar.\n\n44\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.230\nThey're scenario based questions,\nonly eight of them, and\n\n45\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.930\nthey're gradient scoring, meaning that one\nanswer will give you five points of value.\n\n46\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.690\nAnother answer will give you three,\nother answers will give you less, right?\n\n47\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.590\nSo you've got to pick a better answer.\n\n48\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.150\nYou're analyzing things.\n\n49\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.350\nSo these intermediate level\nexams are not rote memorization,\n\n50\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.620\nthey are taking knowledge and applying it,\nwhich make it pretty fun actually.\n\n51\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Very, very cool.\n\n52\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.809\nWell Terry, we do thank you for\nthat information and\n\n53\n00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.309\nif that sounds like something\nthat might interest you,\n\n54\n00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.722\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in the up coming series.\n\n55\n00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.284\n[SOUND]\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.192 --> 00:00:13.921\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.490\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.064\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday's episode we are kicking off our\n\n7\n00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:25.443\nITIL planning protection and\noptimization series, that's right.\n\n8\n00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:26.620\nPPO as they like to call it.\n\n9\n00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.790\nAnd joining us in the studio to help\nlend his expertise on that topic,\n\n10\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.440\nour good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.570\nTerry, welcome to the studio.\n\n12\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.480\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.510\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.640\nHappy to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.651\nI got a lot to learn in this particular\nseries about planning, protection and\n\n16\n00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:39.310\noptimization.\n\n17\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.410\nBut before we dig in to the meat of the\ncourse, let's get some general orientation\n\n18\n00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.080\nto what materials are available to you and\nwhat you could expect from the course.\n\n19\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.870\nAnd actually what's\nexpected from you as well.\n\n20\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.100\nSo if you look at the slide here, you'll\nsee that the topics we're gonna discuss\n\n21\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.010\nare many, there's capacity management,\n\n22\n00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.030\navailability management, continuity\nmanagement, and security management.\n\n23\n00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320\nThose four processes happen to come\nfrom a course called Service Design or\n\n24\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.070\na book called Service Design.\n\n25\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.885\nAnd also demand management, which\nhappens to come from Service Strategy.\n\n26\n00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:10.715\nRight?\n\n27\n00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:14.325\nAnd we're also going to get involved\nin discussing some of the roles and\n\n28\n00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:18.055\nresponsibilities related to those\nprocesses and look at the technology and\n\n29\n00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.145\nimplementation considerations as well.\n\n30\n00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:23.615\nAnd as we discuss those many\ntopics we're also going to be\n\n31\n00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:29.260\nputting those in the context of real-world\nsituations as well as what I call academic\n\n32\n00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.120\nconsiderations.\n\n33\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.170\nIn other words, how you can approach\nlearning this for the exam, right.\n\n34\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.220\nSo as you look at, consider about\nthe exam level of complexity here,\n\n35\n00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.975\nthe next slide deals\nwith this curriculum at\n\n36\n00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:46.735\na higher level than what your\nexperience with the foundation level.\n\n37\n00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:49.615\nSo, if this is your first\nintermediate level exam,\n\n38\n00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:51.475\nyour going to find a different\nexperience quite a bit.\n\n39\n00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:56.625\nThe foundation exam was, basically\njust remembering and understanding.\n\n40\n00:01:56.625 --> 00:02:00.625\nWrote memorization of some concepts and\nsome vocabulary.\n\n41\n00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.765\nWith the intermediate level exams,\nit's higher order thinking.\n\n42\n00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:07.370\nYou're going to be tested to\nsee whether you can analyze and\n\n43\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.740\nevaluate a given situation, and\napply that knowledge effectively.\n\n44\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.490\nSo it's scenario based.\n\n45\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.370\nAnd with those scenarios, you then ask\na question based on those scenarios.\n\n46\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.280\nSo you're not gonna be asked\na wrote memorization question.\n\n47\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.920\nHowever, your knowledge\nis gonna be tested.\n\n48\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.320\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like my kind of exam.\n\n49\n00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they are.\nThey're a bit better.\n\n50\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.450\nNot quite essay exams, not quite essays,\nbut they get close to essay exams.\n\n51\n00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.749\nAnd I find them actually kind of fun.\n\n52\n00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.266\nYou're solving a puzzle.\n\n53\n00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:38.435\nSo not rote memorization,\nbut solving a problem.\n\n54\n00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:43.825\nWhich can be a good experience for\na lot of exam takers.\n\n55\n00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:48.260\nThey are more, I would say probably a bit\nmore difficult than the foundation one,\n\n56\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.730\nbut that foundation was pretty tough, and\nin fact that there's 40 questions after\n\n57\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.430\na little bit of lecture and\nyou had to memorize lots of things.\n\n58\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.240\nSo that could be a lot harder sometimes\nthan just applying knowledge.\n\n59\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.830\nBut that's the nature of this beast,\nfor sure.\n\n60\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.380\nSo the way we're going to approach this is\ncertainly I'm going to be talking a lot,\n\n61\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.040\ngiving you the theory lecture\napproach with real world examples.\n\n62\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.320\nThere's opportunities for\ndiscussions through the online forum.\n\n63\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.280\nThere's also plenty of opportunities for\nself-study.\n\n64\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.700\nAnd I'm going to encourage you to do\nthat due diligence with the self-study.\n\n65\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.790\nDon't just take the lectures, but go try\nto reinforce this learning on your own.\n\n66\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.260\nThere are some exercises we prepared for\nyou.\n\n67\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.340\nAnd as well as some knowledge checks,\nor assessments.\n\n68\n00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.290\nAnd there's also some practice exams,\notherwise known as mock tests.\n\n69\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.600\nThese practice exams are also\ngoing to get their own episode,\n\n70\n00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.465\nso we'll parse out some practice exams,\nand give you some tips and\n\n71\n00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:49.423\ntricks on how you can get in the mind\nof the test maker, if you will, okay.\n\n72\n00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:52.945\nAll these resources that we just\nmentioned, well, except for\n\n73\n00:03:52.945 --> 00:03:58.310\nthe lecture and discussions,\nare available through download,\n\n74\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.610\nplease go right now to the show\nfiles up above me here and\n\n75\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.380\ndownload the zip file, and when you unzip\nthat you're gonna find lots of resources\n\n76\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.780\nincluding these exercises that will\nbe referenced throughout the course.\n\n77\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.390\nSo speaking of exams and preparing for\n\n78\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.940\nexams let's take a look at where this\nparticularly fits into the exam scene.\n\n79\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.760\nFirst of all this is an accredited course.\n\n80\n00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.780\nSo unlike an unaccredited course we have\nto follow a very specific syllabus and\n\n81\n00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.590\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n82\n00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.370\nSo we're gonna hit all the topics the\naccrediting agency says we need to hit.\n\n83\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.150\nAnd you can see at the bottom\nhere the copyright owner, Axilos,\n\n84\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.430\nhas empowered accrediting agencies,\nexam organizations, exam institutes.\n\n85\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.620\nAnd they in turn have empowered\ntraining organizations.\n\n86\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.880\nSo I'm here representing Passion-IT Group,\nan authorized training organization,\n\n87\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.180\nin partnership with ITProTV, so\n\n88\n00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.860\nthat we can provide accredited training,\nand I am an accredited trainer.\n\n89\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.450\nSo all that keeps it nice and legal.\n\n90\n00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.950\nBy taking an accredited training course,\n\n91\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.900\nyou are eligible to take\nthe accreditation exams.\n\n92\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.640\nWithout an accredited course,\nyou're ineligible to take those exams.\n\n93\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.790\nSo that's what the qualification scheme,\nhow it's built by the exam agencies.\n\n94\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.551\n&gt;&gt; Nobody's getting turned\naround at the desk, right?\n\n95\n00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.284\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n96\n00:05:13.284 --> 00:05:14.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n97\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.260\n&gt;&gt; So here is this little house just\nbasically describes all the course work\n\n98\n00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.770\nthat's possible through\nthe ITIL curriculum,\n\n99\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.350\nas blessed by the copyright owner and\nthe exam institutes.\n\n100\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.760\nYou see at the bottom there,\nwe're two credits is ITIL Foundation.\n\n101\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.715\nIt's available on ITProTV and\n\n102\n00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:36.760\nITIL Foundation is a course that is\na prerequisite for all the courses.\n\n103\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.020\nIn other words,\nbefore you can sit any other exams,\n\n104\n00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.350\nyou have to earn\nthe ITIL Foundation certificate.\n\n105\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.350\nYou can't start up higher,\nyou gotta start at the foundation.\n\n106\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.440\nNow after you get foundation\nyour path is very elective.\n\n107\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.340\nYou can choose lots of different\ncourses from either side here.\n\n108\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.389\nYou'll see that ITIL\npractitioner is available and\n\n109\n00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.480\noffers you three credits, right?\n\n110\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.540\nOther courses offer you three,\nyou see on there oo the left.\n\n111\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.380\nSome courses offer you four.\n\n112\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.520\nIf you collect enough credits\na total of 22 credits,\n\n113\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.680\nyou can be considered an ITIL expert.\n\n114\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.170\nAssuming that foundation is\ntwo of those credits, and\n\n115\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.660\nmanagement across the life cycle, the\nCap Stone course is worth five credits.\n\n116\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.360\nOkay, so where we are for\nthis course is there with PPO.\n\n117\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.010\nYou see it there along\nthe right side there.\n\n118\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.460\nPlanning, protection, and optimization.\n\n119\n00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.310\nThese form the capability modules,\n\n120\n00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.020\nwhich are really a collection\nof topics from the core books.\n\n121\n00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.180\nOn the left, you have just the core books.\n\n122\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.830\nService strategy, service design,\nservice transition, service operations and\n\n123\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.240\ncontinuous service improvement.\n\n124\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.560\nThose life cycle modules\ncorrespond one-to-one to\n\n125\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.920\neach of the core publications\npublished by ITIL.\n\n126\n00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo, life cycle modules get\nyou three credits each,\n\n127\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.010\ncapability modules get\nyou four credits each.\n\n128\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.520\nYou can take them from either side.\n\n129\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.810\nIn other words,\nafter you've taken foundation,\n\n130\n00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.660\nyou could take service offerings\nagreements and get four credits.\n\n131\n00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.980\nCome over and\ntake service design and get three.\n\n132\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.420\nBack over to release control and\nvalidation for four more.\n\n133\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.710\nBack over to service operations for three.\n\n134\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.480\nYou can mix and\nmatch these as you wish, right.\n\n135\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.020\nOnce you've amassed 17 credits,\ntwo of which are foundation.\n\n136\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.750\nYou can then be eligible to set and take\nthe management across the lifecycle course\n\n137\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.560\nwhich enables you to take the management\nacross the lifecycle exam.\n\n138\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.420\nOnce that's passed you'll have\na total of at least 22 credits,\n\n139\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.780\nyou're considered an ITIL expert.\n\n140\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.550\nTo be an accredited trainer as I am,\n\n141\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.000\nyou have to have that credential,\nthat ITIL expert credential.\n\n142\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.360\nAnd have had to pass the relative exam,\n\n143\n00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.400\nso in other words I'm teaching PPO,\nI had to have passed that PPO exam.\n\n144\n00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.140\nNot just all the rest of them, I had to\nhave PPO specifically in my curriculum.\n\n145\n00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.666\n&gt;&gt; And that just kinda makes sense to me,\nright.\n\n146\n00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:55.653\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, of course.\n\n147\n00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:56.391\nYou've seen it.\n\n148\n00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.594\n&gt;&gt; You're teaching material that\nyou've actually encountered before.\n\n149\n00:07:57.594 --> 00:08:00.650\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n150\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.110\nSo again to recap on the left here\nyou have the life cycle modules.\n\n151\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.770\nThose are one to one matching\nto the core curriculum.\n\n152\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.080\nThe ones on the right there capability\nmodules are a mix of those.\n\n153\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.290\nPPO itself, planning,\nprotection, optimization,\n\n154\n00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.920\ndraws a lot from service design and\npicks up one process from server strategy.\n\n155\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.980\nSo it's taken from a combination of those.\n\n156\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.410\nAnd they're applying these in\nsome sort of practical manner.\n\n157\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.800\nSo they're giving you some\nvery specific activities.\n\n158\n00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.980\nThey dive a little bit deeper\ninto what you have to do\n\n159\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.420\nto be successful with\nthese particular processes\n\n160\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.590\nrather than at the high level what\nthe processes accomplish okay, all right.\n\n161\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.650\nSo, moving forward here you'll see,\nthat where we are, is for\n\n162\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.880\nthe capability lifecycle\nwe're doing something.\n\n163\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.220\nWe're actually seeing\nthe activities involved, for\n\n164\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.160\nthe service lifecycle approach.\n\n165\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.920\nIt's more about the strategy\nof implementing these\n\n166\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.366\ndifferent life cycle stages and\nthe processes that they hold.\n\n167\n00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:02.025\nOkay, all right.\n\n168\n00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:03.710\nSo the exam is different.\n\n169\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.770\nAs I mentioned before the foundation exam\nis 40 questions of rote memorization with\n\n170\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.250\none correct answer.\n\n171\n00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.010\nThese intermediate level exams,\nthere's only 8 of them.\n\n172\n00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:17.480\nAnd there is more than one correct answer.\n\n173\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.430\nSo for instance, one answer will give\nyou a maximum of 5 points, another\n\n174\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.080\nanswer would give you 3 points, another\nanswer, if you choose it, will give you 1.\n\n175\n00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.820\nOf course, you can also pick\nthe distractor and get 0 credit for\n\n176\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.430\nthat particular question.\n\n177\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.990\nSo eight questions with\na possibility of five for\n\n178\n00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.770\neach question means there's\na maximum of 40 points.\n\n179\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.710\nAll right,\nyou need to get 28 out of those 40.\n\n180\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.975\nSo you don't have to be absolutely\nperfect to pass this exam.\n\n181\n00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:46.170\n70% is where you're weighing in at.\n\n182\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.390\n28 out of 40 that means that if you do\nthe math there, if you did six three point\n\n183\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.690\nanswers for 18, plus two five point\nanswers for ten, that's the 28.\n\n184\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.740\nSo what we need to get good at,\nis getting rid of the ones and zeroes,\n\n185\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.840\nstay in that wheelhouse of always being\nable to pick the three and five answers.\n\n186\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.510\nAs you practice these exams and\nas you're preparing for\n\n187\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.930\nthe exams, that's really what\nyou want to be targeting,\n\n188\n00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.960\nis that nice little sweet spot\nof picking three's and five's.\n\n189\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.620\nOf course it'd be great\nif you could get 100% and\n\n190\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.060\nalways get the five point answers.\n\n191\n00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.650\nIt'd be great.\n\n192\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.670\n&gt;&gt; It really shows that they\nhave a focus on whether or\n\n193\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.890\nnot you understand the concept.\n\n194\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.250\nAnd not so much well step one is this,\nstep two is this, or\n\n195\n00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.060\nthat rote answer is x, y, or z.\n\n196\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.310\nWhich can be very frustrating because,\nyou know exams.\n\n197\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.320\nA lot of them, they're just testing on\nhow well you take a test and not so\n\n198\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.130\nmuch on on how much that you\nknow about the material.\n\n199\n00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.580\nThis seems to really gear into\nshow us how much you do and\n\n200\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.663\nyou have a grading scale\nin which you can do that.\n\n201\n00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:47.950\nAgreed that's a good point Daniel.\n\n202\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.840\nI've taken lots of different technology\nexams over my years and as Daniel said\n\n203\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.090\nsome of them just see can you regurgitate\nat a very deep level a particular concept.\n\n204\n00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.945\nThis is applying knowledge which\nagain I find a bit more fair.\n\n205\n00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:05.445\nThat said, there is an academic\nnotion to this exam as well.\n\n206\n00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:09.525\nWhat I mean by that is, test makers\nhave to test against objectives.\n\n207\n00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:14.400\nSo, while they try to make it as realistic\nas possible, some times the reality is not\n\n208\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.405\n100% accurate because they have to test\nan academic environment some what.\n\n209\n00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:20.785\nSo, we call that the ITIL island.\n\n210\n00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.365\nOne of the downloads available\nto you is going to be\n\n211\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.100\nbasically a tutorial on\nhow to approach the exam.\n\n212\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.720\nI highly encourage you to have a look\nat that as it becomes available.\n\n213\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.970\nAnd you'll get some of the nuance for\n\n214\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.510\nhow the test makers think about these\nobjectives, and how they should be tested.\n\n215\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.360\nThat concludes this set up and\nlogistics episode.\n\n216\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.760\nTune in soon for\na deep dive into foundation review.\n\n217\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry, great stuff.\n\n218\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.940\nWe do thank you for joining us today.\n\n219\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.910\nThank our good viewers for watching, but\nit looks like that's our show for today.\n\n220\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.160\nDefinitely come back.\n\n221\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.310\nLike Terry said,\nwe've got plenty more to go.\n\n222\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.980\nSo definitely join us for those.\n\n223\n00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.050\nThat being said,\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n224\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.350\nWe do appreciate you watching for IT Pro\nTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n225\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.080\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n226\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.447\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n227\n00:12:13.447 --> 00:12:17.132\n[MUSIC]\n\n228\n00:12:17.132 --> 00:12:20.333\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.045\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.938\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:16.257\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:21.057\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, we are continuing on with\n\n7\n00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:25.265\nmore on our ITIL PPO series,\nthe Planning Protection and Optimization.\n\n8\n00:00:25.265 --> 00:00:26.757\nAnd of course,\njoining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:30.537\nagain, continuing to lend his expertise,\nour good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.367\nTerry, welcome back my man,\nhow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.007\n&gt;&gt; Happy to be here, yep.\n\n12\n00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.166\nBefore we dive in too deeply into the\ntopics related to Planning Protection and\n\n13\n00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.010\nOptimization, I wanna make sure that\nwe knock off the rusts of some basic\n\n14\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.547\nconcepts that were\ndiscovered in foundation.\n\n15\n00:00:44.547 --> 00:00:48.330\nSo, rather than necessarily taking\nthe whole foundation course again,\n\n16\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.660\ntune in pretty specifically to this\nparticular module because it's going to\n\n17\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.280\nhelp with the language of ITIL.\n\n18\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.950\nIt has its own definitions of things, so,\ngetting our head around that language\n\n19\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.900\nagain is gonna be pretty important for\nfuture success.\n\n20\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.020\nAgain, you're not gonna be asked\nexplicit questions about these things,\n\n21\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.700\nbut they're gonna be using this language.\n\n22\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060\nSo, get your head around the language,\nit's gonna be really helpful.\n\n23\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.040\nSo, this idea, man,\njust an idea of some of these things,\n\n24\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460\njust a few questions here as we\nlook at this PowerPoint here.\n\n25\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170\nWhich of the following best\ndescribes the concept of utility?\n\n26\n00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.330\nDo you remember what utility is?\n\n27\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.299\nI'll give you a second\nto take a look at these.\n\n28\n00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:33.470\nDaniel, might you have a guess?\n\n29\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was looking at this and\njust because of, I would wanna go with a.\n\n30\n00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:40.040\nThat's just my instinct there.\n\n31\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.430\n&gt;&gt; It's a pretty darn good answer.\n\n32\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.849\nThe ability to tailor a service\ndesign package to a specific purpose.\n\n33\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.810\nCertainly, utility is intended\nto be fit for purpose, so,\n\n34\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.260\nit's a pretty good answer,\nbut it's not the best answer.\n\n35\n00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.230\nThe textbook definition is service\nprovision that removes constraints and\n\n36\n00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.300\nenhances performance.\n\n37\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.290\nSo, it's basically the functionality.\n\n38\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.960\nWe'll look at it a little bit later on and\nreview it more in depth, but\n\n39\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.280\nthat's just the nature of\nthe beast about this language.\n\n40\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.040\nA very good answer in a,\n\n41\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.090\nthe best answer being d in this\ncase because it's very specific.\n\n42\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.550\nSo, as you would've taken\nan intermediate level exam, but\n\n43\n00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.490\nI'm not gonna ask you\na question like this.\n\n44\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.150\nThey'll just use the term, utility,\nor they'll use the synonyms.\n\n45\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.934\nLike you're providing a service\nthat removes constraints and\n\n46\n00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:27.805\nenhance the performance, but the users\nare complaining about the warranty, right?\n\n47\n00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:33.270\nSo, it's basically a mix of the languages\nthere could play out for you.\n\n48\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.040\nOkay, how about another,\ntake a step at this one.\n\n49\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.290\nWhich of the following\nmake up service assets?\n\n50\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.801\nBasically, what is the definition\nof a service asset?\n\n51\n00:02:55.502 --> 00:03:00.700\nAgain, as a textbook definition,\nit's resources and capabilities.\n\n52\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.280\nThese other ones have some merit, but\naccording to ITIL, redefining the language\n\n53\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.080\nin their own light, is a service asset\nis either resource or capability.\n\n54\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.600\nAgain, we'll have a look at these in\na little bit more detail later on.\n\n55\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.810\nI think it is kind of reinforcing\nthe need for a refresher here, right.\n\n56\n00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.701\nAnd finally, which of the following\nis an incorrect use of a RACI chart?\n\n57\n00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:23.318\nIncorrect use.\n\n58\n00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:28.380\nSo, does it define roles and\nresponsibilities?\n\n59\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.940\nYeah, does it determine\nwho should be consulted?\n\n60\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.300\nThat's what the C stands for,\nso that's good.\n\n61\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.820\nTo ensure sufficient people\nare responsible for each activity?\n\n62\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.500\nThat's correct.\n\n63\n00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.240\nTo ensure more than one\nperson is accountable?\n\n64\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.050\nThat's incorrect, so, therefore,\n\n65\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.470\nD is the correct answer because\nit is incorrect use of a RACI.\n\n66\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.970\nAccording to RACI, there's only one\naccountable for any given activity.\n\n67\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.480\nSo again, the need for\nreinforcement is what this was about, and\n\n68\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.200\nwe're gonna do that reinforcement now.\n\n69\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.980\nThe things we learned in foundation.\n\n70\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.576\n&gt;&gt; So, if we're not just coming off\nthe heels of our foundations exam,\n\n71\n00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:09.422\nwe probably gonna wanna pay attention\nto those foundation foundations.\n\n72\n00:04:09.422 --> 00:04:11.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly right.\n\n73\n00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.987\nAgain, not only to knock off the rust\nof the conceptual things cuz maybe,\n\n74\n00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:18.000\nthat is kind of embedded, but\nit's the language things.\n\n75\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat terminology will get you every time.\n\n76\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.786\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they would,\nit's just terminology.\n\n77\n00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:22.141\n&gt;&gt; You're not on top of that stuff and\n\n78\n00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:24.714\nthey start asking you questions\nbased off of their definition and\n\n79\n00:04:24.714 --> 00:04:27.210\nyou don't have that,\nyou're gonna be in a real world of hurt.\n\n80\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.870\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, so,\nwe'll certainly do the concepts and\n\n81\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.210\nwe'll also get into some\nof the words as well.\n\n82\n00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.737\nSo, this whole idea of a lifecycle,\n\n83\n00:04:35.737 --> 00:04:40.800\nyou'll recall from foundation that\nITIL is based on service lifecycle.\n\n84\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.311\nSo, Daniel,\nwhat does lifecycle mean to you?\n\n85\n00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:45.480\nJust generically.\n\n86\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Just generically,\nI would say it is the start to finish\n\n87\n00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.940\nprocedure that you're gonna go through for\nany given task.\n\n88\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.535\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good choice.\n\n89\n00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:57.980\nLifecycle could be applied to so\nmany different things.\n\n90\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.255\nLifecycle of an employee from the time\ntheir hired to the time they're fired or\n\n91\n00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:02.854\nretired.\n\n92\n00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:04.621\n&gt;&gt; Retired [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, or\n\n93\n00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.460\nin those points in-between.\n\n94\n00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.490\nSo, the lifecycle of employee.\n\n95\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.210\nThe lifecycle of an incident in ITIL.\n\n96\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.860\nFrom the time the person calls and\n\n97\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.740\nsays, I can't find the application,\nthe application seems to be down,\n\n98\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.350\nto the time it's restored, and\nthat user is satisfied again.\n\n99\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.530\nThe lifecycle of an incident, right?\n\n100\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.960\nSo the nature of ITIL is based\non the lifecycle of a service,\n\n101\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.440\nthat a service has a lifecycle from the\nidea that the services needs to be brought\n\n102\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.710\nto life through the design transition\n\n103\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.110\nin operation of that service and\nthe ongoing improvement of that service.\n\n104\n00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.830\nUltimately, the service\ncould be retired as well.\n\n105\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.500\nSo this idea of a lifecycle is in play,\nand\n\n106\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.700\nITIL, describing\nthe lifecycle of a service.\n\n107\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.650\nAnd it's based on five core books\n\n108\n00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.070\nthat coincide with five stages in\na lifecycle service, such as these.\n\n109\n00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.850\nSo you have Service Strategy, the earliest\nstage in the lifecycle of a service.\n\n110\n00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.607\nService Design, which we're gonna spend\na lot of time discussing through PPO.\n\n111\n00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:15.452\nPlanning Protection and\nOptimization draws from processes\n\n112\n00:06:15.452 --> 00:06:21.010\nthat are described in the service\ndesign core book, all right.\n\n113\n00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.450\nService Transition,\nto bring the design to life and\n\n114\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.840\nmake it something that's breathable and\nworkable.\n\n115\n00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.650\nAnd then, Service Operation\nis the day-to-day caring and\n\n116\n00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.550\nfeeding of the service\nserving the customers.\n\n117\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.600\nCSI, Continual Service Improvement\nis a lifecycle stage\n\n118\n00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.270\nthat is actually embedded\nin all stages and\n\n119\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.830\nit's a continual cycle of improvement of\nthe services through measured improvement.\n\n120\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.469\nAgain, we're gonna spend a lot of\ntime talking about Service Design.\n\n121\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.920\nYou'll see, and\nwhat's highlighted here in blue,\n\n122\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.240\nare the five processes we're\ngonna be talking about in PPO.\n\n123\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.110\nFour of which are coming\nfrom Service Design.\n\n124\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.790\nIn addition to the warranty processes,\nas they're referred to, capacity,\n\n125\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.910\navailability, continuity, and\nsecurity management, we're gonna add\n\n126\n00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.070\nto the discussion Demand Management, which\nhappens to be located in Service Strategy.\n\n127\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.876\nAs you can see, these processes\nare associated with each stage.\n\n128\n00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:26.430\nAnd while we can talk about them\nseparately, they certainly interact.\n\n129\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.500\nIt would be folly for design people not\nto understand the transition processes.\n\n130\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.737\nIt would be silly for transition people\nto not understand design processes,\n\n131\n00:07:36.737 --> 00:07:39.423\nstrategy processes, operational processes.\n\n132\n00:07:39.423 --> 00:07:43.575\nSo while they're discussed\nin these different stages,\n\n133\n00:07:43.575 --> 00:07:47.726\nthey are absolutely integrated and\ntend to be integrated\n\n134\n00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:52.411\nacross the various functions and\npeople that practice, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:56.101\nAll right, so,\nagain some more definitions.\n\n136\n00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:56.996\nWhat is a service?\n\n137\n00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:58.316\nTextbook definition.\n\n138\n00:07:58.316 --> 00:08:01.310\nA means of delivering value to Customers.\n\n139\n00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.200\nNotice the all caps there.\n\n140\n00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.970\nA means of delivering value to\ncustomers by facilitating outcomes\n\n141\n00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.580\nthat they want to achieve without\nthe ownership of specific costs and risks.\n\n142\n00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.630\nThe basis of ITIL is service.\n\n143\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.480\nNot solutions, not systems.\n\n144\n00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.420\nIt's one thing to deliver a system or\nan application.\n\n145\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.980\nIt's another thing to deliver a service\n\n146\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.070\nwhich could be underpinned\ncertainly by various things, but\n\n147\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.590\nservice is a lot more holistic way to look\nat what you're providing to customers.\n\n148\n00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.290\nFocus again on these words value and\ncustomer.\n\n149\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:43.280\nI call it the nine tenths rule in\nthe foundation course where if you\n\n150\n00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.360\nhave an answer that includes the word\nvalue, and the other three answers don't,\n\n151\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.270\nchances are the answer that includes\nvalue is the correct answer.\n\n152\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.610\nThe same goes true for the word customers.\n\n153\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.060\nIf you have four answers,\none seems to have a focus a on customers.\n\n154\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.910\nOther ones don't have the focus on\ncustomers, the one that has the focus on\n\n155\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.480\ncustomers is very likely the better\nanswer on intermediate exam.\n\n156\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.310\nSo again, nine times out of ten,\n\n157\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:17.750\nif a answer includes value or\ncustomers and the other answers don't.\n\n158\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.080\nChances are the one with value and\n\n159\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.220\ncustomers is going to\nbe the better answer.\n\n160\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.230\nThat's just how important these things,\nthese concepts are in ITIL, all right.\n\n161\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.340\nSo again word service management.\n\n162\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.570\nYou'll often see this\nplay out in the exam.\n\n163\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.930\nWays to describe\nthe general maturity level?\n\n164\n00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.720\nWhat capability does this organization\nhave that's described in the scenario?\n\n165\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.920\nWhat is service management?\n\n166\n00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.670\nIt's a set of specialized capabilities.\n\n167\n00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.250\nSo that may describe it in terms\nof this is a very mature IT\n\n168\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.180\nservice management organization, meaning\nthey have lots of capabilities here.\n\n169\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.910\nOr, conversely that might say\n\n170\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.150\nyou've only just started your\nimplementation of service management.\n\n171\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.270\nYou are not really sure what a service is,\netc.\n\n172\n00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:10.250\nSo those types of descriptions of\nthe maturity level of the capabilities\n\n173\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.200\nof the organization give you some insights\ninto what problems you might need to be\n\n174\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.914\nsolving in the question itself, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:19.914 --> 00:10:20.414\nAll right.\n\n176\n00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:28.790\nThe over arching of value of service\nmanagement is to make sure you can\n\n177\n00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.770\nmaintain and have a meaningful\nrelationship with customers.\n\n178\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.100\nBy meaningful, you're able to\ndeliver the value that they need,\n\n179\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.620\nperforming at acceptable level and\nat an acceptable cost.\n\n180\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.540\nNow where this plays in in PPO is when\nwe're talking about designing a service,\n\n181\n00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.360\nwe need to do so cost effectively.\n\n182\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.860\nYou don't want to overbuild it,\nyou don't want to under build it.\n\n183\n00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.170\nYou don't want to build a golden goose\nsolution for something that's going to\n\n184\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.630\nbe used by only a few people for\na low value business outcome.\n\n185\n00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:04.030\nSo getting the right balance is gonna\nbe an important aspect of this.\n\n186\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.300\nAgain rope memorization you might\nremember the service providers,\n\n187\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.990\nthree types of service providers.\n\n188\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.250\nInternal service provider, and\nTYPE II shared services unit.\n\n189\n00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.420\nBoth TYPE I, and\nTYPE II are service providers,\n\n190\n00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.290\nthat are within the same organization,\nthe same company, the same university,\n\n191\n00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.030\nthe same government agency, right?\n\n192\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.040\nSo internal is embedded with\na particular business unit.\n\n193\n00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.910\nI'll use a bank as an example.\n\n194\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.630\nMaybe you have an IT department that\nserves the consumer loan department.\n\n195\n00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.861\nAnd an IT department that\nserves the teller, banking,\n\n196\n00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:43.890\nconsumer banking,\nas folks comes in that way.\n\n197\n00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.120\nSo you've got loans, and\nyou've got the normal banking.\n\n198\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.680\nAnd maybe you have\ncommercial loan departments.\n\n199\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.440\nIf you have a separate unit serving\nthose specific areas of the business,\n\n200\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.050\nthen you are considered\nan internal service provider.\n\n201\n00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.200\nA shared services unit is also\nwithin the same organization, but\n\n202\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.060\nthey provide centralized\nservices that everyone consumes.\n\n203\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.640\nI worked in such a location for\nmany years.\n\n204\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.230\nI worked in a shared services unit\ncalled Global Application Services, and\n\n205\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.680\nwe provided email.\n\n206\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.440\nWas consumed by all the business units,\nwe provided the Internet portal,\n\n207\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.470\nthe enterprise search,\nsome business intelligence solutions,\n\n208\n00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.080\ndocument management, learning management.\n\n209\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.440\nSo we provided services that were\nconsumed by manufacturing business unit,\n\n210\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.290\nthe sales business unit,\nthe, the research and\n\n211\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.160\ndevelopment business unit,\nas a centralized resource.\n\n212\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.750\nType III external service providers.\n\n213\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.940\nThey provide IT services to customers who\ndon't exist within the same organization,\n\n214\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.990\nperhaps for profit.\n\n215\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.090\nIT ProTV, for instance,\nis an external service provider.\n\n216\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.150\nRight they provide services to\nexternal customers that don't work for\n\n217\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.860\nITProTV as an example right?\n\n218\n00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.940\nOf course they have IT functions within\nITProTV that serve those customers.\n\n219\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.660\nThey have functions within\nITProTV that serve ITProTV.\n\n220\n00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.020\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n221\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.820\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo it,\n\n222\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.559\njust because you you can distinguish\nbetween type I, type II,\n\n223\n00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:14.920\ntype III, doesn't necessarily describe the\ncomplete scope of any given one provider.\n\n224\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.015\nAny given provider could be.\n\n225\n00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:20.185\nIn all three types of spaces, if you will.\n\n226\n00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:24.585\nAnother important aspect of this, I think\nthe distinction is important but it's just\n\n227\n00:13:24.585 --> 00:13:29.935\nas important to realize these are really\ndistinctions without a difference.\n\n228\n00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:34.765\nAnd what I mean is the principles\nof ITool apply to type I,\n\n229\n00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:36.980\ntype II or type III services.\n\n230\n00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.320\nSo you've gotta deliver\nvalue to customers.\n\n231\n00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.430\nThat's what it is, just who is your\ncustomer really is what this is about.\n\n232\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.070\nYou have different locations\nof where your customer is, but\n\n233\n00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.140\nyou still have to deliver value.\n\n234\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.430\nWho are stakeholders\nin service management?\n\n235\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.270\nYou'll see them listed\nhere in the various boxes.\n\n236\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.150\nYou've got the service provider themself\nas a service provider you need to take\n\n237\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.910\ncare of yourselves.\n\n238\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.470\nYou may have heard the phrase\nthe cobbler’s kids have no shoes, right?\n\n239\n00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.840\nWell, you need to take\ncare of yourself too.\n\n240\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.350\nSo, when you’re designing processes and\nwhen you’re trying to determine the best\n\n241\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:14.340\ninterfaces between, let’s say service\nstrategy and service design, You need\n\n242\n00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.700\nto have the customer in mind for sure, but\nyou also need to have each other in mind.\n\n243\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.950\nWhat's the best interfaces for\n\n244\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.430\nhow strategy interacts with design or\ndesign with an actual transition.\n\n245\n00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.310\nSo your functions in your groups and your\nteams, within your certified organization,\n\n246\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.530\nneed to be well fed as well.\n\n247\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.300\nOf course, we have customers and users.\n\n248\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.210\nCustomers are a little\nbit different than users.\n\n249\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.040\nCustomers are the ones that\nactually pay for it, or sponsor it.\n\n250\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.070\nAs an example, in my organization,\n\n251\n00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:49.040\nthere was a HR department that sponsored\nthe learning management system.\n\n252\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.850\nRight, they're the ones\nthat got the budget.\n\n253\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.620\nThey governed what should be spent\non what kind of functionality.\n\n254\n00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.260\nWhen upgrades are going to happen,\nhow learning was going to be managed.\n\n255\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.380\nSo they did the business\nprocess of learning management\n\n256\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.770\nwas part of HR's business.\n\n257\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.720\nSo they owned or they were\nthe customer I should say, of the.\n\n258\n00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.470\nLearning management system, and\nyet everyone in the organization\n\n259\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.320\nused the learning management system or\nservice, I should say, everyone used it.\n\n260\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.460\nSo the difference between the users and\n\n261\n00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.800\nthe customers is really who's paying for\nit.\n\n262\n00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.740\nSometimes they're the same,\nsometimes they're different.\n\n263\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.780\nThey certainly have different\nstakes in the game.\n\n264\n00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.720\nRight, a customer who pays for\nit like the HR department.\n\n265\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.940\nThey're looking for fast and\ncheap and users are looking for\n\n266\n00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.720\nfull functionality all the time\neverywhere, ease of use, etcetera.\n\n267\n00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.200\nRight, they're not easily concerned about\nthe dollars and cents aspect of it.\n\n268\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.340\nCustomers would be, that's why\nthey're distinguishable as services.\n\n269\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.128\nAnd then of course suppliers.\n\n270\n00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:48.705\nIt would be hard for me to imagine,\nas you go the full screen there,\n\n271\n00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:52.688\na supplier is a third\nparty just responsible for\n\n272\n00:15:52.688 --> 00:15:55.793\nhelping you deliver your services.\n\n273\n00:15:55.793 --> 00:16:00.766\nIt's tough for me to imagine an IT Service\nProvider that doesn't somehow rely on some\n\n274\n00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:01.880\nsort of supplier.\n\n275\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.430\nWhat would IT Pro TV be without an ISP,\nright?\n\n276\n00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.810\n&gt;&gt; Right!\nThe Internet.\n\n277\n00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're gonna have\nsomeone to help you there.\n\n278\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.810\nOf course, you also have software, right,\nto help you to get your job done as well.\n\n279\n00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.108\nUtilising Facebook, I wouldn't call it\na supplier, but utilising Facebook for\n\n280\n00:16:18.108 --> 00:16:19.418\none of your streams, etcetera.\n\n281\n00:16:19.418 --> 00:16:25.840\nSo you have different aspects on how\nyou make another stakeholder to manage.\n\n282\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.420\nWhere this plays out on\nany given exam question\n\n283\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.850\nis that you're probably going to need\nto be inclusive of all stakeholders.\n\n284\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.385\nIf you have an answer that kicks the users\nto the side or totally ignores them-\n\n285\n00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:40.197\n&gt;&gt; Probably not the answer.\n\n286\n00:16:40.197 --> 00:16:41.053\n&gt;&gt; Probably not the five answer.\n\n287\n00:16:41.053 --> 00:16:41.558\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nRight.\n\n288\n00:16:41.558 --> 00:16:42.134\n&gt;&gt; Probably not the five.\n\n289\n00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.157\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt might be the three out of it.\n\n290\n00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:44.755\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIt might be the three-point answer.\n\n291\n00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:48.790\nCertainly if it excludes the customer,\nit's not gonna be the five answer, right?\n\n292\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.640\nSo also, if you're not,\n\n293\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.440\nif you just kick your own,\nyou knock the IT people out of the way.\n\n294\n00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's probably not gonna be good and\n\n295\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.240\nof course, if suppliers are involved,\n\n296\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.710\nunless the scenario explicitly says\nthere are no suppliers involved.\n\n297\n00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.780\nYou probably have to have\nsuppliers involve as one\n\n298\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.340\nof the stakeholders as well.\n\n299\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.325\nSo, if stakeholder is one of\nthe focuses of the scenario or\n\n300\n00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:16.043\nquestion, think conclusive and\nremember there's four of them.\n\n301\n00:17:16.043 --> 00:17:18.210\nFour different stakeholder groups.\n\n302\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.190\nOkay good.\n\n303\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.840\nSo here we just kind of slipped\nthe script a little bit.\n\n304\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.800\nWe had Internal service providers,\nExternal Service providers.\n\n305\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.090\nSame thing here, Supporting Services,\n\n306\n00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.980\nInternal Customer Facing services, or\nExternal Customer Facing services.\n\n307\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.090\nConsider this, consider a teller machine.\n\n308\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:47.270\nThat is an External Customer Facing\nservice for a bank.\n\n309\n00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.640\nWhat the teller is using when\nshe's putting in your deposit,\n\n310\n00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.030\nclicking things on a computer,\nthat's an Internal Customer Facing.\n\n311\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.680\nBoth of these are connected to some\nsort of data sources in the back.\n\n312\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.570\nWhere all your accounts are stored.\n\n313\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.050\nServers, and databases, and\nnetworks are being used.\n\n314\n00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:10.290\nSo Supporting Services such as network,\nservers, databases, those are in\n\n315\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.360\nthe back end, not necessarily customer\nfacing, not directly customer facing.\n\n316\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.810\nAgain, this is another\ndistinction without a difference.\n\n317\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.410\nIf you happen to be, let's say,\nresponsible for the databases at the bank.\n\n318\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.630\nYou manage the database services.\n\n319\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.170\nYou still need to be there\nproviding value to customers.\n\n320\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.480\nYou still need to have your\neye on your stakeholders.\n\n321\n00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.510\nYou still need to provide\nthe appropriate cost and\n\n322\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.580\nrisk mitigation factors of your services.\n\n323\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.800\nThe right processes need to be defined.\n\n324\n00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.190\nThe right points of interface\nneed to be defined.\n\n325\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.530\nSo whether you're a Supporting Service\nowner, an Internal Customer Facing\n\n326\n00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.030\nservice owner, or\nan External Customer Facing Service owner,\n\n327\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.740\nyou still have to play at the table\nthat ITIL sits, basically.\n\n328\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:59.860\nThrough the value it took customers,\non time, on budget, basically.\n\n329\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.168\nAnother look at this, we're looking\nat the internal customers here or\n\n330\n00:19:03.168 --> 00:19:04.860\nparticular organization.\n\n331\n00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.730\nYou could see here, by this graphic,\nthat any given IT organization\n\n332\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.500\ncould have external customers, right, that\nare directly interfacing with the backend.\n\n333\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.830\nOr they could have some sort of\nother business applications that do\n\n334\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.140\nthe negotiation or\nthe interface with the external customers.\n\n335\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.640\nAgain distinctions without a difference.\n\n336\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.954\nIn other words, ITIL principles as they\nplay out on the exam, as they play\n\n337\n00:19:29.954 --> 00:19:35.799\nout in real life, the principles of ITIL\napply to all types of providers, okay.\n\n338\n00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:41.052\nHere's this idea of core\nenabling enhancing services.\n\n339\n00:19:41.052 --> 00:19:42.507\nAgain, the language.\n\n340\n00:19:42.507 --> 00:19:43.992\nLet's say core service,\n\n341\n00:19:43.992 --> 00:19:47.960\nin this example you have pizza\ndelivery service as an example.\n\n342\n00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.470\nThe core service is delivering tasty\npizza with phone and online ordering.\n\n343\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.620\nAn enabling service are the drivers\nthat help deliver it, right.\n\n344\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.970\nAnd enhancing services, maybe you have\na mobile app that can track the pizza\n\n345\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:07.290\ndelivery or no one is there or\nremember your order from last time and\n\n346\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.950\nautomatically bring it up\nthose types of things.\n\n347\n00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:14.910\nSo, the core services making sure you\ncan pick up the phone, answer the phone,\n\n348\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.030\nand get the order and delivered on time,\nright, those type of things.\n\n349\n00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.780\nLet's take an IT look at this.\n\n350\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.510\nLet's take email.\n\n351\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:29.560\nThe core service, email,\nis people can send and receive emails.\n\n352\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:35.270\nAnd enabling services would be\nthe servers, the databases,\n\n353\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.250\nthe network,\nwithout those email doesn't work.\n\n354\n00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.950\nIdentity management,\nyou gotta be able to login and\n\n355\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.200\nhave a unique mailbox just for you.\n\n356\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.730\nSo those are back end enabling services,\nwhere the core services send and\n\n357\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:48.328\nreceive email.\n\n358\n00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:51.550\nMaybe enhancing service,\nI know when we first\n\n359\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.850\nadopted exchange many years ago we\ndidn't have mobile messaging everyone.\n\n360\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.910\nOnly one group had it, all right.\n\n361\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.920\nUntil we figured out our security model,\nand got that all mature and ready to go.\n\n362\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.251\nAnd then we offered mobile messaging\nto everyone, it became a core service.\n\n363\n00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:11.239\nBut at one point in our evolution there,\nmobile messaging was an internal service,\n\n364\n00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:15.990\nand then we integrated it with instant\nmessaging as an enhancing service.\n\n365\n00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:18.250\nThen eventually that\nbecame a core service.\n\n366\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.120\nAgain a distinction without a difference\nis that whether you're a core service\n\n367\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.510\nprovider, enabling service provider, or an\nenhancing service provider you still have\n\n368\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:32.730\nthe need to deliver value to\ncustomers through these services.\n\n369\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.460\nThe principles apply.\n\n370\n00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.560\nAll right, we talked about briefly\nutility and warranty earlier.\n\n371\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.725\nUtility was considered the ability\nto remove constraints,\n\n372\n00:21:43.725 --> 00:21:46.940\nright, or enhance performance.\n\n373\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.550\nTake email as an example\nas it relates to utility.\n\n374\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.480\nPerhaps some of you are old enough\nto remember a day before email.\n\n375\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.270\nDaniel do you recall?\n\n376\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.090\n&gt;&gt; I do recall this.\n\n377\n00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.240\n&gt;&gt; There was a time before you, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Quite a few years, yes.\n\n379\n00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so days before email,\nback in the golden days.\n\n380\n00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.280\nInter office communication how is it done?\n\n381\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.150\n&gt;&gt; You did the cool little inter\noffice memo things where you put it in\n\n382\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.150\nan envelope or you put the sticky note on\nit and it had all the where it was going,\n\n383\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.460\nwho was that from, who was that to,\nkind of where it was pertaining to.\n\n384\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.780\n&gt;&gt; A piece of paper\n&gt;&gt; Right, the physical paper!\n\n385\n00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.310\nAnd the physical outbox!\n\n386\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.880\nAnd some people came by,\npicked it up and delivered it.\n\n387\n00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.830\n&gt;&gt; So, again, doing compare and contrast,\n\n388\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:32.500\nwhat utility therefore\ndoes emails provide?\n\n389\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.980\nIt enhances performance.\n\n390\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nBecause it speeds that up exponentially.\n\n391\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.680\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n392\n00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.700\nI can sit it at 5,000.\n\n393\n00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Easily, from my keyboard,\n\n394\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.770\nI don't have to get up, it's not paper,\nit's all so many things.\n\n395\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.110\nSo it's enhancing performance.\n\n396\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.200\nStaying with, staying when utility.\n\n397\n00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.460\nI remember the advent of e-mail and\n\n398\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.110\nat first it was just, within the office,\nI could email my office mates.\n\n399\n00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.896\nOf course Internet email broadens-\n&gt;&gt; Expands that, yeah,\n\n400\n00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:01.865\n&gt;&gt; So again,\n\n401\n00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:06.970\nwe are still enhancing\nperformance when we do that.\n\n402\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.080\nNow I can communicate with thousands and\nthousands of people.\n\n403\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.170\nSo, But even then, okay, so\nnow I get in an email at work, nice.\n\n404\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:22.780\nBut I had to be at work on a company\ndevice, on a company desktop or\n\n405\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.470\nlaptop, connected to that network,\nbefore I could use company email.\n\n406\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.880\nThey kinda broke down that particular\nconstraint by letting me have VPN\n\n407\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.150\naccess, right.\n\n408\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.674\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n409\n00:23:31.674 --> 00:23:35.980\nI still had to connect to my\nnetwork back at the office right?\n\n410\n00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.310\nThrough my internet connection.\n\n411\n00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.910\nBut through that VPN connection I\nremove the constrain of having to be\n\n412\n00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.030\nat the office physically.\n\n413\n00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.690\nRight, and then that constraint\nwas eventually removed.\n\n414\n00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:51.055\nDidn't even require VPN connection, of\ncourse you can reach out your phone right\n\n415\n00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:53.406\nnow and\nbe able to check your email, right?\n\n416\n00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:54.557\nSo another constraint removed.\n\n417\n00:23:54.557 --> 00:23:56.935\nThe same performance is being supported,\n\n418\n00:23:56.935 --> 00:24:00.111\nyou're supporting the performance\nof communication.\n\n419\n00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:03.690\nBut now we remove the constraints of,\nyou have to be on a laptop at work.\n\n420\n00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.430\nWell now you can be on\nyour laptop at home to,\n\n421\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.360\nI can get this from the beach on my phone,\nright?\n\n422\n00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.790\nSo that's removing constraints,\naspect of utility.\n\n423\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.590\nIt's basically the functionality\nof removing constraints or\n\n424\n00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.950\nenhancing performance.\n\n425\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.780\nAnd it's also associated with\nthe terms fit for purposes.\n\n426\n00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:27.390\nYou go full screen here, you'll see that\nutility is equated with fit for purpose.\n\n427\n00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:32.550\nYou'll see that warranty is\nassociated with fit for use, right?\n\n428\n00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.310\nAnd notice the or and and gates here.\n\n429\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.820\nOverall, it's saying that you\nneed to deliver both utility and\n\n430\n00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.070\nwarranty, to be able to deliver value.\n\n431\n00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.780\nIf you can do that, you're able to deliver\nsome value, to affect business outcomes.\n\n432\n00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.160\nSo what is warranty?\n\n433\n00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.020\nWell we're gonna spend a lot\nof time on warranty with PPO.\n\n434\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.470\nPPO has these four topics in scope.\n\n435\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.570\nCapacity management, availability\nmanagement, continuity management, and\n\n436\n00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.840\nsecurity management.\n\n437\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.500\nWe're also going to throw in\ndemand management as well.\n\n438\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.430\nBut these warranty processes\nensure that the service is\n\n439\n00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.290\nthere when it's supposed to be there, and\nperforming as it's supposed to perform.\n\n440\n00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.782\nSo it's not the functionality of email,\n\n441\n00:25:14.782 --> 00:25:19.870\nit is is it there to be able to\nwork as it's intended to work?\n\n442\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:27.630\nSo is it possible to have a very\nhigh-utility service and bad warranty?\n\n443\n00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.970\nIn other words, has all the functionality,\nall the bells and whistles.\n\n444\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:35.100\nIt's intuitive to use,\nit's got all the nice little buttons\n\n445\n00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.580\nthat users would expect, and\nit's just so intuitive that it's easy.\n\n446\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.640\nBut if it falls over everyday,\nyou're losing on the value proposition.\n\n447\n00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah warranty seems very\nmuch like yes and no questions.\n\n448\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.470\nIs it doing this, yes or no?\n\n449\n00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.310\nDoes it do this, yes or no?\n\n450\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.880\nWhereas the utility seems\nlike what does it do?\n\n451\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.870\nRight-\n&gt;&gt; Right, gives you more-\n\n452\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:56.720\n&gt;&gt; And do you like it,\n\n453\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.870\nright it's more, yeah, good point.\n\n454\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:02.320\nIt's more subjective,\nutility's almost more subjective.\n\n455\n00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.990\nDoes it do it nicely, is it easy to use?\n\n456\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.930\nAre you selling more\nwidgets because of it?\n\n457\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.136\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Those kinds of things,\n\n458\n00:26:08.136 --> 00:26:09.490\nwhereas warranty is, is it there?\n\n459\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, or no?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n460\n00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, is it secure, yes or no?\n\n461\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.810\nDoes it have sufficient capacity?\n\n462\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.280\nDoes it have sufficient security or\ncontinuity?\n\n463\n00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.670\nSo we're gonna talk deeply\nabout these later on, so\n\n464\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.650\nI'm not gonna pick these\napart too much now.\n\n465\n00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.880\nBut let's look at warranty,\nat least in compare and contrast.\n\n466\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.260\nThey're all really somehow related to,\nis it available, right?\n\n467\n00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.840\nAvailability is kind of\na baseline measurement of,\n\n468\n00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.090\nis it there when it's\nsupposed to be there?\n\n469\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.650\nNow availability could be\ntarnished because of bad capacity.\n\n470\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.740\nIf the disk runs out of disk space and\nthe application falls over,\n\n471\n00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.711\nthat's a capacity issue that\naffected availability, right?\n\n472\n00:26:50.711 --> 00:26:55.510\nContinuity, continuities also\ncould effect availability.\n\n473\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.300\nContinuity management is making\nsure that if there is a failure,\n\n474\n00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.740\nyou can respond appropriately.\n\n475\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.960\nMeaning quickly enough or cost effectively\nenough, to bring the service back up.\n\n476\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.160\nSo if a server falls over dead,\nis there any other server\n\n477\n00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.770\nin the closet you can bring up and\nbe restored within two hours?\n\n478\n00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.630\nOr is there one operating right\nnext to it, in real time?\n\n479\n00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.570\nSo if it falls over,\nyou're still up, right?\n\n480\n00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.790\nThat's continuity management,\ndealing with this failure.\n\n481\n00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:25.140\nOr what about losing\nan entire data center, right?\n\n482\n00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.270\nIf a tornado strikes your data center,\nhow quickly can you recover from that?\n\n483\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.960\nDo you have a redundant data\ncenter in another geographic\n\n484\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.670\nlocation that's ready to turn on?\n\n485\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.070\nIs it already on?\n\n486\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.740\nThose types of things is\nwhat continuity deals with.\n\n487\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.020\nBut still points back to\nthe same question of,\n\n488\n00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.490\nis it available when it's\nsupposed to be available, right?\n\n489\n00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.430\nAnd then of course, security management.\n\n490\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.570\nIt could be available,\nhave plenty of availability designed in.\n\n491\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.280\nIt could have plenty of\ncapacity designed into it.\n\n492\n00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.450\nHave a thorough continuity\nplan designed for it.\n\n493\n00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.380\nAnd then a denial of service\nattack hits your network, and\n\n494\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.560\nno one's getting anything.\n\n495\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.240\nOr a virus attacks your network and\ncorrupts all the data, or deletes this and\n\n496\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.510\ndeletes that.\n\n497\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:07.890\nOr anybody can get on the network,\ndue to a lack of security, and just starts\n\n498\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.700\nputting fake information in there, or-\n&gt;&gt; Making it a little too available.\n\n499\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.210\n&gt;&gt; Making it too available, exactly,\n\n500\n00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.190\nmaking it available to everybody,\ngood point.\n\n501\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.790\nSo, security management.\n\n502\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.830\nNot directly related to availability,\nbut related to the warranty.\n\n503\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.360\nIs it performing as it should?\n\n504\n00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.620\nAnd of course, if data gets corrupted, or\n\n505\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.530\nif it's not available because of security\nattacks or denial of service attacks.\n\n506\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.550\nThen obviously you got an issue there.\n\n507\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:35.410\nSo, those four processes, availability,\ncapacity, continuity, and security.\n\n508\n00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.710\nThose four processes are key to warranty.\n\n509\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:41.280\nAnd they're also a big focus of\nwhat we're gonna talk about in PPO.\n\n510\n00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.950\nPlanning, protection, and optimization,\nfocusing on those four processes.\n\n511\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.848\nAnd again,\nalso throwing in some demand management.\n\n512\n00:28:47.848 --> 00:28:54.760\nOkay, all right, assets,\nresources and capabilities.\n\n513\n00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.190\nBy definition,\nan asset is a resource or capability.\n\n514\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:04.840\nIt's interesting, because asset\ncertainly has a meaning outside if ITIL.\n\n515\n00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.940\nIt's often considered,\nin financial management,\n\n516\n00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.222\nit's something that's got a tag on it,\non the laptop lid.\n\n517\n00:29:11.222 --> 00:29:13.830\nAnd it has a depreciation\nschedule associated with it.\n\n518\n00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.510\nThere are actually financial\nthings associated with assets.\n\n519\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.434\nBut ITIL's taken a word, it's commonly\nused in different context, and\n\n520\n00:29:20.434 --> 00:29:22.345\ngiven you a very specific meaning.\n\n521\n00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:25.750\nAnd it simply means a resource or\na capability.\n\n522\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.343\nNow, you may recall,\ngonna ask you Daniel, if you recall,\n\n523\n00:29:29.343 --> 00:29:31.487\nthat assets exist in two domains.\n\n524\n00:29:31.487 --> 00:29:35.447\n&gt;&gt; Man, you're gonna [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So we got resources and capabilities,\n\n525\n00:29:35.447 --> 00:29:38.210\nand you gotta consider these assets.\n\n526\n00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.890\nAs a service provider,\nyou have to consider your own assets.\n\n527\n00:29:43.017 --> 00:29:44.550\nWhat other assets should you consider?\n\n528\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.900\n&gt;&gt; This is why we're doing a foundation\nrefresher, because I don't remember.\n\n529\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, fair enough,\nI'm glad you don't.\n\n530\n00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.490\nSo you have customer assets and\nservice provider assets.\n\n531\n00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.250\nService assets are the ones\nthat you control,\n\n532\n00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.180\ncustomer assets are the ones\nyou need to understand, right?\n\n533\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.680\nSo the way to kind of reinforce this.\n\n534\n00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.504\nDo you have to be a geophysicist\nto work in the IT\n\n535\n00:30:07.504 --> 00:30:09.042\ndepartment-\n&gt;&gt; You sure do.\n\n536\n00:30:09.042 --> 00:30:09.653\n&gt;&gt; Of an oil company?\n\n537\n00:30:09.653 --> 00:30:11.200\n&gt;&gt; You have to, it's mandatory.\n\n538\n00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding, I'm kidding,\n\n539\n00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.095\nit's not, I'm facetious here.\n\n540\n00:30:14.095 --> 00:30:15.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, no, obviously not.\n\n541\n00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.970\n&gt;&gt; Do you have to be a lawyer to work\nin the IT department of a law firm?\n\n542\n00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n543\n00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.460\nif you're working in the IT department of\na law firm, you don't have to be a lawyer.\n\n544\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.730\nBut do you need to know what\nthe lawyers are trying to do?\n\n545\n00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.730\n&gt;&gt; It probably would help.\n\n546\n00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.560\n&gt;&gt; You need to understand\nwhat those assets are doing.\n\n547\n00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So they're bringing their expertise.\n\n548\n00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.930\nYou know, the customer assets,\nthey have their expertise.\n\n549\n00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.470\nThey have their resources and\ntheir capabilities.\n\n550\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.340\nThey have paralegals, they have lawyers,\nthey have trial lawyers,\n\n551\n00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.220\nthey have finance, tax lawyers.\n\n552\n00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.610\nThey have different types of\nlawyers in their practice, right?\n\n553\n00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.640\nAnd they have tort lawyers perhaps.\n\n554\n00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.192\nParalegals, they have clerks,\n\n555\n00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:56.630\nthey have various folks on\nthat side of the business.\n\n556\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.460\nIT is helping them get their job done.\n\n557\n00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.390\nUnderstanding what their\nassets are trying to get done.\n\n558\n00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:05.340\nUnderstanding their capabilities and\ntheir resources is important.\n\n559\n00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:10.555\nSo if you want to introduce a whiz-bang\ndocument management system,\n\n560\n00:31:10.555 --> 00:31:16.130\nlet's say, for\na law firm that can't spell Word, right?\n\n561\n00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.570\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That service is maybe going to fail,\n\n562\n00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.670\nunless you consider those assets\naren't quite developed yet.\n\n563\n00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.980\nThe resources and capabilities\naren't ready to take on this new\n\n564\n00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.270\ndocument management,\nbecause they can't even spell Word.\n\n565\n00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.770\nThey've been using pencil and\npaper for years.\n\n566\n00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.600\nOf course,\nthat goes back quite a few years,\n\n567\n00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.253\ncuz most law firms probably\ncan spell Word now.\n\n568\n00:31:35.253 --> 00:31:35.945\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's hope so.\n\n569\n00:31:35.945 --> 00:31:37.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll give you another\n\n570\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.760\nexample from, I did some consulting\nwith an oil company not so long ago.\n\n571\n00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.180\nAnd the introduction of MRI technology for\n\n572\n00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.180\nthe geophysicists, to go out and\ndiscover oil where it might be,\n\n573\n00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.980\nwas an evolutionary aspect for\na lot of those geophysicists.\n\n574\n00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.859\nSo it's one thing to have the IT\ncapability of doing MRI imaging, and\n\n575\n00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:02.911\ngetting that data sent remotely\nback to a lab somewhere.\n\n576\n00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:06.149\nWhen the geophysicist used to\nhave to go out to the field,\n\n577\n00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:08.720\ndig up some dirt,\nmix it with stuff, right?\n\n578\n00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.480\nDo what they did,\n\n579\n00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.745\nwhatever they did, I can't say-\n&gt;&gt; You're not a geophysicist.\n\n580\n00:32:11.745 --> 00:32:12.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not a geophysicist.\n\n581\n00:32:12.485 --> 00:32:14.064\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, but once upon a time,\n\n582\n00:32:14.064 --> 00:32:15.090\nthat's what it was like.\n\n583\n00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.131\nAnd they still used IT\nin that environment.\n\n584\n00:32:17.131 --> 00:32:18.923\nBut to introduce this new technology,\n\n585\n00:32:18.923 --> 00:32:21.423\nthat could transform\nthe geophysicist's behavior,\n\n586\n00:32:21.423 --> 00:32:25.500\nnecessarily means the geophysicist's\nbehavior needs to come along too.\n\n587\n00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.560\nSo considering customer assets, while you\n\n588\n00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.620\ndon't own the responsibility of training\nthem on all the things they need to know.\n\n589\n00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.050\nYou're not gonna train them on law,\nyou're not gonna train them on geophysics.\n\n590\n00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.930\nYou probably do need to be there to\nmake sure they're up to speed on\n\n591\n00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.140\nthe technology you're introducing.\n\n592\n00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.750\nSo understanding customer assets,\ntheir resources and capabilities.\n\n593\n00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.150\nAnd understanding your own assets,\nyour own resource and capabilities.\n\n594\n00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:52.600\nIs a necessary evil in ITIL planning,\nprotection, and optimization.\n\n595\n00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.810\nAll right, Terry definitely a lot of good,\nexcellent information there.\n\n596\n00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.030\nAll this ITIL foundation review.\n\n597\n00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.400\nBut I'm looking at our time, and I hate\nto cut you off, cuz it’s getting so good.\n\n598\n00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.870\nEspecially for me, because I can\ndefinitely needed this refresher.\n\n599\n00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.760\nBut like I said, we're kind of\nrunning out of time for this episode.\n\n600\n00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.670\nHow about we roll this into a part two?\n\n601\n00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.040\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, awesome.\n\n602\n00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.563\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff.\n\n603\n00:33:10.563 --> 00:33:12.430\n&gt;&gt; Good idea.\n&gt;&gt; That being said, thank you ladies and\n\n604\n00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:13.350\ngentlemen for joining us.\n\n605\n00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:17.320\nWe thank Terry for lending his\ntime to this show for us as well.\n\n606\n00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.290\nBut we're gonna have to\nroll this into a part two.\n\n607\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.290\nDefinitely join us back for\nthat, to continue our refresher\n\n608\n00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.680\non the Foundation Foundations\nthat we need to understand.\n\n609\n00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.750\nBut for this episode,\nwe need to call it a day.\n\n610\n00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.510\nThanks for watching, I've been your\nhost for ITProTV, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n611\n00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:31.470\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n612\n00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.096\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n613\n00:33:34.096 --> 00:33:40.193\n[MUSIC]\n\n614\n00:33:40.193 --> 00:33:44.008\nThank you for watching

00:00:08.646\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.212\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.021\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:16.621\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.616\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\n\n8\n00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:23.484\nand in today's episode we are continuing\non with more of our PPO series for ITIL.\n\n9\n00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:26.324\nWe're actually doing a Part\n2 on ITIL Foundation,\n\n10\n00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:28.269\na little bit of a refresher on that.\n\n11\n00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.891\nAnd continuing that conversation with us\ntoday in the studio, our good friend,\n\n12\n00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.700\nMr Terry Decker.\n\n13\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.043\nTerry, welcome back, man.\n\n14\n00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:35.593\nI know you have a lot of information,\n\n15\n00:00:35.593 --> 00:00:37.698\nthat's why we had to break\nthis up into two parts.\n\n16\n00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:41.235\nObviously, I need this, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that's good.\n\n17\n00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:42.799\nSo we're taking our time-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n18\n00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:43.871\n&gt;&gt; Doing it right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:46.696\nMake sure we uplift Daniel, and\nothers, that need this good refresher.\n\n20\n00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:47.333\nSo yeah,\n\n21\n00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:52.289\nwe talked a few things already about\nsome of the topics in ITO foundation.\n\n22\n00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.750\nWe got a few more before\nwe put this topic to bed.\n\n23\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.100\nAnd we're gonna start with processes.\n\n24\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.184\nSo, again, very rote definition.\n\n25\n00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.583\nWhat is a process, right?\n\n26\n00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:03.383\nSo as you look at the slide here,\nyou'll see the rote definition.\n\n27\n00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:07.720\nA structured set of activities designed\nto accomplish a specific objective.\n\n28\n00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.575\nPretty straightforward, it takes one or\nmore defined inputs and\n\n29\n00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.142\nturns them into defined outputs.\n\n30\n00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:19.047\nSomething comes in, it gets processed,\nsomething spits out.\n\n31\n00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:20.642\nNothing really magical about it.\n\n32\n00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:24.866\nWanna remind you that businesses have\nprocesses as well, it's not just IT.\n\n33\n00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.211\nOf course,\nwe're focusing on IT service providers and\n\n34\n00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:30.429\nthe processes that they're using.\n\n35\n00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.651\nBut effectively, what you're trying to do\nas an IT service provider is enhance their\n\n36\n00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.127\nbusiness processes as well.\n\n37\n00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:38.782\nAgain, the oil companies are trying to.\n\n38\n00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:40.222\nThey have processes for finding it.\n\n39\n00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:42.366\nThey have processes for distributing it.\n\n40\n00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.689\nThey have processes for\nattracting it and refining algorithms.\n\n41\n00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.368\nThey got their processes.\n\n42\n00:01:47.368 --> 00:01:51.320\nIT is trying to help get those\nbusiness processes done.\n\n43\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.439\nPretty straightforward there.\n\n44\n00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.125\nAgain, that's really obscure about this\ndefinition just reminding you what\n\n45\n00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.340\nthe definition is.\n\n46\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.081\nAnother thing to recall about process is,\naccording to ITIL,\n\n47\n00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:06.541\nis all processes have these\ncharacteristics, that they are measurable.\n\n48\n00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.028\nA mature process, that is, is one\nthat has metrics associated with it.\n\n49\n00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:14.740\nSo you know if it's performing as\nit should be performing, right?\n\n50\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.793\nFor instance, incident management.\n\n51\n00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:18.726\nI told you my recall for foundation.\n\n52\n00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:21.867\nIt's often measured in how\nquickly you respond or\n\n53\n00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.569\nhow quickly you resolve those incidents.\n\n54\n00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.620\nOr even the volume, how many do you have?\n\n55\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.632\nRight, so\neven volume metrics can be part of it.\n\n56\n00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:31.258\nWe're gonna talk about availability,\n\n57\n00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:33.323\ncapacity, continuity and\nsecurity management.\n\n58\n00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:36.221\nSo we're gonna be looking for\nsome key performance indicators and\n\n59\n00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.351\ncritical success factors for\nthose processes.\n\n60\n00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:42.124\nWhat does success look like if you\ndo availability management well?\n\n61\n00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:47.128\nWe'll be looking at some measurements of\na little bit later on as well, right.\n\n62\n00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:49.731\nSpecific results,\nthere's something at the end, right?\n\n63\n00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:52.317\nThey deliver something,\nmaybe it's a document.\n\n64\n00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:56.994\nMaybe it's a plan,\nmaybe it's a satisfied customer, right?\n\n65\n00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:00.006\nThose sorts of things,\nthey are customer-focused.\n\n66\n00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.536\nThey are intended to have\na specific stakeholder in mind.\n\n67\n00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:06.889\nThe customer might be,\nan end-user customer,\n\n68\n00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.663\nthe customer might the next\nstage in the life-cycle.\n\n69\n00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:13.071\nBut the stakeholder is the key and\n\n70\n00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:17.378\nthe customer value is what's\ntrying to be delivered here.\n\n71\n00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:20.025\nAnd something distant started,\nthey respond to something, something gets\n\n72\n00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:22.974\navailability management started, something\ngets capacity management starting.\n\n73\n00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:26.480\nSo as we learned about these processes,\n\n74\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.883\nwe'll also reinforce what triggers them,\nwhat gets them set in motion.\n\n75\n00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:37.139\nNow, a process doesn't exist\non an island all by itself.\n\n76\n00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.730\nTo have process under control, you really\nhave to have process policy as well.\n\n77\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.235\nThe many things in that upper orange\nbox there are you can see how\n\n78\n00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:51.600\nprocess policies kinda superseding\non top of them at the upper layer.\n\n79\n00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.100\nIt does kinda drive the other ones,\nso to speak.\n\n80\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.397\nIt's one thing to have a process defined.\n\n81\n00:03:56.397 --> 00:04:00.680\nIt's another thing to have a policy that\nsays thou shalt follow the process, right?\n\n82\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.863\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it does help to have that management\n\n83\n00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:08.430\nfortification, if your will,\nof that process as should be followed.\n\n84\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.216\nOf course, process controls\nbegins with process ownership.\n\n85\n00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:17.277\nIn the absence of an availability\nmanagement process, as an example.\n\n86\n00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:20.934\nIf you currently don't have\na availability management process,\n\n87\n00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:24.930\none of the first activities you'll\nneed to do, is find a process owner.\n\n88\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.736\nPut someone in charge of it.\n\n89\n00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:29.222\nThey are now accountable for it, right?\n\n90\n00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:32.236\nWe'll talk about some of those roles\ndefinition a little bit later on.\n\n91\n00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:34.816\nBut accountability is very key to ITIL.\n\n92\n00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.690\nIts relation to processes that accountable\nis delivered through a process owner.\n\n93\n00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.074\nOf course a process owner\nneeds to document it.\n\n94\n00:04:41.074 --> 00:04:45.308\nNeeds to make sure that the objectives\nare well understood and they get plenty of\n\n95\n00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:48.734\nfeedback from the practitioners\nof the processes down stream.\n\n96\n00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:53.568\nOf course, in the green box there you got\nthe process itself and what is driving it.\n\n97\n00:04:53.568 --> 00:04:56.940\nPeople have access to it,\nthey know how to use it.\n\n98\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.965\nThey are procedures and work instructions\nwithin the processes that guide people\n\n99\n00:05:00.965 --> 00:05:03.423\nthrough how they're\nsupposed to make it happen.\n\n100\n00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:05.168\nNotice the measurement piece.\n\n101\n00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:08.269\nIt's in operations that the metrics\nactually get generated.\n\n102\n00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.667\nThe operation of a process that is, right.\n\n103\n00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:14.447\nWho does what and when the process roles?\n\n104\n00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:18.162\nAnd how do you approach your\nimprovement methodology.\n\n105\n00:05:18.162 --> 00:05:22.493\nThat's all built into the process itself\nwhat feedback do you get there, right?\n\n106\n00:05:22.493 --> 00:05:25.360\nAnd of course, you have people,\nprocess enablers.\n\n107\n00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.988\nWise people that know how to use\na process, understand why it's being used\n\n108\n00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:35.369\nnot blindly following it but following it\nwith the overarching goals in mind, right.\n\n109\n00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.582\nFeedback mechanisms you see\nthe arrows between the boxes.\n\n110\n00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:42.692\nFeedback mechanisms between the enablers,\nand the process and\n\n111\n00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:47.500\nbetween the process, and the controllers\nare all very necessary as well.\n\n112\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.926\nSo again, as this plays out on exam\nyou're not gonna be asked a question what\n\n113\n00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:52.488\nare elements of process control.\n\n114\n00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:53.795\nYou're not going to get that.\n\n115\n00:05:53.795 --> 00:05:55.492\nBut you could see missing elements.\n\n116\n00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:58.635\nAgain, in the absence of a process owner.\n\n117\n00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:00.585\nYour process is not gonna\nbe very successful,\n\n118\n00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:02.793\nbecause you have to be at\nthe controls of it, right.\n\n119\n00:06:02.793 --> 00:06:06.536\nIn the absence of process management,\nthe day to day execution of the process.\n\n120\n00:06:06.536 --> 00:06:09.129\nAnd without measurement,\nyou're gonna be less mature.\n\n121\n00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.287\nAnd of course you have to have\nwise people executing it.\n\n122\n00:06:12.287 --> 00:06:15.564\nSo in the absence of those things,\nas you're reading the scenario,\n\n123\n00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:18.624\nmaybe you have uninformed people and\na well-defined process.\n\n124\n00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:24.740\nMaybe you have well-informed people and a\nwell-designed process but poor execution.\n\n125\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.212\nYou'll see how the scenario plays out.\n\n126\n00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:31.941\nNow, moving on from processes\nto the word called functions.\n\n127\n00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:37.056\nITIL defines function as a team or\ngroup of people and the tools and\n\n128\n00:06:37.056 --> 00:06:42.452\nresources they use to carry out one or\nmore processes or activities.\n\n129\n00:06:42.452 --> 00:06:43.930\nI kind of short-hand this.\n\n130\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.750\nA group of people with special tools and\nskills, right?\n\n131\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.378\nSo ITIL describes these functions and\nspreads them out across the IT services to\n\n132\n00:06:54.378 --> 00:07:00.182\nmake sure that the appropriate activities\nare done on time, on budget, wisely.\n\n133\n00:07:00.182 --> 00:07:01.757\nThey're done well, right?\n\n134\n00:07:01.757 --> 00:07:03.376\nFunctions are the people.\n\n135\n00:07:03.376 --> 00:07:10.614\nProcesses are the process, the practices,\nfunctions are actual people, all right.\n\n136\n00:07:10.614 --> 00:07:12.808\nSo, let's look at some roles.\n\n137\n00:07:12.808 --> 00:07:15.211\nThe process owner, I've already\nmentioned it a little bit earlier.\n\n138\n00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:19.450\nThe process owner, generically is\naccountable to ensure that the process\n\n139\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.748\nperformed according to agreed and\ndocumented process and\n\n140\n00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:25.114\nmeet the aims of the process definition.\n\n141\n00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:28.441\nSo accountable,\nloading up this word accountable means,\n\n142\n00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.834\nthey're not in a silly\ndoing it day to day,\n\n143\n00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:35.038\nthey just make sure it gets done that\nthe process itself is fit for purpose.\n\n144\n00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.938\n&gt;&gt; So they're the ones that come by and\nsay, your you might someone that\n\n145\n00:07:37.938 --> 00:07:40.393\nis actually doing the process\nis there anything you need?\n\n146\n00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.950\nIs the process working correctly?\n\n147\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.986\nIs there any problems that we need to\nbe aware of that we need to address and\n\n148\n00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:48.448\nmake sure that this gets\nback to status quo?\n\n149\n00:07:48.448 --> 00:07:50.320\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, exactly right.\n\n150\n00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.942\nThey own it, accountable for it.\n\n151\n00:07:51.942 --> 00:07:56.764\nAgain, not necessarily involved in your\nday to day execution or management of\n\n152\n00:07:56.764 --> 00:08:01.480\nthe day to day execution, but\non top of it at an holistic level, right.\n\n153\n00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.346\nMaking sure it's measured, improving it,\naddress those policy issues,\n\n154\n00:08:06.346 --> 00:08:09.169\nand define what success looks like, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.029\nNow, a process manager is managing\nthe day to day execution of the process.\n\n156\n00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:15.550\nSo they're seeing how it's playing out.\n\n157\n00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.501\nThey're making sure\npeople are trained well.\n\n158\n00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:22.438\nThat they review and audit, to make sure\npeople are complying with the process,\n\n159\n00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:23.174\nall right?\n\n160\n00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:26.764\nThey monitor and report back,\nperhaps to the process owner.\n\n161\n00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:27.711\nHow is it going?\n\n162\n00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:32.798\nWe need to tweak this it could be a very\nprime source of improvement ideas for\n\n163\n00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:34.186\nthe process owner.\n\n164\n00:08:34.186 --> 00:08:38.344\nNow again,\nthis is not a hierarchical nature here.\n\n165\n00:08:38.344 --> 00:08:43.034\nA process manager in other words\ncould outrank a process owner, right?\n\n166\n00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:46.355\nThere's nothing mean that one reports to\nthe other, they're just different roles.\n\n167\n00:08:46.355 --> 00:08:49.410\nIt's also, doesn't have to\nnecessarily be different people.\n\n168\n00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.730\nI could be a process owner,\nI own the process, and\n\n169\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.110\nI also manage it day to day, right.\n\n170\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.894\nSo it's not necessarily an organizational\nchart either, don't think of it that way.\n\n171\n00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.112\nDon't think of it as a hierarchy,\n\n172\n00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:05.173\nand don't think of it as\nan organizational structure, okay.\n\n173\n00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:08.236\nThere's just roles to play,\nincluding process practitioners.\n\n174\n00:09:08.236 --> 00:09:11.503\nThese people actually carry out one or\nmore of the process activities,\n\n175\n00:09:11.503 --> 00:09:12.705\nthey get something done.\n\n176\n00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:16.059\nThe manager could be accountable for\nthat getting done.\n\n177\n00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:18.044\nBut the practitioners\nare actually getting it done.\n\n178\n00:09:18.044 --> 00:09:21.255\nAnd of course,\na manager could be a practitioner too.\n\n179\n00:09:21.255 --> 00:09:24.353\nIt's not hierarchical, and\nit's not organizational.\n\n180\n00:09:24.353 --> 00:09:28.735\nA practitioner could outrank\na manager as an example.\n\n181\n00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.446\nLet's say your change\nmanagement process for\n\n182\n00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:35.071\nsome kinda changes require\nsenior vice president approval.\n\n183\n00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:38.475\nWhen the senior vice president comes\ninto the process and approves something,\n\n184\n00:09:38.475 --> 00:09:39.604\nthey are a practitioner.\n\n185\n00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:41.963\nThey are carrying out the approval step.\n\n186\n00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.538\nOf the change management process.\n\n187\n00:09:43.538 --> 00:09:48.125\nAnd yet they're a senior vice president,\nin this case managed by someone that,\n\n188\n00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:51.010\nin the organization, that they outrank.\n\n189\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.789\nSo you get the idea there, okay.\n\n190\n00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:55.366\nSo again, not hierarchical,\nnot organizational,\n\n191\n00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:56.977\njust roles that could be played.\n\n192\n00:09:56.977 --> 00:09:59.851\nAnd any given person could\nhold more than one role.\n\n193\n00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:03.574\nNow as we talk about availability\nmanagement, capacity management,\n\n194\n00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:06.125\nthe processes we're gonna\ntalk about later on.\n\n195\n00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:10.447\nOne of the features of each one of\nthose modules is that we'll talk about\n\n196\n00:10:10.447 --> 00:10:14.051\nthe responsibilities of\nthe availability process owner,\n\n197\n00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:17.520\nthe availability process manager, etc.\n\n198\n00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.559\nThe generic ideas serve you well, here.\n\n199\n00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.990\nWe'll just look at them as\nwe review each process.\n\n200\n00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.451\nWe'll look at the details of what\nis an owner of the availability and\n\n201\n00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.670\nmanagement process do that might\nbe different than the generic\n\n202\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.542\ndescription of a process owner,\nas an example, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:36.693\nSo we'll look forward to that\nlearning a little bit later on, okay.\n\n204\n00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:39.884\nNow another role that's\nvery key to success for\n\n205\n00:10:39.884 --> 00:10:43.252\nan IT service organization\nis the Service Owner.\n\n206\n00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:45.493\nIs the person that's accountable for\n\n207\n00:10:45.493 --> 00:10:49.250\nthe over arching quality of the service or\ndelivery.\n\n208\n00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.685\nSo again,\nperhaps you're the email service owner.\n\n209\n00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:57.290\nThen you're accountable for everything\nrelated to email service delivery.\n\n210\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.940\nAccountable does not mean you necessarily\nget your hands dirty in the details of\n\n211\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.930\nevery single thing.\n\n212\n00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.367\nYou don't reboot a server,\nyou don't write a script,\n\n213\n00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:09.335\nyou don't maintain a mailbox,\nthose types of things, right?\n\n214\n00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:12.927\nBut you make sure those are done at\ntimely fashion as agreed, right?\n\n215\n00:11:12.927 --> 00:11:17.992\nSo the service owner is the face and\nname associated with the service.\n\n216\n00:11:17.992 --> 00:11:19.020\nThey own it and\n\n217\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:25.120\nthey make sure it's delivered at\nthe level quality which expected, right?\n\n218\n00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.980\nCertainly, they could be a prime mover\nin identifying service improvement\n\n219\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.870\nopportunities.\n\n220\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.730\nThey're gonna have interface\nwith the business customers\n\n221\n00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.910\nbecause they are the face and\nname of the service.\n\n222\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.103\nSo they're gonna be\nhearing their complaints,\n\n223\n00:11:36.103 --> 00:11:38.839\nthey're gonna be hearing of\nthe successes as well, right?\n\n224\n00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:42.193\nSo they also have a stake in\nhow this process is work.\n\n225\n00:11:42.193 --> 00:11:46.787\nIf you own a service and availability\nis poor, and it's regularly poor, not\n\n226\n00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:52.032\nimproving, then maybe you're gonna have a\nchat with the availability process owner.\n\n227\n00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:54.020\nSay hey, why is this keep failing?\n\n228\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.790\nWe're not doing this very well.\n\n229\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.960\nThese are more measurements\nwe can put into.\n\n230\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.244\nGive us some newer details of where\nwe're failing and why we're failing.\n\n231\n00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.741\nIs it our architectural designed poorly?\n\n232\n00:12:04.741 --> 00:12:06.598\nIs it technology based?\n\n233\n00:12:06.598 --> 00:12:07.948\nIs it human based?\n\n234\n00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:10.136\nWhere are we failing?\n\n235\n00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:17.480\nI once as a technical practitioner, twice\nI have to say, I did it more than once.\n\n236\n00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.181\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Dropped a production database,\n\n237\n00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:24.398\na database that was in\noperation I dropped.\n\n238\n00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:25.332\n&gt;&gt; They love it.\n\n239\n00:12:25.332 --> 00:12:25.977\n&gt;&gt; My gosh.\n\n240\n00:12:25.977 --> 00:12:27.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n241\n00:12:27.032 --> 00:12:32.009\nmy team collectively did it three\ntimes over about eight month period.\n\n242\n00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:35.713\n&gt;&gt; If you've never seen the comic\nstrip about little bobby tables.\n\n243\n00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:36.666\n&gt;&gt; Bobby tables?\n\n244\n00:12:36.666 --> 00:12:37.476\nNo.\n\n245\n00:12:37.476 --> 00:12:38.329\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou gotta look at that that's a good one.\n\n246\n00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:39.644\n&gt;&gt; Alright I'll check it out Bobby Tables?\n\n247\n00:12:39.644 --> 00:12:43.883\nB-O-B-B-Y\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, little bobby tables\n\n248\n00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:45.609\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a database kinda thing?\n\n249\n00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:47.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a joke about databases.\n\n250\n00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:49.355\n&gt;&gt; My goodness,\ngood old database geek joke.\n\n251\n00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:51.695\nI gotta check that one out, I'll be\nsure to check it out, Bobby tables.\n\n252\n00:12:51.695 --> 00:12:54.243\nAnyway, my team happened to drop\n\n253\n00:12:54.243 --> 00:12:58.797\noperational databases three\ntimes in about eight months.\n\n254\n00:12:58.797 --> 00:13:03.599\nAnd of course, when you drop databases,\navailability of the application kinda\n\n255\n00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:07.913\nthanks, the application failed,\nthe service failed by us doing that.\n\n256\n00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:12.501\nSo it was effectively human error,\nit wasn't technology failing.\n\n257\n00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:15.102\nSo again what did we do we do?\n\n258\n00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:18.222\nThe service owner was certainly knocking\non our heads, our doors I should say.\n\n259\n00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:19.577\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Knock on our door.\n\n260\n00:13:19.577 --> 00:13:21.852\n&gt;&gt; Knocking on our heads\nends in a lawsuit.\n\n261\n00:13:21.852 --> 00:13:22.863\n&gt;&gt; Bam, bam, bam, that's right.\n\n262\n00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:24.347\n&gt;&gt; You can't do that.\n\n263\n00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:27.937\n[LAUGH] They were knocking on our doors\nsaying why are we failing at availability?\n\n264\n00:13:27.937 --> 00:13:31.223\nThe first time it happened human error,\nyou can't correct it, right?\n\n265\n00:13:31.223 --> 00:13:34.719\nOf course we could offset\nthe chance of that happening again.\n\n266\n00:13:34.719 --> 00:13:36.164\nWe didn't take that opportunity.\n\n267\n00:13:36.164 --> 00:13:39.935\nAfter two more such activities we\nkinda had to learn some lessons there.\n\n268\n00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:44.010\nSo again, availability management is\nprobably related to components and\n\n269\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.026\ntheir failure but not necessarily.\n\n270\n00:13:46.026 --> 00:13:50.310\nThings can fail because of\nhuman activity as well.\n\n271\n00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.500\nSo availability management needs\nto have that holistic view.\n\n272\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.448\nHow do you mitigate\nthe risk of human failure?\n\n273\n00:13:55.448 --> 00:13:59.401\nHow do you mitigate the risk of\ntechnology failure in dealing with that?\n\n274\n00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:03.497\nOkay, and the service owner, again,\nis gonna have a key stake in that game.\n\n275\n00:14:03.497 --> 00:14:08.731\nSo, that wraps up our discussion\nof the refresher for foundations.\n\n276\n00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:13.681\nWe are gonna get a little bit more\nindoctrination into the context of PPO\n\n277\n00:14:13.681 --> 00:14:16.913\nup next with service\ndesign considerations.\n\n278\n00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:19.676\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, sir,\nwe do thank you for joining us today.\n\n279\n00:14:19.676 --> 00:14:21.272\nThank our good viewers for watching.\n\n280\n00:14:21.272 --> 00:14:24.734\nBut hopefully you are now going yes,\nyeah, that's right, and\n\n281\n00:14:24.734 --> 00:14:26.714\nthis refresher has been great for you.\n\n282\n00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:28.127\nIf not, hey just go back and\n\n283\n00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:31.637\nrewatch these episodes until this\nis all making sense to you again.\n\n284\n00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.530\nAnd then we can move\nforward amicably on TPO.\n\n285\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.444\nLooking forward to doing\nthat actually Terry.\n\n286\n00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:39.845\nSo, thanks for joining us today,\nwe do thank you good viewer for watching.\n\n287\n00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.830\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel

00:00:12.654\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n4\n00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:13.680\nGreetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.000\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.430\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.620\nwe are coming back with more\nOn our ITIL PPO series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.150\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.300\nagain to continue that conversation\nour good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.210\nTerry, welcome back, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.080\nGood to have you again.\n\n12\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.330\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.250\nYep, we're gonna need to set the stage\na little bit deeper about PPO, planning,\n\n14\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.610\nprotection and optimization.\n\n15\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.480\nSetting the context of PPO within\nthe lifecycle stage called service design.\n\n16\n00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.600\nFour of the five processes we're gonna\ntalk about through PPO are born and\n\n17\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.320\nraised in service design stage.\n\n18\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.750\nAlthough active at other times in\nother stages they are born here and\n\n19\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.970\noperate here most effectively.\n\n20\n00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.370\nSo certainly related to the planning and\nprotection aspect of it and\n\n21\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920\nongoing optimization.\n\n22\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.120\nService design is the key stage that makes\nsure those good questions are answered\n\n23\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.310\nat the right time,\nearly in the lifetime of the service.\n\n24\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.300\nSo if we look at the slide deck here,\nyou'll see some reminders of these things\n\n25\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.270\nthat we learned about, in foundation as\nwell as perhaps intermediate courses.\n\n26\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.870\nService design is trying to fulfill\nwhat service strategists have asked for.\n\n27\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.260\nAnd service strategists have asked for\n\n28\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.040\na service to be designed to\nmeet certain business outcomes.\n\n29\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.310\nSo certainly making sure that\nbusiness requirements are met\n\n30\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.090\nis what service design is about.\n\n31\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.190\nAnd those requirements are often\nborn out in service strategy.\n\n32\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.250\nService design is also anticipating how\nthe service is going to be delivered\n\n33\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.960\nin operation.\n\n34\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.780\nSo service delivery and\n\n35\n00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.150\nservice design are opposite sides\nof the same coin in some regards.\n\n36\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.010\nWhereas you anticipate how the service\nis going to be delivered and\n\n37\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.410\ntherefore design it to that purpose.\n\n38\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.910\nLet's take it away from IT services for\na little bit.\n\n39\n00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.420\nTalk about service design unrelated to IT.\n\n40\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.480\nFor instance, how would you go about, if\nyour market strategy as a car manufacturer\n\n41\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.940\nwas to develop a new vehicle,\ncalled an SUV, Circa 1984, right.\n\n42\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.250\nThere was an SUV launched that year\nby American Motors called the Jeep.\n\n43\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.190\nIt gained a lot of market shares, and\nGeneral Motors looks at that market share\n\n44\n00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.190\nbeing taken up by this thing called SUV\nand says, hey we need one of those things.\n\n45\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.450\nFord Motor Company does the same thing.\n\n46\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.560\nIt says, hey we need one of\nthose things called an SUV.\n\n47\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.654\n&gt;&gt; They actually used to call them ORVs.\n\n48\n00:02:31.654 --> 00:02:33.790\nOff road vehicles.\n\n49\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Off road vehicles, right?\n\n50\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.310\n&gt;&gt; Now we call them SUV's.\n\n51\n00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Sport utility, so you're going to be\non the road as well to provide sport and\n\n52\n00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.700\nutility right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.662\nGet your groceries,\ndon't just jump stumps that's right.\n\n54\n00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:51.070\nSo this concept of an SUV was gaining\nsome steam in the market place.\n\n55\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.510\nCar manufacturer says hey\nwe need one of those.\n\n56\n00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.710\nSo service strategy says\nwe want one of those.\n\n57\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.530\nWhat do you do?\n\n58\n00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.950\nWell you design it,\nyou design this field, you prototype it,\n\n59\n00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.200\nyou make sure it's gonna be able to be\nmanufactured at a cost effective rate,\n\n60\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.890\ncan be supported at\na cost effective rates.\n\n61\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.050\nThe parts can be delivered,\nthe value chain,\n\n62\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.000\nthe supply chain can be\nmanaged effectively.\n\n63\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.220\nYou got to manage your processes for\nprocurement of steel,\n\n64\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.130\nand stamping, and all that sort of thing.\n\n65\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.850\nSo the idea of, let's have a new SUV,\nsomething service strategy does.\n\n66\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.960\nService design's gonna come in here and\nmake it real, make it possible,\n\n67\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.870\nby answering all the questions that\nneed to be answered about manufacturing,\n\n68\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.930\ndelivering eventually to a show\nroom floor somewhere and\n\n69\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.940\nthen ongoing support of that through\nservice and parts and what not.\n\n70\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.860\nSo service design is similar in that\nyou're anticipating what that's going to\n\n71\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.870\nbe operations,\nhow is this gonna be delivered?\n\n72\n00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.270\nHow is it going to be manufactured?\n\n73\n00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.260\nWhat's the supply chain?\n\n74\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.020\nWhat's the process chain?\n\n75\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.280\nWhat's the point of interfaces?\n\n76\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.590\nHow do customers buy it?\n\n77\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.430\nHow do customers get it serviced?\n\n78\n00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.730\nHow they order parts,\nall those sorts of things.\n\n79\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.000\nAnd the different layers of stakeholders,\nthe car dealership versus the end user\n\n80\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.750\ncustomer, the distributors,\nthe manufacturers, the suppliers.\n\n81\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.340\nService design needs to\nconsider all those types of\n\n82\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.330\naspects to be able to deliver something\nof value in operations later on.\n\n83\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.440\nSo that’s really what service design\nis about holistically, right.\n\n84\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.100\nUnderstanding requirements,\nmaking sure that the business requirement\n\n85\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.140\nare understood well and\noperating within some constraints.\n\n86\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.123\nAll right, the constraints for\n\n87\n00:04:28.123 --> 00:04:32.540\nregulatory constraints it has to be\nsafe it has to have seat belts in it.\n\n88\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.780\nThere has to be appropriate fuel\nconsumption, perhaps mileage.\n\n89\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.320\nGas mileage is one of the constraints,\nperformance.\n\n90\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.040\nGround clearance might be one of\nthe things you're design constraints\n\n91\n00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.410\nare operating under.\n\n92\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.440\nDoes it have to be four-wheel drive,\ntwo-wheel drive?\n\n93\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.310\nSo if you can take all those types\nof considerations to an IT service,\n\n94\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.910\nit is basically trying to reinforce\nthe idea that you need to think about\n\n95\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.630\nall the questions that need to be\nanswered before you get into operations,\n\n96\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.290\nbefore the service is actually delivered.\n\n97\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.400\nSo you build it fit for purpose,\nand fit for use, right.\n\n98\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.030\nWhile operating within the constraints\nof cost, of time, etc.\n\n99\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.380\nOkay.\n\n100\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.590\nSo ultimately what service\ndesign is trying to get done\n\n101\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.340\nis to make sure you can reduce\ntotal cost of ownership by\n\n102\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.890\nmaking sure you don't have to fix\nthings after it's already launched.\n\n103\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.620\nHopefully it's working well.\n\n104\n00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.370\nI'm sure that there's been occasions where\ncar manufactures have launched lemons\n\n105\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.390\nthat didn't meet the market expectations\nand they had to get rid of I think-\n\n106\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.611\n&gt;&gt; A Ford Pinto.\n\n107\n00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:37.736\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think Ford had an earlier one called\n\n108\n00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:40.930\nthe Edsel that was\nfamously under sold right?\n\n109\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.000\nThey we're going to have a big\ncar that just kind of fell flat.\n\n110\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.210\n&gt;&gt; They had that horse color on the-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well there was a lot of ugly\n\n111\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.110\nvehicles back then.\n\n112\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.040\nThe big fins and things like that but\nthe Edsel perhaps was pretty disgusting.\n\n113\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.610\nAt any rate.\n\n114\n00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.750\n&gt;&gt; As we insult all\nthe Edsel fans out there.\n\n115\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly well if you have one\nnow it might be probably worth it.\n\n116\n00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.568\nBut at any rate service design is\ntrying to preclude that big surprise.\n\n117\n00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:08.630\nYou know what, no one really wants it but\nanswering all the questions as fitfully as\n\n118\n00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.050\npossible before you actually launch is\nreally what its trying to get done.\n\n119\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.010\nAnd hopefully again the market is ready\nfor you, the customers are ready for\n\n120\n00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.010\nyou you're gonna fulfill a need.\n\n121\n00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.940\nRight, you're going to perhaps\nsatisfy the regulators better.\n\n122\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.490\nYou're gonna satisfy the bean\ncounters in accounting better.\n\n123\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.350\nYou're gonna satisfy both the cost\nquality and risk factors better.\n\n124\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.350\nThat's what it's about.\n\n125\n00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.120\nAnd it relates to planning\nprotection optimization.\n\n126\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.850\nThe focus of this course.\n\n127\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.710\nWe're gonna be focusing a lot on making\nsure that this service you're delivering\n\n128\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.010\nhas the appropriate warranty.\n\n129\n00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.370\nThat it's there when it's supposed to be.\n\n130\n00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.020\nNot the functionality necessarily.\n\n131\n00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.830\nNot gonna talk about the utility so\nmuch as the warranty piece.\n\n132\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.630\nWe're not talking about intuitive\ndesign of applications.\n\n133\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.910\nWe're talking about,\n\n134\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.130\nis it designed because you anticipate\n5,000 people using it everyday?\n\n135\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:02.260\nOr 20,000 people using it everyday, or is\nthere other factors in play about usage?\n\n136\n00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.170\nMaybe it's not used every day, but a bunch\nof people use it at the end of the month,\n\n137\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.400\nanswering all those kinds of questions is\nwhat service design is trying to get done.\n\n138\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.975\nOkay.\nOf course, the target audience of service\n\n139\n00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:20.170\ndesign is going to be the service\nproviders themselves.\n\n140\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.290\nWhen we talk about these five processes,\navailability management, capacity\n\n141\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.700\nmanagement, continuity management,\nsecurity management and demand management.\n\n142\n00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.930\nWe're going to be talking about what\nthe service provider is doing on behalf of\n\n143\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.860\nthe customer.\n\n144\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.880\nIn fact, a lot of service design happens\n\n145\n00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.550\nin the background without\nvisibility to the customer.\n\n146\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.110\nThere's certainly going to be some\ninterface with the customers for\n\n147\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.390\nhoning in on requirements,\n\n148\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.640\nmaking sure they understand the market\nplace and those types of things.\n\n149\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.339\nBut for the most part, these things are\nhappening in the backend with the customer\n\n150\n00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:52.715\nin mind, okay, for sure, and making\nsure that ultimately you can deliver\n\n151\n00:07:52.715 --> 00:07:54.341\nthe right things at the right time.\n\n152\n00:07:57.263 --> 00:07:59.796\nThe people that would\nbenefit from good design or\n\n153\n00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:03.752\npeople involved in good design are IT\narchitects, technical architects,\n\n154\n00:08:03.752 --> 00:08:07.060\nhow to build the perfect machine so\nto speak.\n\n155\n00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.160\nBut IT managers and\npractitioners also involved here.\n\n156\n00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.930\nService owners care about it,\nremember service owners accountable for\n\n157\n00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.760\nthe quality of their service?\n\n158\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.290\nCertainly service design can be good and\n\n159\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.890\ntherefore provide a good service or\nit could be bad and\n\n160\n00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.580\nthe service falls over often,\nnot making service owners very happy.\n\n161\n00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.710\nRight?\nAnd of course business\n\n162\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.510\nrelationship managers.\n\n163\n00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.780\nThey're gonna be involved in that front\nend interface with the customers,\n\n164\n00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.220\ntrying to find out what is\nthat's going to excite them.\n\n165\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.260\nWhat it's the gotta haves as\nopposed to nice to haves.\n\n166\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.710\nWhat are they willing to spend?\n\n167\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.820\nWhat's their cost tolerance?\n\n168\n00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.310\nWhat's their risk tolerance?\n\n169\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.000\nAre there regulatory over compelling\nregulatory requirements means\n\n170\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.650\nwell we've got to spend it because if\nwe don't, we're gonna get audited and\n\n171\n00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.480\nget shut down, that kind of thing.\n\n172\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.050\nSo it's like you can't have\nan automobile that doesn't have brakes.\n\n173\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.560\nSo making sure that you have\nall the safety features or\n\n174\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.860\nregulatory features that are required for\na given service.\n\n175\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.585\nOkay, all right,\n\n176\n00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:07.500\nnow this puts service design in context of\nthe other four stages in the lifecycle.\n\n177\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.890\nYou see it near the top.\n\n178\n00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.750\nYou got service strategy\nup there at the top, right?\n\n179\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.250\nSo I'll get my laser pointer going here.\n\n180\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.310\nYou see that service strategy is\nthe earliest stage listed here and\n\n181\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.310\nthis is a great way to describe\nkind of the downward flow.\n\n182\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.170\nOnce you've determined\nwhat the strategy is,\n\n183\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.240\nwhat services you wanna offer, do you\nwant to offer an SUV or an Edsel right?\n\n184\n00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.640\nWhat do you want to offer as a service?\n\n185\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.160\nYou then need to approve\nthe appropriate funding,\n\n186\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.140\nallocate the appropriate resources\nin terms of people and time, and\n\n187\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.650\nset the direction of the overarching\norganization, right.\n\n188\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.740\nSo you pass those requirements\ndown to service design.\n\n189\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.360\nWho then gets into the weeds of what's it\ntake to actually manufacture this thing,\n\n190\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.750\nor to build this thing.\n\n191\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.560\nService design then takes their good work,\nand\n\n192\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.870\ncompiles it into a service design package.\n\n193\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.340\nYou see the output over here,\nservice design package.\n\n194\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.010\nAgain, you may recall this from\nyour foundation courses as well.\n\n195\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.890\nThe service design package is\nthe collection of all the questions and\n\n196\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.730\nall the answers, right?\n\n197\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.410\nSo when you're designing something,\nyou're gonna ask questions like, well,\n\n198\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.140\nwhat's the technical architecture of this?\n\n199\n00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.140\nWhat is the business architecture or\nmanagement architecture?\n\n200\n00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.190\nHow do we interface with customers for\nthis?\n\n201\n00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.220\nWhat processes do we need?\n\n202\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.510\nWhat technology is gonna be in play?\n\n203\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.710\nIs there a design specification?\n\n204\n00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.710\nIs there a business requirements document?\n\n205\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.040\nAll those types of things\nthat you need to bring\n\n206\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.100\nto answer the appropriate questions\nabout service design have answers.\n\n207\n00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.760\nAnd most of those answers are in\nthe form of some sort of document,\n\n208\n00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.700\nor some sort of deliverable.\n\n209\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.160\nWell the service design package is\na collection of all those documents, or\n\n210\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.670\nall those deliverables.\n\n211\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.550\nAll the questions answered, the services\nI impacted can then be passed down to\n\n212\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.420\nservice transition that\ntakes those good answers and\n\n213\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.060\nstarts building the service\npiece by piece.\n\n214\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.490\nIf you have some software development\nexperience this may sound very familiar.\n\n215\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.890\nYou develop business requirements,\n\n216\n00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.450\nyou turn business requirements\ninto system requirements.\n\n217\n00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.330\nSystem requirements into technical,\nfunctional requirements.\n\n218\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.240\nMaybe you have a design specification,\n\n219\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.690\na package configuration, all these\ndifferent documents could be generated.\n\n220\n00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:25.033\nIt's a very good analogy, but remember\nthat service design is not the same as,\n\n221\n00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:27.340\nsolution design.\n\n222\n00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.810\nService design includes solution designs.\n\n223\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.790\nSo service design is a super\nset whereas system design and\n\n224\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.230\nsolution design would be subset.\n\n225\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.820\nIt takes a lot more elastic thinking,\n\n226\n00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.770\na lot more questions to be\nanswered to design a service than\n\n227\n00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.439\nit does to design a system,\neven though systems are parts of services.\n\n228\n00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.800\nWith all these questions answers, and\ncompiled into service design package,\n\n229\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.450\nthey pass down to service transition,\nthey build it, they test it,\n\n230\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.550\nthey make sure it's ready to go.\n\n231\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.143\nAnd with all green lights,\neverything tested out perfectly,\n\n232\n00:11:59.143 --> 00:12:03.910\nthey deliver it into service operations,\nor they bring it to service operations.\n\n233\n00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.560\nThey transition it there.\n\n234\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.947\nAnd of course, service operations is where\nthe customers actually start using it.\n\n235\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.820\nAll these other things are kind of in the\nbackground with some customer interface.\n\n236\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.468\nUltimately the service is launched, it's\nout there available for consumption, and\n\n237\n00:12:18.468 --> 00:12:20.680\ncustomers start consuming.\n\n238\n00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.450\nAnd you that swooping arrow going up,\nthat's where business value can be\n\n239\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.750\ngenerated, it's because they're actually\nusing the service you promised them.\n\n240\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.400\nWay back up in service strategy, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.550\nAnd of course, CSI,\nI appreciate that it's a separate book and\n\n242\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.190\nI appreciate they call it a stage, but\n\n243\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.560\nit's not really linear because CSI\nis in play all the time, right?\n\n244\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.720\nCSI, continued service improvement, can\nbe brought to improve service strategy,\n\n245\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.830\nservice design, service transition,\nand service operations.\n\n246\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.820\nIn fact CSI can be brought\nto bare to improve CSI.\n\n247\n00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:01.110\nSo it's always intended to be active as a\nway of working, a cultural frame work for\n\n248\n00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.050\nwhich you measure and continually approve\nyour various processes and services.\n\n249\n00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.045\nSo that's it in this context,\n\n250\n00:13:08.045 --> 00:13:12.870\nservice design is where we're gonna spend\na lot of time with these four processes.\n\n251\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.590\nA fifth process called demand management,\nhappens to come from service strategy.\n\n252\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.380\nAnd as it relates to\nthese warranty processes,\n\n253\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.748\nwe'll also discuss demand management.\n\n254\n00:13:20.748 --> 00:13:27.540\nSo, why bother,\nwhy bother with service design?\n\n255\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.740\n&gt;&gt; Because it's fun [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n256\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.910\n&gt;&gt; Obviously there's a purpose and\n\n257\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.370\nmaking sure everything goes in its\nproper order and has its proper context.\n\n258\n00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.100\nWith all the checks and balances in\nplay it's going to help make sure that\n\n259\n00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.350\nwhat you are trying to do\nis actually successful.\n\n260\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.043\n&gt;&gt; Does it slow things down?\n\n261\n00:13:42.043 --> 00:13:44.086\n&gt;&gt; It probably can, yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:46.250\n&gt;&gt; You need to be good at this.\n\n263\n00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.600\nIf your sloppy at service design,\nyou'll pay for it in longer project times,\n\n264\n00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.620\nmaybe, so you won't be on time on budget\nbecause you're not very good at it.\n\n265\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.030\nOr if you're really good at it.\n\n266\n00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.540\nI know I worked in organizations who\nwere very good at delivering services or\n\n267\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.810\nsolutions on time and on budget,\nbut not ready for primetime,\n\n268\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.440\nand that's also bad, right?\n\n269\n00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.380\nCuz it's not quite fully baked.\n\n270\n00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.120\nYou didn't think about these six different\nfactors and you launched into operations.\n\n271\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.860\nAnd now we gotta put out fires, right.\n\n272\n00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.415\n&gt;&gt; They say done is better than perfect.\n\n273\n00:14:16.415 --> 00:14:18.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I understand.\n\n274\n00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, right it's probably\nthe philosophy behind that.\n\n275\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.550\n&gt;&gt; It is right.\n\n276\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.870\nAt some point you're going to cut bait and\nget on with that.\n\n277\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.600\nI appreciate that.\n\n278\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.240\nDone is better than perfect.\n\n279\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.580\nI totally get that but\nservice design anticipates that if you\n\n280\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.670\nhave to fix things in operations, you're\nactually gonna spend more money there than\n\n281\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.850\ndoing the due diligence earlier on in the\nlifecycle stage, called service design.\n\n282\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.930\nDoing it early, plenty of studies suggest\nthat if you get it closer to perfect\n\n283\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.800\nearlier than operations,\nyou'll end up saving money doing so.\n\n284\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.070\nSo it's just the due diligence for this.\n\n285\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.350\nSo get good at it.\n\n286\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.699\nCome up with repeatable processes.\n\n287\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.560\nAnd so you're not re-inventing the wheel,\nright?\n\n288\n00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.230\nHone in on this stage\nas one that's important\n\n289\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.020\nnot one that we just get\ngood at putting fires.\n\n290\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.890\nAnd sometimes I mean I certainly worked\nin or I've been around organizations,\n\n291\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.370\nI'm worked in organizations where\nthe fire fighters were heroes, right?\n\n292\n00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.220\nLook how good we good we did\nputting out all these fires but\n\n293\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.570\nwouldn't it be more heroic\nif the fires never started?\n\n294\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.390\nIt would be keep what service designers\nfight about, keep the fires from starting.\n\n295\n00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.730\nSo the process that's kind of\nthe mother hen in service design,\n\n296\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.800\nyou may recall from foundation,\nit's called design coordination.\n\n297\n00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.300\nIt is the process at\nthe top of service design.\n\n298\n00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.406\nIt makes sure that all the other processes\nwithin the service design are done well,\n\n299\n00:15:38.406 --> 00:15:45.060\nare done on time, are done on budget,\nare rightly coordinated, prioritized,\n\n300\n00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.670\nthat any risk related to design\nare mitigated or at least identified.\n\n301\n00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.780\nRight.\n\n302\n00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.050\nDesign coordination has a very solid\nhandshake with another discipline called\n\n303\n00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.260\nproject management.\n\n304\n00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.610\nIf you have some project management\ncredentials in your pocket, you will\n\n305\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:06.250\nrecognize a lot of project management\nconcepts in design coordination.\n\n306\n00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.830\nCoordination, risk of identification,\nbudget management,\n\n307\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.188\ntime management,\nmilestone management, etc.\n\n308\n00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:17.310\nSo design coordination is that\nprocess within service design\n\n309\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.540\nthat makes sure other things get\ndone well on time and on budget.\n\n310\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.450\nIncluding the four processes we're talking\nabout that follow in service design.\n\n311\n00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.510\nAvailability, capacity,\ncontinuity, and security.\n\n312\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.530\nAll right.\n\n313\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:32.250\nSo you'll see here,\n\n314\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.610\ndesign coordination doesn't operate\njust within service design.\n\n315\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.340\nIt has points of coordination with other\nprocesses that exist in other stages.\n\n316\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.780\nCertainly, service design is\na stage these interact with\n\n317\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.040\nservice transition is a stage.\n\n318\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.440\nThere needs to be some\nsynergies between those two.\n\n319\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.710\nService design also needs to\ninteract with service strategy.\n\n320\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.970\nSo as you look at this,\nI wanna read the whole list to you.\n\n321\n00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.030\nAs you read this bulleted items here,\nyou'll find that some of them exist in\n\n322\n00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.510\nservice strategy, some of them\nfit within service transition.\n\n323\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.000\nRight.\nJust as a example,\n\n324\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.010\nservice portfolio happens\nto be in strategy.\n\n325\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.140\nChange management happens\nto be in transition.\n\n326\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.960\nFinancial management, strategy.\n\n327\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.860\nBRM, strategy.\n\n328\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.900\nTransition planning and support,\nthat's it's sister hand, if you will.\n\n329\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.900\nIf design coordination mother hand of\nservice design, transition planning and\n\n330\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.460\nsupport is the mother hand for\nservice transition.\n\n331\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.970\nSo a good handshake there, etc.\n\n332\n00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.290\nAs you go down through this list\nyou'll see a lot of interaction\n\n333\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.533\nbetween service strategy,\nservice transition interacting\n\n334\n00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:39.680\nwith service design across\nthis process interfaces.\n\n335\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.470\nAs we look at the different processes and\n\n336\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.830\nyou'll see three of the ones are in scope\nall four of them here, availability,\n\n337\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.070\ncapacity, continuity and\nsecurity management.\n\n338\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.470\nThose four processes happen to be\nvery specifically addressed by PPO.\n\n339\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.130\nAs we review the details of these,\n\n340\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.610\nwe'll be reviewing how these processes\ninteract across the lifecycle as well.\n\n341\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.630\nWhile they're born in service design,\n\n342\n00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.990\nall these processes have\na play in other stages.\n\n343\n00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.490\nOkay.\n\n344\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:15.530\nSo, that completes our overall contextual\nview of PPO as relates to service design.\n\n345\n00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.560\nI want to remind you that there is some\nself-study, there's an exercise called\n\n346\n00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.750\nplanning, protection, and\noptimization generic role activities.\n\n347\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.250\nIt's called that In the first episode\nthere is a download link there,\n\n348\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.410\nin show files,\nthat I asked you to zip out.\n\n349\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.260\nUnzip that file,\nyou'll find this particular exercise.\n\n350\n00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.780\nI encourage you to do\nthe exercises on your own.\n\n351\n00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.270\nCome to the forum to discuss any issues\nyou might have, learn there, and\n\n352\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.980\nalso pick up some exam practice\nfrom those downloads as well.\n\n353\n00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.320\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff, Terry.\n\n354\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.210\nThis is a very informative, very well put.\n\n355\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.760\nAnd that reminds of what we need to focus\nin on when it comes to design strategy.\n\n356\n00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.650\nAll that other great stuff.\n\n357\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.970\nWith that being said, it looks like we've\ncome to the end of yet another episode.\n\n358\n00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.120\nHopefully, you have gotten\na lot out of this one.\n\n359\n00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.570\nWe try very hard to make\nsure that that is the case.\n\n360\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.640\nAnd you will come back for more.\n\n361\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.470\nBecause there will be more.\n\n362\n00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.620\nBut for\nthis episode I think we're done for today.\n\n363\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.600\nThanks for watching, I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowrie for IT Pro TV.\n\n364\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.583\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n365\n00:19:15.583 -->

00:00:17.105\nAnd welcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.131\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n9\n00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:23.670\nwe are continuing on with\nmore on our ITIL PPO series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.220\nJoining us in the studio yet\nagain our good friend Mr Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.873\nTerry welcome back man, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:32.617\n&gt;&gt; Doing great happy to be here and as\nDaniel said we're gonna continue on with\n\n13\n00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:36.510\nlearning about protection,\nplanning and optimization.\n\n14\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.645\nPlanning, protection and\noptimazation to get-\n\n15\n00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:38.381\n&gt;&gt; You gotta get the Ps\n\n16\n00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:39.164\nin the right order.\n\n17\n00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.906\n&gt;&gt; Yeah two Ps and an Planning,\nProtection and Optimization PPO.\n\n18\n00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:48.741\nAnd we're now beginning our dive into\nthe processes that are in play here.\n\n19\n00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.334\nStarting with capacity management.\n\n20\n00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:54.171\nAgain, we have some other ones to follow\nincluding availability, continuity,\n\n21\n00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.650\nsecurity as well as one\non demand management.\n\n22\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.150\nBut first with capacity management,\n\n23\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.720\nas you look at the slide deck here you\nwill see that over arching the goal\n\n24\n00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.340\nof capacity management is to be the go to\nplace for all things related to capacity.\n\n25\n00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.752\nReally what it boils down to\ncan read these bullets to you,\n\n26\n00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:11.844\nbut it all adds up to that.\n\n27\n00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:15.855\nCapacity management is a process\nthat intends to oversee\n\n28\n00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:19.540\nthe process of appropriate planning for\ncapacity.\n\n29\n00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.424\nSo, the primary output of capacity\nmanagement is indeed a capacity plan.\n\n30\n00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:27.000\nA document says, here's how we do this.\n\n31\n00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640\nHere's how we're gonna\napproach this service.\n\n32\n00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.820\nThis is the questions we ask,\nthe risk we mitigated.\n\n33\n00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.880\nHere is the plan for this.\n\n34\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.278\nNow capacity management if far reaching,\nbut just as a simple example.\n\n35\n00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:40.470\nAre you gonna have to operate 24/7 for\n\n36\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.625\n5000 users and\nhave availability all the time for those?\n\n37\n00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.985\nIs it 24/7 seven?\n\n38\n00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:47.365\nHow many users do you have?\n\n39\n00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:49.875\nDo you have the appropriate\narchitecture in place for it?\n\n40\n00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:53.917\nWhat are your constraints for capacity\nplan, and must it be a web application?\n\n41\n00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:55.635\nCan it be client server?\n\n42\n00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:58.430\nCan it be mainframe dummy terminal?\n\n43\n00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.194\nWhatever the case may be architecturally\nspeaking you're gonna be operating\n\n44\n00:02:03.194 --> 00:02:08.103\nwith those architectural constraints to\ncome up with an appropriate plan to meet\n\n45\n00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.135\nthe expected needs of capacity.\n\n46\n00:02:10.135 --> 00:02:13.720\nSo we are going to be talking about\nperformance and capacity here.\n\n47\n00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.977\nDo you have enough disk space, do you have\nmemory enough server CPU power, right.\n\n48\n00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:22.019\nSo it goes beyond the technology though,\nit does go beyond the technology.\n\n49\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.490\nCertainly component\ncapacity is in play here.\n\n50\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.507\nAgain, sever, disk space, CP utilization,\nnetwork bandwidth availability, etc.\n\n51\n00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:38.020\nSo those technical aspects are colalest\nin something called component capacity.\n\n52\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.712\nAnd yes,\ncapacity management has that in play.\n\n53\n00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:43.460\nBut service capacity is also in play.\n\n54\n00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.450\nAnd this is actually maybe getting\ncloser to human interactions.\n\n55\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.050\nDo you have enough people at the service\ndesk to answer the phone because you're\n\n56\n00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.150\ninviting 5,000 more users\nto use a brand new service?\n\n57\n00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.911\nDo you have sufficient capacity at\nthe service desk in terms of people?\n\n58\n00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:58.783\nEnough phone lines to handle that.\n\n59\n00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:02.174\nAnd what if your service\nrequires the use of headsets?\n\n60\n00:03:02.174 --> 00:03:06.613\nDo you have a way to revision headsets\nappropriately to the users that\n\n61\n00:03:06.613 --> 00:03:08.690\nare asking those things right?\n\n62\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.990\nOr other devices besides headsets.\n\n63\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.480\nSo the service capacity\ngoes beyond technology and\n\n64\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.660\nconsiders the capacity of your processes,\nyour material provisions, and people.\n\n65\n00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.307\nIt even goes beyond what you\nare in directly control of.\n\n66\n00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:29.890\nService capacity components capacity\nare in your sphere of control.\n\n67\n00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.460\nBut business capacity is also\na concern of capacity management.\n\n68\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.970\nDoes the business have the capacity\nto take on what you're offering?\n\n69\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.620\nI give you an example of that one.\n\n70\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.290\nIt happened to play out\non exam at some point.\n\n71\n00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.930\nIt might have been a practice exam,\nas I recall, might have been a real exam.\n\n72\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.910\nBut the nature of the scenario was that\nthis service has been successfully\n\n73\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.800\nlaunched in several hospitals,\nit's failing in this one.\n\n74\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.730\nSo clearly, since it's been successful in\nso many places, they've done it before.\n\n75\n00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.916\nThey know it works,\nwhy is it failing here?\n\n76\n00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.742\n&gt;&gt; So\nthe implementation isn't broke per say,\n\n77\n00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:06.080\nbecause they've successfully\ndone it before.\n\n78\n00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.919\nNow we have to figure out\nWhere's the monkey wrench?\n\n79\n00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.475\n&gt;&gt; Exactly where's the monkey wrench.\n\n80\n00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:10.801\nAnd in this particular case,\n\n81\n00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:13.723\nwho are you gonna invite to\nthe meeting to trouble shoot it right?\n\n82\n00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:18.382\nSo the scenario plays out in such\na way that clearly states that one of\n\n83\n00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:22.590\nthe failings of this delivery\nof service in operation.\n\n84\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.550\nWas that only two nurses\nknew how to use the new\n\n85\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.600\nsoftware that was associated\nwith the service right?\n\n86\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.470\nAnd yet so the other nurses that\ndidn't know how to use it were going\n\n87\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.970\nback to the old paper\nbased way of doing things.\n\n88\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.630\nSo you had two data sources.\n\n89\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.820\nThere was latency between the paper and\nthe software.\n\n90\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.458\nAnd the service was failing.\n\n91\n00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:44.390\nIt ultimately came down\nto business capacity.\n\n92\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.410\nWas the business.\n\n93\n00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.840\nDid the business have\nthe appropriate resources and\n\n94\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.540\ncapabilities to be able to manage or\nto be able to utilize this service?\n\n95\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.100\nNow you could say,\nwhat does that have to do with IT?\n\n96\n00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.229\nThat's the business' fault, if they\ndidn't get the training or whatever.\n\n97\n00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.390\nI appreciate that particular argument.\n\n98\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.000\nYes indeed, it's not necessarily in\nyour sphere of control whether or\n\n99\n00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.680\nnot these nurses got\nthe appropriate training or not.\n\n100\n00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.030\nBut, it's your services failing.\n\n101\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.799\nSo, if you don't anticipate that need,\nthat capacity need,\n\n102\n00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:18.445\nthat you're gonna have to have x number of\nnurses trained in this particular software\n\n103\n00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:20.525\nbefore this service can be utilized.\n\n104\n00:05:20.525 --> 00:05:23.490\nIf you don't ask the question,\nyou're certainly not gonna get the answer.\n\n105\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.280\nSo capacity planning is\nasking that kinda question.\n\n106\n00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.350\nDo our components line up?\n\n107\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.200\nDoes our service line up?\n\n108\n00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.637\nAnd does the business line up\nfrom a capacity standpoint?\n\n109\n00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:41.410\nSo therefore, it's also considering short\nterm, long term, performance gains, etc.\n\n110\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.251\nPlanning for the future is part of\nplanning for capacity management as well.\n\n111\n00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:50.915\nKnowing that you have architectural\ndesigns that can fit certain\n\n112\n00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:52.620\ncapacity guidelines.\n\n113\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.187\nLike maybe you have some capacity plans\nfor small implementations of only a few\n\n114\n00:05:57.187 --> 00:06:00.438\nhundred users and\nyou have different capacity plans for\n\n115\n00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:04.951\nthose kinds of architectures that\nare required for larger numbers of users.\n\n116\n00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:06.282\nIs it web-based?\n\n117\n00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.560\nIs it Client-Server?\n\n118\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.023\nUnderstanding those architectural\nconstraints can help guide you through\n\n119\n00:06:11.023 --> 00:06:12.979\nyour capacity planning as well all right.\n\n120\n00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.240\nAnd then on-going, tuning.\n\n121\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.387\nSo as you've launched the good plan,\nit seems to be working,\n\n122\n00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:20.392\ncan you tune the capacity a little bit?\n\n123\n00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:22.795\nCan you somehow manage in an instrument,\n\n124\n00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:25.961\ndo some instrumentation to\nunderstand the capacity?\n\n125\n00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:29.130\nSo can you add more disk space as needed?\n\n126\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.690\nIs that modular enough that you can\njust add more disk space in the future,\n\n127\n00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.820\nas an example?\n\n128\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.080\nDo you have an on-going training program\nto handle new nursing coming in.\n\n129\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.955\nSo getting the tuning right at\nthe beginning is certainly important.\n\n130\n00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:45.748\nBut staying in play for your capacity plan\nso that you can understand the capacity\n\n131\n00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:50.346\nneeds as they emerge and evolve is also\nwithin scope of capacity management.\n\n132\n00:06:50.346 --> 00:06:52.210\nSo not a trivial matter.\n\n133\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.950\nAnd again, as with the other processes,\nthe reason why you focus on the definition\n\n134\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.080\nfo the process is so\nthat you get good at it.\n\n135\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.890\nAnd that you can repeat it and you're\nnot reinventing the wheel every time.\n\n136\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.197\nAnd therefore maybe stubbing your toe on\nlack of capacity and having downtime and\n\n137\n00:07:05.197 --> 00:07:06.655\nhaving upset customers and\n\n138\n00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:11.040\nnot having enough headsets when the\ncustomers need and whatever it might be.\n\n139\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.740\n&gt;&gt; You'd be surprised that how\nmany companies or organizations\n\n140\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.650\ndo stub their toe on things that they\nshould be seeing cuz they've done it.\n\n141\n00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.430\nA million times you're like we used to\nsay this isn't our first rodeo right?\n\n142\n00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.760\nWe've done this before why are we\nstill having trouble with x, y,\n\n143\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.740\nor z, but it's just because they\ncan't see the forest for the trees.\n\n144\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.520\nThey just say well I'm just gonna\nfollow procedure and continue to do it.\n\n145\n00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.130\nEven though we have\na failure at one point.\n\n146\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.250\n&gt;&gt; Great example Daniel.\n\n147\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.307\nAnd indeed what I tell as\na whole is trying to do.\n\n148\n00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:43.050\nIs give you a framework so\nthat you don't continually stub your toe.\n\n149\n00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.358\nThat you get in front of things,\nnot chase them.\n\n150\n00:07:45.358 --> 00:07:48.023\nAnd that you end up getting good at\nthose things you are in front of so\n\n151\n00:07:48.023 --> 00:07:51.070\nyou don 't have to reinvent the wheel\nif you do that cost effectively.\n\n152\n00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.592\nCuz there is necessary some pain and\neffort in building these processes.\n\n153\n00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:57.782\nI totally understand that,\nthat can be painful.\n\n154\n00:07:57.782 --> 00:08:01.383\nAs Daniel suggested in earlier episodes,\ndone is better than perfect.\n\n155\n00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:05.195\nI understand that too, and that can be\n[INAUDIBLE] Sometimes you just have to cut\n\n156\n00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:09.140\nbait and get on with it, move forward,\nyou can't solve everything.\n\n157\n00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.610\nBut, the more you solve, the earlier you\nsolve it, the more successful you'll be,\n\n158\n00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.140\nis basically the sermon\nthat iTool is preaching.\n\n159\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.290\nSo again, short, medium, and long term\nfocus, so that there are no surprises.\n\n160\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.400\nComing into the capacity planning to ask,\n\n161\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.980\ndoes capacity management ask you\nto do is to definitely have an ear\n\n162\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.510\nto the ground understanding\nwhat's coming down the track.\n\n163\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.840\nAs well as understanding what you're\ngonna have to deliver right away,\n\n164\n00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.410\nas opposed to the midterm.\n\n165\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.530\nHow can you tweak,\nhow you can you tune, etc.\n\n166\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.700\nI think we've already intoned\nwhy you might wanna do this.\n\n167\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.990\nWhat's the value of capacity\nmanagement to the business?\n\n168\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.710\nTest takers, this could be important.\n\n169\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.280\nAs you take an exam, a classic example\nof a question a test maker might ask\n\n170\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.830\nis you are proposing, implementing\na capacity management process,\n\n171\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.220\nbut the CIO is not convinced that\nit's worth the investment, right?\n\n172\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.050\nThe CIO wants to know why do I\ncare about capacity management?\n\n173\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.630\nWhat's it gonna mean to the business?\n\n174\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.160\nIf you can sell the idea of\nthe business getting more satisfied,\n\n175\n00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.450\ngetting more widget sold,\nfinding more oil,\n\n176\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:26.210\nsolving more trial cases on time or\nwhatever the business objectives might be.\n\n177\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.550\nIf you can convert capacity\nmanagement goals to business goals,\n\n178\n00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.890\nin a direct line, you're gonna get more of\nan ear of the CIO, and more importantly of\n\n179\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.760\nthe people that the CIO is also\nanswering to the business executives.\n\n180\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.040\nThe CEOs, the VP of marketing, or the VP\nof all discovery, whatever it might be.\n\n181\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.270\nSo if you understand how capacity\nmanagement feeds into those things, and\n\n182\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.120\nagain we've already kind\nof talked about it.\n\n183\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.800\nDown time is bad.\n\n184\n00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.870\nWhen there's downtime,\nyou could lose not only reputation but\n\n185\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.310\nyou could lose productivity\non the business side.\n\n186\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.920\nSo IT loses reputation.\n\n187\n00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.620\nThe customer maybe actually lose money or\nrisk someone's safety,\n\n188\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.330\nor cause a regulatory failure and\n\n189\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.820\ntherefore you get an audit finding and\nyou get a fine right?\n\n190\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.290\nThere's all kinds of things where\nunavailable services can result in\n\n191\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.370\nbusiness failure and of course you don't\nwant to be the one that's responsible for\n\n192\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.180\nbusiness failure right?\n\n193\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.530\nSo that also plays to the point about\nbuilding it to the right size right?\n\n194\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.030\nYou can overbuild things.\n\n195\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.750\nYou can build something\nthat's just humongous.\n\n196\n00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:38.800\nIn very expensive for a low lying business\ncredit accounting was that important.\n\n197\n00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.720\nSo again making sure you're working on\nthe right things at the right time and\n\n198\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.490\nbuilding the right size for capacity\nis what capacity planning is about.\n\n199\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.240\nConnecting the dots between capacity\nmanagement and business outcomes\n\n200\n00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.910\ncould also be definitely be something\nyou are asked to do on an exam.\n\n201\n00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:00.030\nSo please be careful or please be\ncognizant as you read about these\n\n202\n00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.020\nprocesses that you understand\nwhy the business even cares.\n\n203\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.830\nIt's not doing this for\nIT's sake or just because we can.\n\n204\n00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.166\nWe're doing it because we're trying to\nmove the needle in a positive direction\n\n205\n00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:11.920\nfor the customers, or for the business.\n\n206\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.980\nIndeed is a balancing act,\nbuilding it to the right size.\n\n207\n00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.820\nCost against resources,\nsupply against demand.\n\n208\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.629\nIt's certainly possible\nto overbuild something.\n\n209\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.930\nFor something the business doesn't care so\nmuch about.\n\n210\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.070\nIt’s also on the other side of the coin\npossible to under build something.\n\n211\n00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.250\nBuild it with low capacity only to find\nthat the business really loves it.\n\n212\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.300\nI'll give you an example\nof a service that we built.\n\n213\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.850\nThat was pretty systemically,\n\n214\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.310\nI should say by the system itself,\nit had a lot of high capacity.\n\n215\n00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.260\nWe put together a learning management\nsystem and wrapped a service around it.\n\n216\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.279\nAnd the service we wrapped around it was\nwe could help you manage your training.\n\n217\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.350\nAnd for\nthat scope we built sufficient capacity.\n\n218\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:02.520\nOne of the value statements of this new\nlearning management system was that\n\n219\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:07.970\nthe business could convert PowerPoint\npresentations into e-learning,\n\n220\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:08.830\nand save some money.\n\n221\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.790\nThey wouldn't have to send\npeople to classes, or\n\n222\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.070\nget someone out of their job, day job,\nto present and be an instructor.\n\n223\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.440\nBasically, like ITProTV,\nprovides an e-learning venue here so\n\n224\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.500\nyou can stream learning and\ntake it on demand,\n\n225\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.690\ninstead of waiting for the next class to\nshow up and physically have to go there.\n\n226\n00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.140\nSo we were promising that our learning\nmanagement system could deliver\n\n227\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.480\nsuch e-learning.\n\n228\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.680\nThat was one of the value propositions\nwe had for introducing the learning\n\n229\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.090\nmanagement service, and certainly this\nsystem had the capacity to do that.\n\n230\n00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.140\nThere was no question about that.\n\n231\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.950\nHowever, what we failed to accommodate was\nthe service capacity, we had component\n\n232\n00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.180\ncapacity well designed, but service\ncapacity wasn't so good because all of\n\n233\n00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.500\na sudden we started getting calls, can you\nconvert this PowerPoint to e-learning?\n\n234\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.780\nAnd we said yeah, give me a minute.\n\n235\n00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.250\nAnd we weren't ready for that question,\nat least in terms of scope and scale.\n\n236\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.550\nWe weren't ready for that.\n\n237\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.180\nAnd what happened was\nthe phone kept ringing.\n\n238\n00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.180\nSo we had different business units all\nover the globe it's a global organization,\n\n239\n00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.580\nasking can you do this for us.\n\n240\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.840\nAnd our initial answer was no we can't.\n\n241\n00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.980\nBecause we didn't anticipate the capacity.\n\n242\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.490\nAnd that service capacity that\nwasn't component capacity.\n\n243\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.870\nSo we didn't ask all the questions\nin our capacity plan about\n\n244\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.450\nhow this service would become valuable.\n\n245\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.820\nNow we rebounded.\n\n246\n00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.050\nWe determined that there was a demand,\nwe certainly figured that out.\n\n247\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:33.400\nWe also had some extra funds\nfrom a jar that says yes,\n\n248\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.220\nwe've got some ongoing\noperational expenses so\n\n249\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.150\nwe didn't have to go back to strategists\nnecessarily for some more funding.\n\n250\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.120\nAnd we had a little bit of piecemeal\nfunding that we could put together and\n\n251\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.090\nwe built a little team of five people that\ncould convert PowerPoints to E-learning.\n\n252\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.590\nAnd we tried to manage the demand\nthat way, effectively, and\n\n253\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.330\nit was a stopgap measure.\n\n254\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.020\nAgain, putting out fires with stopgap\nmeasures is not a happy customer,\n\n255\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.350\ndoes not a happy maker make always.\n\n256\n00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.140\nAlso it wasn't happy for us either.\n\n257\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.710\nWe were treading water for months and\nmonths trying to stay on top of this.\n\n258\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.570\nNot efficient, very inefficient,\npotentially very costly.\n\n259\n00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:15.365\nAnd we had to have a better\nway of going about it.\n\n260\n00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:19.085\nSo we had to regroup our capacity plan,\nand come up with a more appropriate,\n\n261\n00:14:19.085 --> 00:14:20.475\nfully baked service.\n\n262\n00:14:20.475 --> 00:14:23.305\n&gt;&gt; So that's a really good example\nof when done was not better\n\n263\n00:14:23.305 --> 00:14:24.425\nthan perfect at that time, right.\n\n264\n00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:26.035\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Because it just created so\n\n265\n00:14:26.035 --> 00:14:31.295\nmuch more work, and made you, not look\ngreat, maybe you putting out the fires,\n\n266\n00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:34.147\nyou were still a hero there,\nBut man, you're just like,\n\n267\n00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:38.798\nlike you said, treading water, you just\nhad your nose above the surface going man,\n\n268\n00:14:38.798 --> 00:14:41.896\nI hope we can continue this rate,\ncuz it's killing us.\n\n269\n00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:45.972\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, and it's not that\nwe didn't anticipate, it was asked.\n\n270\n00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:50.555\nWe asked early on who's gonna do that,\nand IT said well, it's not our business.\n\n271\n00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:53.686\nWe were basically saying,\nit's your business, right?\n\n272\n00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:58.573\nAnd that's kinda rude of an IT service\nprovider says Here, you figure it out,\n\n273\n00:14:58.573 --> 00:14:59.430\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.770\nThat's also inefficient.\n\n275\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.070\nHaving a manufacturing\nbusiness unit figure out\n\n276\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.955\nPowerPoint conversions is probably not the\nmost efficient way to do it, especially if\n\n277\n00:15:07.955 --> 00:15:10.850\nR&amp;D has to figure it out, the sales\norganization has to figure it out.\n\n278\n00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.780\nIt would have been much better\nIf IT figured that out and\n\n279\n00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.170\neven offered it as a service.\n\n280\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.630\nWe could have funded it properly,\nbuilt the appropriate capacity and\n\n281\n00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.870\nagain we're talking service\ncapacity in this case.\n\n282\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.540\nNot even technology capacity.\n\n283\n00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.870\nSo you get some nuance to what capacity\nmanagement really is about and\n\n284\n00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.390\nthe appropriate planning that needs to\nbe put in place with that kinda example.\n\n285\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.550\nAnd again, getting the right balance.\n\n286\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.400\nWhy do you wanna pay for it?\n\n287\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.550\nDo you wanna pay for\n\n288\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.660\na standing team of 20 people to\nhand out PowerPoints I don't know.\n\n289\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.640\nIt depends, how much is demand there,\nwhat does the customer wanna pay?\n\n290\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.560\n&gt;&gt; Plus there's a lot of\npressure there to get it, right,\n\n291\n00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.660\nsomebody's just like,\nI need to do this learning now.\n\n292\n00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.460\nI need this PowerPoint converted now,\n\n293\n00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.685\nnot yesterday, whereas before if you\nwould have said, hey you know what,\n\n294\n00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.065\npeople want to be giving us PowerPoints to\nconvert or PDFs to convert or whatever.\n\n295\n00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:55.053\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's figure out a system that does\n\n296\n00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:58.274\nthat and then deliver it and\nnow there's no pressure, right?\n\n297\n00:15:58.274 --> 00:16:01.262\nThere was a lot less pressure,\nless likely to make mistakes.\n\n298\n00:16:01.262 --> 00:16:02.452\nThings of that nature.\n\n299\n00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:03.827\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, excellent examples.\n\n300\n00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:06.860\nAnd notice that there's going to be\ninterface here with the customer.\n\n301\n00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.880\nYou're not just defining this on your own.\n\n302\n00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.990\nOperationally speaking\nthat's vitally important.\n\n303\n00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.204\nDon't exclude the customer.\n\n304\n00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:17.076\nDon't assume you know what's best or don't\nsay we're not going to answer that right\n\n305\n00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:21.376\nnow, cuz we'll need another $20,000 and we\nalready, went to the till too many times,\n\n306\n00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.840\ncuz our project was overrun or whatever.\n\n307\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.400\nThe politics of economics and\n\n308\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.520\norganization are definitely can\nplay into such considerations.\n\n309\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.210\nBut you end up paying for it anyway.\n\n310\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.460\nAnd you end up paying for\nit perhaps inefficiently.\n\n311\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.300\nAnd that's is of course what\nwe're trying to forestall, okay.\n\n312\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.700\nSo getting the right balance,\nmaking sure you balance it out as you go.\n\n313\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.360\nSo to do this,\nyou need to monitor a few things.\n\n314\n00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.700\nIn this case submission monitor\nthe patterns of business activity.\n\n315\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.290\nYou'll often see this abbreviated PBA.\n\n316\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:54.350\nPatterns of business activity as\nthe calendar suggests you'll see here.\n\n317\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.190\nThat red letter dates on this particular\ncalendar happen to be mid-month,\n\n318\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.140\n16th and\n17th of March it happens to show up.\n\n319\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.255\nBeware of the ides of March.\n\n320\n00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:08.010\n[LAUGH] But\nit's example of business activities,\n\n321\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.380\nmaybe there's month end reporting.\n\n322\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.760\nMaybe there is weekly,\nactivities or deadlines.\n\n323\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.940\nOr maybe things are more cyclical like a,\nif you have an IT service that helps\n\n324\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.690\nmanagers put in employee performance\nreports and you got an IT system and\n\n325\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.640\nservice that manages that, well,\nit tends to be heavier in the last,\n\n326\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.270\nquarter of the year and\nthe first quarter of the year,\n\n327\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.660\nbecause that's when annual reports\nget a lot of churn, right?\n\n328\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.640\nThey're not so busy in March, they\nare not so busy necessarily in June, but\n\n329\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.700\nthey get really busy.\n\n330\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.600\nI'll give you a very egregious example\nof patterns of business activity,\n\n331\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.260\nhow hard they could be to manage.\n\n332\n00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.260\nI manage an IT service\nthat deals with election,\n\n333\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.530\nour voter registration, and balance.\n\n334\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.410\nIt gets really busy every,\nnear the second November of every year,\n\n335\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.760\nevery other year kind of thing, right?\n\n336\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.424\n&gt;&gt; They do see enough taken activity.\n\n337\n00:18:01.424 --> 00:18:03.154\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Right, right exactly.\n\n338\n00:18:03.154 --> 00:18:09.400\nSo dealing with those kind of pattern,\nmaybe you have seasonal sales.\n\n339\n00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.120\nA greeting card company probably\ngets busier a towards Christmas,\n\n340\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.260\nthen it does in the middle of August,\nexamples.\n\n341\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.440\nSo understanding these\npatterns of business activity,\n\n342\n00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.165\nwhich by the way is a precursor.\n\n343\n00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:24.240\nThis an activity the determination\nof PBAs is something that\n\n344\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.840\ndemand management focuses on a lot, which\nwe'll talk about a little bit later on.\n\n345\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.820\nAnd that's really doing it,\ncurrent and future demands.\n\n346\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.790\nThere is definitely a high amount\nof interaction between capacity and\n\n347\n00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:35.770\ndemand management.\n\n348\n00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.063\nKnowing what demand is going to be is\ngoing to influence your capacity plan.\n\n349\n00:18:40.063 --> 00:18:42.931\nAll right, all right, again,\nthere's also this optimization,\n\n350\n00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.960\nbuild it to the right size,\nright, all right.\n\n351\n00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.470\nSo you see some proactive activities and\n\n352\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.910\nreactive activities related\nto capacity management.\n\n353\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.420\nProactive is generally better, but\n\n354\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.790\nthere's also reactive things you do and\nare gonna have to do.\n\n355\n00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.760\nThe capacity management plan should\ntry to predict the proactive and\n\n356\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.990\nreactive nature of the plan itself.\n\n357\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.680\nSo making sure you have adequate questions\nand like I said in the learning management\n\n358\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.580\nservice that we offer, we didn't\nadequately ask the question what if\n\n359\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.034\nthe business asked for\na bunch of PowerPoint conversions, right?\n\n360\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:18.960\nCould we ask that now?\n\n361\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.430\nWell, if we said that we are not going\nto do it, well, that's a risk, so\n\n362\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.590\nat least advertise it,\nunderstand we have a risk,\n\n363\n00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.520\nhow we are going to mitigate,\nmake sure the business knows.\n\n364\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.610\nInstead we kind of stumbled.\n\n365\n00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.620\nSo that's what I am\ntrying to get at there.\n\n366\n00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.420\nTrying to understand trend analysis for\nany given service.\n\n367\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.090\nThis can be done.\n\n368\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.560\nWe are talking about component\narchitectures, technology architectures.\n\n369\n00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.670\nThere is some break even point when\nyou talk about web applications\n\n370\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.000\nthat can be generally\ndiscerned based on trends.\n\n371\n00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.030\nWhen does the web server\ntend to slow down, right?\n\n372\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.095\nWhat type of activities make it slow down?\n\n373\n00:19:54.095 --> 00:19:56.010\nIs it the number of users?\n\n374\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.490\nIs it the time of day?\n\n375\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.800\nIs it concurrent activity by\nthe other company or by, I'm sorry,\n\n376\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.150\nby the other division?\n\n377\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.160\nWhat sort of things?\n\n378\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:08.090\nGive you an example of that,\nrelated to patterns of business activity.\n\n379\n00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.440\nThat's proactive, looking at\n\n380\n00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.910\nhow the system might be used by what kind\nof people is a proactive activity, right?\n\n381\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.920\nLet's take a look at this slide again,\nlook at some reactive activities, right?\n\n382\n00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.960\nMeasuring how things are being used,\nmonitoring.\n\n383\n00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.020\nThat's looking after the fact.\n\n384\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.910\nHow are we doing here?\n\n385\n00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.529\nDisk utilization, CP utilization,\nright, the number of requests for\n\n386\n00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:33.550\nPowerPoint presentation conversions.\n\n387\n00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.770\nAgain, it's not always components,\nit also could be service capacity.\n\n388\n00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.540\nHow was the training going for\nthe business?\n\n389\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.920\nNumber of percentage of nurses that\nhave had the appropriate training.\n\n390\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.600\nThat's another measurement, right?\n\n391\n00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.010\nA critical success factor perhaps\ncould be training activities for\n\n392\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.080\nthe business as an example.\n\n393\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.505\nSo again not component, also related\nto service, also related to business.\n\n394\n00:20:57.505 --> 00:21:02.185\nAnd there's ways to respond and react to\ncertain trends that could be going on.\n\n395\n00:21:02.185 --> 00:21:06.825\n&gt;&gt; This is one of the many benefits of\nusing cloud services in IT is we can\n\n396\n00:21:06.825 --> 00:21:11.665\nreact to, say we have an online sell,\nwe have an online seller of some sort.\n\n397\n00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:15.860\nWe see it up to, all the time, but\nhe loves our products and increase.\n\n398\n00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.830\nOr it's Christmas time.\n\n399\n00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.710\nWhat happens, increase in business,\nwe're selling things.\n\n400\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.590\nAnd you can instantaneously monitor it and\nscale up or\n\n401\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.370\nscale out your servers so\nthey can handle your new capacity.\n\n402\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.910\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthe advent of cloud computing and\n\n403\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.020\nelastic capacity planning Is\ndefinitely transformation.\n\n404\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.034\nConsider that same example I mentioned\na while ago with the election.\n\n405\n00:21:38.034 --> 00:21:45.250\nVoter registration and\nballot voting day, activities.\n\n406\n00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.747\nConsulted with the commonwealth of\nVirginia as a central IT organization in\n\n407\n00:21:49.747 --> 00:21:51.160\nthe state of Virginia.\n\n408\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.070\nThey provided the election technology,\nthe election service, if you will.\n\n409\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.290\nVoter registration, for\nall the different counties, so\n\n410\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:02.160\nthe counties were the customers of this\ncentralized service in itool terms.\n\n411\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.770\nAnd, they were fighting\nthis capacity thing.\n\n412\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.840\nDo we build it humongously and then don't\nuse it almost all year, or, do we go to\n\n413\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.670\nsome sort of elastic service model which\ncloud computing could provide and it did.\n\n414\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.890\nIt ended up going to some elastic they\ndid cloud computing that could expand and\n\n415\n00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:20.690\nthen shrink back.\n\n416\n00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.989\nAnd you only pay for\nthat capacity you're actually utilizing.\n\n417\n00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.034\nAbsolutely transformational capacity\nplanning and elastic provisioning or\n\n418\n00:22:29.034 --> 00:22:33.508\nworking hand in hand in a transformational\nway these days, good points.\n\n419\n00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:39.470\nSo being both proactive and\nreactive means you're paying attention.\n\n420\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.710\nSure, it's good to plan be proactive,\nget all the things, but\n\n421\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.240\nit's also good to monitor.\n\n422\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.050\nAnd make sure you're keeping\nup with the capacity.\n\n423\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.560\nAre you getting close to always failing?\n\n424\n00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.020\nIs it time to add end of the server?\n\n425\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:56.190\nIs it time to upgrade this server\nto have higher CPU utilization,\n\n426\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.880\nor more memory, or more disk space?\n\n427\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.030\nSo certainly monitoring after the fact\nis a part of the reactive nature,\n\n428\n00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.210\ngetting these things planned\nwell up front is too.\n\n429\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.260\nPretty straight forward.\n\n430\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.930\nCapacity management as a process\nis involved in that whole scale.\n\n431\n00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.010\nSo while it's born in service\ndesign as a proactive measure.\n\n432\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.755\nIt's also active in service operations\nas a monitoring reactive measure.\n\n433\n00:23:21.755 --> 00:23:25.840\nOkay, all right, good deal.\n\n434\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.640\nNow this thing about the plan,\nthe capacity plan.\n\n435\n00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.090\nIt's a document.\n\n436\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.660\nIt's how you do things.\n\n437\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.430\nNow, you could do this by service,\nyou could do it by categories of service,\n\n438\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.830\nthere's no prescriptive way that ITIL\nis defining a way you do a single plan.\n\n439\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.640\nBut I daresay there's probably not going\nto be one capacity plan that fits all.\n\n440\n00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.559\nSo you're probably at least going to\nbreak it down at some degree to types of\n\n441\n00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:53.195\nservices.\n\n442\n00:23:53.195 --> 00:23:58.198\nLike maybe you have a capacity plan for\nweb services, or maybe you have a capacity\n\n443\n00:23:58.198 --> 00:24:03.070\nplan for high volume services, whether\nthey're web or client server Right?\n\n444\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:08.625\nYou could come up with ways to manage\nthe sprawl if you will, of capacity plans\n\n445\n00:24:08.625 --> 00:24:14.190\nbecause at some point there is a common\ncomponent to various capacity plans.\n\n446\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.680\nThere's gonna be a lot of commonality\nfrom one capacity plan to another.\n\n447\n00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.310\nSo can you combine to simplify your?\n\n448\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.840\nYour document landscape.\n\n449\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.070\nSure you can, ITIL is not\ntrying to be prescriptive here.\n\n450\n00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:29.820\nBut they are being very descriptive\nof that value of actually pausing and\n\n451\n00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.330\ntaking the effort to write down\nwhat your capacity plan is.\n\n452\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:34.250\nMaybe it's.\n\n453\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.320\nMaybe the plan is a checklist,\nit could start off as a spreadsheet.\n\n454\n00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.180\nWhat are the business capacity needs, do\nthey need training, do they need headsets,\n\n455\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.530\nhow often will they need\nto replace headsets?\n\n456\n00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.350\nAsk basic questions like that,\n\n457\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.210\nwhat components are necessary,\nwhat materials are necessary,\n\n458\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.920\nwho's gonna deliver them, why the points\nof interface for requesting them?\n\n459\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.140\nAll those sorts of things could deal\ncould approach your capacity plan so\n\n460\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.590\ncoming up with a repeatable way to manage\ncapacity could be as simple as starting\n\n461\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.341\nwith a check list of one of the business\ncapacity perimeters what are the service\n\n462\n00:25:08.341 --> 00:25:12.890\ncapacity parameters what are the component\ncapacity parameters and hopefully for\n\n463\n00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:18.220\nall three you have some questions that\nare easily just turn the crank on and\n\n464\n00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.310\nask again, so you don't have to\nreinvent the wheel every time.\n\n465\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:24.930\nThat's what the value of this is,\nto make it repeatable.\n\n466\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.950\nSo, again, looking at the three,\n\n467\n00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:35.370\nbusiness capacity management\nWhat can the business do?\n\n468\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.880\nTo make sure that the business\nhas sufficient capacity.\n\n469\n00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.860\nAs I mentioned that one example,\nthere wasn't enough trained nurses.\n\n470\n00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.820\nSo training was the biggest piece of that.\n\n471\n00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.790\nMaybe the business needs materials,\nlike headsets or a special stylus.\n\n472\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.280\nA bar code reader.\n\n473\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.180\nDo you have enough of those?\n\n474\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.870\nDo you have the ability to replace\nthem quickly, that sort of thing.\n\n475\n00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.290\nI know some services that rely on RF\nreaders, radio frequency readers.\n\n476\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.520\nAre they sufficiently staffed?\n\n477\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.805\nDo people know how those work?\n\n478\n00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:05.305\nRight?\n\n479\n00:26:06.335 --> 00:26:11.595\nDoes the shop floor technician\nat a manufacturing plant know\n\n480\n00:26:11.595 --> 00:26:15.052\nwhen the service is failing so\nwe can do his remedial work?\n\n481\n00:26:15.052 --> 00:26:17.372\nThose types of capacity issues\ncould be related to training,\n\n482\n00:26:17.372 --> 00:26:18.860\ncould be related to process.\n\n483\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.932\nI noticed a case of process\ncapacity is also a big piece.\n\n484\n00:26:24.932 --> 00:26:27.982\nBusiness process capacity,\nhow much can they do?\n\n485\n00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:33.610\nIf you can discover oil at five times the\nrate they used to be able to discover oil,\n\n486\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.090\n&gt;&gt; They're going to do that.\n\n487\n00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.240\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do you have enough geophysicists to do\n\n488\n00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.250\nthe analysis?\n\n489\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:38.850\n&gt;&gt; Good question.\n\n490\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Right now you've got more data coming.\n\n491\n00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.610\nDo you have enough people\nto manage that flow?\n\n492\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.620\nYou're not really going to get\nthe business value unless you consider\n\n493\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.650\nbusiness capacity as well right?\n\n494\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.510\nIf you go to a law firm\nwhat about case load?\n\n495\n00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:56.540\nMaybe you're working 30 cases a month,\nas an average clip.\n\n496\n00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:03.990\nAnd you wanna increase that to 60 by\nhaving faster through put for filings.\n\n497\n00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.860\nSo you as a service you can do that.\n\n498\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.260\nYou provide a way to more quickly\ngenerate the filings on time,\n\n499\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.740\naccurately so they can get them to the\ncourt house sooner than you could before.\n\n500\n00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.930\nSo you're doubling\nThe ability to file cases,\n\n501\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.878\nwell do you have the ability\nto serve the cases?\n\n502\n00:27:18.878 --> 00:27:23.360\nBusiness capacity, okay?\n\n503\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.770\nAgain, that's just a taste of it,\nsome examples of it.\n\n504\n00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.560\nUnderstanding how the business is\ngonna be utilizing the service\n\n505\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.710\ndoesn't mean they are in your\ndirect sphere of control.\n\n506\n00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.360\nBut they have to be a question you ask,\nright?\n\n507\n00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.230\nAnd you have to motivate the business.\n\n508\n00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.780\nIn ways that's going to let\nyour service be successful.\n\n509\n00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.670\nSo they can be successful and vice versa.\n\n510\n00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.240\nOkay?\nWe got a few more things to discuss\n\n511\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.290\nregarding capacity management.\n\n512\n00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.950\nWe've talked about business capacity.\n\n513\n00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:52.130\nWe're going to be looking at component and\nservice capacity as well.\n\n514\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.470\nAnd tie up with some roles and\nactivities and\n\n515\n00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.490\ncritical assess factors\na little bit later on.\n\n516\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, Terry.\n\n517\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.680\nLooking forward to doing that, but\n\n518\n00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.080\nas for this episode it looks like we're\nWe're winding down, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n519\n00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.790\nWe don't wanna keep you too long, right?\n\n520\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.520\nWe wanna make sure that you have enough\nto digest, go take that information,\n\n521\n00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.040\nassimilate it into your person, and\nthen be ready for the next thing.\n\n522\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.646\nWe don't wanna open\nthe flood gates as it were.\n\n523\n00:28:15.646 --> 00:28:16.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Terry, we look forward to\n\n524\n00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:18.210\nseeing you in the upcoming episodes.\n\n525\n00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.710\nWe look forward to seeing our\nlovely audience out there as well.\n\n526\n00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.300\nAs for this one,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n527\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.530\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel

00:00:08.081\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:11.971\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.214\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.669\nwelcome back to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.593\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n8\n00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:24.172\nin today's episode well we are coming\nback with more on our ITEL PPO series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:29.894\nAnd joining us in the studio yet again,\ncontinuing our conversation on capacity.\n\n10\n00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:32.589\nThat's right, I wanted to make\nsure I was on the right show here,\n\n11\n00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.484\n[LAUGH] capacity management,\nis our good friend Mister Terry Decker.\n\n12\n00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:36.981\nTerry we are glad to have you again, man.\n\n13\n00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:37.669\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:40.356\n&gt;&gt; Going great,\nhappy to be here as always.\n\n15\n00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:44.311\nAnd as Daniel said, we're continuing\nour discussion of capacity management,\n\n16\n00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.208\none of the four service design processes\nthere in scope of planning protects and\n\n17\n00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:49.270\noptimization.\n\n18\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.714\nWe also got demand management\nto cover off another episode.\n\n19\n00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:56.490\nSo capacity management,\nyou may recall is got three parts to it.\n\n20\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.985\nIt's got component capacity,\nservice capacity, and business capacity.\n\n21\n00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.204\nWe had a good discussion\nabout business capacity.\n\n22\n00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:04.150\nWe're going to take up service and\ncomponent capacity next.\n\n23\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.879\nSo here's service capacity,\nthis concept is simple.\n\n24\n00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.288\nIt's a pretty picture,\nthe concept is simple.\n\n25\n00:01:09.288 --> 00:01:14.411\nAs time goes forward, capacity can change,\nor capacity needs can change.\n\n26\n00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:18.300\nSo understanding the trending over time is\nan aspect of capacity management planning\n\n27\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.658\nthat needs to be put in place.\n\n28\n00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:22.695\nSo while you're designed\ncapacity into your service,\n\n29\n00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:27.150\nyou need to manage it over time as well,\nafter the service is operational.\n\n30\n00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.750\nYou see the acronyms here or\nthe abbreviations,\n\n31\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.440\nService Level Requirement and\nService Level Agreements.\n\n32\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.875\nService level requirements\nfeed service level agreements.\n\n33\n00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.401\nThey're high level understanding of\nwhat the service needs to deliver,\n\n34\n00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.738\nhow often they need to be there, etc.\n\n35\n00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:46.243\nThe example I've mentioned\nin other episodes about\n\n36\n00:01:46.243 --> 00:01:50.785\ntrying to anticipate the demand for\nlearning management service,\n\n37\n00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:56.370\nconverting PowerPoint presentations to\ne-learning as part of an IT service.\n\n38\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.160\nWell the service level requirements,\nscoping those out, could lead to a service\n\n39\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.430\nlevel agreement that gets very\nspecific and very measurable.\n\n40\n00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.500\nAnd when we in real life when we\nrolled out that particular service,\n\n41\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070\nthe demand was considerably high.\n\n42\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.258\nSo we had maybe five people on our\nteam that were doing that every day,\n\n43\n00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:22.089\nseven hours a day, and just churning\nout PowerPoint conversions every day.\n\n44\n00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.035\nAnd then as we begin to\nsatisfy the pent up demand,\n\n45\n00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:30.020\nbecause of all the existing PowerPoints,\nit began to taper off a little bit.\n\n46\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.415\nNow, this particular example shows\na trend going upward, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:37.103\nWell the trend can also go downward,\nwhere you end up with less demand.\n\n48\n00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:38.788\nUnderstanding trends therefore,\n\n49\n00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:41.882\nis an aspect of capacity management\nthat needs to be put in place.\n\n50\n00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:45.670\nSo you can see whether it's going up or\nwhether it's going down and\n\n51\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.410\ntry to anticipate just what that means.\n\n52\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.510\nCertainly you don't want to overbuild.\n\n53\n00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.560\nYou don't want to have five people\ntwiddling their thumbs in the conversion\n\n54\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.370\nprocess.\n\n55\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.959\nYou also don't want to have five people\nnot meeting the agreed targets of churning\n\n56\n00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.417\nthose things because there's so\nmuch demand, right?\n\n57\n00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:03.666\nSo you have to have the right\nsize of service capacity to be\n\n58\n00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:08.104\nable to be ongoing successful\non behalf of your customers.\n\n59\n00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.961\nAt some point it could trend downward,\nat some point it could trend upward.\n\n60\n00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:14.879\nUnderstanding the trends\nis going to be key.\n\n61\n00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.510\nService management is related to that.\n\n62\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.110\nOf course, component capacity management.\n\n63\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.890\nHere we're dealing with just software,\ndisks,\n\n64\n00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.940\nnetwork bandwidth, network connections,\nlicense capacity, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.040\nThose things that are related\ndirectly to technology.\n\n66\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.115\nTrying to be predictive and\nproactive is the best way forward.\n\n67\n00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:38.632\nBut you also have the reactive piece,\nas we talked about in earlier episodes.\n\n68\n00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:42.798\nBeing able to respond to the trends\nrelated to component capacity,\n\n69\n00:03:42.798 --> 00:03:46.095\ngetting in front of the fact\nthe disk is getting full.\n\n70\n00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:49.852\nClearing out log files or\nadding additional storage, as an example.\n\n71\n00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:54.261\nOr planning a server upgrade\na couple of weekends from now,\n\n72\n00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:58.336\nbecause you realize\nthe server's getting taxed out.\n\n73\n00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:01.520\nGoing trending upward, cuz it's not gonna\nbe able to keep up with that next 2,000\n\n74\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.180\nusers that's gonna join in the couple\nweeks or that sort of thing.\n\n75\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.590\nSo again, trend analysis,\nunderstanding demand,\n\n76\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.850\nand being able to be\npredictive is one thing.\n\n77\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.859\nBut also monitoring as it goes along so\nyou can be reactive, okay.\n\n78\n00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.569\nIt's kinda interesting that monitoring\nis certainly a reactive activity.\n\n79\n00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.366\nYou're responding to\nsomething you've seen.\n\n80\n00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:26.770\nBut if you're good at it,\nit's almost as good as proactive.\n\n81\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.011\nCuz you're getting in front of the failure\nor running out of disk space, or\n\n82\n00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:35.064\nrunning out of processor speed,\netc., or running out of bandwidth.\n\n83\n00:04:35.064 --> 00:04:36.089\nAll right, so\n\n84\n00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:41.482\nwhat types of things might you be\nconsidering under Capacity Management?\n\n85\n00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:46.219\nNew technology exploitation, we had\na brief discussion earlier about having\n\n86\n00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:51.042\nelastic capacity, like you can get from\ncloud computing or hosted solutions.\n\n87\n00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:55.048\nI cited the Commonwealth of Virginia\nusing an elastic approach with a cloud\n\n88\n00:04:55.048 --> 00:04:58.930\ncomputing organization so\nthat they can manage your elections.\n\n89\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.488\nIt gets really busy in October and\nNovember, not so\n\n90\n00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:03.758\nbusy during the rest of\nthe times of the year.\n\n91\n00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:07.719\nSo be able to expand outward and\ncapture that heavy-duty time and\n\n92\n00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.888\nthen go back down to normal sizing.\n\n93\n00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:12.940\nSo that's exploiting new technology,\nright?\n\n94\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.609\nVirtualization has been another\ntechnology exploited for the, for\n\n95\n00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:16.489\nthe sake of capacity.\n\n96\n00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.445\nBeing able to easily capture\nan image on one server and\n\n97\n00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:21.809\nput it on a more powerful server later,\nand\n\n98\n00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:25.730\npick up where you left off the next day,\nright, that sort of thing.\n\n99\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.284\nSo being able to reuse architectures\ncan also help with capacity management.\n\n100\n00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:34.720\nVirtualization is a key way to manage\nthose different architectures.\n\n101\n00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.566\nSo it's pretty clever.\n\n102\n00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:39.400\nAlso understanding relationships\nto demand management.\n\n103\n00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.590\nWe'll talk about demand\nmanagement in detail later on.\n\n104\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.700\nBut in a nutshell,\n\n105\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.755\nwhat demand management is doing is try to\nanticipate what the demand's gonna be.\n\n106\n00:05:47.755 --> 00:05:50.305\nWe anticipate 5,000 users.\n\n107\n00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:54.855\nWe anticipate 500 PowerPoints a month for\nthe next six months,\n\n108\n00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:58.065\ntapering off to 200 a month\nby the end of the year.\n\n109\n00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:02.682\nDemand management is asking questions in a\npredictive sense, at the strategic level,\n\n110\n00:06:02.682 --> 00:06:07.192\nat the service strategy level,\nto make sure that you're funding the right\n\n111\n00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:09.872\nservices, the right capacity for\nthe right services.\n\n112\n00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:13.212\nAgain, had we done it better in the\nexample I gave you, we wouldn't have been\n\n113\n00:06:13.212 --> 00:06:18.862\nsurprised by the unspent demand or the\nunmet demand of converting PowerPoints.\n\n114\n00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:21.829\nHad we asked good questions about hey,\nhow many PowerPoints do you have?\n\n115\n00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.570\nDo you wanna convert those?\n\n116\n00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.693\nHad we asked those questions through a\ndemand management regiment, we'd have been\n\n117\n00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:31.830\nbetter prepared to manage the capacity\nanswer to that demand management question.\n\n118\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.383\nAnd of course, coming up with\nappropriate modelling and trending so\n\n119\n00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:38.209\nthat you don't have to\nreinvent the wheel every time.\n\n120\n00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:41.505\nIf you know you need\nto serve 50,000 users,\n\n121\n00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:45.754\nthat's a different question\nthan managing 5,000 users.\n\n122\n00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:46.860\nAre they heavy hitting?\n\n123\n00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.678\nWhat type of activities are they\ndoing when they get there?\n\n124\n00:06:48.678 --> 00:06:50.571\nAre they submitting big queries or\n\n125\n00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:53.451\nare they just kind of\ntransactional kind of things?\n\n126\n00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:56.620\nHit and go away, right,\nunderstanding those kinds of activities.\n\n127\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.825\nSo modeling and trending, coming up with\nways that you can repeat that modeling and\n\n128\n00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.809\ntrending through capacity planning,\n\n129\n00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.918\ncan help streamline the capacity planning\nprocess and the activities therein.\n\n130\n00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:10.923\nAnd of course, application sizing\nrelated to those modeling and trending.\n\n131\n00:07:10.923 --> 00:07:12.818\nJust how big does\nthe application have to be?\n\n132\n00:07:12.818 --> 00:07:14.590\nHow many users is it going to support?\n\n133\n00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.447\nWhen, how heavy hitting are those users,\netc.?\n\n134\n00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.775\nSo certainly related to design,\n\n135\n00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:27.941\nwe talk about service design being\nthe stage where you try to anticipate.\n\n136\n00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:30.652\nWell, understanding the new\ntechnologies that we just talked about,\n\n137\n00:07:30.652 --> 00:07:31.655\ncan help play into there.\n\n138\n00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:33.222\nDesign resilience,\n\n139\n00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:38.800\ncoming up with ways to improve\navailability through capacity management.\n\n140\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.063\nComponent failure impact analysis,\nwhen do services fail?\n\n141\n00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:47.687\nWe'll talk about that in detail when\nwe talk about availability management.\n\n142\n00:07:47.687 --> 00:07:51.757\nBasically, what you're trying to do is\nmaking sure you're building it with\n\n143\n00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:52.893\nresilience in mind.\n\n144\n00:07:52.893 --> 00:07:57.260\nNothing really new conceptually there,\nokay?\n\n145\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.421\nSo let's look at these.\n\n146\n00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:01.971\nAnd keep in mind that this is probably\na good point of memorization,\n\n147\n00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:04.290\nbecause they could simply use these words.\n\n148\n00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.580\nOn an exam, so exam takers, take heed,\nthere may be a choice, for instance,\n\n149\n00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.935\nrelated to a capacity management question\nwhere they're clearly asking about\n\n150\n00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:17.880\ncapacity management, and you need to\ncome up with the appropriate activities.\n\n151\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.310\nNotice the activities here of tuning,\nimplementation, monitoring and\n\n152\n00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.010\nanalysis and\nnotice that it's cyclical, right?\n\n153\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.460\nThat's at the top of this graphic.\n\n154\n00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.385\nLet me get my laser pointer here and\nreinforce those.\n\n155\n00:08:33.385 --> 00:08:36.075\nSo it's, again,\nit's kinda worth committing to memory\n\n156\n00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:39.525\nthese activities because maybe\nwhat the test maker might do is,\n\n157\n00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:44.455\nwithin the answer to the question,\ninclude activities of capacity management.\n\n158\n00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:45.825\nCuz you're trying to convince the CIO,\n\n159\n00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:48.360\nwhat are you gonna be doing\nin capacity management?\n\n160\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360\nWell what activities would you be doing?\n\n161\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.390\nThese are the four activities, right?\n\n162\n00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.920\nSo tuning, implementation,\nmonitoring and analysis.\n\n163\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.860\nWe've talked about these, but not in\nthose necessarily specific terms, right?\n\n164\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.640\nNotice that what you have underneath it is\ndifferent models or definitions of things.\n\n165\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.160\nYou got a resource thresholds,\nservice thresholds.\n\n166\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.910\nThese kind of look like databases,\na big database.\n\n167\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.970\nIn fact, that's what this biggest\ncylinder is trying to show,\n\n168\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.480\nCapacity Management Information System.\n\n169\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.670\nSo one of the outputs of capacity\nmanagement is a capacity plan,\n\n170\n00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.530\nright, you'll certainly have those.\n\n171\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.880\nAlso keeping up with the relevant data\nrelated to capacity management planning\n\n172\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.310\nis a goal of capacity management.\n\n173\n00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.850\nAnd ITIL simply gives\nthat set of data a name,\n\n174\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.660\nthe capacity management\ninformation system.\n\n175\n00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.620\nAvailability has one, called availability\nmanagement information system.\n\n176\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.940\nContinuity has one, security has one,\n\n177\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.020\nits own set of data that helps inform\nthe process of capacity management.\n\n178\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.534\nKeeping up with the data points, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:48.534 --> 00:09:52.240\nAll right, so what are these activities?\n\n180\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.880\nMonitoring, we've talked about those,\n\n181\n00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.085\nmonitoring the utilization\nof the resources.\n\n182\n00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:03.810\nResponse time,\nhow quickly are you responding to things?\n\n183\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.270\nFor instance, if they say,\n\n184\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.150\nyou're able to manage 500 requests\na month for e-learning conversions for\n\n185\n00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.740\nthose learning management services,\nis that good or is that bad?\n\n186\n00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.410\nSo response time,\nhow quickly are you turning those around?\n\n187\n00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.760\nIt's not just 500 a month,\nit's you turn them around in 24 hours or\n\n188\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.260\n48 hours, that type of thing.\n\n189\n00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:28.980\nSo we're talking about how you're\nutilizing that service as well as\n\n190\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.940\nhow quickly that service\nis turning things around.\n\n191\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.650\nDoing your analysis,\nwhat are the patterns of the service?\n\n192\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.020\nDoes it tend to be heavier\non Wednesdays than Fridays?\n\n193\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.670\nDoes it tend to be heavier in\nthe afternoon than in the morning,\n\n194\n00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.570\nthose types of things.\n\n195\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.510\nUnderstanding those patterns\ncan help you better model for\n\n196\n00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.860\nthe future as well to\nestablish your trends.\n\n197\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.900\nAnd then tuning is adjusting, right?\n\n198\n00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.200\nIt's making your adjustments and\nperhaps even influencing demand.\n\n199\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.470\nMoving activities to the morning\ninstead of the afternoon,\n\n200\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.914\nif you can influence\nthe right behaviors there.\n\n201\n00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:11.036\nAs it relates to component planning,\nmaybe it's reusing capacity on the network\n\n202\n00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:15.950\ndifferently, doing some quality of\nservice analysis and that sort of thing.\n\n203\n00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:21.127\nWe once had a situation where the sales\nteams in the far east, they had critical\n\n204\n00:11:21.127 --> 00:11:26.636\ntraining periods where they came into the\noffice instead of being out in the field.\n\n205\n00:11:26.636 --> 00:11:29.122\nThey came into the office quarterly, and\n\n206\n00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:32.400\nused the learning management\nservice quite heavily.\n\n207\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.750\nAnd it happened to be one\nof the weaker points we had\n\n208\n00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.660\non our wide area network was that\nspace over there in the far east.\n\n209\n00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.620\nWe had some slow links over there.\n\n210\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.380\nSo architecturally speaking,\n\n211\n00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.370\nwe needed to manage that demand\na little bit differently.\n\n212\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:51.811\nSo instead of sending them across\nthe WAN link to stream their e-learning,\n\n213\n00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:56.319\nwe redesigned the technology in\nsuch a way that it downloaded to\n\n214\n00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:57.947\na local server first.\n\n215\n00:11:57.947 --> 00:12:01.276\nAnd they could stream it on that side of\nthe WAN instead of going through the wide\n\n216\n00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:02.490\narea network.\n\n217\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.840\nThat's the nature of capacity planning.\n\n218\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.420\nWe knew we had a bunch of people who were\ngonna demand it at certain times of the\n\n219\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.490\nmonth, we could turn the switch basically\nand manage that traffic as we needed to.\n\n220\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.540\nSo again, service design is trying\nto anticipate these demands and\n\n221\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.110\ntrying to anticipate the constraints.\n\n222\n00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.584\nIn this case the constraint was bandwidth,\nright, you get the idea.\n\n223\n00:12:21.584 --> 00:12:25.120\nIt's a bandwidth kind of consideration,\nright.\n\n224\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.840\nImplementation, introduce performance\nenhancement, make it better.\n\n225\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.820\nSo as you implement, you get better at it.\n\n226\n00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.490\nSo come up with strategies\nlike I just described.\n\n227\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.110\nWe came up with a strategy for\nhow to handle the known\n\n228\n00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.870\nissue of slow bandwidth or low bandwidth\nfor that part of our WAN network.\n\n229\n00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.930\nThat network wasn't high speed enough, so\n\n230\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.980\nwe came up with the technique\nof design that would put\n\n231\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.927\nthe content on the other side of the WAN\nbefore they started streaming, right.\n\n232\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.430\nAgain, capacity planning, understanding\nthe demand and meeting it as necessary.\n\n233\n00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.848\nAnd again, that was only quarterly.\n\n234\n00:12:56.848 --> 00:13:00.094\nCuz there's other times we\ndidn't need that kind of,\n\n235\n00:13:00.094 --> 00:13:03.491\nwe didn't need to hit that\nline with the first download.\n\n236\n00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:07.015\nCuz that was effecting other business\nprocesses, so we just managed it such\n\n237\n00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:10.720\na way that we made sure we staged that\ncontent on the other side of the WAN.\n\n238\n00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.530\nWe did it over the weekend,\nwe knew what they were gonna be hitting.\n\n239\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.620\nWe put the content on the right\nside side of the WAN and\n\n240\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.450\nstreamlined their activities, while not\ndisrupting the rest of the business.\n\n241\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.220\n&gt;&gt; It just goes to show you there's\na lot more going on when it comes to\n\n242\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.370\ntrying to figure out and\nplan for these things then just,\n\n243\n00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.460\nokay, well we don't have enough\nbandwidth on this side of the WAN, so\n\n244\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.360\nwe'll just increase our\nbandwidth through our provider.\n\n245\n00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.984\nYeah you could do that and\nthat would work.\n\n246\n00:13:36.984 --> 00:13:41.932\nBut as you said, you don't always need,\nthere's always these qualifications and\n\n247\n00:13:41.932 --> 00:13:45.206\ncaveats we have to take into\naccount before we start, or\n\n248\n00:13:45.206 --> 00:13:48.210\nbefore we complete our planning phase,\nright?\n\n249\n00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, and again, I gotta say\nI wish that I could say that we\n\n250\n00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.230\nanticipated that right at the beginning,\nwe never were caught by surprise.\n\n251\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.740\nNo, we got caught by surprise.\n\n252\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.928\nThe first time the sales team hit it and\nhit it hard and\n\n253\n00:13:59.928 --> 00:14:05.095\nwas unsatisfied with the performance,\nthat's when we started troubleshooting.\n\n254\n00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.809\nAgain, I'd like to say we were very\ngreat at demand management and\n\n255\n00:14:07.809 --> 00:14:09.040\ncapacity planning.\n\n256\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.810\nIn fact, we were reactive, but we did\ncome up with a solution, right, in time.\n\n257\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.720\nCapacity management and ITIL,\nITIL's version of capacity management or\n\n258\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.970\nsuggestion of capacity management,\n\n259\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.540\nis that you gain as much intelligence\nas you can before you go operational.\n\n260\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.170\nSo you never have\ndissatisfied sales people\n\n261\n00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.850\non the other side of a slow WAN link,\nright?\n\n262\n00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.590\nYou anticipate it and meet it, right?\n\n263\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.461\nThat's just an exemplary scenario, okay,\n\n264\n00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:44.625\nThreshold management, again, we're getting\ninvolved in some just semantics here.\n\n265\n00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:49.035\nA threshold, what does failure look like?\n\n266\n00:14:49.035 --> 00:14:51.733\nRight, so for these sales people on\nthe other side of the slow WAN link,\n\n267\n00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:54.635\nwhat failure looked like is\nwhen it took a minute and\n\n268\n00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:58.055\na half after they pressed\nthe next slide button.\n\n269\n00:14:58.055 --> 00:14:59.655\nThat would be a bit too long right?\n\n270\n00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:01.887\nSo that's a threshold unacceptable,\n\n271\n00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:06.224\nobviously needs to be a lot more\nstreamlined than that, just as an example.\n\n272\n00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:11.313\nNow, we did have the ability for\nsome of our services to be able to\n\n273\n00:15:11.313 --> 00:15:17.130\nmonitor in real time what was the time for\nthe transaction to occur.\n\n274\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.820\nRight, so we didn't monitor\nevery single transaction,\n\n275\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.280\nbut the transaction time between the time\nthey requested the content and the time\n\n276\n00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.870\nthat they started using the content\nwas one that we started monitoring.\n\n277\n00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.030\nAnd sure enough,\nit confirmed what their perceptions were.\n\n278\n00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.349\nThey said it was slow and,\nby golly, it was slow.\n\n279\n00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:33.890\n&gt;&gt; It was slow, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n280\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.540\n&gt;&gt; So again,\n\n281\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.300\ncapacity management could be\nreactive in this regard and\n\n282\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.040\nput some things out there ahead of time.\n\n283\n00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.520\nAnd to see what that looks like\nbased on web traffic, etc.\n\n284\n00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:45.210\nOkay, workload management.\n\n285\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.950\nNotice some of this here like\nrescheduling a service or\n\n286\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.430\na job, moving it to another time or\nanother resource.\n\n287\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.660\nThat's basically what we did,\n\n288\n00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.240\nwe moved the content onto\nthe other side of the WAN link.\n\n289\n00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.810\nSo we moved the service or job,\nwe moved it to make that better.\n\n290\n00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.297\nThat's just an example of some of\nthe management process activity involved.\n\n291\n00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:06.629\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think of in IT,\na lot of companies that start off,\n\n292\n00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:09.009\nthey start off small like most people do.\n\n293\n00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:11.573\nAnd then they worked themselves\nto a bigger company.\n\n294\n00:16:11.573 --> 00:16:15.096\nAnd when they start off small\nthey'll have maybe one server,\n\n295\n00:16:15.096 --> 00:16:17.410\nmaybe two that is handling everything.\n\n296\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.750\nEmail, database, frontend, backend,\nyou name it, it's doing it.\n\n297\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.220\nAnd then as they grow well, that no longer\nhas the ability to perform as they need.\n\n298\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.490\nAnd now we have to say, well.\n\n299\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.070\nNow it's time to upgrade that,\nstart separating these duties out.\n\n300\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.350\nBuy more servers, so\nthat this only does the NS, only does web,\n\n301\n00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.960\nthis only does that, and it takes\nthe load off of that one single server.\n\n302\n00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.569\n&gt;&gt; Excellent example it also reinforces\nthis idea that while, in a perfect world,\n\n303\n00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:47.724\ncapacity management can just do\nthe design effort and not look anymore.\n\n304\n00:16:47.724 --> 00:16:50.780\nIt just doesn't happen that\nway because things change.\n\n305\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.490\nMore people are using it, you're growing,\nthe business is growing or\n\n306\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.750\nin the case of some services as they're\nused more people get excited about using.\n\n307\n00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.230\nSo, customers you didn't\nanticipate start coming.\n\n308\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.940\nImagine Amazon.com years ago providing\n\n309\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.990\nbasically there was a place to go and\norder a book.\n\n310\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.180\nThey were basically competing\nwith Barnes &amp; Noble.\n\n311\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.286\nNow what is Amazon.com?\n\n312\n00:17:11.286 --> 00:17:14.510\n&gt;&gt; They compete with everyone, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, they compete with everyone.\n\n313\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.950\nAnd of course so\ntheir business model changed.\n\n314\n00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.190\nIt grew and grew and grew.\n\n315\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.608\nTheir technology capacity\ncertainly had to keep up, right?\n\n316\n00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:26.960\nSo that's kinda big big example of how the\nworld doesn't stay static in one location.\n\n317\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.300\nYou can't just solve the capacity\nplan riddle one time.\n\n318\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.010\nIt's always going on.\n\n319\n00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.120\nYou gotta keep it moving, all right.\n\n320\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.750\nSo there's this reactive\nnature proactive nature.\n\n321\n00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.850\nGet good at it is what I2 is saying.\n\n322\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:45.640\nUnderstand these dynamics of meeting\ndemand and manage them methodically.\n\n323\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.620\nDon't just respond, okay.\n\n324\n00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.720\nSpeaking of respond certainly\nbeing reactive is part of it.\n\n325\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.020\nWe talked about responding to monitoring.\n\n326\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:03.040\nSo if you determine that there\nis a threshold being passed.\n\n327\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.748\nDo you have way to elastically\nincrease your capacity?\n\n328\n00:18:07.748 --> 00:18:12.223\nAgain, that kinda technology is more and\nmore available and\n\n329\n00:18:12.223 --> 00:18:15.479\nmore and more usable by tea organizations.\n\n330\n00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:18.841\nSo you can last it out and\ngain the capacity you need and\n\n331\n00:18:18.841 --> 00:18:21.400\ncome back down when you don't.\n\n332\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.610\nSo that's the nature of this,\n\n333\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.890\nrespond, response time monitoring,\nhow are you going to get those.\n\n334\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.050\nHow quickly does it respond?\n\n335\n00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.220\nDoes it do it well?\n\n336\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.240\nWe've said monitoring agents spread\nout across the world doing synthetic\n\n337\n00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:42.480\ntransactions, pretending to access\ncontent, pretending to run content, etc.\n\n338\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.380\nAnd by so doing with these agents,\n\n339\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.970\nwe can get an idea for\nhow well they were performing.\n\n340\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.760\nAnd we got to certain thresholds, if we\nhad 20 agents operating on the other side\n\n341\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:58.280\nof the slow WAN link, instead of just one,\nwe realize that the WAN link was suspect.\n\n342\n00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.190\nSo we had to manage it, and eventually\nwe had to redesign our service, okay.\n\n343\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.990\nAgain, as it relates to demand management,\n\n344\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.400\ndemand management is trying to\nanticipate what the demand is gonna be.\n\n345\n00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.830\nAsk the question, how many people\nare using it, when are they using it,\n\n346\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.829\nthese patters of business activity, etc.\n\n347\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.800\nDemand management is also\ntrying to influence user and\n\n348\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.310\ncustomer demand, trying to move them\nmaybe into different behaviors.\n\n349\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.340\nI'll stay with learning\nmanagement service as an example.\n\n350\n00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:34.460\nWe had an opportunity,\nor we had discovered,\n\n351\n00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.340\nI should say that are learning\nmanagement service tend to suffer.\n\n352\n00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.410\nTechnologically speaking,\ncapacity was bad,\n\n353\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.490\nperformance was bad every other Friday.\n\n354\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.040\nAnd we weren't sure why, in fact,\n\n355\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.930\nit took us a while to realize that it was\nactually happening every other Friday.\n\n356\n00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.580\nThat wasn't necessarily a blaring Horn\nover here look at every other Friday.\n\n357\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.170\nIt took us a couple of months or\n\n358\n00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.030\na few Fridays to realize there was\na pattern of every other Friday.\n\n359\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.180\nWhich led us to an investigation of what's\ngoing on on every other Friday, right?\n\n360\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.000\nWhich wasn't necessarily an easy day\nto grab or information grab either.\n\n361\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.150\nWhat we ended up discovering\nmoving to the end game here.\n\n362\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.580\nWhat we end up discovering was\nthe manufacturing organization\n\n363\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.440\nwas doing training audits every Friday.\n\n364\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.110\nWhich means they were heavily querying\nthe learning management system as part of\n\n365\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.350\nthe service to extract training records,\nand to make sure everyone was current.\n\n366\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:31.590\nThose were about 300 training coordinators\nin the manufacturing division\n\n367\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.740\ndoing some activity concurrently\nagainst our servers every Friday.\n\n368\n00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.010\nWe generally handled\nthat particular demand.\n\n369\n00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:45.449\nHowever, every other Friday the sales\nteams in Europe came back from\n\n370\n00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:48.061\nthe field and they took their training.\n\n371\n00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.193\nThat's when they took their training,\nevery other Friday,\n\n372\n00:20:50.193 --> 00:20:51.550\nthat they needed to take.\n\n373\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.170\nSo, now we have two organizations.\n\n374\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.180\nOne doing their weekly report, and it's\npretty heavy hitting, and now the sales\n\n375\n00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.740\nteam, some 3,000, sales team members,\ncoming in and also taking training.\n\n376\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.220\nOur systems,\nour services related to technology,\n\n377\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:11.490\nour component capacity wasn't able to keep\nup, and performance dragged down, right?\n\n378\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.500\nNow again, that's going to the end game.\n\n379\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.880\nNow we know what the problem is.\n\n380\n00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.010\nNow what can we do?\n\n381\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.150\nWell we can influence demand.\n\n382\n00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.180\nWe basically asked the manufacturing team,\ncould you do reports on Monday?\n\n383\n00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.880\nThe kicked and moaned a little bit but\n\n384\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.650\nthey said yeah we'll do our reports\non Monday instead of Friday, right?\n\n385\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.275\nWhich took care of the capacity issue.\n\n386\n00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:34.124\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In a perfect world we would ask all\n\n387\n00:21:34.124 --> 00:21:37.230\nthose wise questions as the beginning\nthrough demand management.\n\n388\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.120\nWe would of passed those answers to\nthose questions through patterns of\n\n389\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.310\nbusiness activity, and\npass that down to capacity management and\n\n390\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.020\ncapacity management might\nhave built a system.\n\n391\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.500\nBig enough to handle both things,\nevery other Friday.\n\n392\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.490\nAs it turns out we built if for\nwhat we knew and it tended to work and\n\n393\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.070\nlater on we had to respond and\nreact to it, which is also okay.\n\n394\n00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.565\nAnd we did respond by influencing Demand.\n\n395\n00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:05.465\nWe changed the demand metric a little bit,\nor the demand calculus a little bit,\n\n396\n00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:08.565\nby asking the manufacturing\nteam to move their activities.\n\n397\n00:22:08.565 --> 00:22:09.335\n&gt;&gt; Jerry, what do they say?\n\n398\n00:22:09.335 --> 00:22:10.815\nYou don't know what you don't know, right?\n\n399\n00:22:10.815 --> 00:22:11.478\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:22:11.478 --> 00:22:13.235\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n401\n00:22:13.235 --> 00:22:17.335\nSo all this kind of means that, over time,\nyou can come up with some modeling and\n\n402\n00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:18.529\ntrending where the activities is.\n\n403\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.430\nSo modelling and trending is basically\ntrying to predict the behavior and\n\n404\n00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.310\nthen building accordingly, right?\n\n405\n00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.120\nI dare say, I have not been deep in this,\nI would admit disclaimer here.\n\n406\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.180\nI have not been deep into architectural\ndesign with lots of services.\n\n407\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.300\nI've been on the edges watching how\nit's done and seeing a results of good.\n\n408\n00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.600\nAnd actually seeing the results of\nbad modeling for capacity management.\n\n409\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.530\nBut in a nutshell,\n\n410\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.640\nwhat I've learned from my exposure here is\nthat the universe of questions to ask for\n\n411\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.330\nany given service is not vast that you\ncan't begin to model and trend against it.\n\n412\n00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.280\nI mean, there's only so\nmany architectures you can choose from.\n\n413\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.510\nLet's say you have the constraint that\nit's gonna be a web-based application.\n\n414\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.100\nThat underpins your service.\n\n415\n00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.322\nNot client server, not mainframe\ndummy terminal kinds of things.\n\n416\n00:23:08.322 --> 00:23:11.340\nIt's gonna be a web application that\nis a constraint you have to operate it\n\n417\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.250\nunder right?\n\n418\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.040\nKnowing that what is the capacity\nof your web services?\n\n419\n00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.820\nWhat is the capacity of your network etc.\n\n420\n00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:25.260\nAgain, that's a known architectural\nconstraint, must be web services.\n\n421\n00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.110\nWe know that if we have 5,000\nusers doing transactional things,\n\n422\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.830\njust updating a database here and\na database there.\n\n423\n00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.940\nThat that's not heavily hitting\nthe network its just transactional stuff.\n\n424\n00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.750\nWe also know that some database\nactivities can be heavy-hitting like\n\n425\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.300\na big query running across\nseveral different tables, etc.\n\n426\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.911\nSo the universe,\nI'm not saying it's simple,\n\n427\n00:23:45.911 --> 00:23:49.909\nI'm not trying to over-simplify this,\nbut what I am suggesting is that you\n\n428\n00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:53.407\ncan certainly take this universal\nquestions that possibly relate\n\n429\n00:23:53.407 --> 00:23:57.049\nto capacity management, and\nnarrow them down in to certain models.\n\n430\n00:23:57.049 --> 00:24:00.534\nSo that you can then test them\nagainst certain activities and\n\n431\n00:24:00.534 --> 00:24:01.839\nwe go through trends.\n\n432\n00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:06.477\nAgain, coming up with a methodical way\nto answer all these myriad questions\n\n433\n00:24:06.477 --> 00:24:12.070\ninstead of just Guessing or throwing it to\nthe wind and putting out fires later on.\n\n434\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.580\nThat’s what modeling and\ntrending is about.\n\n435\n00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.940\nSame thing with application sizing.\n\n436\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.530\nGetting the right size application.\n\n437\n00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.210\nUnderstanding that you're building for\na finite level of time.\n\n438\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.070\nIs this the size it’s going to be for\nthe next year?\n\n439\n00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.970\nThrough service design,\nthrough new and changed services,\n\n440\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:36.930\nis it anticipating the known growth,\nright, that you know it's going to grow?\n\n441\n00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:42.310\nAgain, I can't imagine where Amazon.com\nwas before they took over the world.\n\n442\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.020\nBut, Amazon.com did have\na narrow focus at one time.\n\n443\n00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.820\nAnd it continued to grow,\nand grow, and grow.\n\n444\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.930\nSo much so that they took on capacity\nmanagement as something they own and\n\n445\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.640\nmanaged as experts in the field,\n\n446\n00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.380\nthey basically have written the book\non elastic hosting basically.\n\n447\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.360\nNot saying they didn't have a lot of help,\nand not other players playing,\n\n448\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.410\nI'm just saying as practitioners,\nperhaps the gold standard in that regard.\n\n449\n00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.030\nBecause they had to learn to\nrepeat things, model things, and\n\n450\n00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.768\nget the right sizes for things, etc.\n\n451\n00:25:13.768 --> 00:25:14.988\nOkay.\n\n452\n00:25:14.988 --> 00:25:17.430\nAll right.\n\n453\n00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.890\nSo looking at Capacity Management\nfrom a process perspective, inputs,\n\n454\n00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.630\nsomething gets them started, and then they\ndo something, and come out with something.\n\n455\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.810\nRemember the whole nature\nof a process workflow.\n\n456\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:35.610\nSo what types of documents or activities\nget capacity management planning.\n\n457\n00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.540\nYou're inviting a new service in or\nyou're changing the existing service.\n\n458\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.530\nYou're going to take an existing\nservice to new customers.\n\n459\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.250\nRight.\n\n460\n00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.320\nYou're looking at how much financial,\nhow much money you have to spend.\n\n461\n00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.720\nWhat are your time and\nmoney constraints, right?\n\n462\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.900\nWhat are your architectural constraints,\nright?\n\n463\n00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.280\nHow quickly must it perform?\n\n464\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.720\nDoes it have to be super fast?\n\n465\n00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.610\nIn some cases not necessarily,\nslow is okay in some cases.\n\n466\n00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:03.500\nAgain you don't wanna over build.\n\n467\n00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.590\nSo getting the right inputs related\nto what the business is doing and\n\n468\n00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.740\nhow critical is part of it.\n\n469\n00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.270\nAnd then of course newer chain services.\n\n470\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.770\nIf you have a service breach because\nyou're always running out of disk space or\n\n471\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:15.950\nalways running out of bandwidth,\n\n472\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.280\nthen obviously you could be\nasked come in and fix things.\n\n473\n00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.280\nPut out the fires.\n\n474\n00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.920\nCapacity manager come and\nsay, how we're gonna do this?\n\n475\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.000\nAs an example, service breaches,\n\n476\n00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.350\nwe weren't serving our sales people on the\nother side of the slow WAN link very well.\n\n477\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.640\nWe heard about it.\n\n478\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.750\nPlenty, right,\n\n479\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.600\nthose sales people were very upset\nthat they couldn't take the training.\n\n480\n00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.640\nThey rightfully complained.\n\n481\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.940\nOkay, what are we gonna do about it?\n\n482\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.680\nSo we responded to that particular\nservice breach, as an example.\n\n483\n00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.816\nAnd of course the outputs, a capacity\nmanagement information system, the CMSIS.\n\n484\n00:26:51.816 --> 00:26:54.351\nCapacity plans, we've talked about that.\n\n485\n00:26:54.351 --> 00:26:57.836\nIf you're doing the trend analysis,\nyour models, your work load\n\n486\n00:26:57.836 --> 00:27:01.898\nanalysis system reports, your service\nperformance information reports.\n\n487\n00:27:01.898 --> 00:27:06.575\nThose things we talked about that you went\nout and observed end up being something\n\n488\n00:27:06.575 --> 00:27:09.891\nyou can correlate and\nput into meaningful information.\n\n489\n00:27:09.891 --> 00:27:13.240\nAnd that meaningful information\nis stored in the CMIS.\n\n490\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.140\nAll right the capacity\nmanagement information system.\n\n491\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.950\nSo this slide happens\nto capture interaction\n\n492\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.420\namong different processes\nthe capacity management might have.\n\n493\n00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.250\nIncident management as an example.\n\n494\n00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.780\nIncident management, if we had 500 sales\npeople on the other side of the WAN link\n\n495\n00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.490\nput in in an incident saying hey this\nis not working for me it's too slow.\n\n496\n00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.940\nObviously we have incidents\ntriggering an investigation.\n\n497\n00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.480\nThat could lead to problem management,\n\n498\n00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.590\nskip up a little bit that could\nlead to problem management.\n\n499\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.160\nObviously have a problem which\nwill do the root cause analysis.\n\n500\n00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.830\nThe deeper dive.\n\n501\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.990\nAnd figure out what's going on here.\n\n502\n00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:58.660\nContinuity here and availability here\nare also sides to the same coin.\n\n503\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.420\nRemember capacity management,\n\n504\n00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.520\nif it falls over,\nyou could eventually lose availability.\n\n505\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.720\nThe same with continuity management.\n\n506\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.390\nIf it falls over,\nyou could lose availability.\n\n507\n00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:12.460\nSo collectively these three are forming\npart of the warranty triad.\n\n508\n00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.940\nBut there's actually a fourth one,\nsecurity management.\n\n509\n00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.540\nIt's not listed here.\n\n510\n00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.670\nBut security could also make\navailability falter, right?\n\n511\n00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.620\nDemand management.\n\n512\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.640\nWe talked about it earlier.\n\n513\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.080\nDemand management is trying to predict\nwhat the pattern the base of these\n\n514\n00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.830\nactivities are, and quantify those,\ntherefore giving capacity management\n\n515\n00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.560\nvery important data points and\ninformation points to effectively plan.\n\n516\n00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.710\nSo demand management would understand\nthere's gonna be 5,000 users.\n\n517\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.930\nHere's when they use it heavily,\nhere's when they use it not so\n\n518\n00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.360\nheavily, et cetera.\n\n519\n00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.410\nWe'll talk about demand management in\nsome detail a little bit later on.\n\n520\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.160\nService level management.\n\n521\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.740\nService level management describes the\nlevels of performance that need to be met.\n\n522\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.740\nSo if the salespeople in the other\nside of the WAN link, say.\n\n523\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.260\nThis is slow.\n\n524\n00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:03.650\nService level management will have defined\nslow to a very objective target, right?\n\n525\n00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:07.230\nA minute and a half might be slow\nto log in to the content server.\n\n526\n00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.125\nThat might be too long, right?\n\n527\n00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:14.165\nMaybe the service level management says\nlogins will be executed within 15 seconds.\n\n528\n00:29:14.165 --> 00:29:18.735\nWell obviously a minute and\na half is breaching that threshold, right?\n\n529\n00:29:18.735 --> 00:29:22.375\nSo service level management can\nset the performance thresholds\n\n530\n00:29:22.375 --> 00:29:23.915\nthat everyone's agreed to.\n\n531\n00:29:23.915 --> 00:29:26.730\nWritten down, here's what we're\nsupposed to be performing toward.\n\n532\n00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.880\nCapacity management is trying to\nreach that level of capacity in that\n\n533\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.850\nlevel of performance.\n\n534\n00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:35.030\nAnd of course, if you breach it,\nyou got an incident, you got a problem,\n\n535\n00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.230\nyou gotta chase it down.\n\n536\n00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.190\nOkay.\n\n537\n00:29:40.225 --> 00:29:41.395\nWe've talked about this.\n\n538\n00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:44.365\nSo very briefly just to review,\nthe information management challenge for\n\n539\n00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:46.435\ncapacity management is\nto get all this data and\n\n540\n00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:51.015\ninformation into a collective location and\nthe collective location, ITO,\n\n541\n00:29:51.015 --> 00:29:54.380\ngives the name called the capacity\nmanagement information system.\n\n542\n00:29:54.380 --> 00:30:00.080\nSo one of the outputs of capacity\nmanagement is this CMIS, and one\n\n543\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.210\nof the activities of capacity management\nis the maintenance of this CMIS.\n\n544\n00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.850\nSo you notice the component based reports,\nservice based reports.\n\n545\n00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.950\nThe reporting coming out of\nthis is going to be important.\n\n546\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:15.290\nWhat about exceptions,\nmeaning you've reached the threshold,\n\n547\n00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.480\nyou've passed the threshold?\n\n548\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.090\nWhat does that look like in\ngetting those reports done?\n\n549\n00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.310\nThis is gonna help you trend.\n\n550\n00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:26.330\nIt's gonna help you analyze those trends\nas well, right, so that you can be\n\n551\n00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.470\nboth predictive and reactive to the\ncapacity management problems of the day.\n\n552\n00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:32.990\nOkay.\n\n553\n00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.910\nContinuing on here, business data,\nservice data, component data.\n\n554\n00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.410\nBusiness data, for instance, in that\nlearning management scenario I mentioned\n\n555\n00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.150\nearlier, how many PowerPoints\nare you going to have to convert?\n\n556\n00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:50.310\nWhen we first did this service,\nwe did, we said it's free.\n\n557\n00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:51.860\nRight?\nHR was gonna pay for\n\n558\n00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.340\nit, the business, all you have to\ndo is send us your PowerPoints.\n\n559\n00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.120\nAnd what'd they do?\n\n560\n00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.100\nThe business sends us every\none of their PowerPoints.\n\n561\n00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.300\nWe were flooded with requests.\n\n562\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.390\nWe changed the model a little bit,\nwe charged.\n\n563\n00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.600\nIt was not a high fee, but we did\na cross charge back to the business, so\n\n564\n00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.880\nthey had some skin in the game.\n\n565\n00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.070\nAnd when they had to pay for\nit they said, you know what,\n\n566\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.840\nyou're right these 200,\nwe're never going to deliver those anyway.\n\n567\n00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.110\nSo rather than do the due diligence of\nactually determining which ones they\n\n568\n00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.690\nactually needed to convert they just\nsent us all of them when it was free but\n\n569\n00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.317\nwhen we charged for\nit we were actually influencing demand.\n\n570\n00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:25.930\nThey'd say, okay I'll have a closer look.\n\n571\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.010\nSo sometimes that business data is going\nto be very vital and also you can kind of.\n\n572\n00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:35.890\nMaybe guide them toward the effective\napproach to this instead of sending all of\n\n573\n00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.570\nthem they can send just\nthe ones they absolutely need.\n\n574\n00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.720\nRight?\n\n575\n00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.870\nOf course financial data's\ngoing to come in here.\n\n576\n00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.450\nWhat's it going to cost\nto upgrade the servers.\n\n577\n00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.080\nWhat's it gonna cost\nto get more bandwidth.\n\n578\n00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.680\nAs we were talking about\nthe scenario with the sales people.\n\n579\n00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.390\nOnce a quarter, coming in on\nthe other side of that WAN link and\n\n580\n00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:53.930\nhaving unsuccessful.\n\n581\n00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.197\nAttempts to do the learning.\n\n582\n00:31:56.197 --> 00:31:59.600\nRather than invest in an expensive\nupgrade to the network,\n\n583\n00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.763\nwe came up with a way to put content on\nthe other side of this slow LAN link.\n\n584\n00:32:03.763 --> 00:32:06.546\nThey were happy, the network\nwas singing along just fine for\n\n585\n00:32:06.546 --> 00:32:08.193\nall the other business processes.\n\n586\n00:32:08.193 --> 00:32:12.178\nSo why invest in a big upgrade when\nthere's another cost effective\n\n587\n00:32:12.178 --> 00:32:13.480\nalternative?\n\n588\n00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.310\nWe couldn't have made that determination\nwithout cost data, without financial data.\n\n589\n00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.880\nSo they kinda feed into this whole\nidea of capacity management.\n\n590\n00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.950\nWhat can we spend?\n\n591\n00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.526\nWhat's a wise way to spend it?\n\n592\n00:32:25.731 --> 00:32:29.380\nSo, critical success factors and\nkey performance indicators.\n\n593\n00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.270\nThe critical success factor,\nwhy have capacity management?\n\n594\n00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.530\nTest takers, I highly recommend,\n\n595\n00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.340\nif you wanna do review on any\ngiven process, fast forward to\n\n596\n00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:46.240\nthe part of the lecture that deals with\ncritical success factors and KPIs.\n\n597\n00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.880\nBecause, if you understand them fully,\n\n598\n00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.520\nyou really do understand\nthe process that's in question.\n\n599\n00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.625\nSo what is a critical success factor for\ncapacity management?\n\n600\n00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:58.229\nIt's understanding, accurately,\nthe business forecast.\n\n601\n00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.150\nSo you have these forecasts of demand,\nunderstood.\n\n602\n00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:07.550\nAnd you have reduced variances between\nthe business and the capacity plans.\n\n603\n00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:12.595\nSo if you anticipate 500 a month,\nif you can\n\n604\n00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:16.705\nget that forecast understood, you'll build\nthe appropriate capacity for 500 a month.\n\n605\n00:33:17.885 --> 00:33:19.275\nSo reduce those variances.\n\n606\n00:33:19.275 --> 00:33:21.665\nIf you only got 300,\nyou might have over built.\n\n607\n00:33:21.665 --> 00:33:24.685\nIf you got 3,000,\nyou obviously didn't build big enough.\n\n608\n00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:29.215\nSo try to reduce those variances, it's\npart of the key performance indicators.\n\n609\n00:33:29.215 --> 00:33:30.845\nAnother critical success factor.\n\n610\n00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:33.195\nKnowledge of the available technologies.\n\n611\n00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.900\nKnowing what's available.\n\n612\n00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.170\nAgain, several years ago, elastic capacity\nmanagement was not even in scope.\n\n613\n00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.290\nIt wasn't that long ago.\n\n614\n00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:48.315\nSo some of the key performance indicators\nof knowing what technologies are available\n\n615\n00:33:48.315 --> 00:33:51.995\nis the reduction in the SLA breaches.\n\n616\n00:33:51.995 --> 00:33:53.735\nYou're meeting the right technology.\n\n617\n00:33:53.735 --> 00:33:57.435\nYou're providing the right technology\ntowards the right purposes.\n\n618\n00:33:58.465 --> 00:34:03.585\nAnd you have appropriate timing of\npurchases, you're buying the right things.\n\n619\n00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:07.525\nAgain, appropriate timing of purchases,\nor deciding not to purchase.\n\n620\n00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:12.550\nWe didn't buy more bandwidth for the sales\npeople at the other side of the WAN link.\n\n621\n00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.410\nWe didn't do that, so the timing of that\nparticular purchase was actually delayed.\n\n622\n00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.050\nThat's something you\ncan help with as well.\n\n623\n00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.510\nAbility to match capacity\nwith business needs.\n\n624\n00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.380\nClearly, that's a critical success factor.\n\n625\n00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.755\nThat is the ultimate goal\nof capacity management,\n\n626\n00:34:26.755 --> 00:34:29.504\nmatching capacity with business needs.\n\n627\n00:34:29.504 --> 00:34:33.060\nPretty straightforward.\n\n628\n00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.330\nAll right, challenges and risks.\n\n629\n00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.260\nYou might recall that a challenge,\nin IT terms, a challenge is a risk.\n\n630\n00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.030\nThere's a 100% chance,\n100% chance of happening.\n\n631\n00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:47.220\nYou will face this particular\nissue in capacity management.\n\n632\n00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.120\nYou will have difficulty obtaining\nbusiness strategy information.\n\n633\n00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.580\nIt's hard to, again, even if we were\nwise enough to ask the questions about,\n\n634\n00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.650\nhow many power points do you have, and\nhow many to you want to turn back to us?\n\n635\n00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.510\nThe business would say,\nI don't got time for\n\n636\n00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.750\nyou, go away, I'm trying to find more oil.\n\n637\n00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:07.650\nI'm not trying to convert PowerPoints,\ngo away IT,\n\n638\n00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.920\nI didn't want to talk to you right now.\n\n639\n00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.040\nSo that's gonna be a challenge,\nbecause they won't necessarily know\n\n640\n00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.290\nyour in their business and\nthey want IT to stay in their corner.\n\n641\n00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:20.570\nWe got our business to do,\nthat's just part of the dynamic of this.\n\n642\n00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.800\nSo that's the challenge you're gonna face,\nvery likely.\n\n643\n00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.500\nCombining different\ncomponent information for\n\n644\n00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.540\na single unified component capacity view.\n\n645\n00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.245\nIn other words,\n\n646\n00:35:30.245 --> 00:35:36.365\nyou're trying to build the composite\ncapacity plan by understanding each one.\n\n647\n00:35:36.365 --> 00:35:37.890\nThat's a challenge, it is hard to do.\n\n648\n00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.850\nHow much disk space do you need?\n\n649\n00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.490\nHow much CPU?\n\n650\n00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.450\nAnd how much memory do you need?\n\n651\n00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.170\nSo let's just take CPU, memory and disk.\n\n652\n00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.950\nThose three are related.\n\n653\n00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.650\nThey're not monolithic.\n\n654\n00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.590\nEach one of them is separate,\nbut they're also interrelated.\n\n655\n00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.080\nSo it's gonna be a challenge for\nhow can you get this composite information\n\n656\n00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.960\nregarding component capacity\nin a meaningful way.\n\n657\n00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.430\nThat's where modeling comes into play.\n\n658\n00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.200\nAnalyzing all this data.\n\n659\n00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.850\nAnalysis paralysis it's often called.\n\n660\n00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.790\nWe have so much to look at,\nwe can't move forward.\n\n661\n00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.320\nWe're spending so much time analyzing,\nwe're not getting it done.\n\n662\n00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.280\nAs Daniel said,\ndone is better than perfect.\n\n663\n00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.210\nYou don't wanna get lost in the data.\n\n664\n00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.680\nSo you're definitely\ngonna find a challenge.\n\n665\n00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.870\nHow can you get on top of this?\n\n666\n00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.650\nThe clue is already in the lecture,\nby the way, modeling and trending.\n\n667\n00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.520\nComing up with repeatable models so you're\nnot reinventing the wheel every time for\n\n668\n00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.630\nyour analysis.\n\n669\n00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:39.481\nSo you can have this universe of possible\nquestions narrowed down into some\n\n670\n00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:41.710\noperable models.\n\n671\n00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.300\nImplementing the right tools and making\nsure you have the right threshold volumes.\n\n672\n00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.940\nYou know what the thresholds are and\nyou've got tools to manage against those.\n\n673\n00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.970\nIt's gonna be a challenge.\n\n674\n00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.010\nIt's not a walk in the park,\nthis particular process.\n\n675\n00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:57.410\nIt could be difficult to engineer but,\nas we've talked about,\n\n676\n00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.120\nthe value is also there.\n\n677\n00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.140\nRelated to those challenges of\nsomething we've already seen.\n\n678\n00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.320\nThe business doesn't care,\nthe business doesn't give you information.\n\n679\n00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.640\nService capacity or component capacity\nare considered in isolation, and\n\n680\n00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.510\nnot considered together.\n\n681\n00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:19.570\nThat relates to the aggregation\nof the data you have.\n\n682\n00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.710\nHeavy emphasis on component capacity,\nso you only focus on the technology.\n\n683\n00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.560\nAs I mentioned before, we built a very\ngood learning management system.\n\n684\n00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.650\nWe were very lacking on\nthe learning management service.\n\n685\n00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.900\nWe weren't ready for the demand that\nwe got, in my particular experience.\n\n686\n00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.400\nSo that's just an example of how,\nif you get in front of it,\n\n687\n00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.440\nyou won't have reputation loss or\nupset customers, or\n\n688\n00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.880\na delay in delivering the value your\nservice was intended to deliver.\n\n689\n00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.990\nYou get too bureaucratic.\n\n690\n00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.800\nData overload, which is also one of\nthe challenges, they kind of go together.\n\n691\n00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.967\nAll right.\n\n692\n00:37:58.997 --> 00:38:01.180\nRoles and responsibilities.\n\n693\n00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.910\nPretty short list here.\n\n694\n00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.500\nI mean, pretty long list, but\nit all boils down to this.\n\n695\n00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.180\nMake sure you have someone that owns this.\n\n696\n00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:13.840\nSomeone owns the process and a wise person\nmanages the process, or wise people.\n\n697\n00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.990\nAnd make sure you have often and\nearly engagement with the business so\n\n698\n00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.850\nthat you can keep up on the business\ncapacity side as much as the component and\n\n699\n00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.610\nservice capacity.\n\n700\n00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.390\nSo come up with these activities\nas you play them out.\n\n701\n00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.070\nWe've talked about each one of these.\n\n702\n00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.910\nReport the incidents.\n\n703\n00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:34.370\nCategorize them appropriately,\nas a capacity issue, a performance issue,\n\n704\n00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:39.690\nas opposed to some other topic, so\nyou can do your problem management\n\n705\n00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:45.195\ntrend analysis and, therefore, root out\nthe underlying causes of your failures.\n\n706\n00:38:45.195 --> 00:38:47.535\nAs we talk about availability\na little bit later on,\n\n707\n00:38:47.535 --> 00:38:51.355\nwe'll look at some measurements in place\nthat could point to capacity issues and\n\n708\n00:38:51.355 --> 00:38:55.345\nvice versa, how capacity issues\ncould point to availability issues.\n\n709\n00:38:55.345 --> 00:38:56.945\nWe'll try to connect\nthe dots there as well.\n\n710\n00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:02.474\nAnd be often and early with your\nreporting against capacity.\n\n711\n00:39:02.474 --> 00:39:06.701\nProduce regular management reports,\nbeing transparent about how good you are,\n\n712\n00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:08.609\nor how good you ain't, so to speak.\n\n713\n00:39:08.609 --> 00:39:11.034\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n714\n00:39:11.034 --> 00:39:15.240\nthat completes the lecture\npart of capacity management.\n\n715\n00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.630\nI invite you to some self study.\n\n716\n00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:20.430\nThere's an exercise in the downloads\nthat's related to this.\n\n717\n00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.439\nThis one walks you through,\nsuggesting about 45 minutes.\n\n718\n00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.120\nAnd then, there's this one called,\n\n719\n00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.610\nCapacity Management activity,\nthat suggests about 20 minutes.\n\n720\n00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.520\nAgain, available for\n\n721\n00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:37.320\ndownload in the show files up above\nme here of the first episode.\n\n722\n00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.980\nAnd it's a zip file.\n\n723\n00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:45.920\nUnzip that and you'll find this this\nactivity, exercise, there, yep.\n\n724\n00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.584\n&gt;&gt; All right Terry, capacity management\nis definitely a bit of, well,\n\n725\n00:39:50.584 --> 00:39:52.578\nit's not very complicated.\n\n726\n00:39:52.578 --> 00:39:55.500\nI think anybody's that is watching this\nwould understand what you are saying,\n\n727\n00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.920\nall of the concepts make sense.\n\n728\n00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.630\nBut it is very nuanced, and\nthat is where we have to pay attention.\n\n729\n00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.507\nWe have to make sure that we understand\nthe minutia and all the little bells and\n\n730\n00:40:02.507 --> 00:40:04.099\nwhistles that they throw on top of this,\nso\n\n731\n00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:06.509\nthat we know everything that\ngoes within capacity management.\n\n732\n00:40:06.509 --> 00:40:10.002\nMight take you a little bit so that you\nknow you understand each and every one of\n\n733\n00:40:10.002 --> 00:40:13.355\nthem and know which one of those are,\nas far as capacity management goes.\n\n734\n00:40:13.355 --> 00:40:15.606\nSo make sure you really\npay attention to that,\n\n735\n00:40:15.606 --> 00:40:19.358\nsince you have that grasp by the time\nyou enter any testing booth, as it were,\n\n736\n00:40:19.358 --> 00:40:21.630\nso that you don't get\nthose questions wrong.\n\n737\n00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:25.330\nI wanna make sure you get the fives, and\nnot the threes, or the ones or the zeros,\n\n738\n00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:25.993\ndefinitely.\n\n739\n00:40:25.993 --> 00:40:27.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That being said we have blown\n\n740\n00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.550\ntime for this episode, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and call it a day.\n\n741\n00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.150\nWe do thank you, Terry, for joining us.\n\n742\n00:40:32.150 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.788\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.970\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.434\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are hitting you today with more\n\n6\n00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.174\non our ITIL PPO, that's right.\n\n7\n00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:27.930\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\ntoday, our good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.380\nTerry, welcome back man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.980\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, happy to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.160\nWe got some good topic here,\navailability management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.180\nA very important topic, maybe the gold\nstandard of the warranty processes.\n\n12\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.390\nWe have capacity management,\nand previous episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.310\nNow focusing on availability management,\nand obviously they're related.\n\n14\n00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.860\nIf you don't have sufficient capacity,\nthings can fall over, and\n\n15\n00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.980\ntherefore be unavailable.\n\n16\n00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.270\nSo, these don't operate in a vacuum,\nor an island all by themselves.\n\n17\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.360\nSo, keep that in mind as\nwe learn these things.\n\n18\n00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.320\nOkay, so\nas we look at the slide deck here,\n\n19\n00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.750\nand look at some of the objectives\nof availability management.\n\n20\n00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.990\nAs you can see I annotated he's as\nproactive and reactive as we go through\n\n21\n00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.370\nthese, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nbelabor these for a little bit.\n\n22\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.790\nProduce and maintain an availability plan.\n\n23\n00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.960\nThis is done at the service design level,\nand it is intended to be proactive.\n\n24\n00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.320\nYou're coming up with a plan for\n\n25\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.890\nhow you're going to ensure availability\nof performance is going to be met, right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.960\nSo you have an SLA,\n\n27\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.460\nyou have a general understanding of\nwhen the users are gonna be there.\n\n28\n00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.231\nIs it need to be available Monday through\nFriday, nine to five, is it 24/7,\n\n29\n00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:37.550\nis it 99.9% availability acceptable,\nis 98% availability acceptable?\n\n30\n00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.330\nBut you have those general\nrequirements in play, and\n\n31\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.970\nyou proactively plan to meet\nthose requirements, right?\n\n32\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.330\nProvide guidance and\nadvice on availability issues.\n\n33\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.990\nThis is more reactive.\n\n34\n00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.950\nIf you have ongoing failures,\nyou're providing guidance and\n\n35\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.420\nadvice on how to fix them.\n\n36\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.110\nSo that's kind of the reactive part of it,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.830\nManage service and resource availability\nperformance and improvement.\n\n38\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.640\nWell, this is kind of operational,\nit's reactive, but\n\n39\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.450\nalso has a significant proactive aspect\nto it in that this idea of improvement is\n\n40\n00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.150\nyou're looking at the landscape\nacross perhaps multiple services and\n\n41\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170\nsaying just how good you are at\nthis availability thing.\n\n42\n00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.630\nDo you have lots of services\nfalling over often?\n\n43\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.050\nDo you have just a few\nservices falling over often?\n\n44\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.350\nDo you have one service that\ndoesn't fail very often, but\n\n45\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.100\nwhen it does it goes down for days?\n\n46\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.730\nThat kinda thing.\n\n47\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750\nSo understanding the nuances of\nyour availability management\n\n48\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.720\nregime is a proactive nature as well.\n\n49\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.573\nAssist with availability related incidents\nand problem of course that's reactive.\n\n50\n00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:42.171\nIf something falls over you need to do the\nroot cause analysis of why it fell over\n\n51\n00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.360\nand root out that problem and\neliminate it.\n\n52\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.370\nBut that has obviously reactive\nbecause you have issues.\n\n53\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.198\nThings have fallen over.\n\n54\n00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:54.460\nAnd then assess impact and\nchange requests on availability.\n\n55\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.370\nThis is proactive, as well.\n\n56\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.474\nThrough the change management process,\n\n57\n00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:01.426\nyou might discern that\nyou're adding 5,000 users.\n\n58\n00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:03.620\nIs that gonna affect availability?\n\n59\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.030\nCould that tip the capacity scale\nbeyond tolerance levels and\n\n60\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.290\ncause your services to fail?\n\n61\n00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.680\nOr you evaluate a change request and\nrealize you're adding some architectural\n\n62\n00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.015\ncomponents, such as a video\nprovisioning system, that sorta thing.\n\n63\n00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.975\nSo, capacity, again, is gonna be assessing\nwhether or not you have the appropriate\n\n64\n00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:28.875\ncomponent capacity for this, but\nit also affects availability.\n\n65\n00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.425\nSo, again, you, kinda,\nsee the connections between them, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.635\nSo, we'll be reinforcing these\nreactive-proactives as we go through\n\n67\n00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:41.060\nseveral of the slides in this deck, okay.\n\n68\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.710\nAvailability management is alive and\nwell in service design.\n\n69\n00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.340\nAnd it's also involved in implementation.\n\n70\n00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.790\nSo when it goes through transition,\n\n71\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.120\navailability management's there to make\nsure that everything's set up right or\n\n72\n00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.600\nthat all the measurements are in place or\ngoing to be in place.\n\n73\n00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.770\nAnd therefore making sure that you can\nhave ongoing improvement later on.\n\n74\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.130\nRight, so it's alive and\nwell in service design.\n\n75\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.270\nIt's there through transition,\navailability management is to make sure\n\n76\n00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.830\nthat the appropriate\nmeasures are brought in.\n\n77\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.770\nAnd of course,\nit's there in operations to actually see\n\n78\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.720\nthe effects of the availability plan\nto see that it's working, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:18.218 --> 00:04:23.110\nAll operational services.\n\n80\n00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.170\nSo everything that you care to operate\nin your environment as a service is\n\n81\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.850\nwithin scope of availability management.\n\n82\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.720\nNew services, existing services that\nalready have agreements underneath them,\n\n83\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.150\nservice level agreements and\nservice level requirements.\n\n84\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.750\nAnd all IT services and\ncomponents that may impact availability.\n\n85\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.610\nSo, it's not just the application at\nthe top, it's all the servers and\n\n86\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.760\nall the databases, the network,\neverything underneath it as well.\n\n87\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.550\nSo supporting services as well as\ncustomer facing services are in play.\n\n88\n00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.008\nAll right?\n\n89\n00:04:56.726 --> 00:04:57.640\nWhy?\n\n90\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.550\nWhy would you do this?\n\n91\n00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.910\n&gt;&gt; The immortal question.\n\n92\n00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n93\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.290\nThe immortal question.\n\n94\n00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.810\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n95\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.820\nwhy, what value does availability\nmanagement bring to the business?\n\n96\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.020\nIt's actually probably the gold\nstandard when it comes to\n\n97\n00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.390\nwhat customers care about.\n\n98\n00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.410\nOf course they want it to\nhave functionality but\n\n99\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.150\nif it's not there when they expect it to\nbe there your reputation is tarnished.\n\n100\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.440\nAnd I appreciate the upper case there.\n\n101\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.730\nCustomer loyalty is over.\n\n102\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.540\nYou can't expect a loyal customer.\n\n103\n00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.970\nYou're just trying to retain\nthem cause if it fails,\n\n104\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.740\nyou'll go somewhere else if you can,\nright.\n\n105\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.850\nThat sort of thing.\n\n106\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.760\nSo it is,\n\n107\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.820\nif it's not availability when people, when\nyour customers think it should be, you're\n\n108\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.110\ngoing to lose potentially your reputation,\nbut you're also going to lose customers.\n\n109\n00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.930\nNot a good prospect.\n\n110\n00:05:48.072 --> 00:05:51.629\nSome guiding principles related to\navailability management, again,\n\n111\n00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.711\nkinda riding the same horse we're seeing\nbefore is that things are gonna go wrong,\n\n112\n00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.000\navailability is not a perfect science.\n\n113\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.026\nThings will fall over.\n\n114\n00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:04.180\nIT deals with complex\nconfiguration of systems and\n\n115\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.790\nservices and\nin that complexity things can go wrong.\n\n116\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.330\nSo failures are actually tolerant or\n\n117\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.240\ntolerable by many customers they\nexpect that it's not perfect.\n\n118\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.940\nBut what's your response to it?\n\n119\n00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.850\nRight?\nHow quickly can you recover?\n\n120\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.060\nRight?\nHow often does that happen?\n\n121\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.700\nRight?\nSure it's gonna happen every now and then.\n\n122\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.750\nKeep that limited, right.\n\n123\n00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.060\nAlso, recognize that availability is only\nas strong as the weakest link, right?\n\n124\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.980\nIf there is a single point of failure\nsomewhere in your infrastructure or\n\n125\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.620\nyour architecture, if that fails,\nthe whole thing comes tumbling down.\n\n126\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.490\nObviously, availability could be affected.\n\n127\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.630\nBy the way, that single point of failure\nand the analysis therein is very close to\n\n128\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.660\nanother process that we will be\ndiscussing called continuity management.\n\n129\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.390\nContinuity management is trying to discern\nthose single points of failure and\n\n130\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.740\nmake sure that they are shored up, right.\n\n131\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.790\nSo continuity and\naffordability, capacity and\n\n132\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.480\navailability, interrelated processes,\nokay.\n\n133\n00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.900\nAll right, service availability\nversus component availability.\n\n134\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.920\nProbably the best way\nto teach this aspect.\n\n135\n00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.765\nIs it possible for a component to fail and\nthe service still be available?\n\n136\n00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.175\n&gt;&gt; I would assume so.\n\n137\n00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:15.845\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n138\n00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:21.315\nIf you can imagine an architecture where\nyou have several servers in a cluster.\n\n139\n00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.150\nAnd if one of them fails you still\nhave three more to go, right?\n\n140\n00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.870\nThree more to keep the service available.\n\n141\n00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.120\nNow, there is some impact to\nthat perhaps going around.\n\n142\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.230\nMaybe performance slows down,\n\n143\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.010\nmaybe you can't quite handle as many\nusers, maybe, right, or maybe not.\n\n144\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.510\nMaybe it's just that robust, so\nif you lose something, what about disks?\n\n145\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.630\nIf you lose a disk, is there an array\nto ray or in a storage array?\n\n146\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.510\nYou have the ability to\nsurvive a disk failure, right?\n\n147\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.930\nSo, components can fail and\nthe service should still be available.\n\n148\n00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.202\nWhen you also consider service\navailability you're also considering\n\n149\n00:07:53.202 --> 00:07:56.269\nthings that are beyond\ntechnical in some regards.\n\n150\n00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:01.176\nIs the service available if there's\nnot a computer for somebody?\n\n151\n00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:01.712\nRight.\n\n152\n00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:04.692\nIt is not that the computer is broken or\nunavailable,\n\n153\n00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:07.750\nit is just you didn't provision\nthe computer in time.\n\n154\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:12.630\nSo some things like that could also play\ninto the mix of service availability.\n\n155\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.260\nRight.\n\n156\n00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.470\nSo understand the difference\nbetween component availability and\n\n157\n00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.800\nservice availability is important but\n\n158\n00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.422\nactually, just keep in mind that\navailability is accountable for both.\n\n159\n00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:26.526\nIn the end service availability as\nwell as the minute detail of component\n\n160\n00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:27.880\navailability as well.\n\n161\n00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:35.550\nSome language has you know,\nsome language availability management.\n\n162\n00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.070\nAvailability itself is as you can see\nthere, availability of a service or\n\n163\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.870\ncomponent to perform as required, yup.\n\n164\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.840\nAnd as a measurement what availability is,\nis the percentage of time\n\n165\n00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.520\nthat you've promised to be up,\nthat you're actually up.\n\n166\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.920\nSo let us do the math for a little bit.\n\n167\n00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.660\nIf you promise to be available\nMonday through Friday, 9 to 5.\n\n168\n00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.720\nThat happens to be 40 hours\nthat you've promised to be up.\n\n169\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.940\nIf during that time frame, and during that\nwindow you're supposed to be available,\n\n170\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.770\nyou had a four hour outage that week.\n\n171\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:14.120\nFour hours is one-tenth of 40,\nso you had 10% of down time.\n\n172\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.830\nAvailability would be measured as 90%\nthat week, you had 90% availability.\n\n173\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.170\n&gt;&gt; So this is in our SLAs we look for\nthose little nines And\n\n174\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.761\nhow many nines do I get right-\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n175\n00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:25.964\n&gt;&gt; At that portion of the-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n176\n00:09:25.964 --> 00:09:29.361\nSo you're negotiating your agreements with\ncustomers, how available are you gonna be?\n\n177\n00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:32.577\nAre you gonna be available at 99.9%,\n98% right,\n\n178\n00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:36.340\nwhat's the acceptable threshold for\nthe business, right?\n\n179\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.750\nSome things are more critical than others\n\n180\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.760\nThe customer doesn't wanna say I want to\nbe there all the time, no failures, right.\n\n181\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.895\n&gt;&gt; That usually involves\nwriting a fatter cheque.\n\n182\n00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:47.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it does.\n\n183\n00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.760\nSo you're right, because it costs money\nto build that kind of architecture.\n\n184\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.030\nSo that's availability.\n\n185\n00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.950\nSo back to the slide,\nyou could look at reliability now.\n\n186\n00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:00.760\nSo reliability is the, basically,\nhow often does it fail?\n\n187\n00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.028\nAnd a good metric for\nthat is meantime between failures, right?\n\n188\n00:10:05.028 --> 00:10:13.220\nIf you have a failure on Monday and\na failure on Tuesday,\n\n189\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.430\nWednesday, if you're failing often, that's\na different problem than maintainability.\n\n190\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:23.180\nMaintainability is how long does it take\nyou to get the service back up, right?\n\n191\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.510\nSo reliability, how often it fails,\nmaintainability,\n\n192\n00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.470\nhow quickly you can restore.\n\n193\n00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.100\nThey're different issues, right?\n\n194\n00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.890\nIf you have, in that scenario where you\nhad a four hour outage, four hours of\n\n195\n00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:42.480\noutage in that one week, 90% availability,\nwas that one outage that last four hours?\n\n196\n00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.360\nOr was it 40 outages that lasted what,\n60 seconds?\n\n197\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.400\nAm I doing the math wrong maybe,\nyeah 60 seconds, right?\n\n198\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.825\nThey're different problems to solve,\nif it's falling over all the time,\n\n199\n00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:55.501\nthat's a different issue to\nsolve than well it fell down and\n\n200\n00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:58.040\nit took us forever to bring it back up.\n\n201\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.720\nSo measuring reliability and\nmaintainability\n\n202\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.380\ngive you that nuanced approach to the\noverall arching metric of availability.\n\n203\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.300\nWe know we are 90% available,\nwhich when we know that wasn't good,\n\n204\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.360\nthat we didn't satisfy our SLA, right?\n\n205\n00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.880\nBut what was the nature of this\navailability, reliability or\n\n206\n00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.510\nmaintainability?\n\n207\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.150\nAnd then serviceability\nis just the word used\n\n208\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.850\nto describe these factors\nwe just talked about.\n\n209\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.970\nAvailability, reliability, and\n\n210\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.980\nmaintainability, as it relates\nto a third party supplier.\n\n211\n00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.840\nThis is just a word we use to describe\nhow serviceable is that supplier.\n\n212\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.488\nHow good are they at availability,\nreliability, and maintainability.\n\n213\n00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.007\nAll right.\n\n214\n00:11:40.374 --> 00:11:43.324\nSo when you consider\navailability management\n\n215\n00:11:43.324 --> 00:11:46.730\nyou should consider vital\nbusiness functions.\n\n216\n00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.680\nAll this is really trying to describe is,\n\n217\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.190\nsome things deserve higher\navailability than others.\n\n218\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.450\nFrom my own experience, I once\nmanaged a learning-management system.\n\n219\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.515\nI was a technical operations manager,\nI think my title was, and\n\n220\n00:12:01.515 --> 00:12:05.960\nI was basically assists admin with people\nthat work for me, based out of Manitou.\n\n221\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.939\nAnd I was tasked with designing and\narchitecting and\n\n222\n00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:19.040\nmaintaining a learning management system\nthat had five nines availability.\n\n223\n00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.610\nThat's 99.999% of the time\nit was available.\n\n224\n00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.280\nAnd when I was tasked that I really asked,\nI said, why?\n\n225\n00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.420\nI'm not really sure.\n\n226\n00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.720\nActually when I asked it I wasn't\nsure what five nine's meant.\n\n227\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.960\nI did the math,\nit's basically minutes a year.\n\n228\n00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.927\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of up time.\n\n229\n00:12:34.927 --> 00:12:40.330\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of up time and\nit begged the question.\n\n230\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.580\nWhy would a learning management system\nrise up to that level of expense and\n\n231\n00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.320\narchitecture, right.\n\n232\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.710\nAnd we finally ferreted that out and we\nlowered the standard, it didn't have to be\n\n233\n00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.100\nfive nines, it was not worth chasing it\nfor the vitality of learning management.\n\n234\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.920\nNow, a heart monitoring of service,\nin an ICU Unit.\n\n235\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.959\nMaybe that should be at the head.\n\n236\n00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.532\n&gt;&gt; I want like five hundred and nines.\n\n237\n00:13:05.532 --> 00:13:06.055\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:13:06.055 --> 00:13:06.585\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n239\n00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:10.200\nSo, really I kind of stark examples there,\nbut vital business functions,\n\n240\n00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.080\nyou’re really trying to weigh\nin on what’s vital, right?\n\n241\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.680\nAnd, design accordingly.\n\n242\n00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.080\nThat’s the theme, here right?\n\n243\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.868\nDoes it have to be there all the time, or\n\n244\n00:13:17.868 --> 00:13:21.750\ncan you accept some failure in\nthe business not just go crazy, right?\n\n245\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.719\nSo, keep that\n&gt;&gt; Hospitals are actually an interesting\n\n246\n00:13:26.719 --> 00:13:29.620\ncase study if you're,\nif you wanna look into availability.\n\n247\n00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.480\nThey have their own water systems,\nback-up generators for back-up generators,\n\n248\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.510\nyou start getting into because they\nhave to have to keep people alive.\n\n249\n00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about vitality here.\n\n250\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:39.040\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.605\n&gt;&gt; Textbook definition of that word.\n\n252\n00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:41.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n253\n00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Is that people will die if we don't\nhave these services available for them.\n\n254\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.480\nSo if you really want to see\nwhat it takes to maintain\n\n255\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.860\na super high level of availability,\nhospitals are a great place to look.\n\n256\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n257\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.565\nAnd a great example for\nwhat vitality means in\n\n258\n00:13:56.565 --> 00:13:59.415\nrelation to availability management,\nit's a great example for that,\n\n259\n00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:03.305\nand another aspect of that is, I mean, you\ncan have high standards for availability.\n\n260\n00:14:03.305 --> 00:14:07.515\nYou can be willing to\ninvest in a lot of knives.\n\n261\n00:14:07.515 --> 00:14:08.425\nBut whether life or\n\n262\n00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:11.945\ndeath is involved or not, an organization\ncan choose that is your life.\n\n263\n00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:15.780\nBut I suggest that Amazon.com is\npretty concerned about availability.\n\n264\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.115\nAnd I don't think people die if people\ncan't use that service on any given hour,\n\n265\n00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:21.074\nright?\n\n266\n00:14:21.074 --> 00:14:26.547\nSo that said, vitality in their eyes is\nwe need to be available all the time.\n\n267\n00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:29.901\n&gt;&gt; Right, cuz how much money does Amazon\nlose if their down for two minutes?\n\n268\n00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:30.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n269\n00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, two minutes of a global\noperation is large as Amazon,\n\n270\n00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.260\nthat's a lot of money.\n\n271\n00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.130\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n272\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.310\nSo, definitely this is a great example.\n\n273\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.870\nVitality, life, death, but\nvitality could be invested in for\n\n274\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.400\nall types of business reasons, not just\nlife and death reasons, so good examples.\n\n275\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.230\nAnother aspect of availability management\nand what availability management needs to\n\n276\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:57.140\nenable is the ability to capture\nmetrics about availability.\n\n277\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.400\nSo availability management needs to\nbe on the forefront of understanding\n\n278\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.500\nwhat success looks like.\n\n279\n00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.237\nLet's say 99.9%.\n\n280\n00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:05.485\nWell, how did you ever come\nup with that 99% percent.\n\n281\n00:15:05.485 --> 00:15:09.644\nIn that example where I mentioned,\nyou had four hours of outage this week,\n\n282\n00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:11.630\nhow is that defined?\n\n283\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.490\nRight, was it defined from the first time\none of your monitor's said the service is\n\n284\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.778\ndown or was it from the time one of your\ncustomers called the service desk, right?\n\n285\n00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:23.600\nObviously there's a gap,\nthere could be a gap there.\n\n286\n00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.620\nMaybe it went down six hours before that,\nand no one noticed it.\n\n287\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.740\nWhich one do you care about?\n\n288\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.480\nHow do you want to monitor it, right?\n\n289\n00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.930\nSo coming up with ways of measuring,\n\n290\n00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.080\nmonitoring is closely\nrelated to the measuring.\n\n291\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.960\nBut coming with the ways\nyou want to measure this.\n\n292\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.290\nHave your reliability metrics.\n\n293\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.500\nHave your maintainability metrics, right?\n\n294\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.360\nOf course, have your availability metrics.\n\n295\n00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.720\nHow do you do that, right?\n\n296\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.489\nThat doesn't just invent itself.\n\n297\n00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.227\nSo availability management is on point for\n\n298\n00:15:49.227 --> 00:15:54.105\nmaking sure you have the availability\nto measure these things, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:55.856\nI appreciate the message\nhere on the lower right.\n\n300\n00:15:55.856 --> 00:16:00.467\nAs you go to full screen,\nIf you don't measure or you can't.\n\n301\n00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:04.941\nIf you can't measure,\nyou can't manage, etc., right?\n\n302\n00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:07.520\nIf you can't manage, you can't prove it.\n\n303\n00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.220\nAnd if you're not measuring it,\nyou probably don't care.\n\n304\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.500\nIf you don't control it,\nthen it's out of control.\n\n305\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.370\nOr if you can't control it.\n\n306\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n307\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.920\n&gt;&gt; Nothing you can do about it anyway.\n\n308\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n309\n00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:21.908\nSo there's a point there.\n\n310\n00:16:21.908 --> 00:16:25.740\nAll right, good.\n\n311\n00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.010\nSo we talked a bit about reactive and\nproactive earlier.\n\n312\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.750\nAnd I'm gonna refresh some of\nthese things as we go through.\n\n313\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:40.380\nJust remember that availability management\nneeds to be proactive and also reactive.\n\n314\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.920\nIt has to have both things in play.\n\n315\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.620\nNow this is a rather busy chart.\n\n316\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.460\nNot gonna belabor the details long and\nhard here.\n\n317\n00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.920\nBut look at this upper box here.\n\n318\n00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.710\nIs what's considered reactive.\n\n319\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.185\nJust a little bit of nuance here.\n\n320\n00:16:56.564 --> 00:16:59.633\nNotice that monitoring,\nmeasuring, analysis, and\n\n321\n00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:02.420\nreporting is considered reactive.\n\n322\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.800\nI often ask students in the foundation\ncourse, is monitoring reactive or\n\n323\n00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.250\nproactive?\n\n324\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.160\nAnd they get their thinking caps on.\n\n325\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.960\nYou can see them thinking it all through.\n\n326\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.300\nAnd they come to the conclusion that\nmonitoring is a proactive activity.\n\n327\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.720\nAnd I get it,\n\n328\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.710\nthe synapses are firing in the right\ndirection if that's your conclusion.\n\n329\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.170\nRight?\n\n330\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:28.930\nSo if monitoring can be visualized\nas a proactive activity,\n\n331\n00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.890\nthen why is it here in the reactive box?\n\n332\n00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.500\nI want to hone in on that.\n\n333\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.380\nIf you wait until you\nare operating the service\n\n334\n00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.220\nto evaluate availability, you're,\nby the definition, are gonna be reactive.\n\n335\n00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.690\nYou're gonna be responding\nto what you have.\n\n336\n00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.060\nSo what this is trying to teach\nis that the proactive activities,\n\n337\n00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.720\nif you look in the lower boxes,\nyou do risk assessment.\n\n338\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.270\nYou understand your architectures,\nwhich ones are good, which ones are bad.\n\n339\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.130\nYou understand the number of views,\nyou understand the capacity issues.\n\n340\n00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.550\nAll of those things are well and\nunderstood.\n\n341\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.410\nRight?\n\n342\n00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.330\nThat's proactive.\n\n343\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:09.760\nIf you're thinking about it holistically,\nand building it to be fit for use, right?\n\n344\n00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.380\nSo it's gonna be there when\nit's supposed to be there.\n\n345\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.930\nThat's the proactive aspect.\n\n346\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.840\nIf you wait until operations\nto ask these questions,\n\n347\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.370\nyou could have a house of cards\nthat falls over every day.\n\n348\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.720\nThat's really what this\nis trying to teach,\n\n349\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.520\nso I get the logic of monitoring\ncould be considered proactive.\n\n350\n00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.190\nFor instance if you're monitoring\nsomething, and you see that starting to\n\n351\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.330\nfall over, but because you're monitoring,\nyou do something and it doesn't fall over.\n\n352\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.960\n&gt;&gt; That's still reactive.\n\n353\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, in a academic sense, it is.\n\n354\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.590\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is philosophical kind\nof mind driven, cuz you're thinking,\n\n355\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.110\nwell I'm doing something.\n\n356\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.130\nI'm monitoring.\n\n357\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.630\nThat is proactive.\n\n358\n00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.340\nWell technically,\nI think yeah, that is the case.\n\n359\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.420\nThe only result from that\nis reactive measures,\n\n360\n00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.530\nhence the reason we're sticking\nit in the reactive box.\n\n361\n00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.820\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n362\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.170\n&gt;&gt; Definitely appreciate\nthe way the logic flows.\n\n363\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.520\nKeep in mind that, in effect,\n\n364\n00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.130\nphilosophically appreciate\nthe way Daniel referred to that.\n\n365\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.370\nIt really is reactive, and\nthat's not just an academic point.\n\n366\n00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.650\nThe point is this.\n\n367\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.900\nIf you wait until you get into operations\n\n368\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.310\nto ask the availability\nmanagement questions.\n\n369\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.110\nYou probably waited too long.\n\n370\n00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you missed that bus.\n\n371\n00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.120\n&gt;&gt; You missed that bus,\nbecause it could fall over every day.\n\n372\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I've certainly been\n\n373\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.810\nin operations where that was the case.\n\n374\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.890\nThey just kind of assume.\n\n375\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.440\nThey had a general architecture\nthey thought might work.\n\n376\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.220\nBut they didn't really\nunderstand it deeply enough.\n\n377\n00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.750\nThey didn't test it fully enough.\n\n378\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.860\nAll sorts of things.\n\n379\n00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.720\nAll right, so again, availability\nmanagement alive and well proactively,\n\n380\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.055\nand service design.\n\n381\n00:19:37.055 --> 00:19:40.300\nThey're also playing it through in\nservice transition to make sure that\n\n382\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.260\nthe measurements are gonna be in place,\nand\n\n383\n00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.630\nthat testing validates their\navailability and management plan.\n\n384\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.340\nThat yup, indeed,\nit does respond quickly, and\n\n385\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.150\nit doesn't fall over when\nthe 7,000th user hits it.\n\n386\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.180\nThose sorts of things.\n\n387\n00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.950\nAnd of course, it's going to\nbe there in action monitoring\n\n388\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.610\nreactively in operations to how\navailability is being played out.\n\n389\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.070\nOr reliability, or maintainability.\n\n390\n00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.950\nAll right, good deal.\n\n391\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.110\nSo there's your reactive nature.\n\n392\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.350\nTalked about on the one screen, there's\nthe reactive pieces that we saw before.\n\n393\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.790\nMonitoring, measuring, analyzing.\n\n394\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.250\nAnd then, how you go about measuring,\nbig important things here.\n\n395\n00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.210\nWhat was the business impact?\n\n396\n00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.660\nNow, tough one to get here.\n\n397\n00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.170\nIf a service goes down for three hours,\nyou mentioned in your example.\n\n398\n00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.840\nIf Amazon.com goes down for a couple\nminutes, how many sales were lost?\n\n399\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nRight?\n\n400\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.180\nAnd there's the knock off effect.\n\n401\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.890\nWhat reputation was lost?\n\n402\n00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.780\nAre they gonna go over to another\nretailer now because that's happened five\n\n403\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.610\ntimes this week?\n\n404\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.040\nWhat is the impact when\navailability is missing or lacking?\n\n405\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.150\nAre users impacted predictively?\n\n406\n00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.030\nAre you losing money?\n\n407\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.880\nAre you risking life and limb?\n\n408\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.050\nSo related to vital business functions,\nvery closely related to vital\n\n409\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.680\nbusiness functions,\nis this idea of business impact,\n\n410\n00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.460\nas well, also in the wheelhouse\nof continuity management.\n\n411\n00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.390\nPart of the risk assessment of\ncontinuity management is going to inform\n\n412\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.570\navailability management about how robust.\n\n413\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.840\nSo what is the risk of a heart\nmonitor going offline?\n\n414\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.380\nSomeone dies.\n\n415\n00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.700\nOkay, this needs to be five\nnine availability, right?\n\n416\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.230\nAnd another one right next to it that\nhas five nine availability, right?\n\n417\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.490\nThat sort of thing.\n\n418\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.390\nWhat's the business impact if learning\nmanagement system goes down for\n\n419\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.440\nthree hours?\n\n420\n00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.780\nNot so much, right?\n\n421\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.940\nThat kind of thing.\n\n422\n00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.240\nSo the impact analysis is going to\ninform the availability management, and\n\n423\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.640\nimpact analysis is a big part\nof continuity management,\n\n424\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.950\nwhich is the next process\nwe'll talk about.\n\n425\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.440\nOkay?\n\n426\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.680\nSo again, we talked about these\nconcepts as we went through\n\n427\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.510\non the reactive side of things.\n\n428\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.940\nProper availability management can only\nbegin once the IT service provider admits\n\n429\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.400\nand understands how the technology\nsupports the business.\n\n430\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.750\nI say admits, in my own experience,\nIT knew best, hush, customer.\n\n431\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.240\nRight, I've certainly been in\nthose environments, right.\n\n432\n00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.870\nSo turn around and listen, understand the\nimpacts, understand why it matters, right.\n\n433\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.740\nFor us to build a five nine availability\nfor a learning management system,\n\n434\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.290\nIT thought we should do that, and spend\nall that money when we could have been\n\n435\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.382\nspending that money on a service\nthat allowed us to transfer\n\n436\n00:22:17.382 --> 00:22:22.420\nPowerPoints to e-learning\nwould've been a better idea.\n\n437\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.055\n&gt;&gt; That's someone justifying\ntheir certifications and degrees.\n\n438\n00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:25.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n439\n00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.733\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna build the greatest\ninfrastructure anyone has ever seen.\n\n440\n00:22:28.733 --> 00:22:29.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n441\n00:22:29.361 --> 00:22:30.266\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basically it was.\n\n442\n00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:32.289\n[CROSSTALK] As a techno geek, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n443\n00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:33.032\nHe goes.\n\n444\n00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:36.936\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a techno geek getting\nhis geek groove on, basically,\n\n445\n00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:38.380\n[LAUGH] that's right.\n\n446\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.880\nSo we kind of got a sense for what\nreactive means, and that is something you\n\n447\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.760\ndo after it's in operations,\nthrough monitoring and measurement.\n\n448\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:51.160\nYou're going to be analyzing your\navailability after it's operational.\n\n449\n00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.140\nWe're going to look at some of those\nactivities at a very detailed level soon,\n\n450\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.140\nbut we're out of time for now.\n\n451\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, the clock has\ndwindled down to barely anything left for\n\n452\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.610\nus to talk about, but\n\n453\n00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.690\nthe unfortunate thing is is that Terry\nhas a whole lot more to talk about.\n\n454\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.420\nSo looks like we're headed for\none of our famous part twos.\n\n455\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.140\nWe'll enjoy seeing you there and\ncontinuing this conversation.\n\n456\n00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.750\nJoin us with that part two.\n\n457\n00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.560\nDefinitely want to see\nwhat gets into proactive.\n\n458\n00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.150\nWe looked at reactive\ngonna get into proactive.\n\n459\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.955\n&gt;&gt; Got some more reactive first.\n\n460\n00:23:18.955 --> 00:23:21.430\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It's just a torrent of great stuff.\n\n461\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.110\nJoin us for that episode.\n\n462\n00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.750\nWe're going to go

ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.942\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:16.816\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:21.009\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are coming back with\n\n7\n00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.720\nmore on our ITIL PPO series continuing\non availability management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.260\nVery fun topic so far, and, of course,\njoining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050\nagain our good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.340\nTerry, we're glad to have you\nback again today, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.450\n&gt;&gt; Always good to be here and going great.\n\n12\n00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.130\nWe're gonna pick up on\nAvailability Management some more and\n\n13\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.160\ntalking about some of\nthe activities related to\n\n14\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.300\nthe reactive aspect of\nAvailability Management.\n\n15\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.620\nIf you look at the graphic here,\n\n16\n00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.690\nyou'll see that we're going to be talking\nabout the Expanded Incident Lifecycle,\n\n17\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.430\nwhich basically means that you look at\navailability holistically across time.\n\n18\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.870\nThat's a good way to describe it,\n\n19\n00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.470\nit's just a technique to not just monitor\nan event at a time, but look at the events\n\n20\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.530\nas they might play out throughout\nthe lifecycle of a good service.\n\n21\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.020\nAs you look at this, again,\nyou can see there's across time,\n\n22\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.520\nwe have more than one incident here.\n\n23\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.400\nMore than one incident, so\nyou're looking at it more holistically.\n\n24\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.540\nBasically describing in this aspect or\ndescribing when it's been down,\n\n25\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.940\nwhen it's been up, and\nhow long it's taking to get back, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.480\nSo as we look at this,\nyou'll see the detection, right?\n\n27\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.130\nHow it's detected is another issue,\nbut our tools in place\n\n28\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.130\nto let you detect this or do you have\nto wait for users to call, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.240\nHopefully, you have some tools in place\nand also measurement monitoring tools and\n\n30\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.070\nplace to make that happen.\n\n31\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.700\nFirst, it was detection of when\nit actually get started, right?\n\n32\n00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.660\nThen it moves on to, okay,\nmy gosh, what's going on here?\n\n33\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.790\nAnd perhaps you repair, you get it and\nit takes you, you know what's wrong so\n\n34\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.210\nyou start to repair it and\neventually recover it.\n\n35\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.830\nAnd the course set takes\nsome time to get it back up,\n\n36\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.370\nmaybe you got to Restart the servers,\nget this going, double check, test, and\n\n37\n00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.900\nthen comes back and it's restored, right.\n\n38\n00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.790\nSo all these activities in between.\n\n39\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.170\nAll these can be improved.\n\n40\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.060\nAs an availability management practitioner\nyou can improve the detection, P 7.\n\n41\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.960\nYou can improve the diagnostic piece.\n\n42\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.890\nYou can improve the repair piece and\nthe recovery piece.\n\n43\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.380\nAnd obviously it restored peace.\n\n44\n00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.060\nSo, breaking these things\ndown is important.\n\n45\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.210\nNow, again, we talked about holistically\nhere then, we're backed up, right.\n\n46\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000\nSo you see that we're\ngetting available again.\n\n47\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200\nSo we have up time again.\n\n48\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.530\nYehey, but there's another incident\nfollowing through there, right?\n\n49\n00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.220\nSo Another activity\n\n50\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.490\nin availability management that's\nreactive is service failure analysis.\n\n51\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.730\nSo after it's failed, we look at\nwell what actually happened here.\n\n52\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.270\nService failure analysis\nis looking end to end.\n\n53\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.810\nWhere did this fall over?\n\n54\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.940\nDid it fall over.\n\n55\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.500\nOn the network side, on the database side,\nserver, application, right.\n\n56\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.550\nWhere did it fall over?\n\n57\n00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.370\nAnd how we're gonna prevent it.\n\n58\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.870\nI know sometimes you're so\nquick to wanna restore server,\n\n59\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.140\nyou wanna start rebooting things, right?\n\n60\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.340\nOkay, it's fixed.\n\n61\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.060\nI remember seeing some Reports on outages,\nroute cause analysis,\n\n62\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.288\nroute cause determined, reboot server,\nserver needed rebooting.\n\n63\n00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:15.412\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:17.946\n&gt;&gt; Right that's not quite the root.\n\n65\n00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:18.825\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Server needed rebooting\n\n66\n00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.145\n&gt;&gt; really is not a root cause, so\n\n67\n00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:21.825\nyou're going to have to get\na little bit deeper there.\n\n68\n00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:25.225\nSo, service failure analysis\nis doing that deep dive,\n\n69\n00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.545\nyou're asking good questions\nabout what those are.\n\n70\n00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:33.445\nAnd, you do it holistically, again, you\ndon't just work on one particular service,\n\n71\n00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:35.265\nmaybe you do this across\nmultiple services, so\n\n72\n00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.210\nyou can see\n&gt;&gt; Some\n\n73\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.610\npotential gains across multiple services,\nright.\n\n74\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.720\nSo again and this regards what you're\ndoing in your service failure analysis if\n\n75\n00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.730\nyou look at many, many steps here.\n\n76\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.820\nYou're just looking at the opportunity,\nwhat do you want to focus on and\n\n77\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.610\nthen dive deep into it.\n\n78\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.910\nSo this is also reactive.\n\n79\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.290\nThis is after the fact problem\nmanagement deep dive, right.\n\n80\n00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.850\nIn the extended life cycle,\n\n81\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.860\nextended instant life cycle that’s\nalso a problem management discipline.\n\n82\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.930\nWhere you deep dive and looking at\nthis over time, looking at trends etc.\n\n83\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.990\nSo service failure analysis,\n\n84\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.640\nextended incident life cycle\nare both reactive measures.\n\n85\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.860\nRight, and\neventually working at learning something,\n\n86\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.040\ncoming up with your best guesses as\nto why these things keep failing, and\n\n87\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.610\nthen of course showing them up so\nthey don't happen again.\n\n88\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.860\nThat is reacting to the.\n\n89\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.600\nThe data sets generated\nby service failures.\n\n90\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.410\nAnd again, that kinda even sounds\nproactive because you're trying to prevent\n\n91\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.780\nthem in the future by doing good\nanalysis of what's already happened.\n\n92\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.090\nSo this nature of reactive/proactive, they\nactually kind of get blended sometimes.\n\n93\n00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.600\nBecause if you do due diligence\nof existing failures,\n\n94\n00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.570\nyou can prevent future failures.\n\n95\n00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.270\nThat kind of sounds proactive, doesn't it,\n\n96\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.640\neven though you're responding\nto The failures themselves.\n\n97\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.010\nSo it is in the reactive\nactivities which we talked about.\n\n98\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.680\nExtended incident life cycle and\nservice failure analysis.\n\n99\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.130\nLet's look at proactive activities\navailability management.\n\n100\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.920\nBasically, analysis have\ndivided business functions and\n\n101\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.020\npartnership with IT service\ncontinuity management.\n\n102\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.090\nYou see that first bullet,\nthe understanding the vitality.\n\n103\n00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.720\nWe talked about that earlier.\n\n104\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.410\nSome services are more vital than others.\n\n105\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.880\nAnd that's a good determination for\n\n106\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.550\nhow you proactively design\navailability management in.\n\n107\n00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.320\nAnd do it from the business perspective.\n\n108\n00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.150\nAgain, don't just assume that you're\ngonna be, get your geek grove on and\n\n109\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.210\nbuild the perfect system.\n\n110\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.380\nDon't build a learning management system\nwith 5/9 availability, as an example.\n\n111\n00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.710\nAs we talked about earlier, right?\n\n112\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.400\nUnderstand your targets, define what those\ntargets are, get them agreed, right?\n\n113\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.920\nSo you're matching toward a goal,\nnot just matching.\n\n114\n00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.020\nYou know what you're trying to build,\nright?\n\n115\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.610\nPerform a risk assessment, design IT\nservices to meet recovery designs as well.\n\n116\n00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.790\nRight?\nIn conjunction with IT service continuity\n\n117\n00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.940\nmanagement, how quickly can you recover?\n\n118\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.860\nSo availability and\ncontinuity, close related.\n\n119\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.030\nAvailability and capacity,\ncloser related, right?\n\n120\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.390\nAnd again, understand how the impact\nif the service does go down\n\n121\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.410\nwho is it hurt, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.020\nRelated avail business function is also\nunderstanding the business impact analysis\n\n123\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.330\nof Failure, right?\n\n124\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.130\nAnd of course,\ndevelop the appropriate countermeasures so\n\n125\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.700\nif it does fall over,\nyou can restore it quickly.\n\n126\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.330\nIs two days sufficient?\n\n127\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.460\nIs two minutes the goal?\n\n128\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.290\nObviously you're gonna architect those\nsystems differently as relates to\n\n129\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.900\navailability, right?\n\n130\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.600\nAll of this should be put and\nmaintained in your availability plan.\n\n131\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.820\nThat's the output that says\nhere's why we did this.\n\n132\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.970\nHere's why we made it this way.\n\n133\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.120\nHere's the goals.\n\n134\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.540\nHere's the measurements we're gonna use.\n\n135\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.790\nAnd here's the techniques we're gonna\nuse to restore, recover, and maintain.\n\n136\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.820\nOkay, all right.\n\n137\n00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.650\nSo again, vital business functions playing\nout here quite well, designing it in.\n\n138\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.640\nPretty good graphic here.\n\n139\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.420\nIt's gonna go up.\n\n140\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.520\nThis is just getting the right balance.\n\n141\n00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.750\nThe more you want to make it available,\nright,\n\n142\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.560\nthe more it's potentially gonna cost,\nright?\n\n143\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.090\nUnderstanding the vital business functions\nis gonna help you with this cost\n\n144\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.470\nanalysis as well.\n\n145\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.335\nIf it's at the lower end, expect a base.\n\n146\n00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.840\n[INAUDIBLE] base products,\ntechnology and components.\n\n147\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.110\nThey don't cost as much, but as you go up\nthe change here, system management cost,\n\n148\n00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.100\neffective service management cost,\nhigh availability design cost more.\n\n149\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.710\nSpecial solutions with redundancy, right?\n\n150\n00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.935\nIf a tornado strikes your data center, you\nhave a hot swappable Global data center,\n\n151\n00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:30.845\nand geographic location,\nthose types of things, right?\n\n152\n00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:34.345\nSo you're not just affected by, not even\naffected by the weather, potentially.\n\n153\n00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.695\nSo, again,\nnothing really magical about this.\n\n154\n00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:41.155\nIt's just describing that there is a cost\ncurve associated with availability.\n\n155\n00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:43.825\nYou need to find the right spot,\nthe right location,\n\n156\n00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:46.195\nof four year availability plans, right?\n\n157\n00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:47.775\nThere are basically two aspects or\n\n158\n00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:49.915\nperspectives availability management\ntakes into consideration.\n\n159\n00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:52.144\nSo it's not just reactive and proactive.\n\n160\n00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:54.543\nYou're designing for availability,\nyou're certainly doing that.\n\n161\n00:07:54.543 --> 00:07:58.267\nYou want to be up but\nyou also design for recovery.\n\n162\n00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:03.320\nRight, so if it does go down,\nhow quickly can you get back up, right.\n\n163\n00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.860\nSo again,\nin concert with continuity management,\n\n164\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.640\nIT service continuity management, you're\ngoing to design your system accordingly.\n\n165\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.340\nSo if you lose a server do you have other\n\n166\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.610\nservers ready to go on the shelf and\nyou can be back going in two hours, right.\n\n167\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.590\nOr is it hot swappable right now.\n\n168\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.349\nDisk storage.\n\n169\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.710\nAll sorts of things can\nhave redundancy built-in.\n\n170\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.680\nNetworks tend to be highly resilient.\n\n171\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.710\nIf you lose a router,\npackets are still routed, right?\n\n172\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.597\nIt's not like one router going to\nbring the whole network down, right?\n\n173\n00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:33.456\nThat sort of thing.\n\n174\n00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:35.569\n&gt;&gt; That's the plan anyway.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n175\n00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's the plan.\n\n176\n00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:43.400\n&gt;&gt; This definitely is one of the more fun\naspects of getting into IT side of things.\n\n177\n00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.870\nMaking sure redundant\nthings are redundant.\n\n178\n00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.300\nSo you can use things like SSRP and\n\n179\n00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.530\nwhatnot so you can make sure that if that\nrouter goes down, no one even notices.\n\n180\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.250\nIt's fun to play with but\nit's a lot of life cycle.\n\n181\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.570\n&gt;&gt; What's that acronym you used?\n\n182\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.860\n&gt;&gt; SSRP, hot\n&gt;&gt; I'll stand by writing protocol.\n\n183\n00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.240\n&gt;&gt; I got you, okay.\n\n184\n00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.937\n&gt;&gt; It's where you take two routers,\nit's really cool actually.\n\n185\n00:09:04.937 --> 00:09:06.105\nYou take two routers and\n\n186\n00:09:06.105 --> 00:09:10.050\nyou make everybody,\nall the clients think there's only one.\n\n187\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.590\nAs one goes down they share an IP.\n\n188\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.390\nAs one goes down no one even knows.\n\n189\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.252\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n&gt;&gt; It's very cool.\n\n190\n00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:17.454\n&gt;&gt; Billing that's going to be part of\nservice continuity management, but\n\n191\n00:09:17.454 --> 00:09:18.970\nobviously it affects availability.\n\n192\n00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.330\nAgain, seeing the connection\nbetween continuity and\n\n193\n00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.910\navailable where one ends and the other one\nbegins is sometimes kinda tough, right?\n\n194\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.270\nBut continuity and\navailability are closely related.\n\n195\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.770\nCapacity and\navailability are closely related.\n\n196\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.180\nSo let's look at some activities related\nto proactive availability management.\n\n197\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.730\nOne is component failure impact analysis.\n\n198\n00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.550\nNow, this is an overwrought chart,\n\n199\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.690\nbut basically what I was pointing to\nis that you look at components and\n\n200\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.700\nif they fail, what impact would\nthat have on the service.\n\n201\n00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.080\nSo if you look at this graphic, again,\n\n202\n00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.760\nthey're not suggesting this\nis the prescriptive way\n\n203\n00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.150\nto look at all component failures,\nit's just an example of how to do it.\n\n204\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.300\nSo in this example we have service one and\nservice two.\n\n205\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.390\nAt the top, right?\n\n206\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.880\nAnd they have these letters,\nM, X, and A, right?\n\n207\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.180\nX means that if a failure occurs,\nthe service will be lost.\n\n208\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.020\nA means that there is\nalternatives in place, so.\n\n209\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:12.820\nThere is an impact.\n\n210\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.830\nBut okay,\nit's got some redundancy built in.\n\n211\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.750\nM means the alternate\nneeds manual intervention.\n\n212\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.540\nSo automated versus manual.\n\n213\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.690\nAlternate CI that can\nprovide the service or\n\n214\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.550\na manual intervention that\ncan provide the service.\n\n215\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.330\nSo again as an example service one,\n\n216\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.810\nif someone loses their PC and\nyou see the PC over here so\n\n217\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:37.570\nif a person loses their PC for\nthat person the service is unavailable.\n\n218\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.300\nBut with a manual swapout-\n&gt;&gt; You're back up.\n\n219\n00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.450\n&gt;&gt; You're back up,\nthat person is back up in business.\n\n220\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.850\nSo you can see the M is\nnot quite as impactful.\n\n221\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.890\nAnother example moving down here, disk 1.\n\n222\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.580\nThere's an alternative CI\nthat can provide the service.\n\n223\n00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.900\nDisk one is in play.\n\n224\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.170\nIf it fails,\ndisk two will take over, right?\n\n225\n00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.875\nSo it's already there.\n\n226\n00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.630\nSo there is an alternate in place.\n\n227\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.560\nAnd it's automated, as opposed to manual.\n\n228\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.790\nIt's already going to be there,right?\n\n229\n00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.150\nAnd of course X if it goes down\nYou got a problem that's going on.\n\n230\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:15.590\nSo, an x we look at here on switch 1,\nwhich is right here.\n\n231\n00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.570\nLose this switch you're not\ngetting access to the WAN,\n\n232\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.200\nyou're not getting access to the service.\n\n233\n00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.100\nSo, Component Failure Impact Analysis\nis the way to look ahead.\n\n234\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.940\nAgain, related to continuity planning,\nas well as availability planning,\n\n235\n00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.220\nwhere are your points of failure,\nis really what this is trying to work out.\n\n236\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.500\nHaving a methodical way to do this, is\nwhat availability management is trying to\n\n237\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.770\ndo, not to reinvent the wheel every time,\nbut have a methodical way to look at\n\n238\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.820\nthe architecture and say \"we could have\na problem here, or not.\" let's say,\n\n239\n00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.590\ndoes it mean you're going to\nhave to go buy another switch or\n\n240\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.520\ndoes it mean that you just have a way to\nquickly respond if that's what goes away.\n\n241\n00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.010\nAgain, it depends on vital\nbusiness functions, etc.\n\n242\n00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.230\nIt's a way to look forward and understand.\n\n243\n00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.733\nProactive availability management.\n\n244\n00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:07.338\nAll right, you could also do a little\nbit more advanced work on this\n\n245\n00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:09.980\ncomponent failure impact analysis.\n\n246\n00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.400\nIt's referring to your basically weighing\nthe effect of that particular outage.\n\n247\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.750\nAnd if you can get it back, well,\nthen you see the time limit.\n\n248\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.880\nIf it takes us less than two hours okay,\nthat's fine enough or not.\n\n249\n00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.690\nRight, you get the ideas here.\n\n250\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.030\nSo if it fails how quickly\ncould we come back.\n\n251\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.950\nIs it effective,\n\n252\n00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:34.320\nif you need it to be back right away\nthen you need to build it accordingly.\n\n253\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.910\n&gt;&gt; So this is just like close\nto a racing matrix coming up.\n\n254\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whose going to be the winner,\ngood point, good point.\n\n255\n00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.760\nGood point.\n\n256\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.870\nSo effectively what this is saying\nwhether you use this chart or\n\n257\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.380\nnot is that you're using your component\nfailure impact analysis to say,\n\n258\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.520\nI mean if you go back to the previous\none it just simply says.\n\n259\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.425\nYeah, we'll switch one\nif it fails we're up.\n\n260\n00:12:54.425 --> 00:12:55.855\nWe're out of lunch, right?\n\n261\n00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:58.045\nBut does it take you three\nminutes to replace it?\n\n262\n00:12:58.045 --> 00:13:00.555\nDoes it take you three days to replace it?\n\n263\n00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:01.115\nRight?\nSo\n\n264\n00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:04.570\nyou're weighing in that advance\ncomponent [INAUDIBLE], it's the so what.\n\n265\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.095\nOnce you have this particular analysis,\nyou're doing a so what.\n\n266\n00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:10.475\nHow often, how quickly can we go ahead and\nreplace that.\n\n267\n00:13:10.475 --> 00:13:14.980\nSure, it's impactfull,\nit's going totake the service down but\n\n268\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.161\nright, it's asking the but and\nthe how okay, all right, and\n\n269\n00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:24.250\nthen you have this very similar to\ncomponent failure impact analysis.\n\n270\n00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.610\nOne technique is single\npoint of failure analysis.\n\n271\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:36.890\nSingle point of failure uses these Boolean\nboxes to determine the criticallity.\n\n272\n00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.000\nSo it's got a bit more\nnuance than if it fails.\n\n273\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.550\nFor instance, earlier we saw\nan a where if disk one fails,\n\n274\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.160\nwell disk two just\nautomatically takes over.\n\n275\n00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.516\nHere, it's doing it in\na different way effectively,\n\n276\n00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:50.084\nit's just using these boolean things.\n\n277\n00:13:50.084 --> 00:13:57.334\nFor looking at and gates, or gates,\nso if the primary line is down and\n\n278\n00:13:57.334 --> 00:14:02.480\nthe fill over line is down,\nthen this is down.\n\n279\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.080\nYeah.\n\n280\n00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.980\nRight, that's really what\nthis is trying to say.\n\n281\n00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.780\nOver here we have a nor,\nif either the server goes down or\n\n282\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.560\nthe application goes down then we have\na doubt, right, that sort of thing.\n\n283\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.540\n&gt;&gt; So, it's just another way to do\n\n284\n00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.780\na component failure impact analysis\nthrough some volume logic.\n\n285\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.740\nSo, different ways to slice\nthe same pizza pie, if you will.\n\n286\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.860\nBut it is looking forward proactively\nsaying what does this look like,\n\n287\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.560\nhow could we identify our Single Points\nof Failure and manage them but\n\n288\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.570\ndidn't necessarily mean get rid of them or\nfully make everything redundant.\n\n289\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.920\nIt just means manage them.\n\n290\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.980\nRight?\n\n291\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.966\nSo, component failure\nimpact analysis proactive,\n\n292\n00:14:39.966 --> 00:14:43.228\nsingle point of failure\nanalysis also proactive, okay?\n\n293\n00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:51.520\nModeling Mentioned this before in\ncapacity management, you may recall,\n\n294\n00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.250\nfrom previous episodes.\n\n295\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.440\nCapacity management has\nmodeling involved too.\n\n296\n00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.310\nHow do you model the appropriate amount\nof capacity for the anticipated demand?\n\n297\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.255\nGet good at modeling and\nyou could repeat the model.\n\n298\n00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:04.885\nSo you don't have to reinvent\nthe wheel each time.\n\n299\n00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:07.465\nSo simulate a load test.\n\n300\n00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:09.265\nUnderstand it.\n\n301\n00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:11.435\nThere is repeatable processes or\n\n302\n00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:14.535\nrepeatable steps in the process\navailability management.\n\n303\n00:15:14.535 --> 00:15:16.115\nCome up with your appropriate models.\n\n304\n00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:18.175\nModels will include architectures,\n\n305\n00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:22.745\nmodels will include requirements,\nsimulation of load testing.\n\n306\n00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:25.440\nAnd make sure that those\nrequirements are being met.\n\n307\n00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.480\nSo if you are promising that\n\n308\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.060\na service will be available even if\n20,000 users hit it at the same time,\n\n309\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.150\nif that's your promise you'd better\ntest against it so it doesn't fall over.\n\n310\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.660\nSee how it's related to\ncapacity management?\n\n311\n00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:45.226\nWe talked about 20 thousand at a time\nare linked together here right.\n\n312\n00:15:45.226 --> 00:15:49.390\nThis doesn't have to be overly complex a\nspread sheet can suffice you don't have to\n\n313\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.244\ngo real complex with this modeling.\n\n314\n00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:53.872\nIt's just answering some key\nquestions like, what's it look like?\n\n315\n00:15:53.872 --> 00:15:57.683\nPut it in, do the math,\ncome up with your architectures, right?\n\n316\n00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:03.254\nSome other availability management\nactivities that are proactive is this risk\n\n317\n00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:04.580\nanalysis and management.\n\n318\n00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.600\nWe talked about vital business functions,\nwell, business impact analysis.\n\n319\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.660\nWhat does failure look\nlike on the business side?\n\n320\n00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.140\nIdentify and quantify those risks.\n\n321\n00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.450\nWhat's the likelihood of it happening?\n\n322\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.210\nAnd if it does happen, what's the impact?\n\n323\n00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:23.350\nThat's what a risk analysis is about,\nright, probability and impact.\n\n324\n00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.954\nDoing this with availability management is\nclosely related to continuity management,\n\n325\n00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:32.374\nunderstanding the business impact of\napplication or failures I should say,\n\n326\n00:16:32.374 --> 00:16:33.387\nis what this is about.\n\n327\n00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:36.960\nSo doing that proactively, okay.\n\n328\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.310\nAnd then management of risk,\npretty straightforward.\n\n329\n00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.117\nIf there is a formal discipline,\nM_o_R, management of risk,\n\n330\n00:16:43.117 --> 00:16:47.551\nthe same makers of ITIL AXELOS has\nthe best practice for risk management, so\n\n331\n00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:49.990\nhere's a shout out to that one.\n\n332\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.305\nIn a nut shell, what risk management is,\n\n333\n00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:57.206\nis the intersection of probability and\nimpact.\n\n334\n00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:59.470\nDoes it have a high\nprobability of happening?\n\n335\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.600\nIt has very low impact.\n\n336\n00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.080\nDoes it have low probability\nof happening of happening, but\n\n337\n00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.160\nhas high impact if it does, and\nof course, all points are between, right?\n\n338\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.740\nSo it's really an approach\nto risk management.\n\n339\n00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.840\nYou can't manage a risk that\nyou haven't identified.\n\n340\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.924\nSo part of the idea of risk\nmanagement is to get them listed,\n\n341\n00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:21.380\nget them ranked, and then, you can begin\na methodical approach for managing those.\n\n342\n00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.218\nOkay, All right.\n\n343\n00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:29.855\nPlanned and preventive maintenance,\nproactive availability management,\n\n344\n00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:34.685\nthe reason I'm laughing here is cuz we had\na little joke the other day about another\n\n345\n00:17:34.685 --> 00:17:38.430\nepisode about the root cause\nserver needed rebooting.\n\n346\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.148\nBut that's not the root cause, right?\n\n347\n00:17:40.148 --> 00:17:41.841\n&gt;&gt; You're still kinda\nbegging the question there.\n\n348\n00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:42.781\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n349\n00:17:42.781 --> 00:17:45.678\nit's why did we have to reboot\nthe server would be the real reason\n\n350\n00:17:45.678 --> 00:17:47.730\nwhy we wanna gotta go that forward.\n\n351\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:53.090\nBut that said, sometimes that's what\nyou do is plan deployment maintenance.\n\n352\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.640\nYou take time to cleanse out the logs,\nreboot the server,\n\n353\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.730\nget a nice, fresh start, and\nyou do that on a regular basis.\n\n354\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.840\nThat can improve availability.\n\n355\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.540\nSo you schedule maintenance in, security\npatching is a maintenance feature.\n\n356\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.648\nClearing out the logs is\na maintenance feature, right,\n\n357\n00:18:10.648 --> 00:18:13.046\njust giving it a good\nold cleansing reboot.\n\n358\n00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:13.990\n&gt;&gt; Spring cleaning.\n\n359\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.870\n&gt;&gt; A spring cleaning.\n\n360\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:15.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n361\n00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.680\nSo determining how\nfrequently that happens and\n\n362\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.790\nat what levels of cleansing or\nso to speak.\n\n363\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.968\n&gt;&gt; Or a server on a juice fast.\n\n364\n00:18:23.968 --> 00:18:28.082\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, [LAUGH] that's right.\n\n365\n00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:32.364\nSo again, that's just building\ninto your availability\n\n366\n00:18:32.364 --> 00:18:37.080\nmanagement plan how you want\nto approach these clean ups.\n\n367\n00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.710\nAn example where our availability\nwas severely impacted by\n\n368\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.636\nindexes that needed to be\nrecompiled in the database.\n\n369\n00:18:45.636 --> 00:18:50.220\nI was in the DBA, I did not know what that\nmeant when I first learned this, right?\n\n370\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.560\nBut, I did was smart enough to\nput into my maintenance schedule,\n\n371\n00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.590\nrecompile the index as every\ntime I did maintenance.\n\n372\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.092\nSo I had a script to do it,\nthanks to the DBA.\n\n373\n00:18:58.092 --> 00:18:59.238\nI had the script to do it.\n\n374\n00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.544\nWhen I did my planned maintenance,\nI ran that script.\n\n375\n00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:04.050\nThe indexes were re-compiled.\n\n376\n00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.802\nI had a healthier system ongoing.\n\n377\n00:19:05.802 --> 00:19:07.638\n&gt;&gt; And apparently that\nreally improves performance.\n\n378\n00:19:07.638 --> 00:19:08.972\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A lot.\n\n379\n00:19:08.972 --> 00:19:13.404\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, so again, just as an\nexample, availability management should be\n\n380\n00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:17.668\nin involved in coming up with effective\nmaintenance schedules as well, okay.\n\n381\n00:19:18.768 --> 00:19:22.040\nObviously stay on board,\nlook into improvement.\n\n382\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.570\nLook at it holistically.\n\n383\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.255\nThings are changing.\n\n384\n00:19:24.255 --> 00:19:29.306\nSo even though you built it for\nuse and it's been working for a while,\n\n385\n00:19:29.306 --> 00:19:35.231\nwe should be paying attention to trends,\ntechnology changes, usage changes,\n\n386\n00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:40.490\ncapacity changes, demand changes,\neven continuity changes.\n\n387\n00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.530\nOnce a service becomes used,\nit starts getting used more, right?\n\n388\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.310\nIt kinda keeps growing in use.\n\n389\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.190\nSo is it becoming more\nvital to the business now?\n\n390\n00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:54.370\nSo even your assessment of vitality\ncan change over time, as well.\n\n391\n00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.250\nSo, don't just fall asleep at\nthe wheel once you built fit for\n\n392\n00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.790\nuse, make sure you follow up to\nmake sure still fit for use.\n\n393\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.440\n&gt;&gt; So, availability is\na journey not a destination.\n\n394\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.645\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, ongoing, that's a good\nexample, yep, ongoing, all right?\n\n395\n00:20:10.474 --> 00:20:14.639\nTesting, coming up with a capability,\nright,\n\n396\n00:20:14.639 --> 00:20:18.360\nof being able to test and ready to test.\n\n397\n00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.730\nI mentioned that availability\nmanagement is born in service design.\n\n398\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.383\nI also mentioned that it\nplays out in transition.\n\n399\n00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:29.168\nWell, it's in the transition stage where\nyou actually do the testing to make\n\n400\n00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:32.916\nsure what you built, or what you propose\nto build, is actually fit for use.\n\n401\n00:20:32.916 --> 00:20:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthat's gonna play out in transition.\n\n402\n00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.720\n&gt;&gt; Production of a PSO,\nprojected service outage,\n\n403\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.420\nknowing that there are times that\nthe service will be unavailable.\n\n404\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.210\nYou can basically stop the clock\non availability in some regards.\n\n405\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.550\nIf it's planned downtime,\n\n406\n00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.410\nif you anticipate it,\nyou don't get dinged for it, right?\n\n407\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.190\nYou build into your service level\nagreements, the idea that it's gonna be\n\n408\n00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.430\nmaintained let's say every Sunday,\nbetween 3 and 5 AM, right?\n\n409\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.930\nSo you don't take an availability hit,\nbecause you're maintaining your services,\n\n410\n00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.080\nthat sort of thing.\n\n411\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.200\nBut to do so, that means you need to be\naware when these things are happening.\n\n412\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.260\nSo you're planning your outages.\n\n413\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.980\nIt also gives you a point of reference for\ncommunication to your customers.\n\n414\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.560\nI mean, it's one thing to have\na regular schedule of maintenance.\n\n415\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.850\nIt's another thing to have\nunplanned maintenance, right?\n\n416\n00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.678\nSay well, we have a hot fix that we have\nto do because the vendor says if we don't\n\n417\n00:21:26.678 --> 00:21:28.660\ndo it, we're at a security risk.\n\n418\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.650\nWe're planning that for\nSaturday, everyone.\n\n419\n00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.130\nWe have a projected service outage, a PSO.\n\n420\n00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.830\nWe have a document assist to everyone.\n\n421\n00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.980\nHey, we are down on Saturday,\n\n422\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:42.020\ndon't be surprised if you come to work on\nSaturday and the service is unavailable.\n\n423\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:46.940\nAnd perhaps even have notices that when\npeople come to use the service that\n\n424\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.070\nthe notices of projected service outages\nare immediately available to them there.\n\n425\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.039\nThat sort of thing.\n\n426\n00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:54.817\nAvailability management,\nagain is on point for\n\n427\n00:21:54.817 --> 00:21:57.469\nensuring these type of deliverables, okay?\n\n428\n00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:04.370\nAll right, now we look at the nuances\nhere of inputs triggers and outputs.\n\n429\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:07.560\nPerhaps a good place to pause and\ncomeback for\n\n430\n00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.310\nanother episode, is we got a few\nmore things to discuss here.\n\n431\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Excellent stuff there,\nwe're reading stuff so far,\n\n432\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.190\nhopefully you guys are getting\na lot out of this.\n\n433\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.870\nI know I sure am.\n\n434\n00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.320\nIt's a very interesting conversation\nto try to plan for these things and\n\n435\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.050\nfigure out what is gonna happen and\nokay, let's get in some redundancy or\n\n436\n00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.680\nlet's make sure we triple\nbackup things and moving that.\n\n437\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.950\nIs that necessary?\n\n438\n00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:28.930\nIs it not?\n\n439\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.720\nA lot of thinking goes along with this,\nand pre-planning before the things happen.\n\n440\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.725\nI like being proactive.\n\n441\n00:22:34.725 --> 00:22:35.499\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n442\n00:22:35.499 --> 00:22:37.030\nThat's my kind of tea right there.\n\n443\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.932\nSo let's looks like we got\na little bit more to go.\n\n444\n00:22:38.932 --> 00:22:40.580\nSo definitely join us back for\nour part three.\n\n445\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.320\nAs for this episode, looks like we're\ngonna go ahead and close it down.\n\n446\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.000\nThanks for watching.\n\n447\n00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.180\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n448\n00:22:45.180 -->

well you know it,\n\n9\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.080\nwe are coming back with\nmore of our PPO series,\n\n10\n00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.180\nmoving on with actually a part three\nhere on Availability Management.\n\n11\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.670\nVery good stuff, actually.\n\n12\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.020\nVery interesting topic, and of course\njoining us to continue that conversation,\n\n13\n00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.270\nour good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n14\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.500\nTerry, welcome back, man.\n\n15\n00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.310\nHow's it going?\n\n16\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.970\n&gt;&gt; Going great.\n\n17\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.050\nHappy to be here.\n\n18\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.465\nAnd as Daniel said, we're still working\non this Availability Management.\n\n19\n00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:43.460\nThere's a lot to take in.\n\n20\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.610\nBut it's also very important so\nit's worth the attention.\n\n21\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.150\nI'll begin today with basically\na great place to review, right?\n\n22\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.470\nWe have availability management,\ninputs, triggers, and outputs.\n\n23\n00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.893\nI'm not gonna read you 23 bullets.\n\n24\n00:00:57.893 --> 00:00:59.399\n&gt;&gt; Come on, man.\n[LAUGH]\n\n25\n00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.547\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna highlight a few\n\n26\n00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:01.700\nthings though.\n\n27\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.870\nThe main thing I'd like to highlight is\nas you're trying to recap what we've been\n\n28\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.390\ntalking about availability management,\nthis is a great place to come and review,\n\n29\n00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.620\nbecause it's pretty much everything\nwe discussed on one page, right?\n\n30\n00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.520\nSo as you look at this,\nyou can look at this and\n\n31\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030\nmake sure you understand what\neach one of the lines are saying.\n\n32\n00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.240\nAgain I'm not going to read\nthese 23 things to you.\n\n33\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.860\nBut a great place to come, pause,\n\n34\n00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.890\nbasically pause the video and\njust have a look at this and review.\n\n35\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.598\nA great place to come, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:38.720\nAlso related to a good point of review,\nwe talked about these as we went through.\n\n37\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.530\nWe discussed how Availability Management\ncould be involved\n\n38\n00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.660\nintricately with Capacity Management and\nContinuity Management.\n\n39\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.127\nCertainly, Security Management could\nhave a play in Availability Management.\n\n40\n00:01:48.127 --> 00:01:51.847\nIf a denial of service attack strikes\nyour network, and no one's getting\n\n41\n00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:56.120\nthe services, you have an availability\nproblem, and a security problem, right?\n\n42\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.120\nSo they're related that way too,\nor if a virus comes in and\n\n43\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.255\nstarts corrupting data,\nand taking things away,\n\n44\n00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.290\nyou have an availability issue\npotentially as well, right?\n\n45\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.620\nSo Security Management,\nContinuity Management,\n\n46\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.010\nCapacity Management are siblings\nwith Availability Management,\n\n47\n00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.860\nin the warranty aspect of\ndelivering IT services.\n\n48\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.810\nAccess management, service level\nmanagement or change management,\n\n49\n00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.540\ninstant management and\n\n50\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.090\nproblem management were also discussed\nas we went through the various\n\n51\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.430\nscenarios of where availability\nmanagements involved in operations.\n\n52\n00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.880\nHow it uses service level agreements to\nunderstand what targets they should be\n\n53\n00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.840\nmarching toward, right, or\nwho's gonna have access.\n\n54\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.160\nThat's closely related to\nsecurity management, right?\n\n55\n00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.855\nAnd of course, assessing changes as\nthey come to the change advisory board.\n\n56\n00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:47.915\nAvailability management needs to be there\nto weigh in on whether these changes\n\n57\n00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:49.915\nare going to affect availability.\n\n58\n00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.563\nSo we also talk about that\nas we went through, right?\n\n59\n00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:56.045\nSo that's a little spider web showing\nhow they're intended to be integrated\n\n60\n00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:57.305\nwith each other, right?\n\n61\n00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:00.885\nSo let's look at some of the details here.\n\n62\n00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:05.732\nInformation management for\navailability is all supposed to be\n\n63\n00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:09.150\nkind of collated into availability\nmanagement information system.\n\n64\n00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.040\nWe talked about this.\n\n65\n00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.990\nWe talked about capacity management\nin another episodes as well,\n\n66\n00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.530\nwhere capacity management has a CMIS,\na capacity management information system.\n\n67\n00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.600\nAll the data points,\n\n68\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.430\nall the information that help you manage\navailability need to be collated.\n\n69\n00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.420\nThat's really what this is saying.\n\n70\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.480\nNow is it in a spreadsheet,\nis it in seven different documents, or\n\n71\n00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.370\nis it in a database that can be accessed?\n\n72\n00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.170\nThis idea of a system doesn't mean\nyou're necessarily creating a great,\n\n73\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.090\nbig super size system.\n\n74\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.870\nIt just means a lot of moving parts\nmoving together for a common purpose,\n\n75\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.596\nthis really is what\nthe information system here means.\n\n76\n00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:51.525\nSo if you formalize it into a group\nof relational databases, if you\n\n77\n00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:56.360\norganize into three or four spreadsheets\nand six or seven documents, all\n\n78\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.440\nthat is gonna be part of your Availability\nManagement Information system.\n\n79\n00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.845\nHow do you get access to this?\n\n80\n00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.620\nI've seen this played out\nin some pretty simple ways.\n\n81\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.130\nIt can be very effective for\nyou and simple and by that I mean,\n\n82\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.660\nyou have your modelling document,\nyour availability modelling ideas.\n\n83\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.480\nYou have your availability\nmanagement plans, right?\n\n84\n00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.820\nAnd you have some location\n\n85\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.220\nlike a spreadsheet that can link out to\nthose different repositories as you need.\n\n86\n00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.300\nAnd again,\nit doesn't have to be an elaborately built\n\n87\n00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600\nrelational database application.\n\n88\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.874\nIt's just a way to get all your\ndata in one stack, theoretically.\n\n89\n00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.980\nOkay, alright.\n\n90\n00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.540\nWhat's an availability management plan?\n\n91\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.960\nWell it's answering all\nthe questions about availability.\n\n92\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.910\nIt really is.\n\n93\n00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.880\nIt's the plan of action, right?\n\n94\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.310\nIn the absence of one,\nyou're kinda guessing, right?\n\n95\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.230\nIf it's informal, it's kinda okay but\nwhat if you need to reference it later?\n\n96\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.880\nThe thing about an informal plan is that\n\n97\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.240\nyou won't necessarily get back to\nit later on if you he just says,\n\n98\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.230\nwell you get to the meeting and\nsay let's do this and let's do that.\n\n99\n00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.710\nThat's a great idea.\n\n100\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.900\nIf you don't write it down, then later on\neither the idea is lost or when you're\n\n101\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.720\ndoing some troubleshooting, you're not\nreally sure where you should turn.\n\n102\n00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.440\nSo if you've done a failure analysis,\na component failure impact analysis,\n\n103\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.949\nor a service failure analysis as\none of your proactive activities.\n\n104\n00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.290\nAnd you have identified your risk,\nand have a risk register,\n\n105\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.490\nthat's all going to be made in\nthe availability management plan.\n\n106\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.100\nHere's the things we've determined,\nhere's what we're going to do, and\n\n107\n00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.120\nthen you do it.\n\n108\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.280\nSo writing it down is important right?\n\n109\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.380\nWhat are the key performance indicators?\n\n110\n00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.930\nReally you're talking about measuring.\n\n111\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.680\nWhat are the key metrics for availability?\n\n112\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.140\nif you focus on the service, you're\nlooking at mean time between failures and\n\n113\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.797\nmean time to restore service, right?\n\n114\n00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.790\nThe MTBSI is Mean Time Between\nService Incidence, right?\n\n115\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.400\nSo MTBF, MTBSI, and\nMTRS are subtle measurements related to\n\n116\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.320\nthe availability of your services, right?\n\n117\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.280\nReview your SLAs and your other\nagreements, and contracts to ensure that\n\n118\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.350\nthe targets are the same and\nthat you're meeting those targets, right?\n\n119\n00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.310\nThose are some of\nthe service focus things.\n\n120\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.090\nAccess focus, are people able to access or\n\n121\n00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.340\nis it available is what\nwe're talking about.\n\n122\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.800\nReduce the critical time failures, right?\n\n123\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.920\nWhat I mean by that is, it's one thing,\nmaybe you're really good,\n\n124\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.560\nyour availability metrics are 99% and\nyou've only promised 98.\n\n125\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.280\nBut you had an outage\nduring the heaviest part of\n\n126\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.000\nthe sales season and lost 3 million\ndollars, because the service was down.\n\n127\n00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.880\nYour metrics look good.\n\n128\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.232\nBut, my gosh, we had an outage at\nthat time which was very critical.\n\n129\n00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:47.240\nSo maybe one of the things you\nmeasure is the critical time failures.\n\n130\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.860\nWhen do services fail?\n\n131\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.920\nWhen is most critical.\n\n132\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.460\n&gt;&gt; To start qualifying a little more.\n\n133\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ninstead of having elastic measurement,\n\n134\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.880\nwe're 99% available what\nare you complaining about?\n\n135\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.930\nWell, you were down during the most\ncritical part of our business.\n\n136\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:59.930\nThat's worth it.\n\n137\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.500\nSo having nuance reports that can\nshow uptime during critical times\n\n138\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.470\nas opposed to generic up time,\ncould be part of the way you do it.\n\n139\n00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.090\nThat's definitely business impact focused.\n\n140\n00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.130\nIt's focused on the customers, right?\n\n141\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.280\nAnd I've seen exam questions\nthat tease out that nuance,\n\n142\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.340\nwhere there'll clearly say,\nwe have great availability.\n\n143\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.320\nWhat are you complaining about?\n\n144\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.130\nWe are meeting our expectations, right?\n\n145\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.810\nIt's in the SLA, it's over here, right?\n\n146\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.900\nIt just all points to the idea that\nyou can have nice and green metrics.\n\n147\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.910\nThe metrics look great, and\nstill have a dissatisfied customer, right?\n\n148\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.450\nSo you can't just throw metrics out if\nyou're gonna have to satisfy them, right?\n\n149\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.580\nOf course cost focus.\n\n150\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.830\nYou can also measure what it\ncosts to reduce unavailability.\n\n151\n00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.890\nI've been involved in those exercises.\n\n152\n00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.410\nWhat does an outage cost us?\n\n153\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.616\nI can look at what it costs IT, right?\n\n154\n00:07:52.616 --> 00:07:56.540\nW e brought three technicians\nin from 3 o'clock in the morning\n\n155\n00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.590\nto 10 o'clock in the morning,\nand they were working on things.\n\n156\n00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.810\nThey should have been working on other\nthings besides this service going down.\n\n157\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.360\nSo we lost that productivity.\n\n158\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.530\nWhat does that protivity cost us?\n\n159\n00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.970\nAdd up the salaries,\ncome up with a dollar amount.\n\n160\n00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.710\nThat sort of thing.\n\n161\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.590\nSo there's ways to approach this.\n\n162\n00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.400\nAnd remember there's also\ncost to the business, right?\n\n163\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.970\nWhat did it cost the business\nbecause you were out?\n\n164\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.300\nIf you come out with\nthose kind of metrics,\n\n165\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.810\nthe business is gonna see\nyou as concerned about them.\n\n166\n00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.900\nAnd not just you, they're concerned\nabout them and not just the DSLA, right?\n\n167\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.448\nAnd if you're an external provider, of\ncourse, you're gonna make your money back\n\n168\n00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:36.189\nsatisfying your contractual arrangements,\nbut you're gonna gain loyalty and retain\n\n169\n00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:40.695\ncustomers if you can show that you're\nactually focused on their outcomes, okay?\n\n170\n00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:44.220\nSo what are some challenges and risks\nrelated to the availability management?\n\n171\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.470\nAgain, we kinda discuss\nthis as we go through.\n\n172\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.430\nAnother way to ask these questions,\n\n173\n00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.210\nin the absence of availability management,\nwhat does success look like, right?\n\n174\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.580\nYou wanna be able to meet\nthe customer's expectations, right?\n\n175\n00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.682\nEspecially, again they're not\nnecessarily expecting 100% uptime,\n\n176\n00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:07.030\nnot necessarily, but they do want\nyou to be quick to recover, right?\n\n177\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:11.350\nHow can you integrate this data,\nmake it meaningful to people, right?\n\n178\n00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.890\nSo that you come up with proactive\nmeasures more effectively and\n\n179\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.330\ncost effectively, more efficiently, right?\n\n180\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.650\nAnd convincing management that\nyou need to do this proactively.\n\n181\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.573\nThis is a great place to come,\ntest takers.\n\n182\n00:09:25.573 --> 00:09:30.367\nIf you come or pause on this particular\nslide, if you look at challenges and\n\n183\n00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:35.390\nrisks you're going to get an idea of how\na test maker may form their questions,\n\n184\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.955\nbecause they often go here to say,\nI want to build a scenario around this\n\n185\n00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:43.714\nkind of challenge to see if\nthey know how to fix it, right?\n\n186\n00:09:43.714 --> 00:09:44.810\nThat kind of thing.\n\n187\n00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.920\nSo as an example, you may be tasked,\nas in this first example here where you\n\n188\n00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.440\nhave convincing management of the need for\nproactive investment, right?\n\n189\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.690\nYou may be tasked through a scenario and\nthrough a question.\n\n190\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.609\nYou have been asked to come to\na meeting of the CIO and the CEO,\n\n191\n00:10:02.609 --> 00:10:05.822\nto tell them why you should\ninvest in availability\n\n192\n00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:09.971\nmanagement as a formal process and\nhave proactive investment.\n\n193\n00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:13.800\nSo what kind of data are you gonna\nbring to that meeting, right?\n\n194\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.590\nWhy have one of those?\n\n195\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.180\nSo maybe you bring the cost\nof outages to him, and\n\n196\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.390\nsay here's what it cost to have outages.\n\n197\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.430\n&gt;&gt; Proactive versus reactive.\n\n198\n00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.210\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; If we're more proactive with it,\n\n199\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.810\nmaybe we're only down for\nten minutes, where for reactive,\n\n200\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.450\nit's gonna take us two hours.\n\n201\n00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.840\n&gt;&gt; Great point.\n&gt;&gt; And lose x amount of dollars.\n\n202\n00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.440\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, great point,\nlose reputation, lose productivity, etc.\n\n203\n00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.240\nIf we're proactive at it,\nwe'll be better, right?\n\n204\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.510\nSo you get the idea, this is a great\nplace to come and review the challenges,\n\n205\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.910\nbecause it can give you a sense for how\nthey might approach some questions, right?\n\n206\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.630\nAnother example in that regard,\nI'll just pick one out,\n\n207\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:53.090\nrelated to lack of commitment\nto the process, right?\n\n208\n00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.390\nWhat could increase\ncommitment to the process?\n\n209\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.290\nSo you have one.\n\n210\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You have an availability management\n\n211\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.980\nprocess.\n\n212\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.970\nWhat could increase\ncommitment to the process?\n\n213\n00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.140\n&gt;&gt; How do we get them to\nput more skin in the game?\n\n214\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n215\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.740\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question.\n\n216\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.890\nI can't think of one\noff the top of my head.\n\n217\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.140\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough.\n\n218\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.130\nITILs, textbook answer, get management,\nbuy in, define policies.\n\n219\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.290\nThat's one thing to have a process but\ndefine policies.\n\n220\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.770\nHave a process owner, right?\n\n221\n00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.650\nFocus on the business,\nbring metrics, bring data.\n\n222\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.420\nDon't just say, hey we really should have\nthis because show them the reasons why for\n\n223\n00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.760\nmeasurable outcomes,\nwhat you're losing in reputation.\n\n224\n00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.980\nWhat you're losing in business impact.\n\n225\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.510\nWhat you're losing in money,\ntime and productivity right?\n\n226\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.020\nBring that to bear and\nthen say we need a policy,\n\n227\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.770\nbecause Joe over here\nis just not doing it.\n\n228\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.760\nAnd we have a policy, we need a policy\nthat says Joe, you gotta do this.\n\n229\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.560\nWe need to come up with\na proactive measure,\n\n230\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.415\nfollow the availability management\nprocess, do so proactively, right?\n\n231\n00:11:56.415 --> 00:12:00.810\nS again, looking at holistically,\nyou're looking at not just availability\n\n232\n00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.260\nmanagement as a process,\nyou're looking on how do you get buy in?\n\n233\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.350\nGet the CEO involved,\nget the CIO involved.\n\n234\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.450\nGet the business behind you.\n\n235\n00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.110\nGet funding, right?\n\n236\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.720\nGet policy and make it happen.\n\n237\n00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.940\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.980\nSome roles and responsibilities,\nI've just mentioned some.\n\n239\n00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.470\nIn the absence of a process owner one\n\n240\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.100\nof the first steps you need to do\nis define a process owner, right?\n\n241\n00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.650\nBecause you need someone to be\naccountable for the care and\n\n242\n00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.400\nfeeding of this process throughout\nit's life cycle, right?\n\n243\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.352\nSo you also need process managers,\n\n244\n00:12:34.352 --> 00:12:39.114\npeople that can actually manage the day to\nday operation of availability management.\n\n245\n00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:41.787\nAnd of course people on the ground,\nthe process practitioner,\n\n246\n00:12:41.787 --> 00:12:43.900\nis gonna be involved as well, right?\n\n247\n00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.980\nCome up with your service levels.\n\n248\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.970\nCome up with a maintainability and\nreliability metricnd march toward it.\n\n249\n00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.380\nEven better, put those same targets\ninside a service level agreement.\n\n250\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.340\nPut down on paper saying we\nare marching towards these goals.\n\n251\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.590\nWe're on your side business,\nsign the papers, right?\n\n252\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.933\nThat sort of thing.\n\n253\n00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:05.322\nAll right.\n\n254\n00:13:05.322 --> 00:13:09.487\nSo again, coming up with the regular\noutputs, scheduled meetings,\n\n255\n00:13:09.487 --> 00:13:12.947\nscheduled reviews,\ninputs into financial management,\n\n256\n00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:17.253\ninputs to service continuity management,\nshowing up at cab meetings,\n\n257\n00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:21.710\nchanged adviser board meetings right,\nso you're going to be there.\n\n258\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:24.030\nA busy person here,\nin availability management.\n\n259\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.350\nWhen we first started, this is just\nfrom my own anecdotal experience.\n\n260\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.360\nThis is not an ITIL textbook conversation,\nbut from my personal experience,\n\n261\n00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.010\navailability and problem management\nwere two of the processes we focused on.\n\n262\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.110\nIncident request fulfillment and\n\n263\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.650\nchange in release management happened to\nbe the six processes of significant focus.\n\n264\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.790\nAnd we soon learned that we need\na layer of agreements as well, right?\n\n265\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.660\nService level agreements.\n\n266\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.910\nSo SLM, incident request.\n\n267\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.930\nProblem, availability, change and\n\n268\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.700\nrelease, kind of formed\na critical mass of activities.\n\n269\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.320\nAnd by having those processes in place,\n\n270\n00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.680\nwe're able to then expand our IT service\nmanagement capabilities quite effectively.\n\n271\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.500\nAgain focusing on kind of\nthe golden goose availability.\n\n272\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.890\nThat's the one that customers\ntend to care most about.\n\n273\n00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:20.730\nIt tends to tarnish the reputation\nof IT most when it fails, right?\n\n274\n00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.240\nThe things related to utility,\nit's kinda clunky.\n\n275\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.860\nI don't like the red screen\nwith the pink text, right?\n\n276\n00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.780\n&gt;&gt; You'd be amazed at how many of those-\n&gt;&gt; You see some ugly things-\n\n277\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.748\n&gt;&gt; It's so crazy.\n\n278\n00:14:31.748 --> 00:14:32.451\nIt is.\n\n279\n00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:35.370\nBut those are laughable.\n\n280\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; More so than paralyzing.\n\n281\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.620\nAvailability if it goes down, right?\n\n282\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.560\nthey're gonna say,\n\n283\n00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.950\nplease bring me back the red screen with\nthe pink text, at least wanna use it.\n\n284\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.260\n&gt;&gt; As hideous as it may be.\n\n285\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.360\n&gt;&gt; As hideous it may be I wanna\nto be there, that kind of thing.\n\n286\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.220\nSo again,\nI'm not using utility's not important.\n\n287\n00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.940\nBelieve me,\nI'm not saying utility is unimportant.\n\n288\n00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.464\nI'm just saying availability, if it's not\nthere, you're gonna tarnish reputation\n\n289\n00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:01.947\nquite a bit, and potentially lose\nthe productivity of your users,\n\n290\n00:15:01.947 --> 00:15:04.229\nloose the trust that they have in you,\netc.\n\n291\n00:15:04.229 --> 00:15:08.276\nSo that's why availability kinda raises\nits head as almost a gold standard of\n\n292\n00:15:08.276 --> 00:15:11.086\nthe things you need to be\nmost concerned about often.\n\n293\n00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:15.177\nAgain, not belittling the other ones,\nit's just a very important one, okay?\n\n294\n00:15:15.177 --> 00:15:18.050\nThink that horse might be beaten by now.\n\n295\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sufficiently fog.\n\n296\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.690\n&gt;&gt; Sufficiently fog, that's right.\n\n297\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.580\nGood deal.\n\n298\n00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.520\nSo that's it, in terms of lecture time.\n\n299\n00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.610\nThere's good times for some study, though.\n\n300\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.790\nI encourage you, again, from the very\nfirst episode, there's a zip file you can\n\n301\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.780\ndownload and has all these exercises\nin it, I encourage you to do that.\n\n302\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.079\nUnzip that file,\nget these exercises in front of you,\n\n303\n00:15:39.079 --> 00:15:41.457\nfollow through with some good review.\n\n304\n00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:45.520\nI also mention as points of review\nwithin this lecture itself,\n\n305\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.293\nthe inputs triggers and\noutputs is a great screen to go to.\n\n306\n00:15:49.293 --> 00:15:52.608\nAlso to pause on,\nas well as the challenges,\n\n307\n00:15:52.608 --> 00:15:55.490\ncritical success factors in KPIs.\n\n308\n00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.580\nThose are kind of good ones to pause on,\n\n309\n00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.160\nrather than have to review\nthe entire episode.\n\n310\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.760\nIf you pause on those and\nassimilate that information or\n\n311\n00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.840\nconfirm that you have assimilated that\ninformation, you are in a very good place.\n\n312\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.465\nSo that's it for\nAvailability Management, I promise.\n\n313\n00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:11.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n314\n00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.750\nWell Terry,\nit was definitely a tough nut to crack but\n\n315\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.440\nI think we got to the meat\nof the issue here.\n\n316\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.850\nA few episodes underneath our belt, but\nI don't think any of us are worse for\n\n317\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.505\nwhere we're probably,\nactually better for the seige.\n\n318\n00:16:22.505 --> 00:16:25.940\nThat being said, it looks like we're\nat the end of Availability Management.\n\n319\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.020\nThanks for joining us on these.\n\n320\n00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.500\nWe'll be back with more for IT PPO.\n\n321\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.300\nSo definitely check out\nthe upcoming episodes.\n\n322\n00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.300\nAs for this one though,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n323\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.840\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n324\n00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n325\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.831\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you

00:00:06.363\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.296\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:12.146\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:12.988\nAll right.\n\n7\n00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:16.973\nGreetings everyone and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:18.533\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.452\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nwe're continuing with more on our\n\n10\n00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:26.875\nITIL PPO series, that's right,\nplanning protection and optimization?\n\n11\n00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:30.165\nOptimization, that's right I get my\nacronyms correct on this lovely day.\n\n12\n00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.200\nAnd joining us obviously in the studio,\nour good friend Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n13\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.110\nTerry welcome back man.\n\n14\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.940\nHow's it going?\n\n15\n00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.010\n&gt;&gt; Good to be here and\nit's going very well.\n\n16\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.450\nNext up for this episode we're going to\nbe talking about continuity management.\n\n17\n00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170\nIT service continuity management\nto be completely formal.\n\n18\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.690\nWe scraped our knuckles on\nthis in previous episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.821\nWe talked about its connection to\nthe availability management and\n\n20\n00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:57.020\nwe're gonna scrape our knuckle more and\ndive into the details here about what\n\n21\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.310\nIT Service Continuity Management\nis all about.\n\n22\n00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.310\nSo first of all lets take\na look at the objectives here.\n\n23\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.160\nThe objectives are pretty\nstraight forward.\n\n24\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.320\nComing up with an appropriate\nIT Service Continuity plan,\n\n25\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.980\nthat's the primary output of this process.\n\n26\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.060\nWhich basically means,\n\n27\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.810\nyou have an idea about how you're\ngonna maintain continuity.\n\n28\n00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380\nComplete ongoing regular\nbusiness impact analyses.\n\n29\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.880\nMake sure you understand of what\n\n30\n00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.790\nthe business is feeling if\nsomething goes awry, right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.290\nAnd understand if that could change,\nit's a moving target.\n\n32\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.750\nJust getting it right.\n\n33\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.670\nUpon the match and\n\n34\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.180\nputting in an operation is not enough,\nongoing regular reviews is also in play.\n\n35\n00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.000\nProvide guidance and support.\n\n36\n00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.320\nBe the process,\n\n37\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.880\nbe the practitioners that know best\nhow to approach continuity management.\n\n38\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.550\nBut before we dive into\nthe activities themselves,\n\n39\n00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.162\nlet's consider just what\ndoes continuity mean.\n\n40\n00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:48.220\nI wanna try to get you\na frame of reference.\n\n41\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.120\nIt means some of the mundane\nday to day things.\n\n42\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.454\nIf a server were to fall over,\nis the service still available, right?\n\n43\n00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.580\nThat's something that the availability\nmanagement is concerned about.\n\n44\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.230\nContinuity management could also\nbe at that level of concern.\n\n45\n00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.270\nIt could also be at a very big level,\nlike disaster recovery level.\n\n46\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.130\nWhat happens if a tornado\nstrikes your data center?\n\n47\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.340\nOr what happens if a tornado wipes out one\nof your branches of operations, right?\n\n48\n00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.190\nNot necessarily your IT operations,\nbut your business operations.\n\n49\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.730\nWhat's your response to that\nfrom an IT perspective?\n\n50\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.840\n&gt;&gt; So continuity versus availability,\n\n51\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.500\neven though they seem very synonymous and\nI guess in some ways can be.\n\n52\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.730\nWhen we speak of that continuity,\nwe're thinking,\n\n53\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.090\nwhat will impact our business from\nactually performing business?\n\n54\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; Versus availability, where yeah,\n\n55\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.740\nthe email server may have went down but\nwe're still conducting business.\n\n56\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:37.260\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n57\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n58\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.950\nAbsolutely, great example.\n\n59\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.820\nYou're really talking\nabout business impact and\n\n60\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.270\nwhat is the business\ncontinuity gonna be like.\n\n61\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.870\nSo this link up to business\ncontinuity planning,\n\n62\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.990\nis a key component of IT\nservice continuity planning.\n\n63\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.670\nPutting them together,\nnot working in isolation.\n\n64\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.270\nVery good point.\n\n65\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.110\nSo as we consider this then,\nwhat is the scope?\n\n66\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.300\nThat's what you've gotta describe.\n\n67\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.080\nDoes it include, one of the things\nthe continuity management process and\n\n68\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.530\nthe planning needs to agree on,\nis what is the scope?\n\n69\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.350\nAre we worried about when email goes down?\n\n70\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.278\nAre we worried about\nwhen a servers goes down?\n\n71\n00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:13.265\nAre we talking about disaster\nrecovery when tornadoes hit?\n\n72\n00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:17.540\nAnd what if a flu pandemic strikes\nour work force, I mean all sorts of\n\n73\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.270\nthings could be playing into\nthe business side of this, right?\n\n74\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.520\nSo understanding what is the scope,\nis a necessary first step in understanding\n\n75\n00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.209\nwhat is the overall value or\npurpose of continuity management.\n\n76\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.020\nOf course BIA, Business Impact Analysis,\nrisk analysis.\n\n77\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.950\nComing up with a strategy and a plan.\n\n78\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.590\nThe testing of those plans.\n\n79\n00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.550\nAnd ongoing operation of those plans.\n\n80\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.250\nSo let me just do a little\nbit of laser pointer here.\n\n81\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.160\nAnd just kind of set it\non this particular slide.\n\n82\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.070\nWe'll see it show up a little bit later.\n\n83\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.310\nBut this is effectively coming\nup with a life cycle approach.\n\n84\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.470\nUnderstanding the overall\nstrategy of service continuity,\n\n85\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.760\ndesigning it, coming up with a good plan\nfor it, putting it through transition,\n\n86\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.430\ntraining people on it, testing it,\nmake sure people are aware.\n\n87\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.402\nSo again, if you wanna map this to life\ncycle, we've got strategy life cycle,\n\n88\n00:04:13.402 --> 00:04:16.902\nwe've got design life cycle,\nwe've got transition life cycle, and\n\n89\n00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:20.110\nthen there it is operation,\nongoing operation of it.\n\n90\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.530\nSo you can kind of break down the major\nstages of IT service continuity management\n\n91\n00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.070\nby looking at it through\na life cycle type approach.\n\n92\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.490\nAnd we'll be focusing on that\nvery approach very soon, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.710\nSo but why even do this?\n\n94\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.140\nI think its somewhat obvious but\nt he business cares, right?\n\n95\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.480\nLinking IT Service Continuity Management\nto Business Continuity Management\n\n96\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.780\nas an example.\n\n97\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.010\nIf you consider that perhaps\nthe business is concerned\n\n98\n00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.180\nif they lose the manufacturing\ncapacity of one of their plants,\n\n99\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.300\nbecause maybe a tornado strikes it.\n\n100\n00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.232\nThe business may come up with a business\ncontinuity process that says,\n\n101\n00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:03.833\nwe could recap 50% of the production\nof that particular plant or\n\n102\n00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:08.600\nfactory, if we retrofit these other\nthree factories within a week,\n\n103\n00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.417\nwe could regain 50% of the capacity.\n\n104\n00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:14.200\nAt least that gives us a stop gap measure,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.837\nSo the business has come up with a plan\nfor what they're gonna do if they lose\n\n106\n00:05:17.837 --> 00:05:21.190\nproduction at a factory by retrofitting\nthree other factories, and\n\n107\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.700\nthey also have a time limit in that one.\n\n108\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.380\nSo the business is thinking about it,\n\n109\n00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.060\nwhat would IT's response to\nthat type of eventuality be?\n\n110\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.870\nDo they need to drop\nsome more network cables?\n\n111\n00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.790\nDo they need to send some computers there?\n\n112\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.600\nPower supplies?\n\n113\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.310\nThey gotta put support staff there?\n\n114\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.790\nWhat does IT have to do to satisfy\nthat business continuity concern?\n\n115\n00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.700\nReally trying to connect the dots\nhere is what we're trying to do.\n\n116\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.980\nSo having an IT only focus is\npart of IT service continuity.\n\n117\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.950\nIs not the right kind of focus.\n\n118\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.440\nImportant to ITIL and of course you\ntest takes you need to have that,\n\n119\n00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.710\nthe eye on the right ball there as well.\n\n120\n00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.840\nOkay, so here it is kinda graphically.\n\n121\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.800\nShowing that business\ncontinuity management and\n\n122\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.930\nIT service continuity management\nare tied at the hip, they work together.\n\n123\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.850\nThey talk about it at the strategic level,\n\n124\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.680\nthey talk about it at the design\nlevel where they're planning things.\n\n125\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.890\nThey implement them together, or\nI should say, transition them together and\n\n126\n00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.000\nobviously invocate and\noperate these in parallel, right?\n\n127\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.190\nSo the business has their business,\nIT has their business.\n\n128\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.860\nBut as it relates to continuity,\nthey need to be tied at the hip, right?\n\n129\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.872\nAnd some other key [INAUDIBLE].\n\n130\n00:06:27.872 --> 00:06:32.450\nThis is by the way,\nis a great slide to pause on, reflect on.\n\n131\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.040\nPick up a lot of the words and\nlanguage on.\n\n132\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.460\nI'm not gonna read you every one of these\nbullets, but a great one to pause on,\n\n133\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.130\nbecause you get some key things here.\n\n134\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.350\nThe strategic pieces of understanding\nbusiness impact analysis,\n\n135\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.970\nrisk assessment, and\nyour overall strategy.\n\n136\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.380\nAnd then they talk about how you go\nabout developing the plans for that.\n\n137\n00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.870\nSo that's the design aspects of them.\n\n138\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.100\nA very good slide.\n\n139\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.710\nWe happen to be breaking it\ndown into the constituent parts\n\n140\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.210\nin the subsequent slides.\n\n141\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.016\nA very good place to come and review.\n\n142\n00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:05.043\nHave a pause, and re-assimilate\nthis information as you prepare for\n\n143\n00:07:05.043 --> 00:07:06.415\nthis exam, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:06.415 --> 00:07:09.420\nSo what about some policies and\nprinciples related to this?\n\n145\n00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.410\nPretty darn straight forward.\n\n146\n00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.000\nHere's this word life cycle approach.\n\n147\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.300\nI've already mentioned it.\n\n148\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.730\nYou consider IT Service Continuity\nManagement in a context of have following\n\n149\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:22.060\na strategy, following a plan development\nsuch as what service design would do.\n\n150\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.480\nComing up with a transition plan for how\nyou're going to inform everyone about it.\n\n151\n00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.740\nMake sure works test it, and\n\n152\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.030\nthen hopefully you're gonna operate\nthe plan in real life as well, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.990\nSo that kind of plays out quite easily and\n\n154\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.390\nlook like little pool,\nbilliard balls here, right?\n\n155\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.870\nOne, two, three and four.\n\n156\n00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.378\nThe initiation part is\nreally about strategy.\n\n157\n00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:48.021\nIf you wanna map it to\na life cycle approach,\n\n158\n00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:52.381\nthe initiation of service continuity\nmanagement just to be clear here,\n\n159\n00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:55.036\nit's not about the invocation of the plan.\n\n160\n00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:59.516\nWe're not talking about invocating,\nmaking the plan come to action.\n\n161\n00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:01.421\nThe tornado has hit,\nnow you have got to do it.\n\n162\n00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:02.698\nWe're not talking about that initiation.\n\n163\n00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:07.880\nWe're talking about the initiation of\nthis idea of continuity management.\n\n164\n00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.440\nIt starts with a strategic focus,\na strategy approach,\n\n165\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.750\nwhere you're understanding what\nis the business trying to do.\n\n166\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.340\nYou have policies that back it up.\n\n167\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.940\nYou have terms of reference.\n\n168\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.370\nFor those of you who might have been\ninvolved in disaster recovery planning,\n\n169\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:28.100\nyou might have heard of terms like return\npoint objective or return time objective.\n\n170\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.290\nWhether you've learned those or\n\n171\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.410\nnot, the terms associated with continuity\nneed to be understood by everyone.\n\n172\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.939\nWhat are your terms of reference, right?\n\n173\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.100\nBy the way, return point objective\n\n174\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.300\nis at to what point in time do you need\nto get to if you got a recovered data.\n\n175\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.330\nIs it day latency okay?\n\n176\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.730\nOr is it an hour latency that's okay?\n\n177\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.330\nAnd return time objective is really to\nhow quickly you got to get back up and\n\n178\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.820\nrunning, etc.\n\n179\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.920\nAgain not saying you have to use those\nterms, but if you're gonna use those\n\n180\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.530\nterms, you better explain what\nthey mean so everyone knows them.\n\n181\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.850\nThat's what this strategy\nstage is about or\n\n182\n00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.690\ninitiation stage I should say is about,\nright?\n\n183\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.620\nThis is where we're also gonna beginning\nthe overarching business impact analysis.\n\n184\n00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.670\nWhat are our ultimate goals?\n\n185\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.130\nWhat are the requirements basically?\n\n186\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:18.640\nWhy do we need to recover quickly\nversus more slowly for some services.\n\n187\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.510\nOf course you also gonna\nallocate resources, right?\n\n188\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.720\nIf you wanna have a highly reddened\nsystem of a hot swappable data center.\n\n189\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.850\nIf this data center gets slammed\nyou get a little one ready to go.\n\n190\n00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.220\nI got to do is turn\nthe lights on type of thing.\n\n191\n00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.060\nObviously very expensive, right?\n\n192\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.740\nBut appropriating the appropriate\nresources whether it money, time and\n\n193\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.040\npeople Is what the allocation is about,\nright.\n\n194\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.820\nAnd define the project, right.\n\n195\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.580\nTake this on as a project instead of work.\n\n196\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.880\nAnd understand the inner\nconnection between business and\n\n197\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.360\nITCSM as your working through those.\n\n198\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.460\nAnd then of course make sure you\nhave quality wrapped around it.\n\n199\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.320\nWhatever your project plans are, or\n\n200\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.850\nyour quality plans are around\nthis particular initiative.\n\n201\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.000\nSo, initiation is a big\npart of strategic thinking.\n\n202\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.070\nRight.\n\n203\n00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.470\nAs you move on towards design,\n\n204\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.620\nyou're getting closer to saying okay,\nwe've got this requirements.\n\n205\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.380\nWe understand the general\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n206\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.320\nNow we need to assess this and\n\n207\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.870\nsee what we need to put in place to\naddress this particular impact,right.\n\n208\n00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.890\nHow quickly we respond, how thoroughly\nwe need to respond, what is your\n\n209\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.982\nreturn point, objective return time\nobjective, those types of things, right,\n\n210\n00:10:27.982 --> 00:10:32.144\nhow much money we're going to spend, etc.\n\n211\n00:10:32.144 --> 00:10:34.670\nRight, coming up with appropriate\nrequirements and strategy.\n\n212\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.890\nThis is kind of a pretty graph but\nfor high impact things,\n\n213\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.540\nit require a bit more investment, right?\n\n214\n00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.660\nLower impact things?\n\n215\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.830\nNot so much, right?\n\n216\n00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.960\nAnd keep in mind this is\nalso a moving target.\n\n217\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.450\nYou see the red text there\nthat an assessment is only\n\n218\n00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.890\nas accurate as the time\nin which it was taken.\n\n219\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.820\nBecause things change, right?\n\n220\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.400\nThe business changes,\nmaybe the impact has gone down.\n\n221\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.680\nMaybe the impact has gone up.\n\n222\n00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.230\nAgain, it never stays static.\n\n223\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.080\nIt's an ongoing review as part\nof the deal as well, okay?\n\n224\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330\nSo business impact,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n225\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:07.840\nWhy do it?\n\n226\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.630\nIt just simply means you're looking\nthrough the lens of business.\n\n227\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.250\nIs it hard impact, financial or safety?\n\n228\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.030\nIs it soft impact reputational things,\nloss of competitive advantage?\n\n229\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.340\nIs it life and death?\n\n230\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.880\nRight?\n\n231\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.630\nSay that's pretty hard impact as well,\nright?\n\n232\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.510\nAre you gonna lose money, lose reputation,\n\n233\n00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.990\nlose market, jeopardize your business\nat a high level or not so much?\n\n234\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.840\nThat's really what we're\ntrying to get there.\n\n235\n00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.970\nOkay, again pretty straight forward.\n\n236\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.600\nSome of these discussions came up\nwith availability management to,\n\n237\n00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.450\nthe way you design availability in is\nbased on vital business functions.\n\n238\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.970\nClosely related to assessing vitality\n\n239\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.540\nis understanding a business\nimpact as well, okay.\n\n240\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.750\nHere's this risk again.\n\n241\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.020\nRisk analysis saves\nthe management of risk again.\n\n242\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.960\nComing up with a methodical approach\nto access risk, identify them, and\n\n243\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.160\npotential mitigate or\nget rid of them, right?\n\n244\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.040\nAlso part of it.\n\n245\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.990\nNothing really magical about risk\nassessment that we haven't all ready\n\n246\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.520\ndiscussed.\n\n247\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.590\nIt is the nexus or\nthe intersection of probability.\n\n248\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.182\nThe likelihood something's going to\nhappen or the impact if it does happen,\n\n249\n00:12:14.182 --> 00:12:14.740\nall right.\n\n250\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.480\nSo, now you're getting closer to really\nputting this thing into an overall\n\n251\n00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.750\nstrategy document.\n\n252\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.170\nYou've gotten the ideas of\nwhat we're trying to get done,\n\n253\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.480\nyou're starting to plan this thing out and\none of the outputs is going to be well,\n\n254\n00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.230\nhere's what we intend to do.\n\n255\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.520\nThe purpose of this IT service\ncontinuity effort is to satisfy\n\n256\n00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.030\nthis particular strategic initiative,\nright?\n\n257\n00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.710\nSo, based on your business\nimpact analysis and\n\n258\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.490\nyour risk analysis, you're gonna\ncome up with a balanced approach.\n\n259\n00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.420\nBy balanced, spending the right money for\nthe right kind of risks.\n\n260\n00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.008\nYou see some examples of a risk response\nmeasure of uninterrupted, power supplies,\n\n261\n00:12:56.008 --> 00:12:59.090\nRAID arrays for disk, offsite storage.\n\n262\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.910\nWe'll look at different levels of\nresponse times a little bit later, but\n\n263\n00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:08.550\nyou get a kind of sense of where you\ngoing with a strategic idea, okay.\n\n264\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.530\nSo here we go, manual work around.\n\n265\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:20.680\nAs an example, in our learning management\nservice one of the key value drivers for\n\n266\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.050\nthe learning management service was\nthe retention of training records.\n\n267\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.010\nAnd in a regulated environment training\nrecords can be pretty important.\n\n268\n00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:32.670\nIf an auditor comes and\nasks you, how is that technician\n\n269\n00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.430\ntrained on using this particular\ndevice that puts drugs in a bottle?\n\n270\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:38.470\nBecause if he messes that up,\n\n271\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.660\nwe're giving the wrong doses to people,\npeople could die.\n\n272\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.250\nSo how is this guy trained?\n\n273\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.830\nShow me his training record.\n\n274\n00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.740\nThey go into the learning management\nsystem, bring up the record.\n\n275\n00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.710\nSo what if the learning management\nsystem is not available\n\n276\n00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.710\nwhen the auditor comes and says,\nI want to see that record.\n\n277\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.470\nWhat's a possibility?\n\n278\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.066\n&gt;&gt; You could say,\ncome back later when it does work.\n\n279\n00:13:59.066 --> 00:14:02.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a possibility, absolutely is.\n\n280\n00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.150\nOr, you could also have, I've seen this\nwork out, a regular regimen where,\n\n281\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.820\nsounds kind of silly, but you're printing\nrecords, and storing them in a cabinet.\n\n282\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.850\n&gt;&gt; It's so funny you say that.\n\n283\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.990\nI worked for\nan insurance company a while back, and\n\n284\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.970\nwe used to have this huge metal building\nfull of actual, physical paper records.\n\n285\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.820\nAnd they said well, that's from years\npast, let's digitize everything,\n\n286\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.970\nwe'll go to a digital method for\nclaims input.\n\n287\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.750\nThey bought this method and\nthey started scanning all these documents.\n\n288\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.330\nAnd then they're like well, we actually\nstill need to print out paper stuff.\n\n289\n00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.160\nSo we were continuing to hold paper\nrecords and hold digital systems as well.\n\n290\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.140\nCost us a whole lot of money but in the\nend it actually saved us money because we\n\n291\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.660\nweren't liable to lawsuits and stuff.\n\n292\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nthere's some sort of regulatory governance\n\n293\n00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.380\nover this that says you should\nhave this to save your audits,\n\n294\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.210\nto cover your interest\nin the regulatory front.\n\n295\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.020\n&gt;&gt; And I think it was just\ncheaper to store it as paper.\n\n296\n00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.580\n&gt;&gt; Well, could be.\n\n297\n00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.650\n&gt;&gt; And it's a different record.\n\n298\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.150\nIt was in a different building.\n\n299\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.670\nAgain, going into that disaster\nrecovery kind of thing.\n\n300\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.010\nIf our main building got fireballed\nfrom a meteor from the sky,\n\n301\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.820\nyou could still go get the paper\nrecord and have people's records.\n\n302\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.590\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n303\n00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.270\nSo, there we are talking\nabout access to data, right?\n\n304\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.850\nWhat about access to the system at large?\n\n305\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:17.251\nMaybe and going to manual processes so,\nagain one part is go revert to manual or\n\n306\n00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:18.740\npaper based systems.\n\n307\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.170\nI appreciate what Daniel says, wait until\nit comes back up, is that okay, right?\n\n308\n00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.330\nThat's when you're trying to\njudge this return time objective,\n\n309\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.430\nreturn point objective.\n\n310\n00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.080\nIf it's return time says you\nknow this service cannot be down\n\n311\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.990\nlonger than four hours before we really\nstart feeling some pain, then you need to\n\n312\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.580\nbuild your continuity in such a way\nthat you can recover within four hours.\n\n313\n00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.870\nAnd it does mean you can reimage servers,\nput them online within four hours,\n\n314\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.490\nget the SWAT team out there and putting\nall these stuff together real quickly,\n\n315\n00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.470\nmaybe that's what that means, right?\n\n316\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.460\nSo then you see a reciprocal agreement.\n\n317\n00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.930\nThis is interesting approach for\nrecovery options.\n\n318\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.422\nI've seen this play out in\nthe county I live in for instance.\n\n319\n00:15:56.422 --> 00:16:01.310\nThe regional hospital there, the county\nhospital there They maintain a data\n\n320\n00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.170\ncenter that has some capabilities for\ntheir IT systems.\n\n321\n00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:10.880\nBut County also maintains some for their\nEMS systems, emergency management systems.\n\n322\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.460\nThey're related but different, they're\noperated by different folks, right?\n\n323\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.570\nThey're on different sides of the county,\nthey're both above flood plain.\n\n324\n00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.115\nThankfully, right,\nthat kind of thing, right?\n\n325\n00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:19.675\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n326\n00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:20.825\n&gt;&gt; They're both above flood plain.\n\n327\n00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:23.570\nSo anyway, they have agreed,\n\n328\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.270\nthe privately run hospital and\nthe county I live in.\n\n329\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.830\nThey have a reciprocal agreement that\nshould they lose capacity in their\n\n330\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.710\ndata center, they can come over and\nuse the capacity in the other one.\n\n331\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.390\nThe overarching idea is the same\ndisaster won't strike both of them,\n\n332\n00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.300\nthat's the idea there.\n\n333\n00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.550\nAnd again, that's a good risk\nmitigation approach, right?\n\n334\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.400\nFire trucks can still be dispatched,\n\n335\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.210\nemergency vehicles can still be\ndispatched without the data center.\n\n336\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.850\nSo they have that kind of covered, but\n\n337\n00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.280\nwhat about just on going\nday-to-day operations of things?\n\n338\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.141\nHow can we restore that\nas quickly as possible?\n\n339\n00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:57.720\nWith their approaches,\n\n340\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.860\nlet's use the facilities that each\nof us have in case that happens.\n\n341\n00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.375\nSo they can bring their truck full of\nservers and start putting them into racks,\n\n342\n00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:07.810\nbecause they have spare\ncapacity in each one of them.\n\n343\n00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.280\nThat sort of thing, right?\n\n344\n00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.130\nPower supplies, mobility,\n\n345\n00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.860\nbeing able to be mobile in your recovery\noptions could also be a part of it.\n\n346\n00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.490\nSo reciprocal agreements, again,\n\n347\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.400\nfinding a partnership with\na compatible organization.\n\n348\n00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.600\nWhere you can share resources\nin the event of disaster,\n\n349\n00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.965\ncould be an appropriate approach.\n\n350\n00:17:26.965 --> 00:17:29.230\n&gt;&gt; It's like cloud solution type of idea.\n\n351\n00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.390\n&gt;&gt; In a way it is kinda like it.\n\n352\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.824\n&gt;&gt; We always joked about, maybe\nMicrosoft will use Amazon as a backup.\n\n353\n00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:35.833\n[LAUGH] And vice versa.\n\n354\n00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:36.785\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, good ploy.\n\n355\n00:17:36.785 --> 00:17:38.243\n&gt;&gt; You could really get\nsome nines out of that.\n\n356\n00:17:38.243 --> 00:17:39.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, good point,\n\n357\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.640\nthat's an interesting point.\n\n358\n00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.325\nYeah, good idea,\nwe'll see how that works out.\n\n359\n00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:44.977\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see how that one works\n\n360\n00:17:44.977 --> 00:17:46.230\nout, good point.\n\n361\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.350\nA gradual recovery,\nwhere you have cold storage basically.\n\n362\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.360\nYou have things nearby that are on a rack.\n\n363\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.210\nThey're not ready powered up, so\nyou gotta get them off the shelf.\n\n364\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.060\nStick it in, configure it a little bit,\nand then it runs.\n\n365\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.090\nThat's kind of a gradual recovery,\nsometimes called cold standby.\n\n366\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.790\nMoving that a little bit more urgently,\nintermediate recovery.\n\n367\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.190\nWhere they're there, but\nthey gotta be turned on and configured.\n\n368\n00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:17.770\nSo maybe this is where you need to recover\nwithin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n369\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:23.260\nWe say here, 24 to 72 hours,\nas opposed to intermediate recovery.\n\n370\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.040\nI'm sorry, a hot standby,\nwhere they are ready to go,\n\n371\n00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.350\nyou just have to move on to them.\n\n372\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.490\nYou do have to flip a switch,\nbut they are ready to go.\n\n373\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.060\nAnd then, there is immediate recovery.\n\n374\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.258\nThey're like hot standby,\nbut they're already in.\n\n375\n00:18:38.258 --> 00:18:40.820\nLike I said, this is when you\nhave maybe servers in a cluster.\n\n376\n00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.610\nOne falls over,\nthe other three are still working.\n\n377\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.080\n&gt;&gt; It's like I when was\ntalking about the HSRP.\n\n378\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n379\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.750\n&gt;&gt; Hot standby routing protocol.\n\n380\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.660\n&gt;&gt; On the network PCs.\n\n381\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.160\n&gt;&gt; You never even see the thing go down.\n\n382\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n383\n00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.760\n&gt;&gt; That's a great example Daniel,\nyou can build in this redundancy,\n\n384\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.740\nautomatic redundancy.\n\n385\n00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.270\nAnd it's just completely transparent,\n\n386\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.560\nyou don't even know that\nthe glitch ever happened, right?\n\n387\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.750\nNetworks are certainly classically doing\nthis because they're so vital to so\n\n388\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:01.860\nmany other things that are going on.\n\n389\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.090\nSo that's a very good example.\n\n390\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.810\n&gt;&gt; Man you want to hear a complaint,\nlet that network go down.\n\n391\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.343\nLet someone not be able to get to YouTube.\n\n392\n00:19:08.343 --> 00:19:11.590\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, that's right, so\n\n393\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:12.525\ngood point.\n\n394\n00:19:12.525 --> 00:19:16.930\nAnd again, different levels of recovery\ndepending on what the business impact is,\n\n395\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.600\nwhat's vital,\nthe vital business functions, etc.\n\n396\n00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.680\nSo just connecting the dots here.\n\n397\n00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.190\nOkay, so again what we just went\nthrough was the design considerations,\n\n398\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.410\nhow you're designing it.\n\n399\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.980\nYou answer all these questions,\njust how fast do we need to be?\n\n400\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.390\nWhat is the return point objective or\nthe return time objective?\n\n401\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.560\nWhat are we trying to get done here,\nright?\n\n402\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.250\nAnd again, I want to make sure\nthe focus is clear is that\n\n403\n00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.140\ncontinuity management can also deal with\nthings that aren't quite disastrous.\n\n404\n00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.060\nThey don't have to be a tornado striking\nor a flu pandemic or anything like that.\n\n405\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.640\nIt can be a bit more mundane,\nlike the loss of a server, or\n\n406\n00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.940\nthe loss of an application.\n\n407\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.100\nKeep that in mind as well,\nreset the stage.\n\n408\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.640\nCuz I don't wanna get presumptuous about\nthe examples we're using here to say that,\n\n409\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.620\nthat's just the narrow scope or\nthe broad scope.\n\n410\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.475\nRemember that the scope is\nrather elastic depending on\n\n411\n00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:08.635\nhow you go about it in your organization.\n\n412\n00:20:08.635 --> 00:20:11.165\nSo now we're talking about implementation,\nby implementation,\n\n413\n00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:12.935\nagain we don't mean invocation.\n\n414\n00:20:12.935 --> 00:20:17.595\nWe're not invoking the plan,\nwe are simply bringing the plan to life.\n\n415\n00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:21.185\nAs it equates to the life cycle,\nthis would be the transition stage,\n\n416\n00:20:21.185 --> 00:20:23.120\nwhere you appropriately test it.\n\n417\n00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.600\nYou make sure that the business\ncontinuity plans and\n\n418\n00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.710\nthe service management continuity\nplans are put together nicely.\n\n419\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.970\nYou train people, you get the right\npeople involved in the meetings, and\n\n420\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.380\nsay yep,\nwe are ready to bring this to life.\n\n421\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.680\nSo, implementation is the planning itself,\nintroduction, you're informing people.\n\n422\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.940\nYou're circulating the list of people that\nneed to know about it, the conditions for\n\n423\n00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.440\nwhen you do invocate it,\nwhen you start it, right?\n\n424\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.000\nYou define what a disaster is.\n\n425\n00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.970\nIs it after you've been down for\nso long that you then invocate?\n\n426\n00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.978\nAll right, those types of things are it.\n\n427\n00:20:58.978 --> 00:21:01.330\nAll right,\nthat's what implementation is about.\n\n428\n00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.040\nYou're getting everyone on the same page\nabout what this continuity plan actually\n\n429\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.900\nmeans in terms of execution.\n\n430\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.000\nSo there's your recovery plans,\nthere's your implementation planning.\n\n431\n00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.250\nYou're putting it in place,\nyou've got communication plans,\n\n432\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.520\nsecurity plans, personnel plans.\n\n433\n00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.860\nBy personnel plans, that means how do\nyou get people there at the right time.\n\n434\n00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.700\nJoe, you go to the hospital,\npick up the van,\n\n435\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.420\ndrive it over to the other\nend of the county.\n\n436\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.100\nLoad up this equipment,\ncome back over here, that kind of thing.\n\n437\n00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.370\nThe personnel involved in it,\nwhat's gonna be happening, right?\n\n438\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.250\nMaking sure that's all clear and\nunderstood and\n\n439\n00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.470\narticulated to all the stakeholders.\n\n440\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.319\nThat's about the transition part of it,\nthe implementation part of it, right?\n\n441\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.180\nAgain, organizational planning, getting\nthe right people at the right time.\n\n442\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.420\nWhat's the executive team's play on this?\n\n443\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.110\nWhat are the coordination team's play?\n\n444\n00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.300\nWhat are the practitioner plays on this?\n\n445\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.580\nIt's not a simple matter, you have\ngot to get everyone on the same page.\n\n446\n00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.230\nOf course you also build in\nregular review and audit.\n\n447\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.480\nThis is kind of like going back\nthrough after it's in operation.\n\n448\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.250\nYou come back to say, hey,\nis it really still viable?\n\n449\n00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.470\nIs it still working?\n\n450\n00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.760\nIs it going to be as suitable?\n\n451\n00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.099\nHas the business moved,\nis the impact less or more?\n\n452\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.420\nDid the county move the driveway or\nmove it to the other side of the county?\n\n453\n00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.130\nThose kind of things [LAUGH]\ncould be some big picture things.\n\n454\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:25.590\nI know in fact,\nto tell a bad tale perhaps, we had a very,\n\n455\n00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.620\nvery good, we thought,\ncontinuity plan regarding our services.\n\n456\n00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.910\nBut we lost a data center, and\n\n457\n00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:40.410\nour data about recovery was in\nthat data center and nowhere else.\n\n458\n00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.380\nOops, right?\n\n459\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Our plans were good.\n\n460\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.680\nThey tested out nice and easy.\n\n461\n00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.550\n&gt;&gt; That's like saving your backups\non the disk you're backing up.\n\n462\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly right.\n\n463\n00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.330\nThat's a good example.\n\n464\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.350\nLike saving your backups on\nthe disk you're backing up,\n\n465\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.560\nyou're not really helping\nyourself too much.\n\n466\n00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.220\nSo all of our good data\nabout where we're gonna go,\n\n467\n00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.270\nhow we're gonna get it done was stored\nin the data center that needed recovery.\n\n468\n00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.430\nAnd my gosh, what are we gonna do here?\n\n469\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.880\nSo again, don't eat your own tail and\njust chase it.\n\n470\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.541\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nDo as I say, not as I do, right?\n\n471\n00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:09.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever\n\n472\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.090\nthought what a dog's gonna do if\nit actually does catch its tail?\n\n473\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.320\nYou know, it's kinda silly,\nit's just kinda circle down and circle.\n\n474\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.480\nWhat are you gonna do when you catch it?\n\n475\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.740\nWell that's what we were doing by\nstoring it in the same location.\n\n476\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.240\nSo implementation also includes,\nas I mentioned before, the testing of it.\n\n477\n00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.455\nNow this is not a trivial matter.\n\n478\n00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:27.660\nIt's not easy, by the way necessarily,\nto do a full test.\n\n479\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.870\nYou want to actually just walk through it,\nright?\n\n480\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.250\nSo you get everyone on stage and say,\nokay here is what the scenario is.\n\n481\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.760\nJoey, what do you do?\n\n482\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.210\nAnd hopefully Joey responds correctly.\n\n483\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.390\nJoey is supposed to call Mary,\nMary says okay.\n\n484\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.920\nMary, what do you do?\n\n485\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.560\nWho's doing this at the same time, right?\n\n486\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.740\nYou're just walking through it.\n\n487\n00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.060\n&gt;&gt; Isn't this also called\ntabling where you're actually\n\n488\n00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.650\nkind of like acting out the scenario and,\nokay Bob.\n\n489\n00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.020\nI think they also call it tabling.\n\n490\n00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Good call,\nI'll go along with that word.\n\n491\n00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.968\nPutting on the table,\nhashing it out, I like it.\n\n492\n00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:59.522\nOkay.\n\n493\n00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:02.330\nIn some context I got to say I worked for\na British company,\n\n494\n00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.200\ntabling Means you're putting it aside,\nignoring it.\n\n495\n00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.204\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there is that, yeah.\n\n496\n00:24:06.204 --> 00:24:08.914\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to putting it on\nthe table for consideration,\n\n497\n00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:11.860\nyou're putting it on the table for\nnot looking at it anymore.\n\n498\n00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.186\nI table that motion means it's dead for\nnow, that kinda stuff, interesting point.\n\n499\n00:24:16.186 --> 00:24:17.490\n&gt;&gt; Depends on your context.\n\n500\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.510\n&gt;&gt; As long as there's good food and\nbeverage.\n\n501\n00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we're happy to be there.\n\n502\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.840\n&gt;&gt; I'll go along with that one.\n\n503\n00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.000\nI'll be there.\nI won't be late for that meeting.\n\n504\n00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.090\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH] First in line.\n\n505\n00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.598\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nI'll be the first in line for that one.\n\n506\n00:24:27.598 --> 00:24:29.423\n&gt;&gt; I always say, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n507\n00:24:29.423 --> 00:24:31.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly right.\n\n508\n00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.480\nOkay, so that is one approach.\n\n509\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.420\nA walk through.\n\n510\n00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.400\nOr do you do a full test, right?\n\n511\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.290\nOf course,\nthat's the other end of the spectrum,\n\n512\n00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:39.810\nwhere you actually go\nthrough the parameters.\n\n513\n00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.210\nYou don't make a tornado\nhit the data center.\n\n514\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.670\nBut you actually simulate\nthe fact that a tornado hit.\n\n515\n00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.180\nIt's now down, what do we do?\n\n516\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.440\nHow do we get it back up?\n\n517\n00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.130\nA full test can be that dramatic,\nwhere you actually invoke it in a big way.\n\n518\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.560\nPartial test or scenario tests,\n\n519\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.470\nwhere you just test the reactions and\ninterpretations.\n\n520\n00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:05.410\nOf people involved in it,\nvery similar to a walk through,\n\n521\n00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.970\nexcept not everyone is not\nnecessarily there at the same time.\n\n522\n00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.220\nYou can do it in different\nsegments of the organization.\n\n523\n00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:17.540\nI think it's also important to consider\nthat you implicate the do your testing.\n\n524\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.610\nWith the idea that\nthe business is involved.\n\n525\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:23.170\nI wanna reinforce this idea that IT\nservice continuity management and\n\n526\n00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.460\nbusiness continuity management\nare tied at the hip.\n\n527\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:31.660\nSo as you're testing, as you're\nconsidering audits, get them involved too.\n\n528\n00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.630\nThey may say go away,\nit's more important to get in there.\n\n529\n00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.220\nAnd test takers,\nas you consider that challenge on an exam,\n\n530\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:43.590\nthe best answer's going to be one\nthat highly encourages the inclusion\n\n531\n00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.190\nof the business as opposed\nto just do it on your own.\n\n532\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.510\nEven if the business is complaining,\nyou need to get them involved.\n\n533\n00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.270\nThat's the theme we're\ntrying to reinforce here.\n\n534\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.220\nAnd staying with the implementation theme,\n\n535\n00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.870\nmanage this through a formal\nchange management process.\n\n536\n00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.810\nChange management is a process within ITIL\n\n537\n00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:06.420\nthat doesn't just deal\nwith technical changes.\n\n538\n00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.050\nIt deals with process changes,\nbig changes, small changes.\n\n539\n00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.410\nSo I wanted to remind you of that.\n\n540\n00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.790\nYou might have learned that\nfrom the foundation course.\n\n541\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.020\nBut Change Management is\nan all encompassing thing.\n\n542\n00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.900\nIf something is changing, it's in scope\nfor change management pretty much.\n\n543\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.330\nSo if you're implementing a new\nservice continuity management plan,\n\n544\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:25.390\nthat's a significant change.\n\n545\n00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.410\nYou're affecting people's behaviors,\ntheir perceptions, and\n\n546\n00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.410\nyou gotta orient them in the right way.\n\n547\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.760\nChange management has to be\na process that's good at that.\n\n548\n00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.910\nThey're good at asking these questions\nabout the impact of changes, and\n\n549\n00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.710\nthey have good interfaces with\nthe training methodologies,\n\n550\n00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.160\ngood interfaces with\ntechnology methodologies, etc.\n\n551\n00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.560\nSo invoke change management as\nyour approach to transitioning, or\n\n552\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.620\nimplementing, service continuity\nmanagement in your organization.\n\n553\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.210\nAll right?\n\n554\n00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.800\nAnd now, you're going through,\nstage one was the strategic view,\n\n555\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.980\nstage two was the design view, right?\n\n556\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.440\nStage three was more with the transition,\nright?\n\n557\n00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.610\nNow we're getting on\nthe on going operation,\n\n558\n00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:13.890\nwhich should be a good thing to say for\na following up episode as we go ahead and\n\n559\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.340\ncontinue our discussion\non continuity management.\n\n560\n00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.330\nIn future episodes.\n\n561\n00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.950\n&gt;&gt; All right, there it is.\n\n562\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.650\nSounds great.\nLooking forward to seeing the ongoing\n\n563\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.320\noperations portion of the stages\nthat you have before us.\n\n564\n00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.950\nIt's been a great conversation so far.\n\n565\n00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.690\nLike I said,\nI've really enjoyed this series up to now.\n\n566\n00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.880\nHopefully you can continue that.\n\n567\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.081\nI'm setting the bar high, I know.\n\n568\n00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:30.595\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just\n\n569\n00:27:30.595 --> 00:27:31.860\nhoping to keep you entertained, Daniel.\n\n570\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.494\nIt's all about you.\n\n571\n00:27:32.494 --> 00:27:33.563\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIt's all about me.\n\n572\n00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:35.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on, right here buddy.\n\n573\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.870\nHere's where the show's at.\n\n574\n00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.020\nWe're just kidding, having a good time.\n\n575\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.110\nHopefully you guys are enjoying\nthis content as well.\n\n576\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.970\nBut it looks like we're going to have to\nroll into a part two for here the IT.\n\n577\n00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.110\nWhat is this?\n\n578\n00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.040\n&gt;&gt; Service Continuity\n&gt;&gt; Service Continuity Management.\n\n579\n00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.910\nThese acronyms,\nthey'll get you every time.\n\n580\n00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.180\nWe do thank you for joining us thus far\nthough, definitely check out part two for\n\n581\n00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.790\nthis one, but as for this one goes, we're\ngoing to have to sign off for IT pro TV.\n\n582\n00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.490\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n583\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:58.490\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n584\n00:27:58.490 -->

00:00:12.293\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:13.997\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.390\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.890\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.600\nwe are continuing on with\nmore ITIL PPO series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.310\nComing back from more of a IT\ncontinuity management right?\n\n9\n00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.190\nThat's what we're looking at service\ncontinuity management, am I correct?\n\n10\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n11\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Look at me I'm getting\nmy acronyms down.\n\n12\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.320\nAnd as you can see standing\nright next to me joining us yet\n\n13\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.070\nagain to continue that conversation.\n\n14\n00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.850\nMove it along our good friend Mr.\nTerry Decker.\n\n15\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.010\nTerry welcome.\n\n16\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.660\nHow's it going?\n\n17\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.580\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, yep,\ncontinuing our discussion, as Daniel said,\n\n18\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.200\nfor IT service continuity management.\n\n19\n00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.500\nIn this case,\nwe're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n20\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.430\nWe've gone through three of\nthe life cycle stages, if you will,\n\n21\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.770\nof IT service continuity management, and\nnow we're moving on to ongoing operations.\n\n22\n00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560\nSo as you look at the graphic here,\n\n23\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.090\nyou kinda get the visual\nsense of where we've been.\n\n24\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.950\nWe've gone through the initiation,\nthe planning, and\n\n25\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.050\nthe implementation piece which could\nbe analyst to the strategic aspect\n\n26\n00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.040\nof IT service continuity, the design\naspect, and now the transition aspect.\n\n27\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.360\nWell now we're operating it.\n\n28\n00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.420\nWe're actually in operations.\n\n29\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.830\nOur plan is out there suitable for\npurpose, fit for purpose,\n\n30\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.820\nfit for use, presumably.\n\n31\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.310\nSo how do we make sure it remains intact\nand fit for purpose and fit for use?\n\n32\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.040\nWell, ongoing operations means\nyou gotta regularly educate and\n\n33\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.020\nmake people aware, right?\n\n34\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.620\nRegularly review it, regularly test it,\nmanage any changes through change control,\n\n35\n00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.510\nbe in control of this, right?\n\n36\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.910\nSo the nature of this beast is once you've\ngone through that implementation part,\n\n37\n00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.510\npeople change,\nthe business changes, right?\n\n38\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.920\nI've sort of been involved where\nthe plan was well conceived,\n\n39\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.690\nwell tested, well trained.\n\n40\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.880\nEveryone knew what the stakes were.\n\n41\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.860\nBut then the organization shifted.\n\n42\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.680\nJohnnie wasn't there anymore,\nsally wasn't there anymore.\n\n43\n00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.240\nTheir replacements never got invited\nto the continuity planning meeting.\n\n44\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.290\nSo you need to make sure that as you\noperate IT server continuity management\n\n45\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.490\nplans that you keep on task with\nthe various changing landscape of people,\n\n46\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.610\ntechnology, and processes, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.600\nAnd to manage those changes\nthrough change control.\n\n48\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.800\nSo now, what about invocation?\n\n49\n00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.240\nYou are in operations, and\nsomething has triggered the switch.\n\n50\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.840\nIt's time to implement the plan,\nall right?\n\n51\n00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.510\nThe tornado did strike the manufacturing\nplant or your data center.\n\n52\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.080\nOr, the application did fall over,\nirretrievably and\n\n53\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.770\nyou've been down for two days, it's\ntime to do something different, right?\n\n54\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.460\nIt's time to invoke the plan based\non the criteria that's in the plan.\n\n55\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.830\nSo, you gotta be ready for that.\n\n56\n00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.770\nMaybe, it happens at 3 o'clock\nin the morning, maybe,\n\n57\n00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.250\nit happens at a friendlier hour.\n\n58\n00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.770\nWhatever the case,\nthat the plan calls for,\n\n59\n00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.340\nyou gotta be ready to respond\nwhen it happens, right?\n\n60\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.140\nSo, the invocation, itself,\nis gonna be based on defined criteria.\n\n61\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.590\nThere is a cost to invocate a plan, right?\n\n62\n00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.560\nIt's gonna cost people in time,\nit could cost, certainly, real dollars,\n\n63\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.469\nit's certainly gonna cost, probably, the\nuse of equipment, the transfer of people\n\n64\n00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.310\ndistracting them from their day job,\nso there is an impact for invocation.\n\n65\n00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.270\nSo, invocation needs to be following\na very set, set of criteria,\n\n66\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.030\nwhen do we do this, and\nnot just trying to make it up at the end.\n\n67\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.270\nIt includes go get the backup media,\nget the data.\n\n68\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.850\nIt could be go get hardware, it could be\nmoving people, as I mentioned before.\n\n69\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.730\nTell Sally crank up the van,\nwe gotta move some servers\n\n70\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.800\nover to the other side of the county,\nit could be a lot of kind of stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.440\nWho are you communicating with?\n\n72\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.310\nWho's being alerting?\n\n73\n00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.880\nWhat are the actions and\nyour communication?\n\n74\n00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.530\nAll these things have been foreseen in\nthe plan is now your indicating the plan\n\n75\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.150\nyou need to indicate in a methodical way,\nright, is really what it's about.\n\n76\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.200\nAs we've done in previous episodes,\nas we near the end of the episode,\n\n77\n00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.950\nwe see an opportunity to see, in one page,\nthe inputs, triggers, and outputs.\n\n78\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.830\nThis is a great place to pause or\nto fast forward to for that matter,\n\n79\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.490\nas you're doing your review for your exam.\n\n80\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.305\nIf you can come here and\ncan easily assimilate or\n\n81\n00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:24.710\nreassimilate all the factors of inputs,\ntriggers, and output for a given process.\n\n82\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.300\nYou can feel like you're in a pretty good\nplace, that you definitely understand it.\n\n83\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.380\nSo for instance, you might come to this\nand say, hm, I don't know what BIA is.\n\n84\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.540\nYou see the abbreviation there.\n\n85\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.910\nOkay, so\nI gotta remind myself what BIA is,\n\n86\n00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.380\nbusiness impact analysis in this case,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.890\nMaybe you find yourself a little weak on\ntesting schedules and test scenarios or\n\n88\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.730\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n89\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.810\nSo a good place to come to do a general\nassimilation or reassimilation of the key\n\n90\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.680\nfactors and key learning aspects\nassociated with your exams success, right?\n\n91\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.470\nThat also could be said of this\ninteraction among the other processes.\n\n92\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.550\nWe talked about these as we\ntalked about the process as well.\n\n93\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.510\nWe certainly talked\nabout how continuity and\n\n94\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.340\navailability management\nare tied to the hip, right?\n\n95\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.490\nIncident management, that's how you\nmight start invoking the continuity of\n\n96\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.310\nmanagement plan is because\nincidents start coming in, right?\n\n97\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.730\nThe incident could be the tornado\nhit the manufacturing plant, right?\n\n98\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.900\nProblem management, change management,\ncapacity, asset configuration and\n\n99\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.800\ninformation security all related to\ncontinuity in meaningful ways, right.\n\n100\n00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.760\nSo, again reassess, understand how service\ncontinuity can interact with these other\n\n101\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.086\nprocesses as a great point of review,\nassimilation or\n\n102\n00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:39.070\nreassimilation as you prepare to the exam,\nokay.\n\n103\n00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.100\nNow regarding information management,\nthere's lots of thing you consider.\n\n104\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.025\nI mean you need have the plan somewhere,\nmaintain a comprehensive set of these\n\n105\n00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:51.830\nplans, be able to access those\nplan when you need them.\n\n106\n00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.240\nThink about this, I mean having,\nyour data sources, as I described before.\n\n107\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.150\nWe thought we had some pretty good\nservice continuity plans and they were,\n\n108\n00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.800\nthey were well tested,\npretty well designed.\n\n109\n00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.680\nAnd yet they were,\n\n110\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.750\nmost of the data we needed to invoke those\nwas in the data center that got hit right?\n\n111\n00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.100\nAs Daniel said in an earlier episode,\n\n112\n00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.590\nthat's kinda like backing up\nfiles to the same disk, right?\n\n113\n00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.890\nYou're not really giving yourself\nthe redundancy that you need.\n\n114\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.740\nSo of course, where you store these things\nis also of strategic importance, as well.\n\n115\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.040\nIn fact,\nwhat if the network's unavailable, and\n\n116\n00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.580\nyou need to evoke the plan?\n\n117\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.710\nThat suggests you should have\nplans available on your desktop,\n\n118\n00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.370\non your computer.\n\n119\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.390\nSo you don't have to get to the network\nto get to those types of things.\n\n120\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.050\nSo there's lots of considerations here\nabout what the information system is.\n\n121\n00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.770\nI think you shouldn't consider it as\na monolithic system that you purchase and\n\n122\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.800\nconfigure.\n\n123\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.780\nThat's not what system means in this case.\n\n124\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.455\nIt means more a system of interchangeable\n\n125\n00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:56.700\nparts that move together toward a common\ngoal, better way to look at that.\n\n126\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.260\nAnother great place for review.\n\n127\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.380\nAnd I'll read some of these and\nhighlight some of these.\n\n128\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.990\nAnd I'm gonna read all of these to you.\n\n129\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.670\nBut understanding the critical\nsuccess factors and\n\n130\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.540\nthe key performance indicators\nof any given process\n\n131\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.070\ngives you a sense that you\nunderstand that process really well.\n\n132\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.600\nAgain, and a great place to come and\nreview, pause the set, or\n\n133\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.790\npause your stream here,\nand have a good look at.\n\n134\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.560\nOr perhaps fast forward to it when\nyou're trying to do some reviews.\n\n135\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.390\nBut critical success factors and\nkey performance indicators\n\n136\n00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.840\nare a great place to reassimilate\ninformation, as well.\n\n137\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.130\nSo as an example, if you look at\nthis first critical success factor.\n\n138\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.770\nFor continuity management, services can\nbe recovered to meet business objectives.\n\n139\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.810\nOkay so\nwhat are some key performance indicators?\n\n140\n00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.045\nWhat could you measure or what activities\ncould you go through to make sure that\n\n141\n00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:54.060\nyour services can be effectively\nrecovered according to business needs?\n\n142\n00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.479\nSo you validate that service\nrecovery targets are documented and\n\n143\n00:07:57.479 --> 00:07:58.971\nservice level agreements,\n\n144\n00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:03.550\nso with an achievable target you know\nwhat how you should be behaving, right?\n\n145\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.540\nRegular testing of ITSM of service\nof continuity of management plans.\n\n146\n00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.680\nSo don't just publish it and\ntrain it, regularly review it, right.\n\n147\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320\nSo you see the testing and reviews, so\n\n148\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.790\nwhat you can measure then,\nis the number of test you've conducted.\n\n149\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.530\nDo you test annually,\nbi annually, monthly?\n\n150\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.900\nIt kind of depends on\nthe critically of the service.\n\n151\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.820\nAnd how much tolerance you have for\n\n152\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.950\nthat kind of activity,\nalso I would say that too.\n\n153\n00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.840\nDaily.\n[LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.470\n&gt;&gt; A lot of factors really come into play\n\n155\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.440\nto be honest with ya.\n\n156\n00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.460\nIt's all very,\n\n157\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.040\ndepending on your perspective and\nthe item that you're working with,\n\n158\n00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.620\nthe system that you're working in, it's\ngonna change from one thing to the next.\n\n159\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.100\nSo we do the continuity plans you have for\n\n160\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.860\nthis isn't necessarily going to\nequate over here to this system.\n\n161\n00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and services, right?\n\n162\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.290\nWe got systems and services,\nso an excellent point.\n\n163\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.560\nIt's not one size fits all.\n\n164\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.950\nYou'll probably have more than one IT\nservice continuity of management plan.\n\n165\n00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.260\nYou might have master one that kinda\ndescribes the big picture view, but\n\n166\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.650\nthen you're gonna have individual\nplans depending on the service and\n\n167\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.930\nthe criticality of that service.\n\n168\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.210\nVery good point.\n\n169\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.880\nSo again, as other examples of critical\nsuccess factors and potential KPIs,\n\n170\n00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.200\nI move on to the next one.\n\n171\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.260\nAwareness throughout the organization of\nbusiness and IT service continuity plans.\n\n172\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.960\nAgain, this also could be done\nthrough appropriate training and\n\n173\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.350\nregular validation that it's there,\nregular communications, right.\n\n174\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.680\nSo different approaches.\n\n175\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.760\nAgain, if you can look at these,\nand assimilate these, and\n\n176\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.950\nclearly understand them,\n\n177\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.180\nit's a fairly good indication that you\nunderstand this process at a good level.\n\n178\n00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.420\nOkay, now the same thing\nwith challenges and risks.\n\n179\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.600\nAgain, not to read you all the bullets,\nbut understanding the challenges and\n\n180\n00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.830\nrisks of business continuity planning\nversus IT service continuity planning\n\n181\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.210\nis a key component here.\n\n182\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:54.800\nTest takers, the test bakers are often\nkeen to go to challenges and\n\n183\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.560\nrisks to formulate their scenarios.\n\n184\n00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.910\nIn other words, they'll build\na scenario that has challenges and\n\n185\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.090\nrisks inside it, right?\n\n186\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.140\nAnd your response,\n\n187\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.760\nthen, is going to be mitigating those\nrisks in the most appropriate way, right?\n\n188\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.230\nSo as an example, if you are facing\nan organization that does not have,\n\n189\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.910\nthe business is not involved in business\ncontinuity management planning, hm,\n\n190\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.860\nhow can your IT service continuity\nmanagement planning really get a foothold\n\n191\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.090\nIf the business doesn't have one?\n\n192\n00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.230\nSo one of the earlier steps\nis engage the business.\n\n193\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.640\nFind out what their\nbusiness criticality is,\n\n194\n00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.540\nwhat their business impact\nanalysis might look like.\n\n195\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.440\nI have certainly been involved in\norganizations, either a consultant or\n\n196\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.990\nas an employee where IT has\ncome to the business and\n\n197\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.780\nimproved their awareness of the important\nof continuity planning, right?\n\n198\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:54.280\nSo IT service continuity planning should\nnot exist on an island just for IT.\n\n199\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.110\nKeep that in mind.\n\n200\n00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:00.150\nTest takers, as well as you involved in\noperational planning of continuity, right?\n\n201\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.450\nThe linkage to business continuity is key.\n\n202\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.390\nMake that sure.\n\n203\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.420\nNow what about some roles and\nresponsibilities?\n\n204\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.450\nRoles and responsibilities as with the\nother processes include process ownership.\n\n205\n00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.190\nIn the absence of a process owner, you\ndon't really have a person accountable for\n\n206\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.230\nthe quality of the process.\n\n207\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.240\nAnd of course you also need managers and\nthe integration among other processes.\n\n208\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.020\nSo, the interaction among\nprocess managers and\n\n209\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:30.870\nprocess owners is gonna be something you\nneed to institutionalize so to speak.\n\n210\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.420\nMake that part of the way you work, right?\n\n211\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.880\nIf you've had a test,\nwho's going to perform that test,\n\n212\n00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.440\nthat's gonna be a process manager\non a day to day basis right?\n\n213\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.200\nAnd what are those test results look like\nand how do you go about improving it?\n\n214\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.977\nMaybe then it goes back\nto the process owner.\n\n215\n00:11:48.977 --> 00:11:52.498\nPlease keep in mind that I'm\ndistinguishing between the owner of\n\n216\n00:11:52.498 --> 00:11:55.700\nthe process called IT service\ncontinuity of management and\n\n217\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.250\nthe person responsible for\nexecuting the IT service continuity plan.\n\n218\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.680\nPlease note the difference there.\n\n219\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.864\nA process owner is owning the process\nthrough which these plans are ever created\n\n220\n00:12:05.864 --> 00:12:07.140\nright?\n\n221\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.730\nA plan, someone involved\nin the execution of a plan\n\n222\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.447\nis effectively a process manager, right?\n\n223\n00:12:13.447 --> 00:12:16.563\nAll right, good deal.\n\n224\n00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:18.480\nAgain, ensure all staff and\n\n225\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.740\nbusinesses are aware, undertake reviews,\nundertake quality reviews, negotiate and\n\n226\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.700\nmanage if you've got third\nparty contractors involved.\n\n227\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.470\nIn continuity management planning, make\nsure that the agreement that you have in\n\n228\n00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.520\nplace there support your\noverarching goals for recovery.\n\n229\n00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.910\nAnd that they're also involved in\nthe testing and validation of the plans.\n\n230\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.060\nAttend CAB meetings where appropriate.\n\n231\n00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.364\nCertainly if you're changing\ncontinuity plans or\n\n232\n00:12:43.364 --> 00:12:47.370\nbringing new continuity plans\ninto life as I just suggested.\n\n233\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.780\nThat goes through a change\nmanagement rigor.\n\n234\n00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.010\nSo therefore continuity management\npractitioners, owners and\n\n235\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.410\nmanagers are gonna be showing up\nat CAB meetings as appropriate.\n\n236\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.940\nOkay, so now for some review time.\n\n237\n00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.360\nConsider it a little debate,\nconsider it 20 minutes.\n\n238\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.390\nThis is kind of a group exercise.\n\n239\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.530\nWhat you can do in the absence of\na group is takes these things on,\n\n240\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.666\nrepresent what work through your own argue\nwith yourself so to speak, and why, and\n\n241\n00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:20.190\ntake an approach based on the case study\nwhich you can see in the downloads.\n\n242\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.448\nHow would you approach continuity\nof management discussions there.\n\n243\n00:13:22.448 --> 00:13:23.325\nOkay?\n\n244\n00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:25.080\nAll right?\n\n245\n00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.000\nThere's also an exercise associated with\nthis, also downloadable available for\n\n246\n00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.550\nIT continuity of\nmanagement considerations.\n\n247\n00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.370\nRemember, good self-study.\n\n248\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.620\nAnd there is also the practice exams,\nright?\n\n249\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.138\nThe practice exams will have one,\nmaybe two questions each on continuity of\n\n250\n00:13:41.138 --> 00:13:47.000\nmanagement that can give you a good\npacing of your chops if you will.\n\n251\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.350\nUnderstanding DISS if you\nunderstand this concept well and\n\n252\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.770\nthese activities very well.\n\n253\n00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.110\nThat's continuity of management.\n\n254\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.030\n&gt;&gt; All right well Terry,\n\n255\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.560\nIT continuity of management is\ndefinitely a very cool topic.\n\n256\n00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.750\nI actually really find it interesting\nbecause I've worked in IT and I've done\n\n257\n00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.680\na lot of these things without even\nthinking about it to be honest with you.\n\n258\n00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.390\nDavid is just kind of like, yeah,\nwe need to do this, we need to do that.\n\n259\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.680\nAnd you've presented it in a more\nformalized manner which makes it go,\n\n260\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.010\nthat's why we did that.\n\n261\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.380\nAnd things start to make\na little more sense to me.\n\n262\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; As I worked with him, so\n\n263\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.020\nI appreciate that.\n\n264\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.710\n&gt;&gt; Good deal.\n&gt;&gt; And I appreciate you joining us today\n\n265\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Appreciate our audience for\n\n266\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.790\njoining us as well I know this is kind of\na short episode but we just have a little\n\n267\n00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.650\nextra bit we needed to tag on to IT\nservice continuity of management.\n\n268\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.470\nHopefully you get a lot out of it but\nit is time for us to sign off.\n\n269\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.280\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n270\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n271\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.201\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:08.158\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.158 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.382\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.150\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.450\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.680\nwe're continuing on with\nmore on our ITIL PPO series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.720\nAnd joining as yet again in the studio\nis our good friend, Mr. Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.850\nTerry, welcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.800\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.897\n&gt;&gt; Glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:33.660\nAnd as Daniel said, will continue our\nplanning, production, optimization series.\n\n14\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.410\nAnd we're going to dive in to IT Security\nManagement in this particular episode of.\n\n15\n00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.332\nDaniel what is IT security\nmanagement means to you?\n\n16\n00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:45.153\n&gt;&gt; Man, IT security management is probably\na guy whose got bunch of guys underneath\n\n17\n00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:47.440\nhim that do security type stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.770\nTypically, this will be\nsecurity plus certification.\n\n19\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.540\nMaybe even CISSP,\nif they're high enough level.\n\n20\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.760\nThat kind of certification,\nor that sphere of knowledge.\n\n21\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no.\n\n22\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.965\nThis ain't really that.\n\n23\n00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:01.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This ain't that.\n\n24\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.540\n&gt;&gt; This ain't really that.\n\n25\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.870\nIt's more about the management parts.\n\n26\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.690\nYou did mention that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n27\n00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.400\nWhat about management?\n\n28\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.275\nRemember that ITIL is not a best\npractice for security management.\n\n29\n00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:12.070\nIt doesn't pretend to be, right?\n\n30\n00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.250\nSo when you consider security\nmanagement and the other many acronyms,\n\n31\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.378\nalphabet soup,\nthat Daniel spewed out there.\n\n32\n00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:21.275\nThere are a lot of certifications related\nto the technical aspects of security\n\n33\n00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:22.300\nmanagement.\n\n34\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.930\nAnd while, IT security management\nas a process within ITIL or\n\n35\n00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.520\nIT service management discipline is\nnot void of technical considerations.\n\n36\n00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.350\nWe certainly got to\nconsider the technology,\n\n37\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.240\nit doesn't pretend to go that deep.\n\n38\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.440\nRight, never does.\n\n39\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.240\n&gt;&gt; So this is the 30,000 foot view.\n\n40\n00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.357\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, somewhere in that ballpark,\n30,000 to 15,000 maybe.\n\n41\n00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:41.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Somewhere in that ballpark.\n\n42\n00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:42.260\n&gt;&gt; The turbulence.\n\n43\n00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.570\n&gt;&gt; The turbulence that's right.\n\n44\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.058\nAnd then if you fall out without\na parachute it's still gonna hurt.\n\n45\n00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:46.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n46\n00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.079\n[LAUGH] You're not gonna have a good day.\n\n47\n00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.429\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not gonna be good.\n\n48\n00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.059\nSo really I think that's probably,\n\n49\n00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:52.369\neven though it's kind of funny,\n\n50\n00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.630\nit is a way to describe that\nyou wanna do this well.\n\n51\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.895\nYou wanna do security management well.\n\n52\n00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.076\nYou wanna plan it appropriately,\nhave an appropriate strategy in mind for\n\n53\n00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.970\nhow security's gonna be managed.\n\n54\n00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.610\nAnd have appropriate policies that back up\nyour security management methodologies.\n\n55\n00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.383\nSo, it's not these specific\nactivities we're gonna dive into.\n\n56\n00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:12.380\nYou're not going to design\nfirewall port assignments.\n\n57\n00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.240\nYou're not going to configure HTTPS,\nor any those kind of things,\n\n58\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.670\nthat's not what this is about.\n\n59\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.631\nIt's about the high level view of\nplanning the appropriate strategy, and\n\n60\n00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:26.420\ntechniques for managing security for\nyour IT services.\n\n61\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.696\nSo let's have a look at some\nof the objectives here,\n\n62\n00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:30.160\nyou'll see the purpose itself.\n\n63\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.070\nTo align IT security with\nbusiness security needs, right?\n\n64\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.860\nAnd you see some of the buzz\nwords related to security often.\n\n65\n00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.900\nAny given security plus person would\nrecognized theses managed confidentiality,\n\n66\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.080\nintegrity, availability and\nauthenticity, non repediation.\n\n67\n00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.610\nThese factors of confidentiality.\n\n68\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.840\nThe right people get to see it,\nthe wrong people don't.\n\n69\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.650\nThe integrity.\n\n70\n00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.380\nThe data has integrity in state,\nin storage In transit, right?\n\n71\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.610\nSo the integrity of the data and\ninformation itself is maintained.\n\n72\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.190\nThat it's available, that you're\nmanaging against now services tax,\n\n73\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.930\nor you're managing against viruses and\nthings that corrupt data.\n\n74\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080\nSo that the data is available as well.\n\n75\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.920\nAnd then authenticity and non-repudiation.\n\n76\n00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.520\nYou know that the person you're sending it\nto is actually the person you're sending\n\n77\n00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.850\nto and vice versa.\n\n78\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.410\nSo, for instance when you put your\ncredit card information in amazon.com\n\n79\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.750\nyou are reasonably assured that you're\ngiving your credit card to Amazon.com, and\n\n80\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.780\nnot some fisherman out there\ntrying to grab your credit card.\n\n81\n00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.000\nThat type of authenticity and\nnon-repudiation is also in play as well.\n\n82\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920\nSo, conceptually, obviously security\nmanagement is involved in technology.\n\n83\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.330\nThey're going to be,\nit's just not at the deep level, okay.\n\n84\n00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.220\nSo, the scope is the focal point for\n\n85\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.560\nall IT security issues, and\nyou maintain an IT security policy.\n\n86\n00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.206\nSometimes security is actually\nput even outside of IT sometimes.\n\n87\n00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:01.320\nI've seen some organizations where\nthe security function, even for IT.\n\n88\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.880\nThey report through a different chain\nof command then through the CIO.\n\n89\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.150\nThey actually make it\na separate discipline, right.\n\n90\n00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.614\nYou can certainly, I'm not suggesting\nyou do that, I'm just saying that it is\n\n91\n00:04:10.614 --> 00:04:13.470\na separate discipline, and\nhaving a policy for dealing with it.\n\n92\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.400\nAnd it's not just, the integrity of\ninformation on a server within a database.\n\n93\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.170\nYou can also include physical security,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.272\nAccess to the data center with\na locked door [CROSSTALK].\n\n95\n00:04:26.272 --> 00:04:28.950\n&gt;&gt; As they say, guards,\ngates and guns, right?\n\n96\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.100\n&gt;&gt; Guards, gates and guns.\n\n97\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.620\nGood call.\n\n98\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good call.\n\n99\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.590\n&gt;&gt; So it also can include those types of\nthings is what the scope of it is, right?\n\n100\n00:04:36.768 --> 00:04:40.130\nSo to be effective, information security\nmanagement needs to understand,\n\n101\n00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.680\nwhat are the needs of the business?\n\n102\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.940\nYou don't wanna lock things down so\n\n103\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.590\nmuch that people can't actually get to the\ndata without a lot of pain, necessarily.\n\n104\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.548\nI've worked in some highly\nsecure environments,\n\n105\n00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:53.304\nit is rather constricted sometimes,\nmy gosh.\n\n106\n00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:56.780\nYou know like, you sure I can't\nhave a thumb drive, come on please.\n\n107\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.540\nI'm just taking it over to Johnny over\nthere, please, like that kind of thing.\n\n108\n00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.182\nBut yeah, you can't have a thumb drive,\nno we're not doing it,\n\n109\n00:05:02.182 --> 00:05:03.586\nwe're blocking this thing down.\n\n110\n00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:09.520\n[LAUGHS] I remember years ago, when single\nsign on was not so easily implemented.\n\n111\n00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.970\nWhere, I worked at an organization\nthat had so many passwords.\n\n112\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.800\nA password for your email, which was\nseparate than the password to the network,\n\n113\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.150\nwhich was separate than the password for\nthat application, and that application.\n\n114\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.060\nYou might have ten passwords to manage.\n\n115\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.145\n&gt;&gt; Users love that, by the way.\n\n116\n00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:23.757\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n117\n00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:27.165\nDifferent renewal policies,\nor complexity policy.\n\n118\n00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:28.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are fun.\n\n119\n00:05:28.656 --> 00:05:32.760\n&gt;&gt; So, a lot of people just put\na text file, or a spreadsheet, or\n\n120\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.530\nsome sort of file, on their computer\ndesktop, and remember one password.\n\n121\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.525\nKind of even violating the actual\npurpose and spirit of that security, or\n\n122\n00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:46.905\nthey tape it to the top of the laptop\nthat even worst, that type of thing.\n\n123\n00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:51.215\nSo, you get the idea it needs to be\neffective, it needs to be the right size\n\n124\n00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:55.660\nas we talk about other things to maintain\nthe integrity and confidentiality.\n\n125\n00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.800\nAnd also to allow people to work, right?\n\n126\n00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.580\nAnd once you understand that overall\nscope, what the business of sensitivity\n\n127\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.340\nis, we had classification systems for\ndifferent types of information.\n\n128\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.552\nSome information was considered\nmore securable than others, and\n\n129\n00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:11.880\nthat sort of thing, okay.\n\n130\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.967\nOnce you have that understood,\n\n131\n00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:19.620\nthen you have a better place to begin your\nIT security management disciplines, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.250\nSo why do it?\n\n133\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.140\n&gt;&gt; Why secure things?\n\n134\n00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.770\n&gt;&gt; Maybe regulatory\nagencies say you should.\n\n135\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.510\nI mean, passing out my medical records\nto anybody that wants them is not\n\n136\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.320\na good idea.\n\n137\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.725\nGiving up my bank statements to anybody\nthat want them is not a good idea.\n\n138\n00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:37.411\nFor me as a user, so\nI have privacy concerns.\n\n139\n00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:38.899\nI have financial concerns,\n\n140\n00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.120\nyou might have confidentiality concerns\nrelated to proprietary information.\n\n141\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.450\nYour top secret corporate documents,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n142\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.280\nOr serving might work in a government\narea is where security is,\n\n143\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.140\nof national security interest,\nand those types of things, right?\n\n144\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.640\nSo what value do we get?\n\n145\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.610\nWell, we get the appropriate value for\nthe appropriate risks, right?\n\n146\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.200\nTo ensure that IT security matches and\n\n147\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.300\nsupports that overall business\nsecurity policy, the things they post.\n\n148\n00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.490\n&gt;&gt; Guards, guns, and?\n\n149\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.390\n&gt;&gt; Gates.\n&gt;&gt; Gates.\n\n150\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.470\nAll right, there you go.\n\n151\n00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Ultimately, who's responsible for\nthe organization information?\n\n152\n00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.580\nThe CIO?\nThe Information Security Manager?\n\n153\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.770\nThe executive management?\n\n154\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.710\nThe Security Management process owner?\n\n155\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.280\nWho actually is responsible for\nthe organization's information?\n\n156\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.550\n&gt;&gt; I would say everyone is.\n\n157\n00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n158\n00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.300\nIt's not monolithic,\nyou're responsible for it, it can't be.\n\n159\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.970\nThere's no way that any one person\ncan keep this thing safe, so\n\n160\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.780\nit needs to be backed by appropriate\npolicy, as well as culture.\n\n161\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.280\nAnd most folks kind of get\nthe policy side of things.\n\n162\n00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.660\nYou've been involved in following\npolicies, maybe there's a policy that you\n\n163\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.160\nlock your desktop before you\nstep away from it, right?\n\n164\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.110\nThat you change your password every so\noften,\n\n165\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.740\nthat it has complexity rules\nassociated with it, right?\n\n166\n00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.893\nThose types of things\nare driven by policy Right?\n\n167\n00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:59.165\nAnd IT security management is\nthe primary driver for that, right?\n\n168\n00:07:59.165 --> 00:08:00.698\nSo who's responsible?\n\n169\n00:08:00.698 --> 00:08:01.732\nEveryone is.\n\n170\n00:08:01.732 --> 00:08:03.797\nThat's really what the answer\nto that question is.\n\n171\n00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:05.289\nOkay, and you drive it through policy.\n\n172\n00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:12.771\nSome of the things that might involved\nin policy, what's your policy for\n\n173\n00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.150\nsecurity patching?\n\n174\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.590\nDo you do it?\n\n175\n00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:17.930\nDo you test them fully?\n\n176\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.930\nOr implement now, test later?\n\n177\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.440\nThere's different ways to\napproach these kind of questions.\n\n178\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.420\nSo answer them and have solid answers\n\n179\n00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.180\nembodied in your policies as well\nas in your management plans.\n\n180\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.890\nWhat about proprietary information?\n\n181\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.660\nAre there copyright rules\nyou have to maintain?\n\n182\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.990\nAre there branding rules,\ntrademark rules that you need to maintain?\n\n183\n00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.752\nThe privacy of information\nthat you need to maintain?\n\n184\n00:08:40.752 --> 00:08:43.293\nPersonal identifiable information or\n\n185\n00:08:43.293 --> 00:08:46.300\nprivate information on\nbehalf of your users.\n\n186\n00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:51.126\nSo doing a risk assessment, understanding,\n\n187\n00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.270\ndo vulnerability tests\nare sometimes called.\n\n188\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.170\nUnderstand where your risks are and\n\n189\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.580\ntry to collaborate through the business to\nfind out where your vulnerabilities are.\n\n190\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.300\nSo, providing an information security\n\n191\n00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.950\nmanagement approach is at least one part\nunderstanding the risks of losing, and\n\n192\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.220\nthe business impact of losing information\nor compromising information, right?\n\n193\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.850\nSo come up with the system,\nall these things have had systems,\n\n194\n00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.190\nhave the Capacity Management\nInformation System,\n\n195\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.520\nwe've had Availability\nManagement Information System,\n\n196\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.525\nan IT Service Continuity\nInformation System.\n\n197\n00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:28.120\nAnd Information Security Management,\ninformation system would be good, too.\n\n198\n00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.266\nComing up with a system to keep\nall these data points in line and\n\n199\n00:09:32.266 --> 00:09:36.971\navailable as you need them,\nincluding aspects of people, product,\n\n200\n00:09:36.971 --> 00:09:40.502\nprocesses, and\nthe partners that help you do this.\n\n201\n00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:42.300\nDesign security with those things in mind.\n\n202\n00:09:45.787 --> 00:09:47.460\nPolicy, we've talked about.\n\n203\n00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.890\nGuidelines, organizational structure,\nwho reports to who.\n\n204\n00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.740\nCan the security manager tell the CIO\nshut down that service right now?\n\n205\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.080\nThat's part of\nthe organizational structures.\n\n206\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.270\nWho is on point,\n\n207\n00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:06.250\nwho is leading the hierarchical\norganization as it relates to security?\n\n208\n00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.130\nWho can approve certain types of changes?\n\n209\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.290\nWho has to approve those types of\nchanges as relates to security?\n\n210\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.740\nWhat are the password\ncomplexity requirements for\n\n211\n00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.970\nadministrators of systems versus\nusers of systems, perhaps.\n\n212\n00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.240\nMaybe they have different\nrenewal policies for\n\n213\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.250\nadministrators than you do rank and\nfile users.\n\n214\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.660\nThat type of thing.\n\n215\n00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.600\nAnd of course, you want to promulgate this\ninformation, make sure everyone is aware.\n\n216\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.930\nSo appropriate staff training and\nawareness plan.\n\n217\n00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.630\nHow are you gonna make sure everyone knows\nwhat they're supposed to do to comply?\n\n218\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.820\nAnd you keep that fresh.\n\n219\n00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.100\nYou keep it in front of them.\n\n220\n00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.210\nI worked as a consultant,\nas an employee actually, for\n\n221\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.360\nan organizations that had\nregular security reviews.\n\n222\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:53.110\nI say regular once a year you took\nsecurity awareness training module.\n\n223\n00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.030\nAnd in that module they also talked about,\nthey refreshed it every year and\n\n224\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.140\nthey talked about where\nvulnerability were exposed\n\n225\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.540\ndue to the lack of discipline of people.\n\n226\n00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.590\nNot because the systems were there, but\nbecause you left your laptop open or\n\n227\n00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.670\nyou shared your password with\nsomeone you didn't really know.\n\n228\n00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.521\nThat type of thing, so they kinda give\nyou some examples of those things.\n\n229\n00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:14.578\nAnd renewing and\n\n230\n00:11:14.578 --> 00:11:19.120\nkeeping a security awareness fresh\nin the minds of the users and staff.\n\n231\n00:11:21.224 --> 00:11:23.460\nSo, pretty little picture here,\n\n232\n00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.165\nbasically describing that Information\nSecurity Management got a lot of\n\n233\n00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:31.700\nactivities similar to\nthe lifecycle approach.\n\n234\n00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.410\nYou're planning the strategic aspect,\nyou're implementing it.\n\n235\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.350\nI'm sorry,\nplanning is more about the designer,\n\n236\n00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.270\nbut you're implementing\nit through transition.\n\n237\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:45.512\nYour on-going evaluation through operation\nand maintain, you maintain these and\n\n238\n00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:49.370\napprove the security management\ndiscipline as you go along.\n\n239\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.289\nAnd notice it's cyclical.\n\n240\n00:11:50.289 --> 00:11:53.481\n&gt;&gt; Cyclical.\n\n241\n00:11:53.481 --> 00:11:55.987\n&gt;&gt; Easy for you to say.\n\n242\n00:11:55.987 --> 00:11:56.842\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n243\n00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:58.342\n&gt;&gt; Now that you've fumbled it a few times,\n\n244\n00:11:58.342 --> 00:11:59.667\nI was like yeah, what is that?\n\n245\n00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.988\nRight, yeah it's cyclical,\nthat's pretty good, cyclical.\n\n246\n00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:04.772\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:12:04.772 --> 00:12:05.936\n&gt;&gt; Circular, cyclical,\n\n248\n00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:09.370\nwhatever you\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, it is ongoing,\n\n249\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.590\nit never stops, it is cyclical.\n\n250\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.210\nSo just as it is with those\nother processes we've discussed,\n\n251\n00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.290\nit's not enough just to launch your plans,\nyou have to keep monitoring them and\n\n252\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.140\nmake sure they're fit for\nuse and fit for purpose, okay?\n\n253\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.082\nControlling is really about\nestablishing the framework.\n\n254\n00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:33.278\nControlling is the aspect of\nunderstanding all the architectural\n\n255\n00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:37.274\nelements as well as\nthe organizational elements.\n\n256\n00:12:37.274 --> 00:12:40.186\nBy organizational I mean, you'd have\nappropriate people responsible for\n\n257\n00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:41.290\ndoing that.\n\n258\n00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.108\nSo my first day of employment,\nI call the service desk and I say,\n\n259\n00:12:45.108 --> 00:12:49.658\nI'd like access to the HR database,\nI wanna review everyone's salaries.\n\n260\n00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:53.317\nThe service test makes me\npretty suspicious about that.\n\n261\n00:12:53.317 --> 00:12:53.878\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate\n\n262\n00:12:53.878 --> 00:12:57.560\nthe laughter because most folks would\nprobably say well that's just ridiculous.\n\n263\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.310\nWhy?\n\n264\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.310\nWhy do most folks think that's kind of\nridiculous that a brand new employee could\n\n265\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:06.830\ncall the service desk and\nsay I want to see everyone's salary?\n\n266\n00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.240\nA couple things are in play there.\n\n267\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.079\nThere is probably policy in place\nthat says that's not how it goes.\n\n268\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.530\nThere probably is policy in place,\n\n269\n00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.340\nbut there's even a cultural\nawareness thing gong on there.\n\n270\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.990\nPeople just know-\n&gt;&gt; Intuitively\n\n271\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.730\n&gt;&gt; Intuitively that in this particular\n\n272\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.380\norganization we don't\nshare people's salaries,\n\n273\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.820\nthat's not just what we do, right?\n\n274\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.030\nSo this concept of policy driven down and\ndefined and\n\n275\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.540\neveryone reviews the policies and\nchecks off that they agree to it and\n\n276\n00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.600\nthat sort of thing,\nthat is certainly important.\n\n277\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.380\nI'm not devaluing it in any way, but\nit's also a culture of security awareness.\n\n278\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.460\nHow are we supposed to behave?\n\n279\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.010\nSo, embedding this cultural aspect of\nsecurity where you are thinking about it.\n\n280\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.010\nI worked in high security\nenvironments before, and it was just,\n\n281\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.160\nthere were posters everywhere,\nyou know, you've done that as well?\n\n282\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.832\n&gt;&gt; Loose lips sink ships, right?\n\n283\n00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:52.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n284\n00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.201\n&gt;&gt; It's like World War Two propoganda.\n\n285\n00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:57.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, loose lips,\nsink ships, exactly.\n\n286\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.260\nSo, it's allocating responsibilities,\nunderstanding controls,\n\n287\n00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.120\nthat's what this is about.\n\n288\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.080\nIt's cultural, it's policy, it's planning,\nand it's organizational and\n\n289\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.800\nprocess driven.\n\n290\n00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.800\nIn so many ways I think I'm preaching\nto the choir when it comes to\n\n291\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.580\nsecurity management.\n\n292\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.830\nMost organizations that deal\nwith information systems\n\n293\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.000\nhave gotten the memo that\nsecurity's important.\n\n294\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.250\nYou might not have heard of capacity\nmanagement before this, right?\n\n295\n00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.090\nYou might not have seen\nit as a formal process.\n\n296\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.840\nMaybe you didn't view continuity\nmanagement as a formal process, perhaps.\n\n297\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.520\nI think it would be rare to find\nan IT person that didn't understand\n\n298\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.290\nsecurity management as one of\nthings that needs to done.\n\n299\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.400\nSo, don't think of it anymore\nelaborately then that, really.\n\n300\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.920\nIt’s those intuitive grasps you have\nthat security management is important\n\n301\n00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.490\nwill serve you well, okay.\n\n302\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.955\nOf course you end up planning, as we\ntalked about before, in the life cycle\n\n303\n00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:52.905\napproach the planning is where you're\nreally kind of designed, right?\n\n304\n00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:56.425\nDevise and recommend appropriate\nsecurity measures, right?\n\n305\n00:14:56.425 --> 00:15:00.625\nYou're looking at agreements you have\nwith the business through you SLA's,\n\n306\n00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:03.405\nOLA's, contracts, legal, right?\n\n307\n00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:06.265\nThere could be regulatory reasons why.\n\n308\n00:15:06.265 --> 00:15:08.635\nAgain, a hospitals got to\nprotect their patient records.\n\n309\n00:15:09.805 --> 00:15:12.480\nHIPA requirements I think they're called.\n\n310\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.570\nThat they mean to maintain\nthe privacy of your medical records.\n\n311\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.040\nI think I said training records,\nmedical records.\n\n312\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.610\nSo, certainly I don't want my credit card\ninformation passed around to everyone.\n\n313\n00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.610\nSo, understanding those requirements\nfrom a regulatory aspect and\n\n314\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.120\nfrom an aspect of what you've\nagreed to with your business users.\n\n315\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.210\nAnd of course, you have to make sure\nappropriate funding is available to\n\n316\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.600\npay for the security management\nsystems you want to bring to bear.\n\n317\n00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.480\nThis is all about design.\n\n318\n00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.820\nUltimately, you'd implement,\nthis is the transition phase,\n\n319\n00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.420\nyou're bringing it to life.\n\n320\n00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.162\nYou make sure the right tools are in\nplace, processes are tested, understood,\n\n321\n00:15:49.162 --> 00:15:52.369\nyou do the appropriate training,\nyou get the policies understood.\n\n322\n00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:57.115\nEveryone, you effectively market it,\nso to speak education and\n\n323\n00:15:57.115 --> 00:15:59.022\nyou also build into this.\n\n324\n00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:04.390\nFeedback mechanisms, so that you can make\nsure you get improvement ideas understood,\n\n325\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.650\nand feedback for failures, right?\n\n326\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.795\nA way to monitor the potential failures\nin the security regimen, okay?\n\n327\n00:16:13.795 --> 00:16:18.460\nOngoing evaluation,\nyou're making sure it's working.\n\n328\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.160\nIt's probably like the meat and potatoes\nof this topic, to be honest with you.\n\n329\n00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.980\nIf you're not evaluating what it is\nyou're doing, then you're really kinda\n\n330\n00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.410\nbanging a drum and signifying nothing but\nsound a fury, right?\n\n331\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.220\nBecause if you're not taking a look at\nwhat are we doing, is it effective,\n\n332\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.120\nis it not effective,\ndo we need to make changes?\n\n333\n00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.020\nAnd if we do, then implement them, why\nare you even getting in the game, right?\n\n334\n00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.160\n&gt;&gt; I agree, and\nit's a tough puzzle to solve sometimes,\n\n335\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.680\nbecause you don't wanna get\nin the way of the business.\n\n336\n00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.910\nYou wanna make sure they can do what\nthey need to do at a right time and\n\n337\n00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.782\nright place, get access the day they want,\nwhile securing it too.\n\n338\n00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:54.260\nThere's an interesting book out there,\n\n339\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.860\nits called The Phoenix Project\nwritten by Gene Kim.\n\n340\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.945\nAnd it talks about, basically it talks\nabout the dysfunction between developers\n\n341\n00:17:01.945 --> 00:17:04.563\nand operations,\nthat's really what the focus is.\n\n342\n00:17:04.563 --> 00:17:09.294\nBut what's funny about it is here's a\nsecurity manager, he's a caricature, he's\n\n343\n00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:13.781\nan exaggeration of a security type manager\nand he says no to everything, right?\n\n344\n00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:16.024\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's just his default answer.\n\n345\n00:17:16.024 --> 00:17:19.164\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, too risky, too risky.\n\n346\n00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.050\n&gt;&gt; So again, it's a character, but\n\n347\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.930\nit also plays to a very important\nnote about security management.\n\n348\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.600\nYou need to have the right kind of\nbalance of control, and flexibility.\n\n349\n00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.760\nAnd, what that balance is,\nis different for a different organization.\n\n350\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.105\nIf you work for\nthe National Security Agency,\n\n351\n00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:39.790\nyour security requirements are a little\nbit different than if you work at\n\n352\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.600\na software development shop,\nbecause it's kind of different.\n\n353\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.190\nSo understanding the right balance and\n\n354\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.950\nstriking that balance is a key\ncomponent of your evaluation as well.\n\n355\n00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.940\nAre we still in balance\nas we go down here?\n\n356\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.838\nAnd evaluation is also about\nnoticing your vulnerabilities and\n\n357\n00:17:55.838 --> 00:17:58.770\nhave they been exploited?\n\n358\n00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.310\nSo keeping in tune with security\nneeds ongoing is a big part of this.\n\n359\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.730\nRight, so then you have maintenance,\nmaintain,\n\n360\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.490\nimprove if you can the security\narrangements, right?\n\n361\n00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.770\nSometimes this is just as simple as\nkeeping up with security patches,\n\n362\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.742\nknowing the vulnerabilities.\n\n363\n00:18:15.742 --> 00:18:19.028\nStay intuned to the security analysis\nthat you, of your vendors that they\n\n364\n00:18:19.028 --> 00:18:22.580\nmight pass to you, or vulnerabilities\nthat more are more publicly available,\n\n365\n00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.863\nthat sort of thing, right?\n\n366\n00:18:23.863 --> 00:18:27.492\nAnd this idea of understanding,\nusing a constant cycle,\n\n367\n00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:31.861\nthe Plan Do Check Act Cycle,\nthat's the Demings cycle highlighted,\n\n368\n00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.933\nthe PDCA, where in a cycle of\nplanning you then do something, and\n\n369\n00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:40.490\nthen you check to see if,\nmove the needle in the right direction.\n\n370\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.820\nSo, let's say you've had\nsome security breaches,\n\n371\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.330\nyou need it to plan to do something about\nthat, so you plan to do something and\n\n372\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.662\nthen you do something about it.\n\n373\n00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:52.630\nWhat do I need to check,\nare there still breaches happening, or\n\n374\n00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:56.480\nis that vulnerability been plugged,\nthat sort of thing, all right.\n\n375\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.510\nProcesses, how many processes are there,\nthis is a very busy slide and\n\n376\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.920\nnot worth memorizing.\n\n377\n00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I promise you,\n\n378\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.970\ndon't worry about that so much.\n\n379\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:12.286\nBut the processes are about monitoring\nevaluation, we've talked about those,\n\n380\n00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:17.525\nmaintain your security policy, make\nsure it's working, right, and this also\n\n381\n00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:22.942\ncan all be collated into your IT security\nmanagement information system, right?\n\n382\n00:19:22.942 --> 00:19:26.788\nSo it's basically just circling the wagons\nand documenting what you're doing,\n\n383\n00:19:26.788 --> 00:19:29.120\nright, in this information system.\n\n384\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.310\nAnd there's also controls in place, right?\n\n385\n00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:37.470\nUnderstanding your threats,\nif you have a thread that's been exposed,\n\n386\n00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.990\nyou have an incident,\nthen what damage did it do?\n\n387\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.570\nAnd what's your control response to it,\nor corrective response to it, right?\n\n388\n00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:51.120\nRoll back, restore, back out, right,\nget rid of that data, come back over so if\n\n389\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.320\nyou've had your database has been attacked\nand all the data has been corrupted,\n\n390\n00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.020\nif you got it backed up somewhere we can\nget back to a known point objective.\n\n391\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.720\nThat sort of thing, okay?\n\n392\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.360\nSecurity breaches, how do you manage them?\n\n393\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.920\nOf course you got to evaluate them.\n\n394\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.757\nWhat happened, how big was it, how big\nis the vulnerability remaining, right?\n\n395\n00:20:13.757 --> 00:20:17.265\nThese things happen, hopefully they\nnever happen but you know they do,\n\n396\n00:20:17.265 --> 00:20:19.180\nwhat is your response to them?\n\n397\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.730\nTransparency and appropriate response\nis the operating word because\n\n398\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.710\niTool is not a desk practice for\nsecurity management.\n\n399\n00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.380\nThis high level, this 30,000 foot view,\nis sufficient, right,\n\n400\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.170\nyou're gonna have to manage\nthe breaches that happen.\n\n401\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.880\nAs we've done with other processes,\nthis forms a great place to review\n\n402\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.940\nthe pertinent facts related to a given\nprocess, the inputs, the triggers, and\n\n403\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.000\noutputs.\n\n404\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.470\nAgain, I'm not going to throughout,\ndo 24 different bullet points here.\n\n405\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.310\nBut if you can come here, either pause\nthe screen and have a good look, or\n\n406\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.470\nas you're reviewing for\nthe exam a little bit later on come and\n\n407\n00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.830\nlook to assimilate or\nre-assimilate these valid points.\n\n408\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.910\nYou'll find a lot of value here, it's\nlike a one page summary of the various\n\n409\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.800\ninteractions in conjunction with this one,\nthe web one we've seen in other episodes.\n\n410\n00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.730\nWhere you see how security management\ninterfaces with other processes and\n\n411\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.230\nactivities.\n\n412\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.510\nSome of them are not necessarily IT,\nright?\n\n413\n00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.150\nLook at legal and\nHR in the lower right hand corner here.\n\n414\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.210\nCertainly knowing what the legal\nramifications are, the regulatory risks,\n\n415\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:31.280\nand HR, where a lot of data\nabout employees is at, and\n\n416\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.290\nthe promises you make to employees to\nkeep their information secure, right?\n\n417\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.456\nI know my Social Security number is there,\n\n418\n00:21:38.456 --> 00:21:42.139\nI know my paycheck's information's\nin there, those kinds of things.\n\n419\n00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:46.620\nEven medical records could be driven\nthrough HR because they have access\n\n420\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.480\nto certain aspects of my coverages and\nthose kinds of things.\n\n421\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.260\nClearly, Access Management,\njust to highlight another one here,\n\n422\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.960\nAccess Management is the process\nwithin the iTool framework\n\n423\n00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.500\nthat is effectively the operational\nextension of security management.\n\n424\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.270\nSo in service operations,\nyou control access to information,\n\n425\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.070\nit's through Access Management\nthat that control is exercised.\n\n426\n00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.230\nSo you define it in IT\nsecurity management, or\n\n427\n00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.340\ninformation security management.\n\n428\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.140\nYou define how access is going to\nbe controlled in Access Management,\n\n429\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.690\nthe process is actually one of those\ncontrol mechanisms that are actually\n\n430\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.240\nexecuted, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.940\nAnd then information management,\nwe saw a brief picture of it earlier on.\n\n432\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.550\nThere's lots of data points\nassociated with security management,\n\n433\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.040\nwhat controls you have in place,\nwhat risks you have,\n\n434\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.270\nwhat breaches you've had, what processes\nare in place, what reports you've had.\n\n435\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.150\nKeeping all that type of\ninformation in some sort\n\n436\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.050\nof security management information system\nis a great recommendation from iTool.\n\n437\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.520\nAs I've talked about it\nin previous episodes,\n\n438\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.580\nthis doesn't mean that you have to go out\nand buy a security management system or\n\n439\n00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.230\nengineer some really elaborate\nrelational database.\n\n440\n00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.060\nIt could simply be a collection of\ndifferent data sources that kind of work\n\n441\n00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.670\ntogether for the common goal.\n\n442\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.600\nSo don't over think this as you're trying\nto build it, if you build one, great,\n\n443\n00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.980\nif it becomes a nice, elaborate\nrelational database solution, super.\n\n444\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:12.010\nBut it can be quite simple, it can be as\nsimple as a spreadsheet that points to\n\n445\n00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:17.670\nall the relevant artifacts such as your\nrisk register, your security incident log.\n\n446\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:22.950\nYour security process log, your security\nreports, and those types of things, okay?\n\n447\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:27.430\nWe had, for instance, as an example\nof what might come in here, I recall\n\n448\n00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.440\nwe had a special access provisions for\nadministrative accounts.\n\n449\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.890\nSo, if I was an administrative of\na server, I just didn't call and\n\n450\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.000\nget access to the server.\n\n451\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.270\nI had to follow a different\nkind of procedure and\n\n452\n00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.040\nI was under review more often.\n\n453\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.001\nSo once every six months I had to go\nre-certify that I still needed access to\n\n454\n00:23:48.001 --> 00:23:48.882\nthe server.\n\n455\n00:23:48.882 --> 00:23:54.953\nIf I managed people that had access\nto the server, I led that review.\n\n456\n00:23:54.953 --> 00:23:56.970\nSo, lets say Daniel worked for me,\n\n457\n00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.283\nhe was an administrator of one\nof the servers that I owned.\n\n458\n00:24:00.283 --> 00:24:05.590\nIn this system, and Daniel went\non to work from somewhere else.\n\n459\n00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:10.530\nOnce every six months, I had to review\nthe list of who has access, and\n\n460\n00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.100\nI needed to be wise enough to\nknock Daniel off of this list,\n\n461\n00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.540\nbecause he's not supposed to\nhave access to this anymore.\n\n462\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.900\nThat's just good security practice.\n\n463\n00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.230\nDaniel-\n&gt;&gt; It's not personal, it's business.\n\n464\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.671\n&gt;&gt; It's not personal, it's business.\n\n465\n00:24:20.671 --> 00:24:22.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\n\n466\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.970\nhe'd no longer has a need\nto have access to this.\n\n467\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.540\nSo let's remove that access, right?\n\n468\n00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.330\nHe doesn't need to be an administrator of\nthe learning management system anymore,\n\n469\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.270\nhe's moved on to operate other services.\n\n470\n00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.050\n&gt;&gt; You'd be surprised how many people\nI had to explain that concept to.\n\n471\n00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.890\nAnd was like, why am I not a local\nadministrator of my own computer?\n\n472\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.130\nWell, you get the computer from us.\n\n473\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.830\nIt's actually our computer, the company's\ncomputer, and it's not personal,\n\n474\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:46.530\nit's business.\n\n475\n00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.450\nIt keeps you from doing\nsomething that could potentially\n\n476\n00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:51.950\ndamage business continuity.\n\n477\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:56.020\n&gt;&gt; Get a little note of irony there,\nnote of irony.\n\n478\n00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.830\nPeople in IT,\nat the organization I used to work in.\n\n479\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:03.820\nThe people in IT, by default because\nthey worked in IT, got to be what\n\n480\n00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.590\nthey call self managed, which means they\nwere administrators of the local machine,\n\n481\n00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.480\npresumably because IT people know better.\n\n482\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.220\nHow ironic, because IT people\nare also very experimental?\n\n483\n00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:15.753\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes they are.\n\n484\n00:25:15.753 --> 00:25:16.534\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I think I'll try this.\n\n485\n00:25:16.534 --> 00:25:17.564\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What does this do?\n\n486\n00:25:17.564 --> 00:25:20.003\nLet's push that button.\n\n487\n00:25:20.003 --> 00:25:22.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n488\n00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.840\n&gt;&gt; Very curious people, so.\n\n489\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.830\n&gt;&gt; What do they say about the cat?\n\n490\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.825\nCuriosity-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, curiosity killed the cat.\n\n491\n00:25:27.825 --> 00:25:29.410\nThat's right, Very good.\n\n492\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.990\nAgain, just a kinda funny story and\nhonestly it did work pretty effectively.\n\n493\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.930\nWe often found the vulnerabilities because\nIT was figuring out things, right?\n\n494\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.990\nSo it was actually a little humor for\nthe sake of that.\n\n495\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.620\nCritical success factors,\nyou'll see several here listed.\n\n496\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.360\nAgain, I'm not gonna read these all.\n\n497\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.480\nBut understanding what makes security\nmanagement critical and what makes it\n\n498\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.520\neffective, can help you get inside the\nminds of a testmaker sometimes as well.\n\n499\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.870\nAnother good place to come and\npause or fast forward to,\n\n500\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.240\nto reassimilate or assimilate the key\npoints of security management.\n\n501\n00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.990\nI'll go through a couple.\n\n502\n00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.420\nObviously the critical assess factor is\nthat the business is protected against\n\n503\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.590\nsecurity violations.\n\n504\n00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.620\nTheir data is there when\nit's supposed to be.\n\n505\n00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.170\nThe right people get it,\nthe wrong people don't, etc.\n\n506\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.525\nYou don't share with that new employee,\n\n507\n00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:20.300\neveryone's salary information,\nthat kind of thing, right?\n\n508\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.890\nAnd that you have clear,\njust cherry picking here,\n\n509\n00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.300\ngoing at the bottom here,\nyou have clear ownership of policies,\n\n510\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.660\namongst all of the communities\ninvolved in security.\n\n511\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.740\nIn other words,\nyou're not guessing who's responsible for\n\n512\n00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.110\nmaking sure that the HR database is\nsecure, we're gonna let the HR director\n\n513\n00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:41.040\napprove all request for\naccess to the HR data systems, right.\n\n514\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.770\nSo that's ownership.\n\n515\n00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.400\nSo if a new employee calls\na service desk and says,\n\n516\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.480\nI need access to the HR database, because\nI want to review everyone's salaries,\n\n517\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.530\nthe service desk says,\nthat's not how it works.\n\n518\n00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.350\nI may counter, but hey,\nI'm the new compensation analyst,\n\n519\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.060\nI'm supposed to have that.\n\n520\n00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.840\nThe service desk still needs to say,\nI'm sorry, that's not how it works.\n\n521\n00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.220\nThe request needs to come through\nthe HR Director, here's how you do that.\n\n522\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.490\nThat's how the service testing kinda lead\nthe person to the right location, right?\n\n523\n00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.230\nHave that figured out, who is accountable?\n\n524\n00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.070\nIt's not gonna be the access managers.\n\n525\n00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:19.120\nThe access management process is not\ngonna be there to determine who gets it,\n\n526\n00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.870\nthey just know what group to put them in,\nthey manage all the nuts and\n\n527\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.360\nbolts in the back end.\n\n528\n00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.890\nSomeone within the business\nis gonna be responsible for\n\n529\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.820\nallocating those appropriate\nlevels of access.\n\n530\n00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:32.230\nGetting that clear is an important\ncritical success factor, right?\n\n531\n00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.290\nThis is an example of a couple,\nI kind of cherry picked there.\n\n532\n00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.890\nBut definitely a good place to come for\nsome good reviews.\n\n533\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.740\nAll right.\n\n534\n00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.950\nAs with the KPIs,\nkey performance indicators.\n\n535\n00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.970\nKey performance indicators are intended\nto be measurements of your process.\n\n536\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.170\nThese can be effective\nmeasurements of security process.\n\n537\n00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:57.480\nYou have fewer security breaches, whatever\nthat might mean, you have fewer of those.\n\n538\n00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.490\nOr if you do have one,\nthe impact of them is decreased.\n\n539\n00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.780\nHow you go about measuring that means\nyou have to have some pretty effective\n\n540\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.080\nplanning up front to understand\njust what a security breach is?\n\n541\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.650\nDid you get a fine from\nthe federal regulators because you\n\n542\n00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.450\nlet out a bunch of\ncredit card information?\n\n543\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.700\nDid you lose a bunch of customers?\n\n544\n00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.120\nLose business, right?\n\n545\n00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.240\nThat sort of thing.\n\n546\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.960\nSo decrease the number,\ndecrease the duration,\n\n547\n00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.360\ndecrease the impact of security breaches.\n\n548\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.590\nCuz they're gonna happen very likely,\n\n549\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.120\nthere's really some sort of\nbreach here and there, right?\n\n550\n00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.660\nAgain, I'm not gonna\nread these all to you but\n\n551\n00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.700\nunderstanding that KPIs are ways\nto measure effectiveness.\n\n552\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.040\nCan also assess factors why you measure,\nright?\n\n553\n00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.670\nAnd come back here, good place to\nassimilate and reassimilate good\n\n554\n00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.693\ninformation about the process\ncalled information security.\n\n555\n00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:51.320\nChallenges and risks.\n\n556\n00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.970\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n557\n00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.260\nA challenge is a risk that is\n100% chance of happening, right?\n\n558\n00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:04.260\nSo you will face the challenge of adequate\nsupport from the business, right?\n\n559\n00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.485\nThey want it to be secure,\nthey certainly do.\n\n560\n00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:07.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n561\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.280\n&gt;&gt; They may not necessarily want to pay\nfor it, or go through the rigors of it.\n\n562\n00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.220\nYou're gonna teach them that\nthe HR Director needs to approve and\n\n563\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.382\ngo through a very long process to let\nthe new Compensation Analyst get access.\n\n564\n00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:20.220\nYes, we are, that kind of thing.\n\n565\n00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.140\nSo you need to get that kind of\nsupport from the business and\n\n566\n00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.660\nmake sure they are part of\nthe solution of security.\n\n567\n00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n568\n00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.210\n&gt;&gt; That's where most of your\nusers are gonna be anyway.\n\n569\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:35.190\nSo you need to make sure that they\nare adequately involved in the culture and\n\n570\n00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.510\nimplementation of the security, right.\n\n571\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.702\nAgain, not to read all these to you,\nanother great place, this is a place that\n\n572\n00:29:41.702 --> 00:29:47.870\ntest makers like to go to design their\nscenario, and question challenges, right?\n\n573\n00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.570\nSo they'll introduce things where,\n\n574\n00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.840\nPrince says there's adequate\nsupport from the business.\n\n575\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.460\nThey'll have a scenario where the business\nis not concerned about security and yet\n\n576\n00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.450\ncomplains about security loss.\n\n577\n00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:59.510\nOkay, how are you gonna solve that,\nall right?\n\n578\n00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.680\nThat kind of thing.\n\n579\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.680\nReal world,\nI mean it's kind of unrealistic.\n\n580\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.070\nSometimes-\n&gt;&gt; It's crazy we're being factitious and\n\n581\n00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.830\nhaving fun with it, but\nyou'd be surprised.\n\n582\n00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n583\n00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:11.310\n&gt;&gt; Why does my computer\nkeep getting compromised?\n\n584\n00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.860\nWell, here's the problem.\n\n585\n00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.048\nYou keep going to places you shouldn't go.\n\n586\n00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:15.770\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n587\n00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.920\nyou complain because you're the owner of\nthe company that you wanted full access\n\n588\n00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.000\nand full control of your computer so\nwe gave it to you.\n\n589\n00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:21.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n590\n00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.480\nthere you go,\nnow you have the perfect storm.\n\n591\n00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember when we were trying to\nget the acceptable use policies in place.\n\n592\n00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.630\nWhat kind of websites can you visit and\nthose kind of things.\n\n593\n00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.370\nAt first, it was just this long list.\n\n594\n00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.960\nAnd we maintained a list\nof do not go here.\n\n595\n00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow it's the opposite.\n\n596\n00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is a list of places you can't go,\n\n597\n00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.810\ncuz everywhere else is dangerous.\n\n598\n00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n599\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.870\nYou see what I mean?\n\n600\n00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.590\nSo those are tough things to\nget through the business,\n\n601\n00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.960\nto make sure the business accept it.\n\n602\n00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.410\nYou don't want to lock it down so\n\n603\n00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.540\nmuch that they can't-\n&gt;&gt; That they're paralyzed.\n\n604\n00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.250\n&gt;&gt; That they're paralyzed.\n\n605\n00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And there could be\n\n606\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.505\nvery legitimate reason to go off the list.\n\n607\n00:30:53.505 --> 00:30:54.810\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, they're not like they're\n\n608\n00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.480\ngoing to go watch a bunch\nof YouTube channels.\n\n609\n00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And do these kind of things.\n\n610\n00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.860\nThere could be legitimate reasons\nto however, to go to YouTube.\n\n611\n00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:02.348\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nBut they submit that.\n\n612\n00:31:02.348 --> 00:31:03.196\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n613\n00:31:03.196 --> 00:31:06.520\nan exception to the rule because of x,\ny z, factors.\n\n614\n00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.920\nAnd then we,\nas security professionals, go okay.\n\n615\n00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.340\nWell let's take that into account.\n\n616\n00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.360\nIs that worth the risk?\n\n617\n00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.710\nWe do our risk matrices,\nand okay, that is worth it.\n\n618\n00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.980\nWe're gonna make more\nmoney than we'll lose.\n\n619\n00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.730\nOr it's not that big of an exposure.\n\n620\n00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:20.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then you allow\n\n621\n00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.140\nthe exception or you don't.\n\n622\n00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right, good point.\n\n623\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:24.730\nYep, very good.\n\n624\n00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.650\nSo again, coming here to challenges and\n\n625\n00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:31.510\nrisks is a great place to review,\nassimilate, and re-assimilate just what\n\n626\n00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.970\nmight be in the minds of a test maker as\nthey approach these questions of security.\n\n627\n00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.770\nNow, roles and responsibilities.\n\n628\n00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.780\nAs we've talked about the other processes,\nhaving an owner is gonna be important.\n\n629\n00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.360\nBut process manager on a day to\nday basis are obviously critical.\n\n630\n00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.490\nOn the ground, managing the day to day\nimplementation of security management, and\n\n631\n00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.800\npolicy, making sure\npolicy's being followed.\n\n632\n00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.160\nAuditing, vulnerability testing,\npenetration testing, ongoing day to day.\n\n633\n00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.890\nIt's not a static environment,\nyou gotta test it all the time, right.\n\n634\n00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.890\nSo be there to participate\nin business impact analysis.\n\n635\n00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.130\nPerform that security risk analysis and\n\n636\n00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.210\nmake sure you understand\nyour vulnerabilities and\n\n637\n00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.520\naddress them appropriately in\na balanced way, cost effective way.\n\n638\n00:32:12.355 --> 00:32:16.595\nAs monitoring and managing,\nact as a focal point, make sure you're,\n\n639\n00:32:16.595 --> 00:32:21.955\ngot the buzz words again confidentiality,\nintegrity available are maintained.\n\n640\n00:32:21.955 --> 00:32:25.455\nAnother good place to come and\nreview and assimilate\n\n641\n00:32:25.455 --> 00:32:29.843\nin a holistic way just what information\nsecurity management is about, right?\n\n642\n00:32:29.843 --> 00:32:32.406\nNow, further,\n\n643\n00:32:32.406 --> 00:32:36.190\nthe way some exercise thing see what you\ncan come up with some security measures.\n\n644\n00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.230\nYou got preventive maintenance, detection,\n\n645\n00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:42.880\nrepression, corrective recovery, walk\nthrough this and come back to the forum,\n\n646\n00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.320\nthe forums we have here at ITProTV and\nbring your good questions there.\n\n647\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.210\nThere's also some one or\n\n648\n00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.660\ntwo questions are gonna be on\nyour practice exams, maybe three.\n\n649\n00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.870\nSo go to your practice exams and see how\ntest makers tease out these concepts.\n\n650\n00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.140\nIn my opinion, security management\nis probably one of the more\n\n651\n00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.110\nintuitive processes because\nwe kind of live and\n\n652\n00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:10.770\nbreathe it as practicers of IT\nmanagement or users of IT systems.\n\n653\n00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.650\nBut don't let my assumption\nkeep you in the dark.\n\n654\n00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.240\nFollow through with some good study on\nyour own and reinforce these ideas.\n\n655\n00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.298\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n656\n00:33:19.298 --> 00:33:21.280\n[INAUDIBLE] security management.\n\n657\n00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.320\nLike you said,\nit's kind of an intuitive process.\n\n658\n00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:29.340\nWe as a race of people actually, are\nfocusing on security, keeping things safe.\n\n659\n00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.560\nWe have to survive, right,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n660\n00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.690\nAnd this just kinds molds right into\nthat when it comes to figuring out\n\n661\n00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:39.570\nthe environment of IT and then okay,\nnow how do I keep that Safe for my users,\n\n662\n00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.900\nmy company and myself.\n\n663\n00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.250\nAnd that's all this is talking about.\n\n664\n00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.660\nIf you understand those concepts,\n\n665\n00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.260\nyou're gonna do just fine on\nthis portion of the exam.\n\n666\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.840\nAnd of course, all of Terry's advice and\ngood recommendations.\n\n667\n00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.680\nThat being said, looks like we've come\nto the end of yet another great episode.\n\n668\n00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.130\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it and\ngot a lot out of it.\n\n669\n00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.830\nBut signing off for ITProTV I've\nbeen your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n670\n00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:00.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm Terry Decker.\n\n671\n00:34:00.690 -->

00:00:11.577\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:13.677\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.677 --> 00:00:16.409\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.022\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:19.654\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:23.630\nwell we are continuing on with\nmore of our Itel PPO series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.450\nAnd joining us in the studio again,\nour good friend Terry Decker.\n\n10\n00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.690\nTerry, glad to have you again.\n\n11\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.240\nHow is it going?\n\n12\n00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.790\n&gt;&gt; Good to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.680\nIt is going great.\n\n14\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.500\nYeah, we 've got a couple more topics\nbefore we finish up this PPO course.\n\n15\n00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.520\nPlanning, Protection and Optimization.\n\n16\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.070\nOne of those is Demand Management,\nwhich we're gonna start on right now.\n\n17\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.479\nWe've mentioned Demand Management\nin earlier episode called\n\n18\n00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.040\nCapacity Management, and\nthey're closely related.\n\n19\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.950\nWanna kind of invite you to see if\nyou can think up this a little bit.\n\n20\n00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.010\nWhat might be the difference between\ndemand management and capacity management?\n\n21\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.080\nAny ideas?\n\n22\n00:00:56.576 --> 00:01:00.017\n&gt;&gt; That's a good question,\nI mean demand, I don't know.\n\n23\n00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:02.175\n&gt;&gt; Well, maybe here's a hint.\n\n24\n00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:05.853\nDemand management happens in\nan earlier life cycle stage,\n\n25\n00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:11.940\nit comes before capacity\nmanagement Still blank.\n\n26\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.696\nStill just totally fine?\n&gt;&gt; No, no good on this one.\n\n27\n00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:18.258\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, demand management\nthat intends to be predictive, right?\n\n28\n00:01:18.258 --> 00:01:22.401\nIt tries to predict what the demand's\ngonna be, and once you understand,\n\n29\n00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.230\nperhaps, what that demand\nis more methodically,\n\n30\n00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.883\nyou have a better idea of what\ncapacity you need to build, right?\n\n31\n00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:32.245\nSo understanding that\nthe demand could be coming,\n\n32\n00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:36.010\ninforms your capacity\nmanagement discipline, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.054\nKnowing that the demand is gonna come,\nyou'll build the appropriate capacity.\n\n34\n00:01:39.054 --> 00:01:45.570\nSo demand management happens in service\nstrategies in early stage activity.\n\n35\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510\nAnd actually,\ndemand management could discern,\n\n36\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.200\nwell you know what,\nthere's not gonna be enough demand here.\n\n37\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.080\nIt's not worth building that service.\n\n38\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.040\nOr they might find that this is gonna\nbe a lot bigger than we thought, right?\n\n39\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.910\nSo they're trying to be predictive\nwith this whole nature of\n\n40\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.880\nwhat capacity might we need later.\n\n41\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.950\nSo they come up with a process\nearlier in the life cycle stage\n\n42\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.790\ncalled demand management.\n\n43\n00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.320\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at.\n\n44\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.990\nIf you take a look at the slides here,\nthen you'll see that the scope of\n\n45\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.470\ndemand management is to identify and\nanalyze patterns of business activity.\n\n46\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.820\nLike PBA, we saw that a little\nearlier in Capacity Management.\n\n47\n00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.190\nPatterns of Business Activity,\nthis refers to when do people use it and\n\n48\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.720\nhow intensely they use it across time,\nright.\n\n49\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.059\nMonth end reporting, weekly analysis,\n\n50\n00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.310\nyear-end performance reports,\nthose types of things.\n\n51\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.520\nAnother acronym here,\nidentify user profiles, right.\n\n52\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.130\nSo this is breaking down\nusage by types of people.\n\n53\n00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.139\nMaybe the executives use it heavily,\n\n54\n00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.142\nmaybe the manufacturing team\nuses it lightly, or vice versa.\n\n55\n00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:53.960\nSo understanding,\nwhich type of users are doing what,\n\n56\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.250\nis kind of a sub set of\npatterns of business activity.\n\n57\n00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.815\nSo you got,\nthe super set of what the business does,\n\n58\n00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.011\nthe cycle of their activities.\n\n59\n00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:05.124\nAnd then you get down into the weeds and\n\n60\n00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:08.452\nfind out what people do to take\nin different types, right.\n\n61\n00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:13.090\nSo, demand management is going\nto then drive the overall\n\n62\n00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.530\nunderstanding of what we can\nanticipate in demand of a service.\n\n63\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.790\nAnd of course, that informs capacity\nmanagement process quite a lot, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.920\nSo you see these again.\n\n65\n00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.970\nIdentify and analyse, and\ninfluence customer demand.\n\n66\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.578\nI cited an example on the capacity\nmanagement episode where we had\n\n67\n00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:36.691\nsalespeople coming in every other Friday.\n\n68\n00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:40.784\nWhich happened to be a day that\nthe manufacturing team was heavily hitting\n\n69\n00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:42.580\na particular service.\n\n70\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.860\nAnd, every other Friday,\nwith both of those things happening,\n\n71\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.380\nour system suffered,\nperformance went way down.\n\n72\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.503\nAnd, it took us awhile to figure that out,\nhonestly, we didn't just discover that.\n\n73\n00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:54.395\nBut, demand management would\ntry to predict that and\n\n74\n00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:58.660\nactually ask enough questions,\ninterrogate the business enough.\n\n75\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.830\nThat they would understand that there's\ngonna be a potential every other Friday,\n\n76\n00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.330\nthere's gonna be very heavy hitting.\n\n77\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.200\nAnd therefore, influence customer demand.\n\n78\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.132\nIn other words,\n\n79\n00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:13.300\nask the customer maybe to change\ntheir behaviors a little bit, right?\n\n80\n00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.834\nYou can also influence customers'\ndemands through charging more, right?\n\n81\n00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:22.640\nIs a classic example for internet service\nproviders, to charge you a premium for\n\n82\n00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.570\nmore.\n\n83\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.520\nThey're a way of kinda influencing\nyour demand, in many ways.\n\n84\n00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.080\nIf you're concern about how slow it is,\n\n85\n00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.150\nwhen everyone in your family is watching\na different movie in a different room.\n\n86\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.000\nBecause if you're Internet bandwidth,\nspeeds, then you might call them up and\n\n87\n00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.770\nsay, I need some more.\n\n88\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.070\nAnd say, well we got some more for\nyou, right?\n\n89\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.309\nAnd a way to influence demand there,\nis to make customers pay for it.\n\n90\n00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:47.269\nAnother example of influencing demand,\n\n91\n00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:51.420\nis that we had a lot of people\nasking a particular service.\n\n92\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.490\nI mentioned this one earlier too, for\n\n93\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.060\nconverting PowerPoint\npresentations to eLearning.\n\n94\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.690\nAt first, we just kind of opened\nthe flood gates, and says, yeah, yeah,\n\n95\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.300\nwe'll do that for you,\njust send us what you got.\n\n96\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.640\nAnd they sent us everything, right?\n\n97\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.369\nThey didn't do any triage, whatsoever.\n\n98\n00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.473\nSo then we kind of influenced their demand\na little bit by saying, you know what,\n\n99\n00:05:11.473 --> 00:05:14.560\nwe're gonna start charging\na hundred dollars per conversion.\n\n100\n00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.770\nAnd then, the business said,\nokay, well, let me look,\n\n101\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.720\nI'm not gonna send you 500, right?\n\n102\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.130\n&gt;&gt; All of a sudden, yeah, things get\na little more nuanced [INAUDIBLE]\n\n103\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah ,exactly.\n\n104\n00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:22.360\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that's not as\nimportant as hoped it was\n\n105\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n106\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.240\nWe never supposed to have that.\n\n107\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.035\nSo they had some skin in the game.\n\n108\n00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:26.376\nSome financial skin in the game so,\n\n109\n00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.355\nwhen that was away we kind\nof influenced demand too.\n\n110\n00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:32.960\nSo, this demand management thing can\nbe nuanced in that way as well, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.225\nAs we look, the business value is\nyou're trying to predict, right?\n\n112\n00:05:37.225 --> 00:05:41.719\nSo you're trying to achieve a balance\nbetween what you're going to build and\n\n113\n00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.970\nwhat you're gonna deliver, right?\n\n114\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.670\nMaking sure you have\nthe right balance there.\n\n115\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.630\nAsking these questions earlier,\nITIL suggest, gives you a better sense for\n\n116\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.050\nhow you can effectively plan for\ncapacity later on, right.\n\n117\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.331\nAnd again, it also gives you\nthe ability to influence demand, okay?\n\n118\n00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:06.886\nUnderserved, I sometimes read this\nas undeserved, but it's underserved.\n\n119\n00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:11.290\nUnderserved demand is a source of risk,\nright?\n\n120\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.610\nThat means you have a lot more\ndemands you're able to satisfy, right?\n\n121\n00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.105\nYou don't have enough resources,\nyou don't have enough servers,\n\n122\n00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:20.829\nyou don't have enough people,\nyou don't have enough headsets, right?\n\n123\n00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:23.841\nYou don't have enough phones,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n124\n00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:27.650\nunderserved demand as a source of risk,\nnot having that available.\n\n125\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.290\nSo, excess capacity on the other hand\ngenerates costs with no value, right?\n\n126\n00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.250\nYou over built it.\n\n127\n00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.180\nYou got, 120,000 headsets on a shelf and\nno one's using.\n\n128\n00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.982\nThat's sort of thing, right?\n\n129\n00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:45.130\nSo excess capacity, generates cost.\n\n130\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.150\nSo trying to find that balance is what\ndemand management is trying to figure out.\n\n131\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.080\n&gt;&gt; It's like buying a helicopter\nto fly a hundred yards.\n\n132\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.890\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n133\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.792\n&gt;&gt; It's completely more than unique.\n\n134\n00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.550\n&gt;&gt; Way over kill,\ngood example, way over kill.\n\n135\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.550\nSo you're only trying to get\nthis nice little balance here.\n\n136\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.340\nAs you can see on this\ngraphic in particular,\n\n137\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.590\ndon't get lost too much in this.\n\n138\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.290\nBut as price goes up, right, quantity,\ngetting the right supply mix,\n\n139\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.850\nand you're trying to find\nthat nice little sweet spot.\n\n140\n00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.560\nSo you're not providing too much,\nyou are not spending too much.\n\n141\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.420\nIt's really all it amounts to.\n\n142\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.721\nThis is just a graphical representation\nof that very same concept, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:28.832\nNow, this is a very interesting\ngraphic in lot a ways.\n\n144\n00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:29.942\nThis seems like,\n\n145\n00:07:29.942 --> 00:07:34.905\nalmost like a self fulfilling statement\nlike a snake swallowing it's on tail.\n\n146\n00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:38.809\nIt's bit more nuance than that.\n\n147\n00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:44.290\nAs usage increases, demand increases.\n\n148\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.270\nAgain, doesn't that sound just\nlike a self fulfilling prophecy?\n\n149\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.390\nBut let me add some nuance.\n\n150\n00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.040\nIt's actually more of an engine.\n\n151\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.820\nIn other words, as it's used,\nit's going to be used more.\n\n152\n00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.810\nThat's really what I'm trying to get at.\n\n153\n00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.799\n&gt;&gt; It's a perpetual motion engine.\n\n154\n00:07:57.799 --> 00:07:59.860\n&gt;&gt; Almost, it's just spinning.\n\n155\n00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.544\nIt's almost like an engine.\n\n156\n00:08:01.544 --> 00:08:03.559\nSo I'll give you a couple examples.\n\n157\n00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:12.902\nAnd it's been proven.\n\n158\n00:08:12.902 --> 00:08:19.030\nAs I used that service amazon.com,\nI thought, that service is good.\n\n159\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.800\nI said, you know what,\nI can go to Amazon.com.\n\n160\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.120\nI can do that, right?\n\n161\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.130\nI tell my friends about it, right?\n\n162\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.930\nYeah, I can do that.\n\n163\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:32.860\nSo as I used it I found more use for\nit so I came back to it again, right?\n\n164\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:38.450\nThat's the nature of this kind of\nengine is that in the dynamic of usage,\n\n165\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.240\ndemand can increase.\n\n166\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.470\nSo, it's not quite like a snake\nswallowing its own tail,\n\n167\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.620\nit's more like Daniel said like\na propelled engine, right.\n\n168\n00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.140\nNot self propelled-\n&gt;&gt; Perpetual motion.\n\n169\n00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Perpetual motion.\n\n170\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.077\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for the clarification.\n\n171\n00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:53.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n172\n00:08:53.852 --> 00:08:57.700\n&gt;&gt; But at any rate it is,\nit kinda just exponentially grows.\n\n173\n00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.183\nSo demand management is\ntrying to anticipate that,\n\n174\n00:09:01.183 --> 00:09:03.010\nwhat might this look like?\n\n175\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.160\nMaybe one a little bit closer to my own\nexperience was again in this learning\n\n176\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.060\nmanagement system.\n\n177\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.566\nAs people use the learning management\nservice in the system they began to find\n\n178\n00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:14.980\nmore value in that and\ncame back to it more often.\n\n179\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.360\nRight, so it started off kinda slow.\n\n180\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.190\nNo one just rushed to it, but\n\n181\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.690\nas they begin to use it they had more\nreasons to come back to it, right?\n\n182\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.780\nThat's what I'm talking about, okay.\n\n183\n00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.600\nSo, again, we'll see this little\ngraphic here quite often.\n\n184\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.820\nThe matching of demand and\ncapacity requires study.\n\n185\n00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.080\nWhat are they up to?\n\n186\n00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.320\nLooking at the customers, patterns of\nbusiness activity, asking them questions.\n\n187\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.682\nNow, that could be very challenging.\n\n188\n00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:43.882\nThe same example I mentioned earlier where\nthe manufacturing group was doing their\n\n189\n00:09:43.882 --> 00:09:45.084\nqueries every Friday.\n\n190\n00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:49.056\nAnd the sales teams were\ncoming every other Friday and\n\n191\n00:09:49.056 --> 00:09:52.239\nheavily hitting the system for training.\n\n192\n00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:56.620\nEven if we had a mature demand management\nprocess, and I'll admit that we didn't.\n\n193\n00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.468\nBut even if we did probably getting\nthat kind of intelligence early,\n\n194\n00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:04.234\nwould have probably been really hard.\n\n195\n00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:07.364\nAsking the right kind of questions\nto the right number of people.\n\n196\n00:10:07.364 --> 00:10:11.684\nWe might not ever have gotten those data\npoints to put the two together to say.\n\n197\n00:10:11.684 --> 00:10:14.512\nHm these things all happen on Friday,\nright?\n\n198\n00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:16.703\nSo I appreciate the challenge of this.\n\n199\n00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:19.065\nIt's not necessarily a walk in the park,\nbut\n\n200\n00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:23.060\ndemand management as Itel would put it,\non the perfect little Itel island.\n\n201\n00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.558\nWould be a very good way to predict\nthese demand constraints and\n\n202\n00:10:28.558 --> 00:10:34.484\ndiscern their patterns of business\nactivity ahead of time, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:34.484 --> 00:10:39.100\nSo, it all comes around to gearing,\nhow you wanna get this engine just right.\n\n204\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.490\nSo gearing your service assets, remember\nassets are resources and capabilities.\n\n205\n00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.672\nSo it's people, it's servers,\nit's the number of headsets\n\n206\n00:10:47.672 --> 00:10:50.926\nyou have on your shelf ready to pass out,\nt hose types of things.\n\n207\n00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:54.537\nSo understanding the patterns of\nbusiness activity, quantifying those.\n\n208\n00:10:54.537 --> 00:10:57.084\nAnd getting the right\nbalance as you go through, so\n\n209\n00:10:57.084 --> 00:11:00.050\nyou should appropriately\ngear the service assets.\n\n210\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.680\nThis gearing will likely happen\nin capacity management, right.\n\n211\n00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.377\nDemand management is grabbing the data so\n\n212\n00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:10.698\nthe capacity management\ncan make wise decisions.\n\n213\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.392\nNow while it's born,\ndemand management is born and\n\n214\n00:11:17.392 --> 00:11:23.412\nservice strategy is intended to be\nan early indicator of predictive nature.\n\n215\n00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:25.381\nIt also needs to follow through.\n\n216\n00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:28.474\nRight, if they predicted 10000 users and\n\n217\n00:11:28.474 --> 00:11:33.512\nyou built a service to accommodate\n10000 users and only 200 show up.\n\n218\n00:11:33.512 --> 00:11:36.622\nHm, you've got some lessons to\nlearn in demand management, right?\n\n219\n00:11:36.622 --> 00:11:38.533\nOr vice versa, right?\n\n220\n00:11:38.533 --> 00:11:40.350\n&gt;&gt; You missed the boat somewhere.\n\n221\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.233\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you missed the boat somewhere.\n\n222\n00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:45.052\nSo, basically what you're trying to do\nin demand management is understand your\n\n223\n00:11:45.052 --> 00:11:46.072\npredictive nature.\n\n224\n00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:49.140\nAnd that's really important about what\ndemand management's trying to do.\n\n225\n00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.790\nBut you're following through to\nsee how good you are, right?\n\n226\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.993\nYou're making sure the capacity plans\ntend to meet those demand predictions.\n\n227\n00:11:56.993 --> 00:12:00.359\nYou look through transition and\nsee that testing and\n\n228\n00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:04.276\nvalidation is going on to again\nvalidate your predictions.\n\n229\n00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:07.456\nAnd of course service operations it's\nwhere it's really gonna be validated.\n\n230\n00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:11.900\nYou're also trying to predict how this\nperpetual motion engine is working too.\n\n231\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.116\nSo going into service operations you\nanticipate some slow adoption but\n\n232\n00:12:16.116 --> 00:12:17.740\nyou anticipate it to grow.\n\n233\n00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.937\nSo it's a way to do some checks and\n\n234\n00:12:19.937 --> 00:12:23.480\nbalances of how healthy\nyour demand forecasting is.\n\n235\n00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.451\nAnd, of course, if you discern that\nthere are opportunities for improvement.\n\n236\n00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:31.923\nWhere you really missed the boat widely or\nmissed the target widely or just narrowly,\n\n237\n00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:34.320\nyou're gonna have some lessons learned.\n\n238\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.900\nPerhaps that rolls back into some\ncontinual service improvement\n\n239\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.830\nopportunities.\n\n240\n00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.560\nSo as you again improve your demand\nmanagement process in a nice little cycle.\n\n241\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.280\nSo how could you forecast demands, right?\n\n242\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.690\nBusiness plans, we already talked\nabout patterns in business activities.\n\n243\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.013\nThose things are kind of predictive.\n\n244\n00:12:53.013 --> 00:12:57.304\nBut if you also know the business\nis going to be adding 3,000\n\n245\n00:12:57.304 --> 00:12:59.459\nnew manufacturing employees.\n\n246\n00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:04.430\nOr the sales team is gonna be laying\noff 3000 sales members, right?\n\n247\n00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.440\nUnderstanding what the business\nplans are could also\n\n248\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.570\naffect your forecasting as well.\n\n249\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.390\nMarketing plans,\nyou plan to sell more widgets.\n\n250\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:17.460\nYou plan to sell more of this or\nbring more people in, right?\n\n251\n00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.740\nSo marketing plans can play into it.\n\n252\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.600\nProduction, sales forecasts, etc., okay?\n\n253\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.190\nUnderstanding what the business is up\nto could also influence your demand\n\n254\n00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.410\nforecasting, so interrogate those.\n\n255\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.270\nYou also need to look,\nremember customer assets.\n\n256\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.950\nWe've talked about\nthe two types of assets.\n\n257\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.850\nYou've got service assets,\nthose within the IT service provider.\n\n258\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.162\nYou have customer assets,\nthose in the business.\n\n259\n00:13:41.162 --> 00:13:44.284\nWhile you're not necessarily in\ncontrol of those customer assets.\n\n260\n00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:46.757\nYou need to know what they're doing and\nwhat they're trying to get done.\n\n261\n00:13:46.757 --> 00:13:49.940\nSo that's just connecting\nthe dots to this idea.\n\n262\n00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.371\nThat understanding what\ncustomers are intending to do or\n\n263\n00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:56.220\ntrying to do is gonna be important.\n\n264\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.720\nAs an example,\nI mentioned it in earlier episodes, you\n\n265\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.290\ndon't have to be a geophysicist to work\nin the IT department of an oil company.\n\n266\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:05.810\n&gt;&gt; Let's hope not.\n\n267\n00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly right.\n\n268\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.480\nSo their assets are doing what they do.\n\n269\n00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.800\nThey are finding the oil,\nthey're getting it out of the ground and\n\n270\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800\nthey're distributing it right?\n\n271\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.370\nFor an IT service provider, they need\nto help them do that, and do that well.\n\n272\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.585\nSo if you intend to introduce some\nnew technology that's promising to\n\n273\n00:14:23.585 --> 00:14:27.900\nfind oil faster or more safely or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n274\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.190\nAnd it's been proven.\n\n275\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.740\nThere's some benchmark testing\non this new IT technology,\n\n276\n00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.530\nit's really gonna help them.\n\n277\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.320\nIt's fine that IT gets it but\nyour customers need to get it too.\n\n278\n00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.405\nSo as you launch this new service\nthat's using this new technology.\n\n279\n00:14:42.405 --> 00:14:46.125\nYou might find an audience lacking\nin the appropriate skills or\n\n280\n00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:49.297\nthe appropriate motivation\nto use a new technology.\n\n281\n00:14:49.297 --> 00:14:53.040\nSo you also need to be aware\nabout all those thing too, okay.\n\n282\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.598\nAgain so you can discern the pattern\nof business activity, a ll right.\n\n283\n00:14:58.887 --> 00:15:03.191\nThe context of the patterns of\nbusiness activity are actually on\n\n284\n00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:05.590\nthe ground with the user profiles.\n\n285\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.250\nWhat are different users using?\n\n286\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.470\nSo again,\nusing the oil company as an example,\n\n287\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.390\noil companies want to do three things,\nbasically.\n\n288\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.710\nThey want to find it,\nthey wanna get it out of the ground, and\n\n289\n00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.950\nthey wanna move it, distribute it, right?\n\n290\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.680\nWhat IT services can you bring\nthat helps them do that, and\n\n291\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.630\nwho is getting that done?\n\n292\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.990\nThat's when you start\ngetting on the ground.\n\n293\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.930\nWell, what do the geophysicists need,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.740\nWhat does the marketing team need?\n\n295\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.610\nWhat does the supply chain manager need,\nright?\n\n296\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.990\nTo make sure you got the right\nthings at the right time.\n\n297\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.540\nWhat does your logistics planner need,\nright?\n\n298\n00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.426\nTo make sure you can\ndistribute it properly.\n\n299\n00:15:38.426 --> 00:15:42.815\nSo you've got these different users\nthat are executing things and\n\n300\n00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:44.941\nbusinesses trying to get done.\n\n301\n00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:47.100\nAnd you're getting down\ninto the weeds now.\n\n302\n00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.613\nSo patterns of business activity,\nfind it, extract it, move it.\n\n303\n00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:54.214\nAt what times of year are you doing this?\n\n304\n00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:55.595\nAre there heavy activities?\n\n305\n00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:58.156\nThursday and Friday,\nis that when everyone is really busy?\n\n306\n00:15:58.156 --> 00:16:01.879\nIs it at the end of the month\nwhen it's really busy?\n\n307\n00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:06.571\nOil has found that you're gonna have\nto kick-start the ideas of getting out\n\n308\n00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:10.542\nthe ground, or the activities\nto get it out the ground, right?\n\n309\n00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:13.581\nSo understanding those patterns and\nhow they interrelate with each other,\n\n310\n00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:16.253\ngets down into the weeds and says so\nwhat our geophysicists doing?\n\n311\n00:16:16.253 --> 00:16:18.631\nWhat are our logistics planners doing?\n\n312\n00:16:18.631 --> 00:16:23.065\nWhat are our manufacturing teams doing and\n\n313\n00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:28.750\nequipment folks doing,\nthose kind of things, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:30.230\nAgain getting into the details here,\n\n315\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.833\nI don't want you to get lost in\nthem please don't get lost in them.\n\n316\n00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:38.188\nIt's not serving us academically\nto get real lost in these details.\n\n317\n00:16:38.188 --> 00:16:40.050\nIn other words, to prepare for the test.\n\n318\n00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:44.270\nIt's also not gonna server your\ndirect needs back at the office.\n\n319\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.510\nBecause your really gonna have to\nfocus on your particular scenarios and\n\n320\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.140\nyour particular users.\n\n321\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:56.110\nBut this is an example of how\nuser profiles can be mapped to,\n\n322\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.340\nin a methodical way, to a particular code.\n\n323\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.101\nYou see here, you got the senior execs,\nlet me get my laser pointer going here.\n\n324\n00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:07.625\n[COUGH] We just described\nthe senior executive and\n\n325\n00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.497\nwe give it a name, User Profile 1.\n\n326\n00:17:09.497 --> 00:17:11.064\nAnd how is he using it?\n\n327\n00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:14.200\nIn this case, extensive travel,\nhigh technical assistance.\n\n328\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.320\nIn other words,\nhe is gonna need some help along the way.\n\n329\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.750\nHe is not a self-starting user,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n330\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.880\nSo what does that mean in terms of\ndemand management on the service desk\n\n331\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.006\nperhaps, right?\n\n332\n00:17:24.006 --> 00:17:29.910\nWhat is it mean on demand of\nyour services themselves?\n\n333\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.880\nSo you can see that you end up\njust kind of track this down.\n\n334\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.710\nSo PBA code 9D means that remote\nsize customer interaction.\n\n335\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.880\nSo we need to have someone there\nto help them, executive support.\n\n336\n00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.590\nWhat level of activity?\n\n337\n00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.300\nA high level of activity, right.\n\n338\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:52.110\nAgain, it's just trying to map user\nprofiles in a methodical way to\n\n339\n00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.420\ntheir associated levels of activity and\ndemand, right.\n\n340\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.880\nAgain don't get lost in the details.\n\n341\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.790\nHigh level test takers and even\noperationally minded folks understand that\n\n342\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:09.060\nyou need to consider user profiles\nas that necessary level of detail,\n\n343\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.140\nbreaking down the business activities\nby user type, if you will.\n\n344\n00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.740\nUser profile is an important aspect.\n\n345\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.430\nThat level of understanding will\nserve you well on the exam.\n\n346\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.670\nAnd this level of detail will serve\nyou well in demand management\n\n347\n00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:23.330\nback at the office.\n\n348\n00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.100\nAll right.\n\n349\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.630\nSo this idea of Activity based Demand,\nall right?\n\n350\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.975\nWhat is the business doing?\n\n351\n00:18:32.975 --> 00:18:34.313\nIs really what it points to.\n\n352\n00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:37.730\nThe business plans are in\nthe driver's seat.\n\n353\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.180\nWhat are they up to?\n\n354\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.250\nAgain, keeping with this oil company.\n\n355\n00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.120\nIf you have a goal to discover oil,\nget it out of\n\n356\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.080\nthe ground and distribute it,\nnotice the chain of events there.\n\n357\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.910\nYou gotta find it before you\ncan get it out of the ground.\n\n358\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.440\nYou gotta get it out of the ground\nbefore you can distribute it.\n\n359\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.150\nSo if the business has plans\nto go find a bunch, right?\n\n360\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.270\nThat's gonna drive the other\nones eventually, right?\n\n361\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.710\nSo there's some sequence\nof events that happens.\n\n362\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.890\nSo understanding how each of those are\ndriving each other is part of it, right?\n\n363\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.010\nSo business processes are driving demand.\n\n364\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.098\nIf you find a bunch of oil,\nnow it's time to extract a bunch of oil,\n\n365\n00:19:19.098 --> 00:19:21.740\nthat's the way you put it, right?\n\n366\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.030\nYou may slow down on\nthe discovery of it and\n\n367\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.190\nget worried about getting\nit out of the ground.\n\n368\n00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.900\nYou work those wells,\nyou'll get to discovery another day.\n\n369\n00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.200\nSo business has plans for\nwhen they're gonna do that,\n\n370\n00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.380\nwhen they reach a certain level\nof production for some oil field.\n\n371\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.242\nI'm totally making this\nup by the way I'm not,\n\n372\n00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:40.172\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:19:40.172 --> 00:19:41.605\n&gt;&gt; Really as an example, but\n\n374\n00:19:41.605 --> 00:19:45.384\nif they find oil and they working\nthe fields for a while, somewhere in\n\n375\n00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:49.448\nthe business strategy is, okay now\nit's time to go find others, right?\n\n376\n00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:52.572\nMaybe they are doing\nsimultaneously sometimes,\n\n377\n00:19:52.572 --> 00:19:57.255\nmaybe they pause one activity while\nthe other one is going The lesson here is\n\n378\n00:19:57.255 --> 00:20:01.765\nbusiness is making those decisions\ntherefore affecting your demand.\n\n379\n00:20:01.765 --> 00:20:05.727\nKnow what the business is doing,\nthat's really all this is trying to say.\n\n380\n00:20:05.727 --> 00:20:10.451\nBe in their offices understanding\nwhat they are trying to get done and\n\n381\n00:20:10.451 --> 00:20:14.530\nyou can more effectively plan for\nthe anticipated demand.\n\n382\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.940\nThat's really all this is trying say,\nwhat is daisy chain is about.\n\n383\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.994\nAnd ultimately those things laid\ndown to what IT is doing for them.\n\n384\n00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:24.380\nDo you need more service desk staff?\n\n385\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.160\nDo we need to have elastic\ndemand management so\n\n386\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.200\nthat we can roll up some capacity, right?\n\n387\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.370\nDispatching trucks,\n\n388\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.780\ndispatching pipes, whatever it might be\nwe have to do to move the stuff around.\n\n389\n00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.220\nIT could be involved.\n\n390\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.300\nOkay.\nAll right.\n\n391\n00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.060\nSo activity-based demand management.\n\n392\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.030\nAgain looking at from a chart here.\n\n393\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.432\nWhat is the business trying to do?\n\n394\n00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:55.080\nThey're generating demand, right?\n\n395\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.280\nHow many people do they have?\n\n396\n00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.710\nAre they hiring more people in\nthe discovery department, right?\n\n397\n00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.460\nAre they hiring more people in\nthe distribution department or\n\n398\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.660\nextraction department, that sort of thing.\n\n399\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.780\nYou've got these different business units,\nwhat are they doing?\n\n400\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.310\nAre they moving, are they growing,\nare they shrinking?\n\n401\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.806\nAll that is in play here.\n\n402\n00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:16.940\nActivity-based demand management, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.550\nNow, this idea of developing\ndifferentiated offerings,\n\n404\n00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.090\nI kind of alluded to it earlier.\n\n405\n00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.940\nDifferentiating your offerings is\na way to influence demand, and\n\n406\n00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:35.200\nto perhaps manage your throughput,\nincluding profit for that matter.\n\n407\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.050\nClassic example I've mentioned before,\nyour ISP.\n\n408\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.630\nThey offer tiers,\nhow much bandwidth do you want?\n\n409\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.150\nWhat kind of speed are you looking for?\n\n410\n00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.070\nThere's business packages\nversus residential packages,\n\n411\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.330\nthose type of things.\n\n412\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.347\nSo differentiated offerings, staying with\n\n413\n00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:57.370\na consumer-type products, like cable TV.\n\n414\n00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.513\nYou can get packages,\ndifferentiated offerings there,\n\n415\n00:22:01.513 --> 00:22:06.344\nsome of high definition markets or\ndo you get the premium channels?\n\n416\n00:22:06.344 --> 00:22:07.963\nYou're influencing demand, but\n\n417\n00:22:07.963 --> 00:22:10.930\nyou're also controlling the profit\nstreams as well, right?\n\n418\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.770\nManaging the cost and\nthe profits as you go through there.\n\n419\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.010\nSo, differentiated offerings is\nalso part of demand Management.\n\n420\n00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.821\nMust you have the same size pipe for\nall types of situations?\n\n421\n00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:25.830\nIs really what demand management is\nreally trying to understand here.\n\n422\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.220\nAnd if you do need a bigger pipe,\nare you gonna be charging for\n\n423\n00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.460\nthat pipe as it's used.\n\n424\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.440\nThat sort of thing, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.400\nThat's very closely related\nservice packages, right?\n\n426\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.120\nDifferentiated offerings can end up\nbeing different service packages.\n\n427\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.587\nSo, l get the core service but\nl want a little bit more, or\n\n428\n00:22:41.587 --> 00:22:45.090\nmaybe l wanna do bundles,\nso l get a reduced rate.\n\n429\n00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.370\nRight, those type of things.\n\n430\n00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.170\nService packages are also\nway to influence demand and\n\n431\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.978\nincrease usage or\ndecrease usage if you need, okay?\n\n432\n00:22:53.978 --> 00:22:54.970\nAll right.\n\n433\n00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.765\nSo now it's an operations.\n\n434\n00:22:57.765 --> 00:23:01.590\nYou actually are in operations using this.\n\n435\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.980\nSo during the operations, demand\nmanagement makes sure that the demand\n\n436\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.260\nis appropriately serviced,\nthat's for sure.\n\n437\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.740\nAnd if not, how can you influence it.\n\n438\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.050\nAs in the example I mentioned before\nwith the e-learning conversion.\n\n439\n00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.030\nWe offered it for free,\nthey sent us every single one of them.\n\n440\n00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.480\nWe made a charge for it and\n\n441\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.270\nthey were a bit more delivered\nto them what they sent us.\n\n442\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.550\nThey didn't really need all 800\npresentations converted after all.\n\n443\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.090\nBecause there's some of\nour old stale learning and\n\n444\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.000\nthey didn't need those after all.\n\n445\n00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.880\nBut if it was free,\nthey had no skin in the game.\n\n446\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.070\nThat type of thing demand\nmanagement can play in on.\n\n447\n00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.265\nAnd staying with that\nsame team of e-learning,\n\n448\n00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:42.469\nwe need to understand what\nthat demand was like.\n\n449\n00:23:42.469 --> 00:23:45.239\nWe didn't anticipate it fully,\nbut now it's rolling and\n\n450\n00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:48.022\npeople really want to use\na learning management service.\n\n451\n00:23:48.022 --> 00:23:50.106\nHow many is there out there\nthat need to be converted?\n\n452\n00:23:50.106 --> 00:23:53.749\nAnd what kind of rate are we\ngonna have to maintain or\n\n453\n00:23:53.749 --> 00:23:56.473\nis it we need to convert 300 a week?\n\n454\n00:23:56.473 --> 00:23:58.265\n500 a week before we can do it.\n\n455\n00:23:58.265 --> 00:23:59.697\n20 a week, what is it?\n\n456\n00:23:59.697 --> 00:24:02.032\nThat's the thing that can\nhappen in operations.\n\n457\n00:24:02.032 --> 00:24:07.130\nSo once it's launched, the main management\ncan also follow through with some\n\n458\n00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:12.319\nunderstanding and predictive nature of\nwhat's gonna go on the future, okay?\n\n459\n00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:16.330\nHopefully you can answer all these\nquestions early but it's never that easy.\n\n460\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.539\nSo you have to follow up later, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:22.806\nNow we enclose to the end here for\ndemand management but,\n\n462\n00:24:22.806 --> 00:24:26.830\nthis again is great slide to come and\nreview, to reinforce.\n\n463\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:29.279\nThis slide refers to the inputs,\nthe triggers and\n\n464\n00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:32.896\noutputs were layer to demand management,\nand pretty straight forward,\n\n465\n00:24:32.896 --> 00:24:37.296\nyou got a new server you're considering,\nor you're changing a service dramatically.\n\n466\n00:24:37.296 --> 00:24:40.734\nDemand management needs to be there\nto try to predict what the demand for\n\n467\n00:24:40.734 --> 00:24:44.474\nthat newer change service is gonna be as\nyou could see at the top here, right?\n\n468\n00:24:44.474 --> 00:24:48.450\nThe things we have talked about\nare kinda reoriented here.\n\n469\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.981\nWe've got user profiles, patterns of\nbusiness activity, policies in play.\n\n470\n00:24:52.981 --> 00:24:56.901\nSo I encourage you to come here and\npause, you know pause the screen and\n\n471\n00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.040\nlook at this as a good point of review.\n\n472\n00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.715\nIt's an excellent point to reinforce or\n\n473\n00:25:02.715 --> 00:25:07.782\nreassimilate the information that\nwe've gleaned from this episode, okay?\n\n474\n00:25:07.782 --> 00:25:08.383\nSame with this one.\n\n475\n00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:12.745\nDemand management certainly could\ninteract with lots of other processes.\n\n476\n00:25:12.745 --> 00:25:15.745\nThe key one is capacity management\nthat we've talked about.\n\n477\n00:25:15.745 --> 00:25:17.441\nBut it's gonna be right there\nwith strategy management.\n\n478\n00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:21.329\nDemand management could predict that\nthere's gonna be a lot demand and\n\n479\n00:25:21.329 --> 00:25:25.465\nconvince strategist that, hey,\nwe need a new service here, right?\n\n480\n00:25:25.465 --> 00:25:26.726\nWe could sell this thing, right?\n\n481\n00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:28.649\nOr we could definitely\nplease the customers.\n\n482\n00:25:28.649 --> 00:25:32.860\nWe can increase customer satisfaction\nif we brought this service to light.\n\n483\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.500\nPortfolio management is that process that\ngoes through that decision making process\n\n484\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.440\nwhether we should fund something,\nthere along with financial management.\n\n485\n00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.730\nOf course BRM,\nbusiness relationship management,\n\n486\n00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.150\nthere's a lot of communication between\ndemand management and the business.\n\n487\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.001\nYou're getting in their offices and trying\nto discern their patterns of business\n\n488\n00:25:52.001 --> 00:25:53.965\nactivity and know their business plans.\n\n489\n00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:55.377\nWell BRM that process,\n\n490\n00:25:55.377 --> 00:26:00.580\nis the process that kind of governs all\nthe interfaces with the customer, right?\n\n491\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.126\nAnd on and on there.\n\n492\n00:26:02.126 --> 00:26:07.053\nSo another good place to pause and review\nhow would demand management be effected\n\n493\n00:26:07.053 --> 00:26:09.740\nby these other processes, and vice versa.\n\n494\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.020\nHow this demand management\naffect these processes?\n\n495\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.829\nA great place to review and\nreassimilate knowledge that we've gleamed.\n\n496\n00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:22.911\nOne other thing, if you've had some\nother courses like service offerings and\n\n497\n00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:27.531\nagreements or service design,\nyou will have stubbed your toe in demand\n\n498\n00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:31.150\nmanagement in those courses and\nshould not mention it.\n\n499\n00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:35.720\nDemand management is a process that's\nnot mentioned in service, I'm sorry,\n\n500\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.990\nin foundation course.\n\n501\n00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.125\nIt's one that's not included there, okay?\n\n502\n00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:44.010\nSo how could we keep up\nwith this information?\n\n503\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.900\nSo demand management would be relying\nheavily on the service portfolio,\n\n504\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.840\ncustomer and project portfolio to\nunderstand the landscape in those areas.\n\n505\n00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.210\nGetting minutes of\nmeetings between BRM and\n\n506\n00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.860\ncustomers, being at\nthose meetings sa well.\n\n507\n00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.010\nUnderstanding what the agreed\nterms are for performance, SLAs.\n\n508\n00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.775\nAnd of course mapping up to your\nconfiguration management system.\n\n509\n00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:08.410\nSo you know where all your assets are.\n\n510\n00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:14.125\nIt could also affect your demand\nmanagement type of considerations, okay?\n\n511\n00:27:14.125 --> 00:27:18.245\nLast is the source of information to\nhelp information management, okay?\n\n512\n00:27:20.415 --> 00:27:22.395\nSo some key performance indicators.\n\n513\n00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:26.099\nTo be successful at demand management, you\nneed to be successful at discerning PBAs.\n\n514\n00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.681\nThat you also document those and that you\nunderstand not just the high business\n\n515\n00:27:32.681 --> 00:27:37.355\nlevel of business activity but down in\nthe weeds and what each type of users,\n\n516\n00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:41.683\nhow are you gonna demand against\nthe system, user profiles, right?\n\n517\n00:27:41.683 --> 00:27:44.954\nThat's going to then feed\nthe capacity management so\n\n518\n00:27:44.954 --> 00:27:47.431\nour capacity plans effective, right?\n\n519\n00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:52.370\nSo that's another KPI the man\nmanagement being good makes capacity\n\n520\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:58.098\nmanagement better right, so you kind\nof connect the dots to your KPIs, okay?\n\n521\n00:27:58.098 --> 00:28:01.631\nAll right, another great place to come and\nreview and\n\n522\n00:28:01.631 --> 00:28:06.031\nre-assimilate knowledge picked\nup in this particular episode is\n\n523\n00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:09.740\nthe challenges critical to\nsuccess factors and risks.\n\n524\n00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.370\nBeing able to read these and understand\nthem as related to demand management is\n\n525\n00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.340\none pretty solid indication that you get\nit, that you understand demand management.\n\n526\n00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.009\nSo I'll cherry pick a little bit here.\n\n527\n00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.980\nAvailability of information\nabout business activities.\n\n528\n00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.690\nThat's a challenge you're gonna face.\n\n529\n00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.010\nThis means that you're gonna necessarily\nget involved with the business.\n\n530\n00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.170\nTest makers like to pull on\nchallenges to form their scenarios.\n\n531\n00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:43.070\nAnd a classic would be in this case,\na test maker will show\n\n532\n00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:48.100\nthat you are not able to get in front of\nthe business, you just kind of guessing.\n\n533\n00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.810\nAnd this scenario says,\nyou are guessing, and you are failing.\n\n534\n00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.310\nWell, how could you fix that.\n\n535\n00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.470\nGet in front the business, basically.\n\n536\n00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:01.070\nSo facing on the challenges Is\na great way to focus on potentially\n\n537\n00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:06.140\nwhat a test maker may frame his\nquestions and scenarios around, okay?\n\n538\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.620\nCritical success factors,\nagain cherry picking a little bit here.\n\n539\n00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.140\nA great place to come and review.\n\n540\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.680\nCritical success factors related to\ndemand management include that you\n\n541\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:21.820\nhave your PBAs understood, well\ndocumented, and it actually works, right?\n\n542\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.570\nSome of the risks of demand management\nis you don't have adequate information\n\n543\n00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.090\nin your configuration management.\n\n544\n00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.550\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\n545\n00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.100\nYou don't have commitments.\n\n546\n00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.870\nYou're not even sure what\ntargets you're marching toward,\n\n547\n00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.650\nhow big it needs to be, right?\n\n548\n00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:36.709\nThose are being some of the risks.\n\n549\n00:29:39.165 --> 00:29:42.382\nAs with any other process\nthat we've discussed,\n\n550\n00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:46.300\nprocess ownership and\nprocess management are key.\n\n551\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.790\nSo making sure you have\nappropriate ownership and\n\n552\n00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:53.680\naccountability of day to day operations\nof a process our key here, right?\n\n553\n00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.970\nAnd of course what these\nmanagers are gonna be doing,\n\n554\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.760\nthe ones managing the process,\n\n555\n00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.880\nare they're gonna be doing these\nthings that doing in management does.\n\n556\n00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.060\nAnalysing PBAs, identifying, analyze and\ndefining user profiles, making sure\n\n557\n00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.820\ncapacity management has the appropriate\nlevel of information at the right time.\n\n558\n00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n559\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.490\nAll right.\n\n560\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.410\nSo some of the output creating\nuser profile and associated PBAs.\n\n561\n00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.250\nAgain, memorizing these steps,\nnot necessarily useful.\n\n562\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.680\nUnderstanding these steps,\nthey are very useful, right.\n\n563\n00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.960\nGet good at this and\nyou can kinda walk through maybe to,\n\n564\n00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.060\nas an exercise go through an exercise,\ndo these four steps and\n\n565\n00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.090\nyou'll get a better idea of how this\nmight actually play out an operation.\n\n566\n00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.100\nIt's a great place to kinda\nreinforce a learning.\n\n567\n00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.840\n&gt;&gt; It kinda gives you a context to it.\n\n568\n00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.730\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n569\n00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.810\nIt makes you walk your mind through\nthe paces of what demand management\n\n570\n00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:47.410\nactually has to do.\n\n571\n00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.980\nThat's it for demand management.\n\n572\n00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.250\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ndemand management is an interesting topic.\n\n573\n00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.500\nAnd now that I know what it is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n574\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.670\n&gt;&gt; I can speak intelligibly about it.\n\n575\n00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.530\nAnd I have you to thank for that.\n\n576\n00:30:58.530 --> 00:30:59.730\nThank you so much.\n\n577\n00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.570\nNot only me and myself, but hopefully\nyou as well are assimilating this now,\n\n578\n00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.950\njust taking it in so\nthat you can pass your exam.\n\n579\n00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.270\nOr just take it back to your business and\nbe able to use it effectively.\n\n580\n00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.740\nIt apparently has a very\nhigh rate of usability.\n\n581\n00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.060\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; At least to my estimation.\n\n582\n00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.080\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n583\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.720\nlooks like we're at the end\nof our episode here.\n\n584\n00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.170\nThanks for joining us today, Terry.\n\n585\n00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.470\nWe do thank our studio audience for\nwatching.\n\n586\n00:31:22.470 -->

00:00:10.865\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:12.870\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.980\nHi, greetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.260\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in todays episode, well,\n\n7\n00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.960\nif you've come for\nsomething other than ITIL PPO then you're\n\n8\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.910\ngonna be sadly disappointed because\nthat's what we're doing today.\n\n9\n00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.040\nAnd joining me in the studio\nto help me with that endeavor,\n\n10\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.438\nour good friend Mister Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:29.438 --> 00:00:30.182\nTerry, welcome back man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:30.741\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:31.900\n&gt;&gt; It's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.530\nGlad to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.250\nGonna finish up, gonna wrap up this PPO\n\n16\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.300\ncourse here with a consideration of\ntechnology and implementation, right.\n\n17\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.270\nFor those of you that might have taken\ntheir intermediate level course,\n\n18\n00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.870\nyou're gonna see a lot of\nfamiliar concepts here.\n\n19\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.560\nIn all the different curriculum,\n\n20\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.420\nthe technology and implementation\nconsiderations are virtually identical.\n\n21\n00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.950\nSo if it looks familiar, it sounds\nfamiliar, it probably is very familiar.\n\n22\n00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.330\nLet's have a look here.\n\n23\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.200\nFirst of all, a reminder that\nthe word tool is a word that\n\n24\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.910\nITIL uses to describe the technology\nthat the IT service provider uses.\n\n25\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.640\nIt's technology for sure,\ntools or technology.\n\n26\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.360\nITIL uses solutions to describe\nthe technology that customers use.\n\n27\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.940\nThey use the word tools to describe\n\n28\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.750\nthe technology that the IT\nservice provider uses.\n\n29\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.020\nSo when you talk about technology\nconsideration, you're really talking about\n\n30\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.900\nwhat tools do you need to make this\nwork and again at a very high level.\n\n31\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.240\nSo, as we've talked about capacity\nmanagement, we talked about availability,\n\n32\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.490\nwe've talked about demand, we've talked\nabout continuity and security management.\n\n33\n00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.700\nI think if you have any\nexperience at all in IT,\n\n34\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630\nyou understand that tools can\nhelp you do those things, right?\n\n35\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.500\nIf nothing else to have a laptop computer\n\n36\n00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.090\nthat has word processor on it is going\nto help you create a document, right?\n\n37\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.280\nThose sorts of things.\n\n38\n00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.980\nBut we're only talking about a bit more\nextravagant tools in the background.\n\n39\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.050\nYour data modeling,\nyour data design, process design.\n\n40\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.110\nHow are you going to\nthe architectural design, right?\n\n41\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.800\nBeing able to create Visio diagram.\n\n42\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.140\nBeing able to crunch numbers\nin a spreadsheet to determine\n\n43\n00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.170\nsome algorithms for capacity management or\n\n44\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.440\nnetwork utilization or application sizing,\nvarious things like that.\n\n45\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.070\nMonitoring tools, right?\n\n46\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.635\nWe've talked about availability management\nhas these reactive activities of\n\n47\n00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:27.225\nmonitoring to see if how\nthe services are doing.\n\n48\n00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:30.035\nSo monitoring tools are gonna\nbe part of this as well.\n\n49\n00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:32.325\nSo a big bucket of tools, and\n\n50\n00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:36.775\nno real specific definition of\nwhat tools you must have, or\n\n51\n00:02:36.775 --> 00:02:42.450\nshould have is provided by the makers\nof ITIL or the writers in ITIL.\n\n52\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.410\nUnderstanding the tools\nare a big part of it.\n\n53\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.840\nSo this particular episode is gonna be\nfocusing on some more generic high level\n\n54\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.720\nconsiderations for what tools you might\nneed and how you go about implementing\n\n55\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.460\nthese tools for the purposes of\nplanning protection and optimization.\n\n56\n00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.180\nRight, so generic activities,\n\n57\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.960\nbeing able to build to get the\nrelationships among your various assets.\n\n58\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.970\nCan you link for instance in your CSM\nyour Configuration Management system,\n\n59\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.700\ncan you link your logical layer of\nservices, which is something you just kind\n\n60\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.110\nof create out of thin air,\nto the physical assets they have?\n\n61\n00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.610\nSo you have logical and physical.\n\n62\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.600\nSo can you link a service called email\nto the 17 servers underneath it?\n\n63\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.330\nThat make it work, right?\n\n64\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.900\nOr the network components or the identity\nmanagement service that helps it work,\n\n65\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.220\nthose kinda linkages among your assets.\n\n66\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.970\nFurthermore, could you link that\ninformation to the number of incidents\n\n67\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.760\nthat have occurred for that service,\nor the numbers of problems, or\n\n68\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.080\nthe numbers of outages?\n\n69\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.150\nThe length of outages, right.\n\n70\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.850\nThat's what we're talking about,\ngetting these things interrelated\n\n71\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.450\nto each other is a big challenge and\none worth taking.\n\n72\n00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.260\nAnd being able to reuse the data and\n\n73\n00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.330\npresent it at the right times is\na big challenge as well, okay.\n\n74\n00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.520\nAnd of course, managing your skills,\nthe people skills, the competencies.\n\n75\n00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.180\nMake sure you can manage the competencies.\n\n76\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.260\nQuantify them,\nwhat kind of people do you need?\n\n77\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.900\nDo you need process people,\ndatabase people,\n\n78\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.950\nserver people, all of the above,\ncan you roll them all into one person?\n\n79\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.410\nAll of this is also going to depend\non the size of the organization.\n\n80\n00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.280\nHow specialized can you be or\nif you're in a smaller organization,\n\n81\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.580\nmaybe a lot more generalists are involved.\n\n82\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.320\nThey can do a Jack of all\ntrades kind of thing.\n\n83\n00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.470\nBut certainly, understanding\nwhat skills you need to play,\n\n84\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.190\nwhat skills that you need to bring\nto these challenges is important.\n\n85\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.690\nOkay.\n\n86\n00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:45.023\nSo, again, nothing magical about this is\nhow you go about evaluating the various\n\n87\n00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:48.280\ntools, whether you gonna buy or\nbuild them, right?\n\n88\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.290\nYou gotta build it yourself,\nyou gotta buy it off the shelf.\n\n89\n00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.150\nIf you're gonna go purchase\nit from somewhere,\n\n90\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.060\nyou're gonna have some\noptions in play there.\n\n91\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.750\nObviously if you're gonna build it, you've\ngot options to build it yourself as well.\n\n92\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.190\nAre you trying to save a bunch of money,\nyou trying to increase productivity,\n\n93\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.550\na little bit of both, right?\n\n94\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.080\nSo this little serpentine trail is\nagain nothing really magical or\n\n95\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.570\nit's not a big revelation here but\nwhat are you trying to get done, right?\n\n96\n00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.854\nYou see what requirements,\nlet me get my laser pointer here.\n\n97\n00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:21.460\nWhat are your requirements?\n\n98\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.210\nWhat are you trying to get done?\n\n99\n00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.980\nWhat products satisfy those\nrequirements at least\n\n100\n00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.490\nsomewhat if not completely, right?\n\n101\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.740\nWhat's gonna be your selection criteria?\n\n102\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.470\nCost is gonna play in there.\n\n103\n00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.150\nFunctionality is gonna play in there.\n\n104\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.870\nScalability might play in there.\n\n105\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.040\nLots of considerations for\nyour selection criteria, right.\n\n106\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.240\nAnd then of course,\nyou're gonna evaluate the products and\n\n107\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.160\ncome up with a short list of folks or\nvendors.\n\n108\n00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.420\nOr even compare them to your\nown internal building options.\n\n109\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.630\nYou're going to short list those,\nand then you begin to score them.\n\n110\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.050\nSome methodical way to rate\none against the other.\n\n111\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.400\n&gt;&gt; I've definitely seen this go awry\nbefore, where we, I worked for a company\n\n112\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.910\nand they built a change management system\ninstead of buying one off the shelf.\n\n113\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.120\nAnd they thought, this is the end-all,\nbe-all, and everyone hated it.\n\n114\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.640\nIt was unintuitive.\n\n115\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.660\nNobody could figure out how\nto actually work the thing.\n\n116\n00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.880\nAnd it was like, why didn't you just buy\nsomething like Spiceworks, you know?\n\n117\n00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.400\nWell, everybody kind\nof knows how it works.\n\n118\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.690\nThey've spent a lot of time and effort in\nfiguring out what's the best way to do\n\n119\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.370\nchange management or\na very good way to do change management.\n\n120\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.880\nAnd it's super easy.\n\n121\n00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.465\nAnd, it was just, now everyone\nrebelled and no one wanted to use it.\n\n122\n00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:30.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they spent a lot of time and money\n\n123\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.000\nand effort into developing this thing\nthat everyone literally refused to use.\n\n124\n00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.950\nIt was that unintuitive and-\n&gt;&gt; It's a good little cautionary tale and\n\n125\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.900\nI certainly understand that.\n\n126\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.090\nUnless you are a development shop,\n\n127\n00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.850\nunless you are an IT service\nmanagement development shop,\n\n128\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.770\ndeveloping IT service management tools is\nprobably going to be counter-intuitive.\n\n129\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.850\nAs Daniel suggested.\n\n130\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.480\nIt is not as though we are going to\nhit the target It's not your specialty\n\n131\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.460\nnecessarily.\n\n132\n00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.980\nNow that said, if you're a small\nshop you only have you know 300\n\n133\n00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.650\nservers in the data center and\nnot 3,000, right?\n\n134\n00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.280\nYou offer three or\nfour specialized IT services,\n\n135\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.660\nit's not expansive amount of services.\n\n136\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.540\nInvesting a couple of million dollars\nin an IT service management suite\n\n137\n00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.350\nis also counterproductive.\n\n138\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.080\nIt's not worth the trouble.\n\n139\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.811\nYou got 15 employees in\nthe IT organization.\n\n140\n00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:31.323\nAgain, investing $2 million in\nan IT service management suite,\n\n141\n00:07:31.323 --> 00:07:35.438\nprobably not the trouble,\nnot worth that kind of expense, so\n\n142\n00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:40.345\nagain getting the right balance,\nI appreciate the cautionary tale, but\n\n143\n00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:45.094\nITIL got a large choir they are teaching\nto, preaching to so to speak and\n\n144\n00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:50.003\nthey are trying to motivate folks to\ngood practices and best practices but\n\n145\n00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:54.830\nthey can't be so prescriptive to say\nyou should buy and not build because\n\n146\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.780\nno two organization would have the same\nkind a, Considerations in that.\n\n147\n00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.748\n&gt;&gt; I just meant to say be careful.\n\n148\n00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.533\nMake sure you choose the correct way.\n\n149\n00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, I totally understood\nthe spirit of what you said.\n\n150\n00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.920\nIt's a very valid cautionary tale.\n\n151\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.860\nOn the other side of that coin are also\ncautionary tales about going out and\n\n152\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.230\nbuying something that you don't ever use.\n\n153\n00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.000\n&gt;&gt; It's like, well, way of hospitality.\n\n154\n00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.170\n&gt;&gt; Exact, obvious.\n\n155\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.750\nBoth things are in place.\n\n156\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.960\nSo very good points, Daniel.\n\n157\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.630\nAnd a good compare and contrast, and\n\n158\n00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.805\nreally is part of\nthe challenge to a selection.\n\n159\n00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:26.580\nSo you kinda helped me lecture this\nbasically, without having good compare and\n\n160\n00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.460\ncontrast, because that's what you gotta\nfind, that right kind of balance.\n\n161\n00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.170\nAll right, good job.\n\n162\n00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.420\nNow, word soup.\n\n163\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.896\nI'll give you a few minutes.\n\n164\n00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:37.335\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we are back.\n\n165\n00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:38.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we are back.\n\n166\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.310\nObviously, lots of words here.\n\n167\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.550\nKey points to consider during evaluation.\n\n168\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.200\nWe just kind of went through that in\nour back and forth, Daniel and I did.\n\n169\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.540\nHow much?\nWhat's the right balance?\n\n170\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.430\nIs it scale?\n\n171\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.990\nHow many people need to use it?\n\n172\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.340\nWhat's the usability, you know?\n\n173\n00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.900\nThe intuitive nature of it?\n\n174\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.338\n&gt;&gt; Training.\nThat should have been huge.\n\n175\n00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:58.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you see that in there.\n\n176\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.820\nYeah. Training.\nLook at how dang small that is.\n\n177\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.610\nThat's pretty darn small.\n\n178\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt should be right in the middle.\n\n179\n00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.911\n&gt;&gt; Boom, boom.\n\n180\n00:09:03.911 --> 00:09:05.368\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Blinking lights around it.\n\n181\n00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:05.979\n&gt;&gt; I agree with you.\n\n182\n00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:07.295\nSometimes that's often missing.\n\n183\n00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:07.795\nIt really is.\n\n184\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.670\nThis How much?\n\n185\n00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.180\nis a good one.\nHow much money?\n\n186\n00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.730\nHow much functionality?\n\n187\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.930\nHow many people?\nEtcetera.\n\n188\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:20.810\nAgain depending on the scale, size,\nultimate goals, a lot of words here.\n\n189\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.870\nOut of the box.\n\n190\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.400\nBuild it yourself.\n\n191\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.040\nLots of considerations and again,\nit teased out kind of nice in the back and\n\n192\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.450\nforth Daniel and I just had.\n\n193\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.850\nGood job with that.\n\n194\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.210\nNow this MoSCoW Principle.\n\n195\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.080\nIt also points to something\nthat's very basic.\n\n196\n00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.670\nMaybe it's a good mnemonic, something\nthat helps you remember something.\n\n197\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.360\nMust, Should, Could or Won't.\n\n198\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.380\nRight?\n\n199\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.040\nThe Os are completely missing, so\n\n200\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.500\nthe MoSCoW Principle is basically\na way that you could begin to identify\n\n201\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.210\nwhat you really have to have,\nwhat'll be nice to have, etc.\n\n202\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.100\nAnd it doesn't have to be MoSCoW.\n\n203\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.980\nYou could choose other ones.\n\n204\n00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.750\nIt could be gotta have, musts,\nnice, optional in the future.\n\n205\n00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.470\nYou see those kinda things.\n\n206\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.970\nMoSCoW helps.\n\n207\n00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.640\nIf it doesn't help, choose another model.\n\n208\n00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.870\nBut the overarching premise here is\nthat you understand the functionality,\n\n209\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.300\nyou need based on some sort\nof scale of criticality.\n\n210\n00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.840\nAnd if you identified,\nsay you identify 25 requirements, 35,\n\n211\n00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:32.080\n50 requirements that this tool is\nsupposed to satisfy, must satisfy.\n\n212\n00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.380\nThen the must have to be there.\n\n213\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.620\nIf you go to the trouble of saying,\nwe have to have this.\n\n214\n00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.290\nYou'd identify it as a must feature,\nthen don't compromise.\n\n215\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.780\nIf a product doesn't have it,\ndon't go with it.\n\n216\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.780\nOr be ready to customize around it, or\nconfigure around it, whatever must be.\n\n217\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.920\nSo must really do mean must Right?\n\n218\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.734\nThe good old 80/20 rules\nkind of apply here,\n\n219\n00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:58.285\n80% of the functionality you is\nseek is a pretty good match,\n\n220\n00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:02.180\nbecause you probably not gonna\nfind a 100% match, right?\n\n221\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.340\nThat said, you need 100% of those\nthings you should crawled, Must.\n\n222\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.050\nNow the way that plays out in exam\npotentially, is the scenario or\n\n223\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.460\nthe test maker will generate a scenario,\nand they would describe it must do this,\n\n224\n00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.910\nthey'll use explicit language\nlike it must do this,\n\n225\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.820\nit must do that, pick the right product.\n\n226\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.214\nYou cannot pick a product,\nno matter how many other good\n\n227\n00:11:26.214 --> 00:11:30.153\nthings it has unless it has all the musts,\nright?\n\n228\n00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:33.260\nAll right, I mean,\nagain if you're gonna call it a must-\n\n229\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it must be a must.\n\n230\n00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:34.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n\n231\n00:11:34.525 --> 00:11:35.360\nLanguage is fun.\n\n232\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.150\n&gt;&gt; Language is fun, yep.\n\n233\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.070\nI remember yeah, we use to go with\na language of should and shall.\n\n234\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n235\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Shall is a must.\n\n236\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n237\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Should is a nice to have.\n\n238\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.267\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Language is kinda fun.\n\n239\n00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:48.389\nGet the language right.\n\n240\n00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:51.240\nGood deal.\n\n241\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.720\nSo again, you're also,\nas you're trying to pick your tools,\n\n242\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.640\nyou're gonna understand what are the\nservice level requirements for this.\n\n243\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.440\nJust as you would for a service\nthat you're trying to prepare for\n\n244\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.720\ncustomers, you jut consider your\nservice network requirements for\n\n245\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.270\nthe tools you're picking for yourself.\n\n246\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.800\nWhat is gonna be in play?\n\n247\n00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.040\nSo, basically as a cobbler,\nmake sure your own kids have shoes too.\n\n248\n00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.010\nTake care of yourself as\na provider of technology, right?\n\n249\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.110\nUnderstand the risk, understanding the\ndesign, the strategy it's trying to make.\n\n250\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.630\nSo take the same approaches you would\nto introducing a new technology to\n\n251\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.900\nthe business.\n\n252\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.320\nTake that same approach as you\nintroduce new technology to your own\n\n253\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.750\nIT organization.\n\n254\n00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.250\nDon't skimp on that.\n\n255\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.170\nBecause you're going to\nfind points of failure.\n\n256\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.710\nThe example that Daniel mentioned earlier,\n\n257\n00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:41.520\nwhere they built their own change\nmanagement system and it fell flat.\n\n258\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.370\nAnd no one liked it.\n\n259\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.360\nIt was counterintuitive, it didn't work.\n\n260\n00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.820\nIt was a bleh experience.\n\n261\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.330\nInvolving the users and the customers, so\n\n262\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.690\nto speak, in a true itll sense would\nhave precluded some of that bleh effect.\n\n263\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.600\nI'm not sure how you spell that.\n\n264\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n265\n00:12:58.347 --> 00:12:59.533\n&gt;&gt; You can quote me if you like.\n\n266\n00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:00.650\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.259\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n268\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.880\nSame thing.\nThe challenges of tools and\n\n269\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.030\nimplementation as you face\ncustomers could also be handled\n\n270\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.340\nas well within your own\nservice organization.\n\n271\n00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.980\nSo we're looking about adoption of tools,\nthe same kind of challenges apply.\n\n272\n00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.500\nYou got different stakeholder groups.\n\n273\n00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.200\nThe CIO wants it cheap.\n\n274\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.480\nThe users want it good, right?\n\n275\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.152\nAnd the project wants it done now, right?\n\n276\n00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.310\n&gt;&gt; That sort of thing.\n\n278\n00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:26.750\nSo you gotta pick two, right?\n\n279\n00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.710\nRemember, I want it cheap.\n\n280\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.840\nI want it good.\n\n281\n00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.160\nI want it fast.\n\n282\n00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.480\nYou can only pick two of the three,\ntwo of the three.\n\n283\n00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.390\nSo managing these different stakeholder\ninterest also plays out for\n\n284\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.860\nthe service organization as\nwell in servicing that play.\n\n285\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.030\nSo again, take a service minded approach\nto how you tend to these things.\n\n286\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.830\nPrioritize appropriately.\n\n287\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.360\nOf course,\nyou're gonna make compromises here.\n\n288\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.960\nBut try to get that harmonic\neffect as much as possible.\n\n289\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.130\nAnd if you do have to cheat\non the quality side of it,\n\n290\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.050\ndue to cost constraints or time\nconstraints, at least make it apparent and\n\n291\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.620\ntransparent that it was\na conscious decision, and\n\n292\n00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.890\nnot just driven home blindly by\nthose in charge, so to speak.\n\n293\n00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.840\nBring the stakeholders along, all right?\n\n294\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.200\nSo again, that's being transparent.\n\n295\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.960\nYou'll see some of those words,\ncreate a sharing culture.\n\n296\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:20.020\nTest takers, this plays out on\nexams in a way that will challenge\n\n297\n00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:25.820\nyour sense of inclusion, right, and might\nerr on the side of inviting more people.\n\n298\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.760\nTo the solution planning,\ninstead of less people.\n\n299\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.660\nGet more stakeholders involved,\ninstead of fewer stakeholders involved.\n\n300\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.920\nThat's sometimes counterintuitive,\nin a lot of organizations.\n\n301\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.830\nConsensus is hard.\n\n302\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.220\nCollaboration is hard.\n\n303\n00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.330\nThe more people you invite to the meeting,\nthe longer the meeting's gonna take.\n\n304\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.400\nIt's harder to get a decision,\nharder to build consensus.\n\n305\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.990\nI totally understand that.\n\n306\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:53.030\nAnd at some point, you might just want to\nscram that square peg in the round hole.\n\n307\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.390\nI understand that dynamic.\n\n308\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.560\nITIL those, too.\n\n309\n00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.160\nI'm not saying they're ignoring it.\n\n310\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.520\nBut on the ITIL Island drinking\nyour nice little mojito,\n\n311\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.880\nremember that you should invite everyone\nto the island to enjoy the party.\n\n312\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.380\nOkay.\n\n313\n00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.830\nIt's not a deserted island,\nit's a fun island.\n\n314\n00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's a party island.\n\n315\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.570\n&gt;&gt; It's a party island,\numbrella drinks and everything.\n\n316\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.135\n&gt;&gt; It's like Cabo.\n\n317\n00:15:13.135 --> 00:15:15.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n318\n00:15:15.378 --> 00:15:17.180\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n319\n00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.920\nSo again, reinforcing this idea of\ncritical success factors is to make sure\n\n320\n00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.210\nyou invite the stakeholders in.\n\n321\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.690\nAcross the life cycle stages,\n\n322\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.860\ntake a life cycle approach to\nyour own tools and options.\n\n323\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.990\nAppropriate strategy, appropriate design,\nappropriate transition which includes all\n\n324\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.990\nthe training, and of course,\nappropriate operations and measurements.\n\n325\n00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.520\nRight.\n\n326\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.980\nClear rolls and definitions etc.\n\n327\n00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.860\nOkay.\n\n328\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.844\nOf course some of the risks\nof implementing technology,\n\n329\n00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:49.327\nthe landscape changes, and\nyou see change in accountability,\n\n330\n00:15:49.327 --> 00:15:51.660\nresponsibility and practices.\n\n331\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.568\nYou might have built the perfect\nchange management system for\n\n332\n00:15:55.568 --> 00:16:00.970\na small organization, and you've doubled\nin size over the last three years.\n\n333\n00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.358\nAnd it's just not keeping pace, right?\n\n334\n00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:05.540\nSo that could also happen,\nthings change, right?\n\n335\n00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:11.926\nSo the same kinda risks that apply to\nthe management of technology on behalf of\n\n336\n00:16:11.926 --> 00:16:16.958\nthe customers also plays out in managing\nthe risk associated with delivering for\n\n337\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.230\nyourself, right?\n\n338\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.971\nAnd try to keep those in check.\n\n339\n00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:24.373\nAgain, nothing magical about this risk,\nwe're counterintuitive about this list,\n\n340\n00:16:24.373 --> 00:16:26.496\nI should say, pretty straight forward.\n\n341\n00:16:26.496 --> 00:16:28.992\nAnother good place to come for\na good review, okay?\n\n342\n00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:36.246\nDiscern in between licenses,\nI'll given a little bit time here.\n\n343\n00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:40.926\nLicence management is more art\nthan science I think this days.\n\n344\n00:16:40.926 --> 00:16:46.100\nThe way that software publisher package\nthing with support contract and\n\n345\n00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.927\nthe way they do,\nEnterprise level and lower levels.\n\n346\n00:16:49.927 --> 00:16:55.047\nIt's kind of a mystery sometimes to get\nan exact number at different times.\n\n347\n00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:58.987\nI don't know, we spent a couple of months\ntrying to figure out our license landscape\n\n348\n00:16:58.987 --> 00:17:00.329\nacross 23 applications.\n\n349\n00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:02.874\nIt took us about 23 months to\nfigure out the best way to do it.\n\n350\n00:17:02.874 --> 00:17:05.034\nNow, something can be kind of hard, right?\n\n351\n00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:09.504\nSo I'm not gonna belabor this because it\nis somewhat changing at any given time.\n\n352\n00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:13.578\nBut a dedicated license is one per user,\nright?\n\n353\n00:17:13.578 --> 00:17:18.978\nA shared license as it entails,\nis shared among many users.\n\n354\n00:17:18.978 --> 00:17:23.354\nSo kinda the difference there is\nif you buy 100 shared licenses,\n\n355\n00:17:23.354 --> 00:17:27.986\nthat 101st person can't use it,\nthey will be blocked out, right?\n\n356\n00:17:27.986 --> 00:17:28.887\nThey can't use it or\n\n357\n00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:31.806\nyou'll be in violation if it's\nnot automatically blocked out.\n\n358\n00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:38.457\nShared licenses per unit tend to cost\nmore but you don't have to buy as many.\n\n359\n00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:43.973\nSo as an example, if you have three\nshifts of service desk staff.\n\n360\n00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:47.660\nSome come in the morning, they go away,\nthe evening shift comes in, and\n\n361\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.907\nthen the nighttime shift comes in, right?\n\n362\n00:17:49.907 --> 00:17:56.099\nAnd that total number is 450, but no more\nthan 200 are active at any given time,\n\n363\n00:17:56.099 --> 00:18:01.861\nthen maybe the shared license approach\nwould be the less expensive approach for\n\n364\n00:18:01.861 --> 00:18:06.865\nthe service desk software that's\nbeing used as an example, right?\n\n365\n00:18:06.865 --> 00:18:12.111\nWeb licenses are typically providing\nsometimes less functionality but\n\n366\n00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:16.497\nthey are often cheaper to buy,\nthey call it Thin Access, but\n\n367\n00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:20.459\nthey also could be thin on\nthe functionality side too.\n\n368\n00:18:20.459 --> 00:18:23.758\nIf they don't necessarily have\nthe full feature of the client,\n\n369\n00:18:23.758 --> 00:18:25.661\nso you gotta weigh that dynamic out.\n\n370\n00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:29.214\nAnd then of course, service on demand,\nyou're basically paying as you go,\n\n371\n00:18:29.214 --> 00:18:31.362\nas you use the service,\nyou're paying a fee.\n\n372\n00:18:31.362 --> 00:18:33.138\nDifferent ways to license these things.\n\n373\n00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:36.412\nHow you're gonna get the,\nwhat's your deployment strategy?\n\n374\n00:18:36.412 --> 00:18:40.685\nIs it a client, agent or are you gonna\ndeploy it through automated systems?\n\n375\n00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:44.133\nIs it going and\nvisiting each desktop, etc, right?\n\n376\n00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:47.701\nA lot of this has been precluded by\na lot of good distribution software and\n\n377\n00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:50.818\nhonestly aren't a lot of\napplications web based now anyways?\n\n378\n00:18:50.818 --> 00:18:54.455\nSo if you have a browser, you have\nthe application basically so that's,\n\n379\n00:18:54.455 --> 00:18:56.460\nthe landscape changed so much, right?\n\n380\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.051\nIn that regard.\n\n381\n00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:01.764\nCapacity checks, timing, introduction\nstyle, are you gonna do a big bang,\n\n382\n00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:04.980\neveryone gets it at once, or\nyou're gonna do at phases?\n\n383\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.650\nThe advantages of phase approach is you\ndon't necessarily absorb all the risk and\n\n384\n00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.690\ndisruption at once.\n\n385\n00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.510\nPerhaps a disadvantage\nof the phase approach\n\n386\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.860\nis you don't get all\nthe value all at once.\n\n387\n00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.940\nAnd in fact, you're maintaining two\nsystems at the same time, right?\n\n388\n00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.540\nSo different kinda counterpoints there.\n\n389\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.168\nAre you going to roll it out functionally?\n\n390\n00:19:26.168 --> 00:19:29.533\nLike you wanna give it to every\nsales team across the world,\n\n391\n00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:31.224\na functional introduction.\n\n392\n00:19:31.224 --> 00:19:32.547\nOr are you going to do it geographic,\n\n393\n00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.869\nwhere everyone in Germany gets\nit whether they belong to sales.\n\n394\n00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:36.461\n&gt;&gt; HR, whatever.\n\n395\n00:19:36.461 --> 00:19:37.378\n&gt;&gt; HR, whatever, yeah.\n\n396\n00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:39.026\nDifferent approaches there, too.\n\n397\n00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:43.628\nAgain, there's no magic elixir here\nthat says here's the best way,\n\n398\n00:19:43.628 --> 00:19:48.308\nthis disk could be kinda little\norientation of the kind of questions and\n\n399\n00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:51.355\noptions you might have in front of you,\nokay?\n\n400\n00:19:51.355 --> 00:19:55.227\nComing up with appropriate architecture,\nagain,\n\n401\n00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:59.979\nITIL is not going to prescribe or\nbe able to define an appropriate\n\n402\n00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:04.303\nway to blueprint your development\nof IT infrastructure.\n\n403\n00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:07.072\nI mean this is not what\nthey're trying to do, so\n\n404\n00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:11.390\nthis is very broad strokes of what\narchitecture design can mean, right?\n\n405\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:17.985\nAnd keep in mind that architectural design\ndoesn't just mean technology design.\n\n406\n00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:20.702\nWe'll talk about management\narchitectures as well.\n\n407\n00:20:20.702 --> 00:20:24.530\nSo understanding the architecture goes\nbeyond the technologies is an important\n\n408\n00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.717\nthing to take away here.\n\n409\n00:20:25.717 --> 00:20:29.270\nAnd the overall picture\nEnterprise architecture.\n\n410\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.825\nSo if you look at this graphic\na little bit more detail.\n\n411\n00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:36.102\nEnterprise architecture deals\nwith organisational architecture,\n\n412\n00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:38.500\nhow does the business and IT interact?\n\n413\n00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.890\nWhat are the structures of\narchitecture there, right?\n\n414\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.283\nWho reports to who?\n\n415\n00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:46.747\nDoes the CIO report to\nthe finance officer?\n\n416\n00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:50.706\nOr does the CIO report to the CEO, right?\n\n417\n00:20:50.706 --> 00:20:56.001\nDoes the security officer report\nto the CEO or to the CIO?\n\n418\n00:20:56.001 --> 00:20:59.037\nI mean you see the various ways\nthat this can play out and\n\n419\n00:20:59.037 --> 00:21:01.952\nit has an effect on the ay\nthe organization behaves.\n\n420\n00:21:01.952 --> 00:21:03.318\nSo when we talk about architecture,\n\n421\n00:21:03.318 --> 00:21:05.620\nwe're talking about lots of\ndifferent things here, right?\n\n422\n00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.915\nSo you got the Organizational\narchitecture, Enterprise architecture,\n\n423\n00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:13.539\nService architecture,\nhow you build your services, right?\n\n424\n00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:16.844\nWhich services you imply,\nhow they interrelate with each other,\n\n425\n00:21:16.844 --> 00:21:20.690\nhow you define your ownership of\nservices within the organization, right?\n\n426\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:26.128\nAnd then down in the technology finally\nwe talk about application architecture,\n\n427\n00:21:26.128 --> 00:21:30.245\nwe talk about infrastructure\narchitecture as well, right?\n\n428\n00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:34.171\nSo architecture is a big,\nbig thing, it's not a simple thing.\n\n429\n00:21:34.171 --> 00:21:36.970\nSo just keep that in mind,\nthe word architecture is used\n\n430\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.830\nquite broadly by ITIL to\ndescribe not just technology but\n\n431\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.706\nthe way organizations interact\nwith each other as well.\n\n432\n00:21:42.706 --> 00:21:46.411\nAnd it's between these architectures\nthat you build up interfaces and\n\n433\n00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:49.940\nwithin those interfaces you have\nto provide some good lubricants.\n\n434\n00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.483\nMake sure you got enough meetings,\nenough communications between them.\n\n435\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:03.148\nSo Service, Application, Data Information,\nIT Infrastructure, Environmental things.\n\n436\n00:22:03.148 --> 00:22:07.224\nAgain, nothing really magical or\ncounter intuitive about this.\n\n437\n00:22:07.224 --> 00:22:11.778\nI will say that a service is\nsomething that is logical,\n\n438\n00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:14.161\nit's not a physical thing.\n\n439\n00:22:14.161 --> 00:22:18.979\nThey're made out of thin air,\nthey're decisions that people make, right?\n\n440\n00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:20.948\nI mean a server is a server,\nit's a hardware,\n\n441\n00:22:20.948 --> 00:22:22.776\nyou know there is things in there, right?\n\n442\n00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:27.000\nAn application is a bit more tangible too,\nit's installed, it's there,\n\n443\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.184\nit works, it does it's work, right?\n\n444\n00:22:29.184 --> 00:22:33.827\nData and information is what it is, it's\nsomething it's relatively physical, right?\n\n445\n00:22:33.827 --> 00:22:38.600\nAnd of course, IT infrastructure, racks,\nnetwork switches, moving things around.\n\n446\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.933\nBut puting a service level or\na service layer on the top\n\n447\n00:22:41.933 --> 00:22:45.870\nof these different aspects is\nreally a logical construction.\n\n448\n00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:50.702\nConnecting the dots between the logical,\nthe service levels, the service\n\n449\n00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:55.758\nlayer I should say, and the under pending\nphysical things, tangible things,\n\n450\n00:22:55.758 --> 00:23:00.607\nis a very important trick to pull of\nwith your tools implementation, okay?\n\n451\n00:23:02.987 --> 00:23:05.011\nHere we are going into\nmanagement architectures,\n\n452\n00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:06.668\nwe talked about this on a previous slide.\n\n453\n00:23:06.668 --> 00:23:08.141\nGenerally speaking,\n\n454\n00:23:08.141 --> 00:23:13.489\nmanagement architectures is how you map\nthe physical service layers, sorry,\n\n455\n00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:18.464\nlogical service layers to the underlying\nphysical layers as well, right?\n\n456\n00:23:18.464 --> 00:23:23.129\nSo management architectures, they need to\nbe aligned to what the business is trying\n\n457\n00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:26.034\nto do not just technology\nas we talked about before.\n\n458\n00:23:26.034 --> 00:23:30.794\nYou need those kind of interfaces and\nthey need a good amount of lubrication.\n\n459\n00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:33.425\nThat's the kind of considerations for\ntechnology and\n\n460\n00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:35.148\nimplementation need to consider.\n\n461\n00:23:35.148 --> 00:23:39.588\nIt's holistic, it's not just technology,\nit's people too,\n\n462\n00:23:39.588 --> 00:23:44.027\nit's methodical, it also suggest\nyou treat yourself, and IT,\n\n463\n00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:48.645\nin the implementation of tools,\nas if your are a customer, right?\n\n464\n00:23:48.645 --> 00:23:53.052\nSo go through service strategy, go\nthrough design, go through transition and\n\n465\n00:23:53.052 --> 00:23:57.064\nas you're operating it male sure it's\ncontinually improved and fit for\n\n466\n00:23:57.064 --> 00:23:58.461\npurpose and fit for use.\n\n467\n00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:01.971\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Terry it was very cool,\na little rundown on technology and\n\n468\n00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:04.046\nimplementations that we need to consider.\n\n469\n00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:08.446\nBut this looks like we've\nwrapped up our ITIL PPO series.\n\n470\n00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:11.311\nI'm gonna shed a tear,\nI promised myself I wouldn't cry but\n\n471\n00:24:11.311 --> 00:24:13.288\n[LAUGH] I won't seriously that's silly.\n\n472\n00:24:13.288 --> 00:24:16.109\nBut it has been a good time and\nI appreciate you joining us.\n\n473\n00:24:16.109 --> 00:24:18.920\n&gt;&gt; Please keep in mind just as a reminder,\nthere's opportunities,\n\n474\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.835\nthere's other resources available to you.\n\n475\n00:24:20.835 --> 00:24:25.736\nThere's the downloadable exercises,\nthere's knowledge checks going\n\n476\n00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:29.776\nto be there, there are exams,\nvery, very valuable tools.\n\n477\n00:24:29.776 --> 00:24:35.123\nPracticing those exams is critical\nto preparing for the real exam.\n\n478\n00:24:35.123 --> 00:24:39.455\nProbably the most valuable resource among\nthe resources available to you is going\n\n479\n00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:42.345\nthrough those practice exams and\ntesting yourself but\n\n480\n00:24:42.345 --> 00:24:44.996\nalso using it as an opportunity for\nnew learning.\n\n481\n00:24:44.996 --> 00:24:49.013\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Terry, we do thank\nyou for joining us for this PPO series.\n\n482\n00:24:49.013 --> 00:24:52.627\nWe thank our audience for watching\ndefinitely re-watch this stuff over and\n\n483\n00:24:52.627 --> 00:24:55.506\nover and over again until all\nthis concepts and practices and\n\n484\n00:24:55.506 --> 00:24:58.068\nall the things we cover\nbecomes second nature to you.\n\n485\n00:24:58.068 --> 00:25:00.145\nSo that when you sit\nin that testing booth,\n\n486\n00:25:00.145 --> 00:25:04.313\nyou have full confidence in your ability\nto pass that exam, get that certification.\n\n487\n00:25:04.313 --> 00:25:08.483\nThat being said, we do thank you again for\nwatching but signing off for ITProTV.\n\n488\n00:25:08.483 --> 00:25:09.818\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n489\n00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:10.619\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Terry Decker.\n\n490\n00:25:10.619 --> 00:25:12.523\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n491\n00:25:12.523 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:11.162\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:14.510\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.800\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.420\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, and we're\ncontinuing on with sample paper review.\n\n8\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.422\nThis is ITIL planning protection and\noptimization.\n\n9\n00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:25.550\nAnd who's bringing us the information?\n\n10\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.850\nYes it's Terry Decker.\n\n11\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.028\nTerry, hello.\n\n12\n00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:29.380\n&gt;&gt; Hello, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.260\nI'm happy to be here, and as Zach said,\nwe're going to a sample paper review and\n\n14\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190\nit's related to the subject matter\nplanning, protection, and optimization.\n\n15\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.190\nAnd a lot to share with you to help\nyou be more successful in the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.560\nSo, the target audience here\nis definitely exam takers.\n\n17\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.680\nSo let's have a look at the graphic here.\n\n18\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.560\nFirst of all, there's a prerequisite.\n\n19\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.370\nIt'd be very helpful if you\nwatched the little download called\n\n20\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.955\nGeneral Approach to Exam Taking.\n\n21\n00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:56.345\nIt reinforces many of the things and\n\n22\n00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:00.485\ngoes into a bit more detail of many of\nthe things I talk about in this review.\n\n23\n00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:04.845\nAnd also, you should take the sample\npaper, take sample paper one, cuz this\n\n24\n00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:08.427\nis reviewing sample paper one, and that's\njust a better order of our operations.\n\n25\n00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:13.237\nIf you've taken it, then you'll understand\nthe context of my critique of it.\n\n26\n00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:16.457\n&gt;&gt; So, take the sample paper test,\nor exam rather first?\n\n27\n00:01:16.457 --> 00:01:17.152\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n28\n00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:18.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Take it first and\n\n29\n00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:19.497\nthen come to this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:21.905\nSo, if you haven't done that already,\ngo ahead and take a pause,\n\n31\n00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:23.757\ndownload those sample papers.\n\n32\n00:01:23.757 --> 00:01:25.977\nThe sample paper is in three parts.\n\n33\n00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:29.517\nThere's a scenario booklet and\na question booklet.\n\n34\n00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:32.620\nThese mimic what you get on the real exam,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.110\nSo, you go to the question which says\nthis refers to scenario one, let's say.\n\n36\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.120\nSo then, you go read the scenario, and\nthen based on the factors in that scenario\n\n37\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.470\nand the specific question being asked,\nyou evaluate four different answers.\n\n38\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.285\nNow, an additional download is available.\n\n39\n00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:50.290\nIt's the answers and rationale courses.\n\n40\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.610\nYou don't get the answers\nwhen you take the real exam.\n\n41\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo as an extra bonus for\n\n42\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.680\nextra sample paper reviews, you actually\nget the answers and the rationale.\n\n43\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280\nWhich is very good because\nyou get to see the actual\n\n44\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.430\nnuances of the test makers objectives and\nwhat they were trying to test you on.\n\n45\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.900\nYou can learn from that, and\nnot only the subject matter, but\n\n46\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.790\nyou can also learn what's\ninside the test maker's mind.\n\n47\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.040\nAnd, that's why we're\ngoing to be reviewing.\n\n48\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.870\nWhen we go to the sample paper review,\nwe're going to be looking\n\n49\n00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.750\nnot just at the subject matter,\nwe'll look at that a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.850\nWhat we're going to dive into is how\nthis question was structured, and\n\n51\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.220\nhow you can approach for better success.\n\n52\n00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.240\nSo if you haven't done so already, go take\nthat practice exam, sample paper one.\n\n53\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.080\n&gt;&gt; And we'll wait for you.\nWe're gonna wait right here.\n\n54\n00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.192\n&gt;&gt; We'll wait right here.\n\n55\n00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:36.080\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hey, they're back.\n\n56\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n57\n00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.460\nGlad to see that.\n\n58\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.190\nSo, first of all, digging in right away\nto sample paper one, question one.\n\n59\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.270\nNow, as I've mentioned in those general\ntest taking tips, as you're reading\n\n60\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.690\na question, you can discern some\nfluff from some really meaty stuff.\n\n61\n00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.900\nAnd I break those down into three factors,\nthree categories of information.\n\n62\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.180\nFirst, there's the business strategy and\ndirection.\n\n63\n00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.520\nThis is not irrelevant, but\nit's less critical than the other bits.\n\n64\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.010\nIt's just background.\n\n65\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.460\nIt's not just noise.\n\n66\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.240\nAgain, it has some relevance, but\n\n67\n00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.680\nit's not very critical to your\nsuccess on the particular question.\n\n68\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.210\nIt's background.\n\n69\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.275\nSo as you're reading it,\nI'm not saying ignore it, but\n\n70\n00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.655\njust realize it's not the most\ncritical aspect of the question.\n\n71\n00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.531\nAnd then, what I've highlighted in\ngreen here for this particular one, and\n\n72\n00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.925\nby the way, it would be very helpful\nif you had these questions and\n\n73\n00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:29.505\nscenarios in front of you, right?\n\n74\n00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:34.389\nThe green bits, I use that to discern\nthe things that are related to the service\n\n75\n00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.125\nprovider, their current capabilities,\nand their current constraints.\n\n76\n00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:43.664\nThis is setting the stage for how healthy\nis the IT provider, what are they doing\n\n77\n00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:47.882\nthat's good, what are they doing\nthat maybe could be improved, right?\n\n78\n00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:48.990\nIt's showing those.\n\n79\n00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.580\nNow, this could be important because,\nas you're taking these questions,\n\n80\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.600\nif they say that the service provider\nis very strong in X, then you wouldn't\n\n81\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.980\nwant to pick the answer that would have\nyou improve X because the scenario\n\n82\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.860\nis clearly already in play explicitly\nsaying, hey, we're good at this.\n\n83\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.130\n&gt;&gt; So the scenario is very important.\n\n84\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.130\nRead the scenario.\n\n85\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.088\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n86\n00:04:12.088 --> 00:04:16.320\nAnd that's gonna help you kinda get rid\nof the answers that suggest the perfect\n\n87\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.300\nlittle ITL answer that's not really\nrelevant to this particular question.\n\n88\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.300\nSo again, as you're reading, guess,\nor not guess, I mean, look and\n\n89\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.190\nevaluate just how good\nthe service provider already is.\n\n90\n00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.250\nAnd maybe also point to some of\nthe areas that are just ignored, or\n\n91\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.130\nnot necessarily known, right?\n\n92\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.580\nBut there is going to be a specific\nask sometime in this question, or\n\n93\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.710\nin this scenario.\n\n94\n00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.280\nThe specific ask, I highlight in red.\n\n95\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.200\nNow, of course, you don't have the\nadvantage of highlighting the questions\n\n96\n00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.810\nas you're going through, right?\n\n97\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.850\nSo get used to recognizing\nthese in your mind.\n\n98\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.430\nAs you're reading the scenario, divide and\nconquer the scenario into its logical\n\n99\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.400\nbits, the business bits,\nthe IT service provider bits, and\n\n100\n00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.130\nthen the specific deficiencies or\nthe specific actions being requested.\n\n101\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.880\nIn this case, the specific actions\nshow up in the question itself and\n\n102\n00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.730\nwithin this scenario.\n\n103\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.010\nThe question says you are the Central\nTechnology Group, CTG, you're\n\n104\n00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.470\nthe availability manager for CTG and have\nbeen asked to respond to SC's concern.\n\n105\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.640\nWhich one of the following options is the\nbest approach to take in order to respond\n\n106\n00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.360\nto SC's concerns about the premiere\nloan application system?\n\n107\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060\nOkay, so\nthe questions give us some context.\n\n108\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.020\nYou're an availability manager and\nthere's some concerns.\n\n109\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.380\nThe concerns are gonna be in\nthe scenario somewhere, so\n\n110\n00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.870\nbe looking for them because that's what\nyou're gonna have to solve, right?\n\n111\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.280\nAnd as you look at the question itself,\ngo to full screen,\n\n112\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.230\nyou'll see near the bottom\nis the full thing.\n\n113\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.410\nAt the beginning of this month there\nwas a major incident that resulted in\n\n114\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.770\nthe class being unavailable for\nthree hours and 18 minutes.\n\n115\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.450\nTwo weeks later, PLAS performance was\nseverely degraded for five hours and\n\n116\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.820\n45 minutes.\n\n117\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.900\nDuring that time,\nvery slow responses were experienced and\n\n118\n00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.740\nmany of the mortgage requests\nhad to be re-processed.\n\n119\n00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740\nSo there was a business impact.\n\n120\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.530\nYou caused pain.\n\n121\n00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.510\nYou're availability management.\n\n122\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.930\nYou're the IT service provider.\n\n123\n00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.600\nThere was pain caused to the business\ndue to lack of availability and\n\n124\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.820\na lack of speed or performance.\n\n125\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.020\nAnd you're the availability manager.\n\n126\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.373\nSC's business managers has raised concerns\nabout the availability of the PLAS service\n\n127\n00:06:18.373 --> 00:06:19.620\nprovided by your group.\n\n128\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.650\nWhat are you gonna do about that,\navailability manager?\n\n129\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.270\nThat's a very specific question.\n\n130\n00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.800\nWhat are you going to do to\naddress these specific concerns?\n\n131\n00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.130\nSo that's what you're\nevaluating in the questions.\n\n132\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.540\nNow, as you look at this answers,\nas we've done in\n\n133\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.040\nthe general exam taking tips, you're gonna\ndo a compare and contrast among these.\n\n134\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.930\nAnd sometimes you might find\na real easy disqualifier, right?\n\n135\n00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.630\nSometimes you can just look at\nthe first lines of each one and\n\n136\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.590\nfind some distinguishing characteristics.\n\n137\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.280\nAs an example,\nanswer A shows up with Liaise with\n\n138\n00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.150\nCTG's Application Support Team to review\nthe design of the PLAS application and\n\n139\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.420\nestablish a mechanism for measuring\nthe availability of each component.\n\n140\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.990\nNow, this particular scenario didn't\nsay that there was necessarily an issue\n\n141\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.120\nwith measurement,\nit wasn't explicit about that.\n\n142\n00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.890\nSo it could be a nice little\nanswer in a perfect world,\n\n143\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.080\nbut maybe not directly related to this.\n\n144\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.770\nLet's compare that first sentence to\nthe first sentences of the other ones.\n\n145\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.220\nAgain, you're probably going\nto read them in order,\n\n146\n00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.430\nso I'll read them in order as well.\n\n147\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.010\nSo, A is not necessarily wrong,\nI would say at this point.\n\n148\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.890\nBut is it focusing on the right things?\n\n149\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.210\nIs there business involvement?\n\n150\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.000\nIs there customers being\nasked what's going on?\n\n151\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.630\nIs there measurement involved, etc?\n\n152\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.130\nSo now, we're going to B.\n\n153\n00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.160\nAs the two-day guarantee\ntarget has been missed,\n\n154\n00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.130\nyou should recommend an increased target\nof 99.9% availability for PLAS service.\n\n155\n00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.040\nNow, this one is starting off\non a little bit of a wrong foot,\n\n156\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.507\nbecause it's jumping to a solution\nwithout doing some evaluation.\n\n157\n00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:58.403\nIn comparing this to A, at least you're\ngetting some stakeholder involvement.\n\n158\n00:07:58.403 --> 00:08:00.770\nYou're talking to the application team.\n\n159\n00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.186\nSo at least there is some involvement\nabout going and gaining some data.\n\n160\n00:08:04.186 --> 00:08:06.250\nB is jumping to a solution.\n\n161\n00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.060\nThat is a very clear red\nflag of a bad answer\n\n162\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.840\nis it jumps to the answer\nwithout doing some evaluation.\n\n163\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.094\nLet's see as we look at C.\n\n164\n00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:16.372\nAgain, looking just at the first\nsentence of each of those.\n\n165\n00:08:16.372 --> 00:08:18.817\nC says determine the impact\nof the outage and\n\n166\n00:08:18.817 --> 00:08:23.057\nunderstand the availability required\nto satisfy the two-day guarantee.\n\n167\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.500\nNow, this is starting\noff a little bit better.\n\n168\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.030\nObviously, I've already shown\nyou this is the best answer.\n\n169\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.700\nBut let me discern how that is\nstarting off a little bit better.\n\n170\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.640\nIt's focusing on the impact, the\nimplication there being business impact.\n\n171\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.580\nSo the right focus is\nalready being identified.\n\n172\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.374\nBack in answer A, which wasn't necessarily\nwrong, it just said, hey, go to\n\n173\n00:08:46.374 --> 00:08:51.403\nthe application team and see what they\nthink about the design of the application.\n\n174\n00:08:51.403 --> 00:08:54.158\nHow about starting with\nwhat the impact is and\n\n175\n00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:57.215\nthen working your way back from that one,\nright?\n\n176\n00:08:57.215 --> 00:09:01.801\nSo C is starting off a little bit better\nbecause it has the business focus in mind,\n\n177\n00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:02.830\ncustomer focus.\n\n178\n00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.240\nMaybe the golden concepts,\ncustomer value and service.\n\n179\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.176\nThis is focusing on the customer or\nbusiness impacts.\n\n180\n00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:14.097\nAnd then we'll go with D, your with CTG.\n\n181\n00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:17.828\nAnd I just put in highlights here,\nthe customer is missing again, right?\n\n182\n00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:20.141\nYou're missing the customer here, and\n\n183\n00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:23.892\nyour application support team just\nas it did in answer A, right?\n\n184\n00:09:23.892 --> 00:09:26.353\nSo you're missing\nthe customer on this one.\n\n185\n00:09:26.353 --> 00:09:30.548\nC has already started to be a bit better,\ncuz it has this business impact in mind.\n\n186\n00:09:30.548 --> 00:09:31.876\n&gt;&gt; And you should never miss the customer.\n\n187\n00:09:31.876 --> 00:09:34.523\nThat's part of the golden triad,\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n188\n00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:35.516\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n189\n00:09:35.516 --> 00:09:38.900\nThe only exception to that rule\nis that if a scenario is so\n\n190\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.960\nblatantly obvious that\nit's already been covered.\n\n191\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.150\nYou've already covered\nthe customers completely.\n\n192\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.790\nThen your first action could be the next\nsteps, which is after the customer.\n\n193\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.950\nSo unless it's very explicit that you've\ngone back and understood the impact from\n\n194\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.980\nthe customer's prospective completely,\nyou gotta start there.\n\n195\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.620\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n196\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n197\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.260\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n198\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.150\nAll right, Question 2.\n\n199\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.020\nAgain, not going through\nthe rationales and\n\n200\n00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:08.840\nanswers themselves, I'm giving you\napproach to evaluating the answers, right?\n\n201\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.584\nYou can read the rationales and\nanswers for yourself in your downloads, so\n\n202\n00:10:13.584 --> 00:10:16.307\nI'm not gonna rehash that, you can read.\n\n203\n00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:18.228\nAnd if you have questions about that,\n\n204\n00:10:18.228 --> 00:10:21.121\ncertainly bring them forward\nthrough the forum, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:25.070\nSo Question 2, again,\nbreaking them down into business context,\n\n206\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.400\nIT service provider context\nin this specific ask.\n\n207\n00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.860\nIn this case, the ask is within\nthe question and within the scenario.\n\n208\n00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.840\nThe question states you\nare the new IT director.\n\n209\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.780\nYou are convinced that\nimplementation of service design and\n\n210\n00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.460\nprocesses will allow the company's IT\norganization to improve service quality.\n\n211\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.760\nWhile providing better control of costs\nin anticipation of greater pressure\n\n212\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.510\nto keep rates low.\n\n213\n00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.000\nSo you know you gotta keep the cost down,\nand you know you gotta deliver quality.\n\n214\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.853\nAnd you're convinced that service design\nprocesses are gonna help you do that.\n\n215\n00:10:56.853 --> 00:10:58.444\nITIL would love you for\nthat, of course, right?\n\n216\n00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:01.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Management, however,\n\n217\n00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:05.703\ndoubts that the additional cost of service\ndesign processes can be justified.\n\n218\n00:11:05.703 --> 00:11:09.487\nSo you've scheduled a meeting with\nthe management board to present your\n\n219\n00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:10.176\narguments.\n\n220\n00:11:10.176 --> 00:11:11.960\nSo here you are.\n\n221\n00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.860\nYou are an IT director trying to\nconvince business people of your need\n\n222\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.990\nto support the business to\nintroduce service design processes.\n\n223\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.488\nWow, it could be a tough to sell, right?\n\n224\n00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.754\nSo you really need to know your chops.\n\n225\n00:11:29.754 --> 00:11:31.823\nYou need to know, based on this scenario,\n\n226\n00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:35.563\nhow you could solve some of the problems\nthat have been experienced, right?\n\n227\n00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:39.130\nYou'll see some of those and\nhow service design would attack those.\n\n228\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.820\nSo that's what you get amongst the green.\n\n229\n00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.505\nYou determine the current capabilities\nof your IT organization, and\n\n230\n00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:46.886\nyou're the IT director.\n\n231\n00:11:46.886 --> 00:11:50.300\nYou understand your current capabilities\nand your current constraints, right?\n\n232\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.320\nAnd now, you [INAUDIBLE],\nbusiness management has expressed\n\n233\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.580\nfrustration that implementation\nprojects are completed late.\n\n234\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.389\nThey're over budget and\nlacking critical functionality.\n\n235\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.010\nThose three things.\n\n236\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.600\nMaking sure things done on time,\non budget, and\n\n237\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.370\nwith quality is the wheel\nhouse of service design.\n\n238\n00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.302\nThat's what service design does.\n\n239\n00:12:15.302 --> 00:12:20.978\nIt asks the right questions at the right\ntime so that you can appropriately plan,\n\n240\n00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:25.667\nappropriately budget, and\ndeliver In a high quality way, okay?\n\n241\n00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:29.062\nThey also note that the development\nteams are working in isolation.\n\n242\n00:12:29.062 --> 00:12:32.000\nSo you're not bringing them\nalong on the journey and\n\n243\n00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.490\nproduce services which are difficult to\nuse and incompatible with each other.\n\n244\n00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.875\nSo these are design flaws.\n\n245\n00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:42.580\nAnd so I appreciate the IT\ndirector being convinced\n\n246\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.160\nthat doing better design work\nwill solve these problems.\n\n247\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.460\nBut you gotta sell this, right?\n\n248\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.768\nThat's what the question is.\n\n249\n00:12:50.768 --> 00:12:54.708\nHow you're gonna go to the business and\nsay, we need design processes?\n\n250\n00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:57.652\nSo really, so\nthat's the crux of the question.\n\n251\n00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:03.214\nAs a learner, you need to make sure you\nknow what's the value proposition for\n\n252\n00:13:03.214 --> 00:13:06.600\nservice design at a very high level?\n\n253\n00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.750\nNotice this didn't go into the specifics\nof we must have availability management,\n\n254\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.810\nwe must have capacity management,\nwe must have design coordination.\n\n255\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.206\nIt wasn't so specific at a process level.\n\n256\n00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:22.867\nIt was talking about the role of\nservice design holistically, right?\n\n257\n00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.040\nSo you're going to be looking for\na holistic approach.\n\n258\n00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.420\nLet's have a look.\n\n259\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.116\nObviously, they start\noff with the same thing.\n\n260\n00:13:29.116 --> 00:13:32.181\nYour presentation includes the following\nbenefits of service design.\n\n261\n00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:35.729\nA, B, and C starts there.\n\n262\n00:13:35.729 --> 00:13:40.687\nD goes off the bandwagon a little bit,\nnot answering the question, cuz D says,\n\n263\n00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:45.581\nyour presentation includes the following\nbenefits of ITIL at large, right?\n\n264\n00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:49.240\nSo now, we've strayed away from\nthe specifics of the question.\n\n265\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.550\nYou've been asked to convince\nthe business managers\n\n266\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.980\nwhy we should adopt\nservice design processes.\n\n267\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.500\nThat's very specific.\n\n268\n00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.600\nSo don't jump to the ITIL bandwagon in D.\n\n269\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:07.279\nSo D is in this category right now being\nout, not gonna be the five answer, right?\n\n270\n00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:10.038\nAs we look at the first bullet,\n\n271\n00:14:10.038 --> 00:14:15.248\nreduce TCO by ensuring capacity\nmatches business needs.\n\n272\n00:14:15.248 --> 00:14:18.290\nGet very specific now, right?\n\n273\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.530\nIrrelevant to the scenario,\nthe scenario talked about out of budget,\n\n274\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.077\noften late, and\nnot delivering the right functionality.\n\n275\n00:14:26.077 --> 00:14:29.223\nCapacity is not involved in those things,\nright?\n\n276\n00:14:29.223 --> 00:14:31.049\nImproved service alignment by estab.\n\n277\n00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:34.440\nI mean, it's not wrong that capacity\nmanagement does these things.\n\n278\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.520\nIt's just not related to scenario.\n\n279\n00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.320\nThat's why it's in brown here, right?\n\n280\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:45.590\nAs you look at B, it starts to reduce TCO\nby reducing incidents and avoiding rework.\n\n281\n00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.330\nNow, that directly is involved with\nwhat we discerned in the scenario.\n\n282\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.810\nThey talked about when new\nservices are launched,\n\n283\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.400\nthere are a lot of problems with it,\nand there's a lot of service calls.\n\n284\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.770\nThe scenario pointed that out directly.\n\n285\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.380\nSo reducing TCO by reducing\n\n286\n00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.449\nthis disruption is a direct\nlink to the scenario, right?\n\n287\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.060\nContinuing on with the second bullet of A.\n\n288\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.093\nImprove service alignment by establishing\nservice level agreements and\n\n289\n00:15:14.093 --> 00:15:16.378\nservice improvement programs, right?\n\n290\n00:15:16.378 --> 00:15:20.780\nI get that, but we're talking about\nimproving something after the fact and\n\n291\n00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.133\nmeasuring performance after the fact.\n\n292\n00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:24.505\nWe have some problems.\n\n293\n00:15:24.505 --> 00:15:27.521\nNot to test not important in\nservices design, but actually,\n\n294\n00:15:27.521 --> 00:15:30.430\nwe have some issues with\nunderstanding the requirements.\n\n295\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.282\nThere's a mismatch with\nthe development team.\n\n296\n00:15:32.282 --> 00:15:35.248\nThere's a mismatch at delivering\nthe things that aren't satisfying\n\n297\n00:15:35.248 --> 00:15:36.158\nthe business needs.\n\n298\n00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:37.585\nAnd they don't work well with each other.\n\n299\n00:15:37.585 --> 00:15:41.585\nWe're talking about requirements there,\nnot so much agreements, right?\n\n300\n00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:46.155\nUtility versus warranty is what\nthe scenario is pointing to.\n\n301\n00:15:46.155 --> 00:15:51.165\nSLM is gonna be involved more on the\nwarranty side, not on the utility side.\n\n302\n00:15:51.165 --> 00:15:52.451\nThe third bullet of A,\n\n303\n00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:56.808\nimproved IT governance by building\ncontrols into service design, right?\n\n304\n00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:59.899\nThat is a relevant goal of service design,\nbut\n\n305\n00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:03.108\nthat wasn't highlighted\nas a particular gap.\n\n306\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:05.441\nIn the scenario.\n\n307\n00:16:05.441 --> 00:16:10.100\nImprove consistency of services by\nensuring functional design, right?\n\n308\n00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.170\nAgain, pointing directly to the question.\n\n309\n00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.968\nSo the nature of A is every one of these\nstatements is true regarding to the value\n\n310\n00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:18.214\nof service design.\n\n311\n00:16:18.214 --> 00:16:21.400\nIt's just they're not relevant.\n\n312\n00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.640\nNot all these bullets are relevant\nto the specific issues\n\n313\n00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.270\nin this particular scenario.\n\n314\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.750\nThat's a test maker's technique,\nif you will.\n\n315\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.430\nThey will give you a nice\npretty ITIL answer that's\n\n316\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.220\nnot directly related to scenario.\n\n317\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.500\nIt can't be the five answer.\n\n318\n00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.705\nIt's not a bad answer, this is not a five.\n\n319\n00:16:38.705 --> 00:16:39.961\nStraight up, man.\n\n320\n00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:40.523\n&gt;&gt; Not a five.\n\n321\n00:16:40.523 --> 00:16:42.483\n&gt;&gt; And we're seeking out five.\n\n322\n00:16:42.483 --> 00:16:43.312\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we want five.\n\n323\n00:16:43.312 --> 00:16:48.268\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, again, we identified a real\nbad one right away with D because it\n\n324\n00:16:48.268 --> 00:16:53.080\nfocused on the benefits of ITIL at\nlarge instead of the specific ask here.\n\n325\n00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:57.770\nSo D is very suspect, and it continues\nto be bad as it goes down through.\n\n326\n00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.200\nC, on the other hand,\nstarts off at least with a good one.\n\n327\n00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.250\nEase implementation of new services with\nless likelihood of scheduled delays and\n\n328\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:05.990\nbudget overruns.\n\n329\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.500\nThere's nothing wrong with that statement.\n\n330\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.360\nA is perfectly aligned with\nthe principles of surface design and\n\n331\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.150\nperfectly aligned with\nthe issues in this scenario.\n\n332\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.740\nSo it's starting off pretty good.\n\n333\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.520\nBut then I think it runs\noff the rails a little bit.\n\n334\n00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.410\nReduced TCO by minimizing\nstaff on the server's desk.\n\n335\n00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.397\nYou jumped all the way to\nservice operations and\n\n336\n00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:25.295\nstart getting rid of people.\n\n337\n00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.712\nYou have no data to back that up.\n\n338\n00:17:27.712 --> 00:17:33.137\nYou have no data to suggest that the\nstaffing at the service desk is right or\n\n339\n00:17:33.137 --> 00:17:34.700\nwrong, right?\n\n340\n00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.260\nNow, in the future, if you end up reducing\nS and S so much that you only need\n\n341\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.930\nhalf resources at the service desk, then\ncongratulations, but you're not there yet.\n\n342\n00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.748\nAnd there's no data in the scenario\nthat suggests that the service desk is\n\n343\n00:17:47.748 --> 00:17:50.161\nthe crux of the issue-\n&gt;&gt; And without the data,\n\n344\n00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:52.190\nyou're just guessing or whining.\n\n345\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:53.921\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, guessing or\nwhining, exactly right.\n\n346\n00:17:53.921 --> 00:17:59.307\nIt's certainly jumping to an action\nwithout sufficient data, right?\n\n347\n00:17:59.307 --> 00:18:02.910\nAnd then the last bullet, increased\nability to understand what types and\n\n348\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.596\nlevels of service will make\nthe customer successful.\n\n349\n00:18:05.596 --> 00:18:08.872\nCertainly something that\nservice design can do, but\n\n350\n00:18:08.872 --> 00:18:11.502\nthat's not critical to this particular.\n\n351\n00:18:11.502 --> 00:18:12.931\nGetting the requirements right would be,\nright?\n\n352\n00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:16.790\nNot the levels of service but\nthe requirements.\n\n353\n00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:22.220\nAgain, the issues predominating in this\nscenario related to utility, not so\n\n354\n00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.980\nmuch warranty, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.420\nAll right, so\nyou get an idea how to attack a question.\n\n356\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.290\nQuestion 3, again, breaking it down.\n\n357\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.890\nLook how much fluff's in this one,\nat least the way I assess it.\n\n358\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Or background, right?\n\n359\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.120\n&gt;&gt; Background, background stuff.\n\n360\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.240\nThe first several paragraphs are all\nbusiness strategy and direction.\n\n361\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.930\nI'm not saying, again,\nthat it's irrelevant.\n\n362\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.030\nI'm just saying that it's a lot of\nwords that don't necessarily help you\n\n363\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.230\ncritically analyze what's specifically\nbeing asked of you, right?\n\n364\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.840\nGood background.\n\n365\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.730\nNotice the red bits.\n\n366\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.070\nThe red bits are the specific ask.\n\n367\n00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.110\nThe question is a specific ask,\nthe scenario points to them.\n\n368\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.470\nSo the question says you've been asked\nto recommend additional IT service\n\n369\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.720\ncontinuity measures.\n\n370\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.650\nAdditional service continuity measures for\n\n371\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.069\nthe CAD design database and\nstock control system.\n\n372\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.390\nWhich one is the most appropriate\nset of recommendations?\n\n373\n00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:15.550\nSo here we are in PPO,\nplanning, protection, and\n\n374\n00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.560\noptimization, which spends a whole\nlot of time in service design.\n\n375\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.520\nOne of the service design processes\nis IT Service Continuity Management.\n\n376\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.370\nThis is a question about\nIT Service Continuity Management.\n\n377\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.890\nYou've been asked, what are the additional\ncontinuity measures we should bring forth?\n\n378\n00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.406\nAnd then if you look at scenario,\n\n379\n00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:35.830\nthe specific ask shows some of\nthe deficiencies that were recently noted.\n\n380\n00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:40.546\nA recent power outage to the EC South\ncomputer room resulted in the design\n\n381\n00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:45.049\ndatabase and stock control systems\nbeing unavailable for two days.\n\n382\n00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:46.840\nThat's an ouch, two days.\n\n383\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.930\nHow big an ouch?\n\n384\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.450\nAlthough the engineers were able to\noperate to a limited extent using their\n\n385\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:57.150\ndesktop CAD system, this incident caused\nsignificant delays to design work.\n\n386\n00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.440\nThe production line was also interrupted.\n\n387\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.170\nMy goodness.\n\n388\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.770\nYou're affecting income streams now.\n\n389\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:06.960\nThe production line was also interrupted\nas there were no manual processes for\n\n390\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.610\nstock management or for\nordering spare parts.\n\n391\n00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.554\nNow, this is an interesting way to phrase\na very important aspect to IT service\n\n392\n00:20:14.554 --> 00:20:15.286\ncontinuity.\n\n393\n00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:20.657\nIT service continuity has to blend\nwith and coordinate with and\n\n394\n00:20:20.657 --> 00:20:24.619\nsatisfy business continuity needs, right?\n\n395\n00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:28.602\nSo is it IT's business that there\nwere no manual processes for\n\n396\n00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:31.674\nstock management or for\nordering spare parts?\n\n397\n00:20:31.674 --> 00:20:35.540\nShouldn't that be the business\nis business, right?\n\n398\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.040\nSo while IT recognizes,\n\n399\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.900\nthey need to be there to provide the IT\nservices and make sure they're resilient.\n\n400\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.220\nThere needs to be a corresponding buy-in\nfrom the business that they're taking\n\n401\n00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.460\ncare of their side of\nthe continuity question.\n\n402\n00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.370\nIT can be the tail wagging\nthe dog sometimes.\n\n403\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.680\nIT service continuity can help\nbring to light the aspects\n\n404\n00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.379\nof business continuity that the business\nshould be focusing on as well.\n\n405\n00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.635\nSo the interplay between\nIT service continuity and\n\n406\n00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:09.760\nbusiness continuity is being\nsuggested by that very statement.\n\n407\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.721\nAnd again, you're looking for additional\nIT service continuity measures for\n\n408\n00:21:12.721 --> 00:21:13.348\nthe CAD design.\n\n409\n00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:16.846\nAnd then finally,\nyou're going to but failure for\n\n410\n00:21:16.846 --> 00:21:21.235\nany greater link to time will cause\nsignificant operational difficulties.\n\n411\n00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:25.890\nSo basically, we're getting a time frame,\nhow quickly we must respond, so\n\n412\n00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.900\nwe're getting some requirements there.\n\n413\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.512\nOkay, all right, so let's have a look at\nthe questions, then, related to these very\n\n414\n00:21:32.512 --> 00:21:35.741\nspecific issues or the way the answers\naddress these specific issues or not.\n\n415\n00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:39.675\nAnd again, I've done the trouble of\nputting green answers, all the green.\n\n416\n00:21:39.675 --> 00:21:41.748\nWe know D is the right answer,\njust graphically speaking here.\n\n417\n00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:43.420\nBut, how did I get there, right?\n\n418\n00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.770\nAnd how would you get there?\n\n419\n00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.945\nOne good way to get there is kinda compare\nand contrast the bullets as they play out.\n\n420\n00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:52.295\nTypically speaking,\nwhen you're talking about these bullets,\n\n421\n00:21:52.295 --> 00:21:55.910\nit really does give you a very\nexplicit compare and contrast.\n\n422\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.270\nSometimes in the paragraph mode,\n\n423\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:02.420\nit's almost like stream of\nconsciousness kind of responses.\n\n424\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.709\nThey're not quite as easy to pick apart.\n\n425\n00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:08.536\nOne, because they're not\ngraphically bulleted, but\n\n426\n00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:15.010\nthey also tend to flow in a way that\nleads to nuances that aren't obvious.\n\n427\n00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.670\nHere, you're evaluating true false,\nbasically, for each one of the bullets.\n\n428\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:19.830\nIs it directly related?\n\n429\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.700\nIs it not?\n\n430\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.512\nIs it true?\nIs it not, right?\n\n431\n00:22:22.512 --> 00:22:24.650\nThere's both ways of looking at it.\n\n432\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.787\nSo if you look at these first bullet\nstatements going across, you'll see in A,\n\n433\n00:22:28.787 --> 00:22:32.680\ninstall duplicate IT equipment at\nthe EC North site to enable mirroring and\n\n434\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.744\nload balancing between the two sites.\n\n435\n00:22:34.744 --> 00:22:39.819\nSo we're looking for having basically\nthe expense of two different locations.\n\n436\n00:22:39.819 --> 00:22:42.929\nAnd notice what we've done here,\nwe jumped to the conclusion.\n\n437\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.850\nOnce again, we've gone to the answer about\nadditional things without necessarily\n\n438\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.620\na look at the planning piece of it, or\n\n439\n00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.170\nthe strategy part of it, and\nit links up with business.\n\n440\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.810\nSo we jumped to a conclusion.\n\n441\n00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.040\nIt's not necessarily wrong.\n\n442\n00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.236\nIt's jumping too fast, right?\n\n443\n00:23:01.236 --> 00:23:07.455\nB, implement a service recovery plan using\nthe spare computer room at EC North, which\n\n444\n00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:13.520\nalready has the required power, cabling,\nand telecommunications connections.\n\n445\n00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.770\nThis is adding new information.\n\n446\n00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.300\nThis is the red flag.\n\n447\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.694\nWhen an answer to a question adds\ninformation that you could not have\n\n448\n00:23:24.694 --> 00:23:29.395\ndiscerned from the scenario,\nthen it's a big red flag that you're just\n\n449\n00:23:29.395 --> 00:23:33.272\nthrowing more information at you,\ntrying to confuse you.\n\n450\n00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:38.315\nSo in this regard, they're throwing new\ninformation at you, not good, right?\n\n451\n00:23:38.315 --> 00:23:41.867\nIf you look at the first bullet of C,\nimplement recovery for\n\n452\n00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:46.131\nthe designed database and the stock\ncontrol system by taking backups at\n\n453\n00:23:46.131 --> 00:23:49.130\nthe end of each working day and\nstoring off sight.\n\n454\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.482\nWell, that takes cares of\nsome of the redundancy, but\n\n455\n00:23:52.482 --> 00:23:54.716\nit doesn't necessarily address\nhow quickly you can restore.\n\n456\n00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:59.525\nTaking the back up, yeah, but\nwe have a 24-hour turnaround.\n\n457\n00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:03.686\nTaking the back up is gonna\nget our data secured.\n\n458\n00:24:03.686 --> 00:24:05.732\nRight, it's not gonna be\nolder than 24 hours but\n\n459\n00:24:05.732 --> 00:24:07.075\ncan we get it back up and running?\n\n460\n00:24:07.075 --> 00:24:08.820\nYou're not taking care of that one.\n\n461\n00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.188\nAnd D says,\nimplement hot standby facilities.\n\n462\n00:24:11.188 --> 00:24:15.202\nNow a hot stand by,\nready to go, they're on.\n\n463\n00:24:15.202 --> 00:24:17.384\nAll you gotta to do is turn on a switch,\n\n464\n00:24:17.384 --> 00:24:20.740\nthey're ready to go in a spare\naccommodation at EC North.\n\n465\n00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.717\nWhat they wanna do in A is install\nduplicate IT equipment, similar,\n\n466\n00:24:24.717 --> 00:24:25.915\nnot quite the same.\n\n467\n00:24:25.915 --> 00:24:29.156\nLet's look at the second bullets again,\ngoing across,\n\n468\n00:24:29.156 --> 00:24:31.460\nhaving not necessarily ruled out A yet.\n\n469\n00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.267\nYou tell that by my graphical\ntreatment that I have, but\n\n470\n00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:39.090\nI have eliminated B and\nC as the five answers, right?\n\n471\n00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.611\nB just starts off going right\nto the planning stage and\n\n472\n00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:47.708\nbrings in new information that we don't\nget from the scenario, so B's out.\n\n473\n00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:52.071\nNow I'm looking at A and\nC and D in place here.\n\n474\n00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:56.270\nI'm suspect about C because it\ndoesn't talk about recovery.\n\n475\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.962\nIt just talks about having\nthe data backed up, not recovery.\n\n476\n00:24:58.962 --> 00:25:02.042\nI'm not saying it's wrong, but\nnot necessarily relevant to this idea we\n\n477\n00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:05.530\nhave to get back up quickly, okay, that's\nwhat continuity is trying to get done.\n\n478\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.634\nA is also jumping into\nthe upgrade of the network link.\n\n479\n00:25:09.634 --> 00:25:12.870\nWow, let's just go spend a bunch of money.\n\n480\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's just go do that right\n\n481\n00:25:14.086 --> 00:25:14.800\nquick, right?\n\n482\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.294\n&gt;&gt; Sure, why not.\n&gt;&gt; This is bad for a couple of reasons.\n\n483\n00:25:17.294 --> 00:25:21.748\nOne, it's jumping to a conclusion\nwithout sufficient data and\n\n484\n00:25:21.748 --> 00:25:25.470\nsecond, that data was not\nprovided in the scenario.\n\n485\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.094\nSo boom, jumping forward, jumping to\nan action without sufficient analysis of\n\n486\n00:25:30.094 --> 00:25:33.920\ndata, and the data itself was not\neven presented in the scenario.\n\n487\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.900\nSo A is nice fluffy theoretical answer,\nthat's why it's in the brown color here.\n\n488\n00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.212\nTheoretically, maybe okay,\nnot patently wrong but\n\n489\n00:25:42.212 --> 00:25:45.560\nnot specifically relevant\nto this question.\n\n490\n00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.971\nSo, A is gone and B is gone.\n\n491\n00:25:48.971 --> 00:25:51.131\nC is still in play, D is still in play,\n\n492\n00:25:51.131 --> 00:25:53.830\ndistinguishing though\nC is a little suspect.\n\n493\n00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.467\nBecause it never talked\nabout the recovery,\n\n494\n00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:56.680\nat least not in the first bullet.\n\n495\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.790\nDoes it get to the recovery\nin the subsequent bullets?\n\n496\n00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.902\nIt says, negotiate an agreement with a\nthird party to provide a portable computer\n\n497\n00:26:03.902 --> 00:26:07.420\nroom with appropriate IT equipment\nto allow service to be restored for\n\n498\n00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.214\nbackup tapes.\n\n499\n00:26:08.214 --> 00:26:12.630\nWe’re still talking about backup and\nrestore here.\n\n500\n00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.125\nDoes a third party give us speed?\n\n501\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.318\nNot necessarily, in fact,\n\n502\n00:26:19.318 --> 00:26:22.714\nit seems like it's an extra layer\nof something you have to monitor.\n\n503\n00:26:22.714 --> 00:26:28.300\nYou’re complicating your continuity\nlandscape, not simplifying it.\n\n504\n00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.408\nIt's certainly not related to speed,\nnecessarily.\n\n505\n00:26:30.408 --> 00:26:32.880\nThere’s nothing really in there, right?\n\n506\n00:26:34.713 --> 00:26:37.637\nIt says it would reduce the need for\nEC to install and\n\n507\n00:26:37.637 --> 00:26:40.289\nmaintain standby equipment\nat its own sites.\n\n508\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.622\nThat wasn't identified as a specific\nproblem in this scenario.\n\n509\n00:26:44.622 --> 00:26:47.060\nYou’re spending money on the supplier.\n\n510\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.266\nNow maybe, there is a valid reason\nwhy to go to a supplier for\n\n511\n00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:54.327\ncost savings techniques, that wasn't\nthe issue in this scenario at all.\n\n512\n00:26:54.327 --> 00:27:00.157\nSo, now you're introducing nuances\nthat aren't that relevant,\n\n513\n00:27:00.157 --> 00:27:03.851\nnot wrong but not that relevant scenario.\n\n514\n00:27:03.851 --> 00:27:08.905\nFinally we get the time element here,\nensure that this solution can be delivered\n\n515\n00:27:08.905 --> 00:27:13.459\nto EC within 24 hours ready for\nEC to start configuring the equipment.\n\n516\n00:27:13.459 --> 00:27:18.838\nSo we're just asking the supplier to\ndeliver us something to do within\n\n517\n00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:24.871\n24 hours, and our requirement is to be\nrecovered in 24 hours, so C is out.\n\n518\n00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:26.020\n&gt;&gt; Counter intuitive.\n\n519\n00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:31.615\n&gt;&gt; Counter intuitive and I answer\nthe questions, all right, moving on.\n\n520\n00:27:31.615 --> 00:27:36.505\nQuestion four, again blue, green and\nred here, what is the specific asked?\n\n521\n00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:39.004\nThe question says, as the manager\nof information security management.\n\n522\n00:27:39.004 --> 00:27:41.325\nYou are the information security manager.\n\n523\n00:27:41.325 --> 00:27:45.589\nYou want to construct a RACI matrix\nshowing the roles involved in carrying out\n\n524\n00:27:45.589 --> 00:27:46.515\neach activity.\n\n525\n00:27:46.515 --> 00:27:51.255\nAnd categorizing each as preventative,\nreductive,\n\n526\n00:27:51.255 --> 00:27:55.080\ndetective, repressive, or corrective.\n\n527\n00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.822\nNow we learned this in going through PPO\nabout these different measures that you\n\n528\n00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:01.672\ntake in security management.\n\n529\n00:28:01.672 --> 00:28:06.790\nThe types of things that you can do,\nthe categorizations of activities right?\n\n530\n00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.550\nPreventative, reductive, detective,\nrepressive, and corrective.\n\n531\n00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:13.033\nSo one of the things this question is\ndoing is testing your awareness of what\n\n532\n00:28:13.033 --> 00:28:14.185\nthose words mean.\n\n533\n00:28:14.185 --> 00:28:20.148\nClearly, it’s which one of the following\ncharts best represents categorization and\n\n534\n00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:24.407\nrole assignment and then refer to\nthe particular activity number?\n\n535\n00:28:24.407 --> 00:28:29.267\nSo what I've done here, if you look at the\nbottom here, the specific deficiencies or\n\n536\n00:28:29.267 --> 00:28:34.000\nactions are in red, all the other stuff\nif fluff, background information.\n\n537\n00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.789\nBut what we're trying to do according\nto the question is match these\n\n538\n00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:43.169\nsix things at the bottom with\nthe appropriate activity type.\n\n539\n00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:48.118\nPreventative, reductive, detective,\nrepressive, or corrective and\n\n540\n00:28:48.118 --> 00:28:50.480\nassign it to the appropriate role.\n\n541\n00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.186\nSo two things you have to understand,\nof these six things,\n\n542\n00:28:55.186 --> 00:28:59.275\nas you evaluate those six things,\nwhich category do they fall in?\n\n543\n00:28:59.275 --> 00:29:02.091\nAnd then who do you give it to,\nwho's accountable for it,\n\n544\n00:29:02.091 --> 00:29:03.477\nwho's responsible for it?\n\n545\n00:29:03.477 --> 00:29:09.090\nAs we look at the question, those two\nthings are gonna be playing out here.\n\n546\n00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.025\nSo I've done the color coding.\nIf you go to the full screen,\n\n547\n00:29:11.025 --> 00:29:13.180\nI wanna point to the yellow in the bottom.\n\n548\n00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:21.916\nD cannot be the five answer for the simple\nreason that it has two people accountable.\n\n549\n00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:25.240\nThe rule of the RACI, you may recall,\nthere's only one accountable for\n\n550\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.600\nany activity.\n\n551\n00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.640\nThis is violating that rule.\n\n552\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.150\nIt cannot be the five answer,\nif I'm looking for a five answer,\n\n553\n00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.970\nI'm not gonna be considering D.\n\n554\n00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.018\nSo see how, just at a glance now, well\nthis looks like a particularly daunting\n\n555\n00:29:38.018 --> 00:29:40.040\nquestion, there's a lot of data points.\n\n556\n00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.200\nLots of things to look at, my gosh,\n\n557\n00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.109\nI gotta validate 17 lines\non those kind of thing.\n\n558\n00:29:45.109 --> 00:29:49.240\nIf you're looking at the big amount of\ndata, that actually can be a good thing.\n\n559\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.251\nWhen they prevent so\nmany data points, the chances for\n\n560\n00:29:53.251 --> 00:29:57.420\nthem showing you an obviously\nbad ones is more obvious.\n\n561\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.860\nIn this case, it is obvious that D is\nout because there's two accountable.\n\n562\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.520\nSo you can look at a broad stroke.\n\n563\n00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.235\nLook for that when you get RACI matrixes.\n\n564\n00:30:06.235 --> 00:30:08.450\nThat's a very key thing to look at.\n\n565\n00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:15.557\nFollow the rules of RACI matrixes, only\none accountable, at least one responsible.\n\n566\n00:30:15.557 --> 00:30:18.420\nNow of course,\nthis layer get's a little deeper.\n\n567\n00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.380\nObviously we're trying to discern whether\nthe appropriate category is in place.\n\n568\n00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.980\nSo you necessarily need to know what\npreventative means versus detective, etc.\n\n569\n00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.117\nSo let's just go back right quick and\nlook at these six things.\n\n570\n00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.732\nThe event management\nmanager must ensure that\n\n571\n00:30:38.732 --> 00:30:43.514\nintrusion events are detected promptly and\nhandled appropriately.\n\n572\n00:30:43.514 --> 00:30:46.165\nEvent management is a detection technique.\n\n573\n00:30:46.165 --> 00:30:48.060\nIt’s even used as the word detect.\n\n574\n00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.088\nSo I think number 1, we can assume,\nis gonna be detective, so\n\n575\n00:30:55.088 --> 00:30:59.178\nlet's go back to the charts,\nright, you see what I'm saying?\n\n576\n00:30:59.178 --> 00:31:00.540\nSo let's go back to the charts.\n\n577\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.720\nNumber one is detective on three of them,\nall right?\n\n578\n00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.720\nSo A, B, and\nC are still in play, all right.\n\n579\n00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.470\nSo no big magic elixir, but\nwe know they're still in play, right?\n\n580\n00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.220\nThis one's also pretty\nclear on who's responsible.\n\n581\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.080\nThe event manager must ensure.\n\n582\n00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.960\nSo the event management manager,\nlet's look at the chart here, right?\n\n583\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.840\nThe event management manager is here.\n\n584\n00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.515\nEvent management manager is responsible.\n\n585\n00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:32.161\nThat’s looking pretty good,\nthey're responsible there.\n\n586\n00:31:32.161 --> 00:31:37.906\nThey’re responsible, okay, so\nno real magic elixir there either, right.\n\n587\n00:31:37.906 --> 00:31:41.370\nNow what about the process\nowner cuz they're in here too?\n\n588\n00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.110\nEvent management owner is accountable,\nthat is appropriate for event management.\n\n589\n00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.480\nThe manager manages the day to day and\nis responsible for it.\n\n590\n00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.349\nThe owner is accountable,\nso that's another thing.\n\n591\n00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:57.492\nThat's another major concept, or theme,\nI shouldn't say thing, major theme\n\n592\n00:31:57.492 --> 00:32:02.808\nof RACI management is that the owner is\naccountable, the manager is responsible.\n\n593\n00:32:02.808 --> 00:32:05.650\nAnd in this case, for A and C.\n\n594\n00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.995\nThe event management\nowner is accountable for\n\n595\n00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:17.040\nboth A and C, but\nthat didn't happen over here on B.\n\n596\n00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.800\nSo, B is a little suspect now, as the five\nanswer, A and C are still in play.\n\n597\n00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.170\nSo again, you see how I'm just\ntaking a methodical approach,\n\n598\n00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.785\nfirst D's out just because I\ngot this one big concept or\n\n599\n00:32:28.785 --> 00:32:32.490\nthing taken care of about races,\nyou can't have more than one accountable.\n\n600\n00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:38.790\nI got a second elimination because owners\nare accountable, managers are responsible.\n\n601\n00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.360\nSo I could get rid of B.\n\n602\n00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.726\nNow there is an accountable, but\n\n603\n00:32:44.726 --> 00:32:50.230\nthey're putting the accountability\non the information security manager.\n\n604\n00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.312\nThe information security manager is not\naccountable for that management, the event\n\n605\n00:32:54.312 --> 00:32:59.170\nowner is, the event management owner is,\nso that's where that one goes wrong.\n\n606\n00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.040\nSee how that's playing out there?\n\n607\n00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:06.040\nSo again, I've kinda gotten rid of B,\nlet's look at number 2, ops.\n\n608\n00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.205\nSorry about that, number 2.\n\n609\n00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.680\nApplication development must\nensure that all applications\n\n610\n00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.820\naccessing the data are designed for\nmaximum security.\n\n611\n00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.040\nFor instance,\nall data is to be held centrally and\n\n612\n00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.060\nnot stored on laptop or removal disks.\n\n613\n00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:26.486\nAll right, so that particular kind\nof activity is it preventative,\n\n614\n00:33:26.486 --> 00:33:30.799\nreductive, detective,\nrepressive or corrective?\n\n615\n00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:35.840\nIf you take a guess,\nnow obviously you need to know, right?\n\n616\n00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.840\nThat's what this question hopes you do,\nyou know it.\n\n617\n00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.330\nThat's in a category of preventive.\n\n618\n00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.380\nYou're taking some design actions\non a day to day basis, so\n\n619\n00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:48.790\nthis security risk does not ever\nbottle up, it never comes up,\n\n620\n00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.870\nyou're trying to prevent\nit before it happens.\n\n621\n00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.680\nApplication development must ensure\nthat all applications accessing the data\n\n622\n00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.070\nare designed for maximum security.\n\n623\n00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.700\nSo that's a preventative measure.\n\n624\n00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.880\nWell that makes sense.\n\n625\n00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.740\nSo, do we find preventative?\n\n626\n00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.600\nWell, that's also eliminating B, right?\n\n627\n00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.710\nCuz it's repressive.\n\n628\n00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:14.468\nBy the way, what repressive means is if it\nhappens, you can kinda keep a lid on it.\n\n629\n00:34:14.468 --> 00:34:17.078\nYou know you have a issue, right?\n\n630\n00:34:17.078 --> 00:34:22.356\nIf there is a, someone is attempting to,\nTerry Deckers is attempting\n\n631\n00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:29.240\nto log in 50 times simultaneously in three\ndifferent geographic locations, right?\n\n632\n00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.980\nYou have a security [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That would be interesting [LAUGH].\n\n633\n00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.766\n&gt;&gt; So you've detected it,\nnow you gotta repress it.\n\n634\n00:34:34.766 --> 00:34:35.737\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what you do,\n\n635\n00:34:35.737 --> 00:34:38.291\nyou disable Terry Decker's account, right?\n\n636\n00:34:38.291 --> 00:34:40.449\nThat's repressive, right.\n\n637\n00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.440\nYou already have the event happening,\nwhat are you gonna do about it?\n\n638\n00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.356\nThat's the repressive part, detective,\nright, you get the idea there.\n\n639\n00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir.\n\n640\n00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.150\n&gt;&gt; All right, so B's out,\nwe're gonna look at A and C now.\n\n641\n00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:51.686\nSo what can distinguish A and C?\n\n642\n00:34:51.686 --> 00:34:55.730\nNow, here I'm gonna stay with the\ndefinitions to see if I can get something\n\n643\n00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.740\nobvious among the definitions\nthat's wrong.\n\n644\n00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.190\nAgain, I've already color coded them so\nyou'll see where I'm going with this.\n\n645\n00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.330\nBut since I've eliminated B and\neliminated D,\n\n646\n00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.900\nnow I can just focus on two\nseparate answers, A and C,\n\n647\n00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.730\nand they have a lot in common and\nobviously I've already marked this up.\n\n648\n00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.140\nBut even you could take a glance here.\n\n649\n00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.700\nHaving eliminated B and D, where does the\nfirst difference arise between A and C?\n\n650\n00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:25.110\nAnd I see it's at line three, line three\nin answer A, refers to repressive,\n\n651\n00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:28.890\nand line three, in answer C,\nrefers to reductive.\n\n652\n00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:32.690\nSo let's go back and look at what\nline three is telling us about.\n\n653\n00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:37.160\nLine three is talking about application\nmanagement must carry out simulated\n\n654\n00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:43.270\nintrusions on a regular basis to test the\neffectiveness of the security measures.\n\n655\n00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.245\nSo basically we need to know or\n\n656\n00:35:45.245 --> 00:35:49.755\nmake a really good guess whether\nthat's repressive or reductive.\n\n657\n00:35:51.683 --> 00:35:55.595\nGood academic question, cuz that's\nthe question presented to us by the test\n\n658\n00:35:55.595 --> 00:35:59.710\nmaker, do we know the difference\nbetween repressive and reductive.\n\n659\n00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.130\nAt line three is the first difference.\n\n660\n00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.110\nSo, I do happen to know\nthe answer to that, right?\n\n661\n00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.325\n&gt;&gt; Give it to us please,\nwe want to hear it [LAUGH].\n\n662\n00:36:07.325 --> 00:36:11.992\n&gt;&gt; While I may not be, and I'll admit\nto this, not completely solid on what\n\n663\n00:36:11.992 --> 00:36:16.431\nthe major difference between\nrepressive and reductive is, I do know\n\n664\n00:36:16.431 --> 00:36:21.428\nwhat repressive is, and repressive is\nthere when you already have an event.\n\n665\n00:36:21.428 --> 00:36:24.084\nYou already have detected something and\nyou wanna squash it,\n\n666\n00:36:24.084 --> 00:36:25.370\nthat's what repressing is.\n\n667\n00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.365\n[CROSSTALK] There is already evidence,\nit's already evident.\n\n668\n00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:32.364\nSo, I'm very suspect that this activity\nis repressive because it's not\n\n669\n00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:36.169\ntalking about something that already\nhappened and we must put it out,\n\n670\n00:36:36.169 --> 00:36:40.740\nfire it out, it's about doing something\nto make sure that were okay, right.\n\n671\n00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.610\nSo I know it's not repressive,\nI'm not 100% sure it's not reductive, but\n\n672\n00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.086\nI know it's not repressive.\n\n673\n00:36:47.086 --> 00:36:50.230\nSo I'm kinda suspect on answer A now\n\n674\n00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.580\nbecause I do not think that\nactivity is repressive.\n\n675\n00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.730\nNow let's validate it.\n\n676\n00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.610\nMay I say I'm a little squishy on\nthat one, and I'm not 100% solid.\n\n677\n00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.570\nLet's look at another point of difference,\nhappens to be on the next line, and\n\n678\n00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.960\ntalking about accountability.\n\n679\n00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.100\nRight, we have human resources\naccountable for the preventative measure.\n\n680\n00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.050\nIt's still called preventative\ndown here by answer C, but\n\n681\n00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.990\nthe accountability falls with\nthe information security manager, right.\n\n682\n00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.890\nAgain, so for number four,\nlet's go back to make sure.\n\n683\n00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.890\nNumber four is strict access controls\nmust be established to be implemented by\n\n684\n00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:28.930\nthe service desk in collaboration with the\ncompany's human resources organization.\n\n685\n00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.650\nWith collaboration from human resources.\n\n686\n00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.080\nResponsible sounds like service desk,\naccountable sounds like ISM.\n\n687\n00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.990\nLet's again take a look at the data here.\n\n688\n00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:43.167\nWe've got accountable as human resources,\nit's probably not right, and\n\n689\n00:37:43.167 --> 00:37:46.953\njust the bigger theme here,\nwhy would we make the accountability for\n\n690\n00:37:46.953 --> 00:37:49.580\nour information security\nneeds the business?\n\n691\n00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.990\nHR is a business function,\nright, it's a business process.\n\n692\n00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.806\nWe wouldn't make them accountable for\nour information security needs, right.\n\n693\n00:37:57.806 --> 00:38:00.143\nThey're gonna consult with us,\ntell us what they are, but\n\n694\n00:38:00.143 --> 00:38:02.950\nwe're gonna be accountable and\nor responsible for them.\n\n695\n00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.736\nSo, that's kind of a red herring and\nthat's why it gets a little bit of red\n\n696\n00:38:06.736 --> 00:38:11.256\nA there because human resources would not\nbe accountable, in fact, number 4 actually\n\n697\n00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:15.655\nis pretty clear about that, saying strict\naccess controls must be established, and\n\n698\n00:38:15.655 --> 00:38:18.797\nthen later on it says,\ncollaboration with a company's HR.\n\n699\n00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:22.290\nThat's not passing the accountability\nonto them, that's consulting with them.\n\n700\n00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.159\n[CROSSTALK] So it's pretty darn clear.\n\n701\n00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:23.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n702\n00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.360\n&gt;&gt; So again, on the theoretical approach,\nlet us get rid of B and\n\n703\n00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.930\nD fairly quickly, and\nthen we start to look at A and\n\n704\n00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.210\nC that had a lot in common, so\nnow you just gotta manage the delta.\n\n705\n00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.979\nWhat are the differences\nbetween these two?\n\n706\n00:38:35.979 --> 00:38:40.370\nAnd if the first one wasn't a clear bright\nlight, then maybe it is our second clue.\n\n707\n00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.550\nAnd we found a second clue that\nA is a little bit suspect,\n\n708\n00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:46.410\nand there's actually a third one there\non line six whether it's reductive or\n\n709\n00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.390\nrepressive, asking that question again,\nright.\n\n710\n00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:54.100\nSo, let's take a look at that and look how\nthese test reviews, these exam reviews,\n\n711\n00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.500\ncan actually give us a good\nlearning opportunity.\n\n712\n00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.939\nRemember I admitted to\na little bit of ignorance,\n\n713\n00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:02.422\nI'm not exactly sure what a repressive\nactivity would be a reductive or\n\n714\n00:39:02.422 --> 00:39:05.270\nwhat a reductive one would be,\n&gt;&gt; Reductive yeah.\n\n715\n00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.990\n&gt;&gt; So you get the idea there, and\ncertainly get a clear aspect as I look at\n\n716\n00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:14.871\nthe repressive one upon detection of an\nintrusion, I now can go on repressive it.\n\n717\n00:39:14.871 --> 00:39:17.338\nSo, clearly it's a repressive one and\nnot a reductive one.\n\n718\n00:39:17.338 --> 00:39:18.130\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Fair enough.\n\n719\n00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:18.870\n&gt;&gt; But you know what?\n\n720\n00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.708\nWe are running out of time.\n\n721\n00:39:20.708 --> 00:39:23.060\n&gt;&gt; Good call.\n&gt;&gt; But there will be a second episode,\n\n722\n00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:29.390\nof sample paper review ITIL Planning\nProtection and Optimization Part Two.\n\n723\n00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:30.530\nTerry did a great job.\n\n724\n00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.430\nThank you.\n\n725\n00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:34.100\nAnd thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n726\n00:39:34.100 -->

00:00:12.350\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.020\njoining us at ITProTV where we\nhelp you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.010\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.650\nWe continue with sample paper review and\nthis is ITIL Planning protection and\n\n8\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.950\noptimization part two we have had,\nwe have seen part one already.\n\n9\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.230\nThis is part two and\n\n10\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.020\nbringing us the information we need\nis the Sherlock Holmes of ITIL.\n\n11\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.870\nYou know him, you love him.\n\n12\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.727\nTerry Decker right here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:40.308\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr. Watson.\n\n14\n00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:44.240\nAs Zack pointed out we\nhave the second part here.\n\n15\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.410\nWe got to pick up questions\nfive through eight.\n\n16\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.380\nWe did one through four\nin the previous part.\n\n17\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.560\nAnd we wanna continue on with that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.670\nAs we look at the full screen here,\n\n19\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.430\nwe're gonna dive into the question,\nin this case question five.\n\n20\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.980\nAgain, setting the stage here.\n\n21\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.150\nThere's a lot of business strategy and\n\n22\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.760\ndirection being played\nout in the blue text.\n\n23\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.620\nA little bit of context related\nto the service provider here,\n\n24\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.350\nshowing in the green.\n\n25\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.380\nAnd in this case,\n\n26\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.310\nit's talking about of the areas of\nhealth in their IT service work.\n\n27\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.504\nDuring the company's initial period of\nrapid growth little attention was paid to\n\n28\n00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:17.619\nformal capacity planning.\n\n29\n00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.074\nAnd by the way the question is\nasking you as the capacity manager,\n\n30\n00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:26.529\nhow you should address the reduction\nof cost as this organization\n\n31\n00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.950\ngoes through a rapid expansion strategy?\n\n32\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.650\nSo as you look at the big red things,\n\n33\n00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.660\nreduce cost through server\nconsolidation later on.\n\n34\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.540\nIdentify areas for\nadditional savings, right?\n\n35\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.160\nAnd then the final red big,\nthe last sentence.\n\n36\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.690\nThere is significant pressure not to\npurchase more capacity than required.\n\n37\n00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.980\nSo we got our status quo, and\nwe also have a need to move forward.\n\n38\n00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.430\nThis is, kinda, interesting, the dichotomy\nworking out here, save money, save money,\n\n39\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.450\nsave money, and then,\nthe second to the last sentence.\n\n40\n00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.310\nAs a result, service design and\ndevelopment costs, are not an issue.\n\n41\n00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.100\nSo, does this ever happen\nin real life by the way,\n\n42\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.110\nwhere you kind of get conflicting signals?\n\n43\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.490\nGo, go, go, cost, money is not an object,\nbut you better save a bunch of money.\n\n44\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.720\nSo in that regard it might\nbe kind of realistic here.\n\n45\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.510\nSo what they're trying to do,\nthe test maker I should say,\n\n46\n00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.170\nis trying to do here, is described or\n\n47\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.460\ndiscerned how capacity management can\nkind of thread the needle of balance.\n\n48\n00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.170\nBuilding the appropriate capacity not over\nbuilding it, save money so it concerned.\n\n49\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.443\nBut you got some problems to solve\nhere especially if this company\n\n50\n00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:34.880\nanticipates rapid growth.\n\n51\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.700\nAnd therefore the increase in demand.\n\n52\n00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.600\nSo tough question here but it's certainly\nrelated to capacity management.\n\n53\n00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.010\nSo let's have a look at the questions and\n\n54\n00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.428\nstart evaluating\nthe potential answers here.\n\n55\n00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:49.330\nAgain, the question specific ask is you've\nbeen appointed as the capacity manager for\n\n56\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.650\nthis organization, and\n\n57\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.230\nyou've been asked to reduce costs\nthrough server consolidation.\n\n58\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.570\nThat's a very clear ask right?\n\n59\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.450\nWhich one of the following options is\nthe most appropriate way to achieve this?\n\n60\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.310\nSo we're still on reduce cost\nthrough server consolidation.\n\n61\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.980\nRight, so how do you go about this?\n\n62\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.050\nThe classic bolted answers here.\n\n63\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.750\nYou can kinda compare and\ncontrast as you go across.\n\n64\n00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.060\nObviously, again, I've already\nkinda given you the graphical clues\n\n65\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.440\nthat the right answer is B,\nit's all green.\n\n66\n00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.550\nBut let's say you're taking this for\n\n67\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.440\nthe first time, you'll see A starts off\nwith meet with application developers, to\n\n68\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.670\nunderstand how applications use resources\nduring different levels in demand.\n\n69\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.270\nNot terrible answer, but compare that\nto B, which meet with customers.\n\n70\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.580\nRemember that golden rule there when the\ngolden concepts, customer focus versus.\n\n71\n00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.279\nSo, it's already kinda\nraising it here again, right.\n\n72\n00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:44.790\nI'm liking B better than A already\nbecause customers are involved.\n\n73\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.330\nSo to to completely eliminate A,\n\n74\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.696\nI just gotta see if they\nfilled that gap otherwise.\n\n75\n00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:52.868\nHave they engage the business,\notherwise in answer A.\n\n76\n00:03:52.868 --> 00:03:57.629\nIn the second bullet, it says, Identify\noptimum levels for processor memory and\n\n77\n00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.769\ndisk utilization, analyze the current\nlevels of processor memory and\n\n78\n00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.900\ndisk utilization, use these data.\n\n79\n00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.530\nI don't see anything.\n\n80\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.250\nSo, I predict yes.\n\n81\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.610\nWhere are the customers?\n\n82\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.850\nWhere are the users?\n\n83\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.410\nWhere are the forecasts,\nthe future demands?\n\n84\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.450\nYou're looking back at trends and\n\n85\n00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.130\ntrying to plan capacity based on\nthe things you've seen in the past.\n\n86\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.010\nNot asking the business\nwhat's anticipated.\n\n87\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.374\nAnd by the way, the scenario was clear,\nthere's anticipated growth,\n\n88\n00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:27.072\nthere's anticipated increase in demand,\nso you can't just look backwards,\n\n89\n00:04:27.072 --> 00:04:29.911\nyou've got to do some sort of\nforecasting forward, right.\n\n90\n00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.690\nSo A is out, right.\n\n91\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.440\nThink it's not very good and\nactually it's not the reddest one, right.\n\n92\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.940\nThe reddest one is D over there.\n\n93\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.140\nIf you look at D, what's so wrong with D?\n\n94\n00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.980\nStart collecting data on resource\nutilization and create a baseline.\n\n95\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.650\nNot too bad right but that's looking\nbackwards instead of looking forwards.\n\n96\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.970\nIs there anything that's moving forward?\n\n97\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.580\nIs there any conversations\nwith the business?\n\n98\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.560\nVery technical approach, I like the\nmethodology of measurement and baselining\n\n99\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.190\nand that's awesome, but not directly\nrelated to this different scenario, right?\n\n100\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.240\nSo now I got A and D eliminated,\nI'm looking at B and\n\n101\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.139\nC in a comparing address there.\n\n102\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.240\nMeet with customers to\nunderstand their experience.\n\n103\n00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.960\nC says meet with representatives of\nthe business to get their future\n\n104\n00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.700\ntransaction volumes.\n\n105\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.832\nWell I like the future part, right.\n\n106\n00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:24.371\nCustomer representatives, business\nrepresentatives also getting close, right.\n\n107\n00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:28.251\nSo I've kinda given the representatives\na little bit of not so\n\n108\n00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.087\nfundamental as customers.\n\n109\n00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:31.987\nBut let's go ahead and\nmove on not eliminating C.\n\n110\n00:05:31.987 --> 00:05:36.390\nC is pretty darn good but they're only\ntalking about future transactions.\n\n111\n00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.420\nSo we've got to get the right balance if\nwhat capacity do we currently have and\n\n112\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.380\nhow is it working?\n\n113\n00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.586\nDo we have spare capacity that could\nbe brought to the anticipated demand?\n\n114\n00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:49.899\nWe're gonna have to somehow accommodate\nthe past and the future, and\n\n115\n00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.553\ndoing that, that's going to\ngive us the balance we need for\n\n116\n00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:56.426\nthis overarching goal, save money, right?\n\n117\n00:05:56.426 --> 00:05:57.490\nSave money.\n\n118\n00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.940\nSo I like the future focus, but\nthere's not enough back, so\n\n119\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.350\nmy next bullet says,\nanalyze historical transaction.\n\n120\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.290\nSo now we're getting some\nhistory stuff in there.\n\n121\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.311\nSo the primary difference between B and\nC seems to be on whether we're focusing on\n\n122\n00:06:09.311 --> 00:06:12.578\nthe customer by name or\njust business representatives, right.\n\n123\n00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:15.878\nPeople that represent the business,\nare we getting in their business fully or\n\n124\n00:06:15.878 --> 00:06:16.479\nnot, right?\n\n125\n00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.960\nVery subtle there.\n\n126\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.840\nThis would be the kind of question\nI'd complain about, honestly.\n\n127\n00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.490\nI'd say wait a minute,\n\n128\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.320\ntest maker, are you telling me I need to\nknow the nuance between a customer and\n\n129\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.170\na business representative,\nto find the five answer versus the three?\n\n130\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.330\nGive me some more meat on that bone.\n\n131\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.100\nGood news there, if you go to the\nrationale, they'll give you bit more meat\n\n132\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.021\nif you're not satisfied with how\nit taste you'll get a little bit.\n\n133\n00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.197\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Better understanding of what was\n\n134\n00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:44.686\nin the test maker's mind.\n\n135\n00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:48.280\nAnd that's really what's important here.\nLearn something, reinforce something and\n\n136\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.660\nunderstand the approaches\nthe test makers make.\n\n137\n00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.020\nOkay and sometimes honestly they\nkinda err in their ways and\n\n138\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.500\nthat might be just a little\ntoo nuanced for my liking.\n\n139\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.320\nHopefully and very probably you're\nnot gonna face that kind of nuanced\n\n140\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.050\nquestion on the real exams.\n\n141\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.090\nThe practice exams tend to\nhave that a bit more often.\n\n142\n00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.540\n&gt;&gt; Would you think that the term\ncustomer would be a bit of a giveaway?\n\n143\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.907\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, again, what's the difference\nbetween a customer and\n\n144\n00:07:15.907 --> 00:07:17.052\na business representative?\n\n145\n00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:17.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n146\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.780\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes the word business is\nused as a synonym for customer.\n\n147\n00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.704\nSo, if you are representing the business,\n\n148\n00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:25.733\nI'm gonna trust you at this meeting,\nright.\n\n149\n00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:30.740\nSo that is just a bit too\nsubjective again in my view.\n\n150\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.718\n&gt;&gt; It's a bit squishy, it is.\n\n151\n00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:36.820\n&gt;&gt; We need some solidness,\nthat's right solidity all right.\n\n152\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.610\nVery good.\n\n153\n00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.830\nNow moving on to question six,\nagain, what's the specific ask?\n\n154\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.519\nWhat's the business context?\nAnd\n\n155\n00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.157\nwhat's the IT service provider's context?\n\n156\n00:07:44.157 --> 00:07:48.953\nIn this particular case, your IT Service\nManager for the service company you\n\n157\n00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:53.674\nneed to advise the bank of the support\nyou can provide during the emergency,\n\n158\n00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:56.502\nwhat would be the most\nappropriate support?\n\n159\n00:07:56.502 --> 00:08:00.268\nSo what you're trying to provide is you\nare a supplier, your customer is the bank.\n\n160\n00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:02.465\nYou're the IT service provider.\n\n161\n00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:06.570\nHow are you going to manage this\ncustomer's particular needs?\n\n162\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.590\nThis gets really close to\nthe needs related to planning for\n\n163\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:16.580\nsufficient capacity, planning for\nload availability, etc.\n\n164\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.395\nSo what has happened, as you read through\nthe business case here in the blue,\n\n165\n00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:24.037\nyou're discovering that one of\nthe distinguishing characteristics for\n\n166\n00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:26.165\nthis bank is their speed of transactions.\n\n167\n00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:29.570\nAnd they kinda guarantee quick turnaround.\n\n168\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.830\nSo performance is a big part of it.\n\n169\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.200\nThere's also anticipated a lot\nmore demand is coming their way.\n\n170\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.310\nHow are you going to support this\nextraordinary amount of demand\n\n171\n00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:44.860\nthat they think is going to be coming\nwhen your contract is already in play?\n\n172\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.080\nSo basically, the customer's asking\nyou to do something extraordinary.\n\n173\n00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.320\nThey're asking you to do something\nthat's a little bit beyond\n\n174\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.690\nthe terms of your contract.\n\n175\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.800\nWhat do you do as a service provider\nwhen a customer says I want more?\n\n176\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.980\nDo you ask them to get\ntheir checkbook right away?\n\n177\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.560\nDo you try to put a finger\nin the dike right away, and\n\n178\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.170\ntry to shore up the problems?\n\n179\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.220\nHow do you approach it?\n\n180\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.450\nThat's really what this is pointing to.\n\n181\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.280\nIf you wanna have customer.\n\n182\n00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.487\nAnd you also don't wanna throw\nthe baby out with the bath water.\n\n183\n00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:16.677\nMeaning you don't wanna just do\neverything for the customer and\n\n184\n00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:18.221\nnot expect to get payed for it.\n\n185\n00:09:18.221 --> 00:09:21.534\nEspecially if you have\nexpenses that you're gonna\n\n186\n00:09:21.534 --> 00:09:25.730\nhave to incur to satisfy these\nnew urgent requirements.\n\n187\n00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.890\nThat's how this one is playing out.\n\n188\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.010\nSo as we look at the questions then,\n\n189\n00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.770\nwe need to find this balance of\ngovernance of actually of good fences and\n\n190\n00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:40.510\nneighbors, good contractual relationships,\nas well as good customer service.\n\n191\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.090\nAnd sometimes they seem at\nconflict with each other.\n\n192\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.920\nIf the customer says jump, It's not in\nyour best interest just to say how high.\n\n193\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.420\nYou need to understand how high.\n\n194\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.135\nBut you also need to say how much.\n\n195\n00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:53.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Another good point there.\n\n196\n00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.360\nI mean, after all, you are a service\nprovider trying to provide good service.\n\n197\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.290\nBut you also have a business\nrelationship with this customer as well,\n\n198\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.900\nmeaning for profit.\n\n199\n00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.120\nSo as you look at the examples here and\nsee how these things play out, again,\n\n200\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.480\nit's kinda obvious which one is\nthe complete right answer, at this point,\n\n201\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.080\ncuz I've highlighted it in green.\n\n202\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.010\nBut, if you look at\nthe first few sentences,\n\n203\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.900\nas we all have done in the past,\nanswer A says,\n\n204\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.140\nthe service company will make its best\neffort to process the additional workload.\n\n205\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.957\nBut the bank will need to accept\nthe capacity is constrained.\n\n206\n00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.029\nAnd it will, therefore, take longer\nto process the loan applications.\n\n207\n00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:33.480\nThe scenario said very specifically\nthat we must satisfy at the same rate.\n\n208\n00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.190\nIt's a business strategic goal for\n\n209\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.070\ntheirs, they do not wanna lose\nthat competitive advantage.\n\n210\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.620\nIn a very competitive environment what\ndistinguishes them is their speed.\n\n211\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.810\nAnd if you're losing on the speed piece\nof it, the competition's gonna take over.\n\n212\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.068\nThat's the business reality\nas plays out in a scenario.\n\n213\n00:10:49.068 --> 00:10:52.465\nSo saying, you're just kind of have\nto live with the slower speeds,\n\n214\n00:10:52.465 --> 00:10:55.790\nis not really satisfying\nwhat the customer needed.\n\n215\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.050\nYou're basically saying,\nit's not nice being you.\n\n216\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Nice being you.\n\n217\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.938\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n218\n00:11:05.654 --> 00:11:09.492\nSo then as we go to B I see\nI got an errant H there.\n\n219\n00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:14.270\nGot moved from here from the however,\nbut well, that's level detail.\n\n220\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.833\nThere is sufficient capacity for\n\n221\n00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:20.340\nload applications if the 30% redundancy\nis applied to normal processing.\n\n222\n00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.220\nHowever, due to the importance of\na nightly regulatory reporting,\n\n223\n00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.260\nuse of resources for\n\n224\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.260\nloan application processing must be\nkept to an absolute minimum at night.\n\n225\n00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.940\nSo here you're telling the customer you\n\n226\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.630\ndon't have 24 hour loan\nprocessing anymore.\n\n227\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.430\nOne of your competitive advantages\nis that you're always open,\n\n228\n00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.770\nalways doing these things and\nresponding quickly.\n\n229\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.230\nYou're basically telling the customer,\nsorry you're not gonna have that anymore.\n\n230\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.390\nA key distinguishing characteristic of\nthis customer is unable to be fulfilled.\n\n231\n00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.660\nAnd you're basically just writing it off.\n\n232\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.050\nYou're not satisfying\nthe customer's request in any way.\n\n233\n00:11:55.308 --> 00:11:58.310\nNow, this is a reality here that you're\ngonna have to invest something in your own\n\n234\n00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.870\ncapacity somehow.\n\n235\n00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:04.100\nSo C and D are talking about investing\nin your capacity as a service provider\n\n236\n00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.780\nto shore up this temporary issue.\n\n237\n00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.790\nIt's not supposed to last forever.\n\n238\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.570\nAnd plus your contract's coming up for\nrenewal soon too.\n\n239\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.470\nSo how do you play those out?\n\n240\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.500\nGetting close is C.\n\n241\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:20.020\nIt says the service company, you,\nwill need to acquire additional capacity,\n\n242\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.230\nthat's true,\nto meet the extraordinary demand.\n\n243\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.350\nD recognizes that as well.\n\n244\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.520\nThere's not enough capacity\nto process additional volume.\n\n245\n00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.540\nUse of the redundancy will\npartially fill the gap.\n\n246\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.070\nBut, additional resources\nneed to be leased.\n\n247\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.690\nSo, at least C and\nD recognize that as a service provider,\n\n248\n00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.030\nyou currently cannot satisfy\nthe customer's needs.\n\n249\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.570\nA and B say,\nit's tough to be you, customer.\n\n250\n00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.510\nC and D are saying, well I recognize it.\n\n251\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.060\nWhat are we gonna do about it?\n\n252\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.700\nAnd now we are going to see the\ndistinguishing characters between C and D.\n\n253\n00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.446\nWe recognize additional capacity is\nrequired by us as a service provider.\n\n254\n00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:57.780\nHow are we going to mange\nthis with the customer?\n\n255\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.580\nAnd here you have a clear departure\nin approaches between C and D.\n\n256\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.640\nC eventually says go ahead and do it, and\n\n257\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.900\nsee if you can negotiate back fill pay for\nwhat you've done in the renegotiation.\n\n258\n00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.260\nI'm not really a business expert, but\n\n259\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.020\nI think if you give something away now,\nyou can't ask for payment later.\n\n260\n00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.970\nIt's gonna be one of those things you have\nto kinda contractually build into things.\n\n261\n00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.010\nSo do that, and somehow build that in,\nand that's what D is trying to do.\n\n262\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.670\nAfter this gap, such equipment should be\nsufficient to accommodate the additional\n\n263\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.720\ntransaction, I'm just reading D.\n\n264\n00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.060\nWith the additional resources all\nreporting can be accomplished in\n\n265\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.880\nthe time available.\n\n266\n00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.980\nAs the additional capacity\nwill be more expensive,\n\n267\n00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.060\nthe service company will\nnegotiate a high rate for volumes,\n\n268\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.530\nmeaning now,\nbeyond those stipulated in the contract.\n\n269\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.030\nSo in other words, they're going to get a\nlittle side line agreement saying this is\n\n270\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.040\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n271\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.744\nHere's what it's gonna cost.\n\n272\n00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:55.695\nYou're not waiting for a contract renewal,\n\n273\n00:13:55.695 --> 00:14:00.440\nyou are building that into the good\nfences and good neighbors right now.\n\n274\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then therefore,\nthe customer value service is met.\n\n275\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.045\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n276\n00:14:07.045 --> 00:14:08.180\nAbsolutely.\n\n277\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.800\nAnd you're solving this particular problem\nrelated to this particular scenario\n\n278\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, question seven.\n\n279\n00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.940\nThis specific ask again\nshowing up in red here.\n\n280\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.440\nAs the IT service manager you must assign\nprocess management responsibilities for\n\n281\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.070\ncapacity management,\navailability management,\n\n282\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.600\ninformation security management,\nand IT security management.\n\n283\n00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.290\nThat's the ask.\n\n284\n00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:35.830\nSo we're basically looking at assigning\nroles to people with various skills.\n\n285\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.070\nAnd what's the best way to do that?\n\n286\n00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.410\nThe green bits here are describing\nthe context and the IT service rider.\n\n287\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.050\nAnd I'd say that really this table\n\n288\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.770\nbecomes the key data factor\nof what you need to deliver.\n\n289\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.830\nYou're gonna be evaluating these current\ncapabilities among these three people,\n\n290\n00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.510\nA, B and C.\n\n291\n00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.730\nAnd, it says very specifically that\nyou need to assign these tasks of\n\n292\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.120\navailability, capacity,\ninformation security, and\n\n293\n00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.540\nIT service continuity to only two of them.\n\n294\n00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.130\nSo, among these three people,\nsomeone is gonna be let go.\n\n295\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.810\nAnd two of them are going to be remaining\nto handle those four warranty processes.\n\n296\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.110\nThat's how it's setting up,\nhow do you go about doing this.\n\n297\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.645\nNow the way I approached this one,\nas you go to the full screen,\n\n298\n00:15:21.645 --> 00:15:23.332\nI'll look at the table here.\n\n299\n00:15:23.332 --> 00:15:26.985\nThe table shows some points of difference.\n\n300\n00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:30.909\nLike if you look at column A referring\nto knowledge of technology,\n\n301\n00:15:30.909 --> 00:15:35.630\nthey are rated on a 100 point scale,\nand they are all in the 90 percentile.\n\n302\n00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.710\nThe lowest ranking one is 90.\n\n303\n00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.000\nThat's pretty darn good.\n\n304\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.170\nSo as I'm looking at this table,\nI was gonna start looking for\n\n305\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.915\nbig wide variations to distinguish people.\n\n306\n00:15:46.915 --> 00:15:53.465\nAnd I found that person C is weak\nin ability to work in a team,\n\n307\n00:15:53.465 --> 00:15:57.664\nquite a bit weaker, a rating of 73.\n\n308\n00:15:57.664 --> 00:16:02.164\nNow I'm not even equating how this person\nmight apply for a particular role.\n\n309\n00:16:02.164 --> 00:16:06.093\nI'm just looking at a comparison\nrate that's an egregious difference.\n\n310\n00:16:06.093 --> 00:16:13.620\nA little bit more egregious is person A\nnot really got for ability to assess risk.\n\n311\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.500\nYou see that in the third column.\n\n312\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.370\nAnd then as I move over to analytical\nskills again person C is the weakest and\n\n313\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.610\nbelow the 90 percentile.\n\n314\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.770\nAnd I could also find that true for\n\n315\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.790\nunderstanding of business requirements and\ncommunication skills.\n\n316\n00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:36.980\nSo just in comparison before I try to\nmatch up the particular skill sets with\n\n317\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.950\na particular process, I can see that\ncandidate C is probably the weakest.\n\n318\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:49.450\nBecause of the egregious differences\nperson C has the most examples.\n\n319\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.090\nRight, you follow that?\n\n320\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.430\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm thinking C is gonna be out.\n\n321\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.920\nDo I have any answers\nthat tell me C is out?\n\n322\n00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.900\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Then I take a look at them.\n\n323\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I see that answer A says C is out,\n\n324\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.760\nnot required.\n\n325\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.320\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; Answer B also says C is out,\n\n326\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.830\nnot required.\n\n327\n00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:14.050\nSo a little bit of difference between C\nand D regarding that particular factoid.\n\n328\n00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.880\nI'm calling it a factoid that C is\nprobably the candidate to be out.\n\n329\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.080\nBecause they're the weakest on\nmore disciplines, all right.\n\n330\n00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.430\nPretty logical approach.\n\n331\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.130\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n332\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.990\n&gt;&gt; In my assessment.\n\n333\n00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.020\nAll right, so A and B are in, for now.\n\n334\n00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.140\nC and D are out.\n\n335\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.830\nSo now, I just gotta look at A and\n\n336\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.850\nB to see if I can find some\nvery nuanced things there.\n\n337\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.270\nAnd I'm only highlighting\nthe differences here.\n\n338\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.300\nYou see the capacity\nmanagement goes to person A.\n\n339\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.090\nAnd person A happens to be has\na high knowledge of technology,\n\n340\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.920\nwhich is very important for\ncapacity management.\n\n341\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.500\nAbility to work on a team is kinda weak.\n\n342\n00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.510\nBut not as critical for\ncapacity management.\n\n343\n00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.050\nPut them in a dungeon, feed them every\nnow and then, capacity manager is ready.\n\n344\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.800\nAll right,\nability to assess risk however, right?\n\n345\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.450\nAbility to assess risk, I'm sorry not\nhowever, ability to assess risk is not\n\n346\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.530\ncritical, it is a weak point but\nin capacity management you're not dealing\n\n347\n00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.540\nwith risk management nearly as much as\nyou are In the other three disciplines.\n\n348\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.470\nContinuity management and\n\n349\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.710\nsecurity management have\nrisk at their central focus.\n\n350\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.280\nAvailability management also\nhas risk as a central focus.\n\n351\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.040\nSo among the four processes,\n\n352\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.720\nrisk assessment is the least important for\ncapacity management.\n\n353\n00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.690\nAnd besides A and B agree on that one.\n\n354\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.890\nA and B agree on capacity management for\n\n355\n00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.100\nperson A so\nit's not a point of difference.\n\n356\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.490\nSo accepting that.\n\n357\n00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.050\nNow for availability I've kind of\nalready answered this question here for\n\n358\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.110\navailability it's going to person B.\n\n359\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.730\nIn answer A and answer B\navailability is going to person A.\n\n360\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.120\nBecause person A is pretty weak on risk\nmanagement, it's gonna be hard for\n\n361\n00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.800\nme to make that a strong case for\nperson A.\n\n362\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.330\nThey need a strong risk\nmanagement discipline so\n\n363\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.070\nI'm kinda suspect about that difference.\n\n364\n00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.600\nOn the other Topics,\nA and B are identical.\n\n365\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.580\nSo, I got one suspicious one, and\n\n366\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.970\nB I got no suspicious of A,\nA is looking pretty good.\n\n367\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.560\nNow, again, this is all based on\n\n368\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.670\nmy initial approach of\ngetting rid of candidate C.\n\n369\n00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.360\nCan we verify that that\nis actually a good idea,\n\n370\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.710\nI mean what could person\nC actually be given?\n\n371\n00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.200\nGiven these skill sets?\n\n372\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.060\nIn the having weakness in ability to work\non a team is a weakness always, right?\n\n373\n00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.400\nYou gotta be able to\nwork with other groups,\n\n374\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.640\nyou gotta be able to integrate\nwith other processes,\n\n375\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.750\nworking on team's essential skill.\n\n376\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.990\nAlready pretty weak there, right?\n\n377\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.980\nAnalytical skills.\n\n378\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.010\nIn the absence of analytical skills it's\ngonna be hard for you to do capacity,\n\n379\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.850\navailability, continuity or\nsecurity analysis is required.\n\n380\n00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.970\nSo that's also a pretty stark weakness,\nright.\n\n381\n00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.430\nUnderstanding the business requirements,\nagain, fundamental\n\n382\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.980\nto all these processes is to understand\nwhat the business is trying to do.\n\n383\n00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.160\nIf you can't translate business\nrequirements into your\n\n384\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.190\nwarranty requirements, you're gonna\nbe coming up short pretty often.\n\n385\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.760\nSo as I look at candidate C as relates\nto these very specific, not just\n\n386\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.675\ncomparing them to other candidates but\nthese very specific processes.\n\n387\n00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:22.620\nIn that there's already strengths\nin these other candidates.\n\n388\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.030\nAgain, I can quickly\nvalidate that C needs to go.\n\n389\n00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:26.660\nRight.\n\n390\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.150\nHe's not a great candidate.\n\n391\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:33.030\nSo again, validating that C and D Are not\nthe ultimate answers all I have to\n\n392\n00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.990\ndo between A and B is find the suspicious\none and the only difference on one and\n\n393\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.820\nthe most suspicious is risk management.\n\n394\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.580\nBreak it down.\n\n395\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:47.165\n&gt;&gt; That is why I call you\nthe Sherlock Holmes right till.\n\n396\n00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:48.975\nIt's gonna stick, you know.\n\n397\n00:20:48.975 --> 00:20:53.085\n&gt;&gt; Now again, it's easy for\nme to say, cuz I mean, obviously,\n\n398\n00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.165\nI've seen these sample papers.\n\n399\n00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:56.090\nI've studied them,\nI know how to go through this.\n\n400\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.190\nIt's a lot harder to do this\nin a live test environment.\n\n401\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.100\nBut you're bringing knowledge and\nyou're also bringing some common sense and\n\n402\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.470\ntaking a knowledgeable and common sense\napproach to parsing out the questions and\n\n403\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.295\nparsing out the answers\nin a methodical way.\n\n404\n00:21:10.295 --> 00:21:13.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It just makes this a lot quicker.\n\n405\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.950\nAnd finally with question eight here.\n\n406\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:20.490\nAgain one of the strategies of test\ntaking is to separate the not so\n\n407\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.940\nimportant information from the important\ninformation and in this case the blue text\n\n408\n00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.970\nrepresenting the business context\nis not irrelevant but not critical.\n\n409\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.989\nYou're gonna get to the specific ask,\nthe specific deficiencies.\n\n410\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.690\nIn this case, you are the senior IT\nmanager for the company APC, and\n\n411\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.460\nyou have the responsibility for\n\n412\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.860\nensuring successful integration\nof this service called FinDocs.\n\n413\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.710\nOrganization and service, which one of\nthe following options is the best approach\n\n414\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.470\ntoward a successful integration?\n\n415\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:56.140\nSo we're looking at the integration\nacross multiple processes, and\n\n416\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.460\nhow to integrate these\nvarious separate companies.\n\n417\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.500\nWe had FinDoc was the organization used to\n\n418\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:10.720\nfinancial reporting in which required and\nthe portability and regulatory compliance.\n\n419\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.540\nThis is a publishing company that used\nto be involve just in text books and\n\n420\n00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.070\ntechnical documentation.\n\n421\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.950\nSo, the regulatory grind or the regulatory\nrequirement s was it nearly as stringent.\n\n422\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:23.380\nFor the old company, it is for\n\n423\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.210\nthis combined company without\ndoing financial documentation.\n\n424\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.430\nAll right so\n\n425\n00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:32.030\na surprise to this organization was my\nthis financial reporting is harder.\n\n426\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.440\nBecause of all those regulatory\ncompliance issues and\n\n427\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.740\nthat you have to have your ducks in a row.\n\n428\n00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.690\nAn error in a technical publication\nis not nearly as important\n\n429\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.510\nas an error in a financial publication,\nyou could get fined.\n\n430\n00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.480\nFor false reporting, or\nshowing lack of control.\n\n431\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.220\nSo that's the nature of this beast.\n\n432\n00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.260\nHow are we going to integrate more\ndiscipline processes in our IT\n\n433\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.460\ndata management,\nsecurity management regime, as\n\n434\n00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.820\nrelates to these new requirements that the\nfinancial reporting is brining into it?\n\n435\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.220\nSo again, looking at the answers,\na compare and\n\n436\n00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.130\ncontrast can help you out again, right?\n\n437\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.800\nYou should meet with FinDoc's management\nto gain their full support for\n\n438\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.298\nservice management processes.\n\n439\n00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:15.780\nNow notice in In contrast\nto these other statements.\n\n440\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.030\nThe first statement in B.\n\n441\n00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.430\nThe most important action you should take\nis to conduct an awareness campaign to\n\n442\n00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:28.330\nensure that FinDoc's management is fully\ninformed of the APC's IT strategy.\n\n443\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.680\nSo this is the tail wagging of the dog.\n\n444\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.670\nIT is going to tell the business\nwhat their strategy is,\n\n445\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.730\nwhat IT strategy Supposed\nto be the other way around.\n\n446\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.560\nThe business tells IT what the business\nstrategy is and IT responds.\n\n447\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.760\nIt's not that IT goes and tells\nthe business what they should be doing.\n\n448\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.900\nSo B is very suspect.\n\n449\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.850\nAnd then you look at C,\n\n450\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.350\nit's important that you should\nmeet with FinDoc's management.\n\n451\n00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.691\nI like starting off there,\nyou're going to the management, right?\n\n452\n00:23:52.691 --> 00:23:57.163\nTo gain their full support for\ncapacity Security, availability and\n\n453\n00:23:57.163 --> 00:23:58.867\ncontinuity management.\n\n454\n00:23:58.867 --> 00:24:01.410\nWe're talking about warranty here right?\n\n455\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:07.440\nAnd all we did in questions A was keep it\nquite broad, service management processes.\n\n456\n00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.560\nAnswer C is a little bit better, and\nit's describing warranty processes.\n\n457\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.327\nBut the only one that's really\na major concern here is security,\n\n458\n00:24:15.327 --> 00:24:17.734\nright, not all the warranty processes.\n\n459\n00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:20.755\nSo that's why I got security\nprocess in green there,\n\n460\n00:24:20.755 --> 00:24:23.660\nbecause that's the good nugget to chew on.\n\n461\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.580\nThose other ones,\n\n462\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.460\nthe other wonky processes,\nweren't directly related to this scenario,\n\n463\n00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.170\nwhere all the issues were related to\nsecurity and breaches there of, all right.\n\n464\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.340\nSo if you look at D, you'll see that it\nfocuses on security as it's supposed to.\n\n465\n00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.710\nThat's where the train went off the tracks\nin this scenario, that's the train you\n\n466\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.035\ngotta put on the track, so security train,\nnot continuity, not availability.\n\n467\n00:24:46.035 --> 00:24:51.840\nSo answer the question,\nspecified in the scenario.\n\n468\n00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.430\nSolve the problem\nspecified in the scenario.\n\n469\n00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.960\nDon't go paint a big picture of\nthe entire IT service management regime.\n\n470\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.790\nAnother theme there.\n\n471\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.860\nAnswer the question,\ndon't solve the problem.\n\n472\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.720\nDon't think beyond it.\n\n473\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.180\n&gt;&gt; It's action as opposed to just theory.\n\n474\n00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n475\n00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.191\nAnd it's action related to the scenario.\n\n476\n00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:11.705\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; Not to some ITIL pipe dream,\n\n477\n00:25:11.705 --> 00:25:13.110\nexactly right.\n\n478\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.470\nSo, that's all your questions,\nit's the way it adds up across those.\n\n479\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.630\nHopefully, you've found that helpful.\n\n480\n00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.610\nJust a couple more things\nto follow up on then.\n\n481\n00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.780\nThis is not the end of your study, I mean,\nI hope you took sample paper one, and\n\n482\n00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.210\nyou came and did this review.\n\n483\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.320\nThere's another sample paper out there for\nyou, sample paper two.\n\n484\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.100\nAnother valuable eight questions, that\nwill not only give you a chance to learn\n\n485\n00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.400\nsubject matter, it'll give you a chance\nto reinforce the things you already know.\n\n486\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.210\nAnd more importantly, it will actually\nget you into the mind of the test maker.\n\n487\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:46.670\nAnd give you practice on parsing\nthrough the various questions,\n\n488\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.680\nscenarios, and\nanswers in a very methodical way.\n\n489\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.216\nAnd when you think you're ready, as you\nlook at the graphic here, when you think\n\n490\n00:25:53.216 --> 00:25:57.340\nyou're ready, you can purchase your exam\nat PassionITGroup, your voucher, that is.\n\n491\n00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.770\nAnd then you can schedule that exam as\nyou wish, at a time of your choosing.\n\n492\n00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.030\nI wish you very much luck.\n\n493\n00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.620\nIf you have any questions at all,\nany challenges you're facing,\n\n494\n00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.100\nplease reach out to the forum for\ndiscussions.\n\n495\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.150\nInteract with the experts there, and among\nyour peers, to get the right answers.\n\n496\n00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as usual, Terry.\n\n497\n00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.250\nAnd thank you for joining us on\nthe ITIL Island Sample paper review, ITIL,\n\n498\n00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.820\nplanning, protection,
