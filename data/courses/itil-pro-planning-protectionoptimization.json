Well, PPO, Planning Protection &amp;\nOptimization is one of the capability\n\n7\n00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:26.036\nmodules designed by the ITIL\naccredited curriculum and\n\n8\n00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:28.090\nit focuses on five processes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.480\nCapacity management, availability\nmanagement, continuity management,\n\n10\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.190\nsecurity management and demand management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.060\nThose five processes, four of them\nthat is, come from service design,\n\n12\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.140\none of them comes from service strategy.\n\n13\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.520\nAnd it looks at those in a combined way;\nhow they interact with each other, and\n\n14\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.110\ndives deep into the specific\nactivities of each of those processes.\n\n15\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.620\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, now,\n\n16\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.975\ncould you give us an idea of who the\nintended audience for this exam would be?\n\n17\n00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.295\nWell, one, yeah, one key audience\nmember is going to be someone\n\n18\n00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:02.125\nperhaps on the path of getting\ntheir ITIL expert credential.\n\n19\n00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.835\nThis is a capability module,\nit's worth four credits, so\n\n20\n00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:09.175\nif you pass that exam you get four credits\ntoward the collection of credits you need\n\n21\n00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:13.355\nto sit the Capstone exam which is called,\nManaging Across the Life Cycles.\n\n22\n00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.500\nSo four credits await with successful\ncompletion of the exam and\n\n23\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.650\noperationally speaking, the audience\nis gonna be those that are involved in\n\n24\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.530\nstrategic and design activities for\nthe IT service organization.\n\n25\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.440\nSo demand management\nplays out in strategy,\n\n26\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.470\nthe other four play out in design as\nrelates to planning, protection and\n\n27\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.980\noptimization, you really are trying\nto build effective services\n\n28\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.230\nthat are resilient to change, and\nare capable of growing with the business.\n\n29\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.002\nSo business focus, service designed\nactivities is the primary focus of PPO.\n\n30\n00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:49.392\n&gt;&gt; Excellent, and now we have an idea\nof who might be watching this.\n\n31\n00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:52.670\nObviously, there's exam takes\nwho are part of that group.\n\n32\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.130\nWhen it comes to the exams, could you\ngive us an idea of what is like to\n\n33\n00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.120\nget registered or just what it's\ngonna be like to take the exam.\n\n34\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm here, I represent PassionIT\nGroup which is a portal passionitgroup.com\n\n35\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.490\nyou can go there and get information\nabout exams at a very specific level,\n\n36\n00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.000\nyou can order your exam vouchers there at\na discount and through PassionIT Group,\n\n37\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.780\nyou also get access to other\nresources like course materials.\n\n38\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.370\nAs you sign up for this course,\nas you're taking the curriculum,\n\n39\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.630\nthere is a wealth of information\nin a zip file that has exam prep,\n\n40\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.690\nactivities, knowledge check activities,\nas well as specific instructions for\n\n41\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.930\nhow you get those vouchers ordered and\nhow you get your exam scheduled.\n\n42\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.290\nThe exam itself is a little bit different\nthan the foundation exam If you've\n\n43\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.770\nhad an intermediate Excel book exam\nbefore you'll find it very similar.\n\n44\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.230\nThey're scenario based questions,\nonly eight of them, and\n\n45\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.930\nthey're gradient scoring, meaning that one\nanswer will give you five points of value.\n\n46\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.690\nAnother answer will give you three,\nother answers will give you less, right?\n\n47\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.590\nSo you've got to pick a better answer.\n\n48\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.150\nYou're analyzing things.\n\n49\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.350\nSo these intermediate level\nexams are not rote memorization,\n\n50\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.620\nthey are taking knowledge and applying it,\nwhich make it pretty fun actually.\n\n51\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.470\n&gt;&gt; Very, very cool.\n\n52\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.809\nWell Terry, we do thank you for\nthat information and\n\n53\n00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.309\nif that sounds like something\nthat might interest you,\n\n54\n00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.722\nwe look forward to seeing\nyou in the up coming series.\n\n55\n00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.284\n[SOUND]\n\n",
