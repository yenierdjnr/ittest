  "description": "The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was created to help businesses manage their IT operations more efficiently and reliably. The ITIL framework provides a collection of practices that businesses can choose to adopt that focus on aligning IT operations with the goals of the business. These practices range from creating new service offerings to day-to-day operations and managing incidents. Many organizations choose to follow ITIL because it prevents them from having to \"reinvent the wheel\" when it comes to IT processes and operations. The ITIL Foundations certification is designed to introduce the candidate to the general processes in ITIL and how they can be used to benefit an organization.",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,110\nThe ITIL Foundation\ncertification is one that\n\n2\n00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,000\npeople seek out when they are looking\nto get introduced to ITIL.\n\n3\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,880\nNow, if you have stumbled\nacross this video and\n\n4\n00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,910\nyou don't even know what ITIL is,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n5\n00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,980\nLet's take a minute to discuss the\nInformation Technology Industry Library,\n\n6\n00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,620\nwhat it is,\n\n7\n00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,732\nwhy we'd even want to know about it and a\nlittle bit about the certification exam so\n\n8\n00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,090\nthat you too, can get your\nITIL Foundation certification.\n\n9\n00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,250\nLet's start with the basics of what it is.\n\n10\n00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,250\nThe Information Technology Industry\nLibrary, it's a little bit of a mouthful,\n\n11\n00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,960\nITIL is what everybody calls it.\n\n12\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,400\nThe ITIL framework was designed\nby the British government to help\n\n13\n00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,265\nfacilitate companies plan IT departments\nbetter, I shouldn't just say plan.\n\n14\n00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,860\nITIL is a service management framework.\n\n15\n00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,010\nSo it covers everything from\nplanning in the early stages,\n\n16\n00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,430\nall the way to operations and ongoing\nactivities throughout your business.\n\n17\n00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,430\nIt really says here's how you\nshould run you IT department and\n\n18\n00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,670\na lot of companies find\nthat very valuable.\n\n19\n00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,370\nYou don't wanna have to reinvent\nthe wheel if other companies have\n\n20\n00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,020\nalready successfully created IT department\nstructures and are operating efficiently\n\n21\n00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,440\nand successfully,\nyou should just be able to mirror them.\n\n22\n00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,650\nThat's exactly what ITIL does is,\nit says here's a framework,\n\n23\n00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,101\nhere's a collection of processes and\n\n24\n00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,234\nresources that other companies have\nused very successfully to create stable,\n\n25\n00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:32,800\nmature and efficient IT departments\nthat support the business.\n\n26\n00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,530\nSo think of ITIL as a helping hand,\nit doesn't do any work for you.\n\n27\n00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,400\nITIL's not some kind of working entity.\n\n28\n00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,950\nIt gives you that framework and\n\n29\n00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,340\nif you follow their guidance,\nit helps you get started really fast.\n\n30\n00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,260\nThe big problem we have in IT is\ncompanies will start out small,\n\n31\n00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,610\nand then they'll explode and become\nmassive organizations almost overnight,\n\n32\n00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,160\nif they have a commercial go viral,\nor something like that.\n\n33\n00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,310\nHow do you deal with that growth,\n\n34\n00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,030\nhow do you ensure you're\nfollowing proper practices?\n\n35\n00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,270\nOne of the best ways to do that is\nto follow a framework like ITIL.\n\n36\n00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,579\n>> Now Don,\nyou mentioned the term practices,\n\n37\n00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:13,200\nITIL really goes into the realm\nof talking about best practices\n\n38\n00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,920\nis what they really want to\nmake sure that they emphasize.\n\n39\n00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,160\nEven though they have learned\nfrom different industries,\n\n40\n00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,390\neven though there are many different\ngroups that have actually contributed to\n\n41\n00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,790\nthe foundation, what they've tried to\ndo with the ITIL, the entire library,\n\n42\n00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,250\nwas to say here are what we believe\nare the best governances and\n\n43\n00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,810\npractices that will make sure that\nyou're successful as an IT department.\n\n44\n00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,280\nRegardless, of the industry\nthat you end up serving.\n\n45\n00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,730\nBy providing enough information, so\nthat you don't really get lost in\n\n46\n00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,750\nsomebody else's tracks of doing things\nwhen their company is not exactly based in\n\n47\n00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,730\nthe same way that yours is or\nfunctioning in the same way.\n\n48\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,160\nSo it really is about best practices.\n\n49\n00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,920\n>> If you think about the time when\nthis came out ITIL was originally being\n\n50\n00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,380\ndeveloped back in the 1980's and\nback then it was uncommon for\n\n51\n00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,070\na company to have an IT department.\n\n52\n00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,900\nIf you did, it usually meant you had\nsome sort of mainframe deployed and\n\n53\n00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,240\nyou needed an IT guy for\nthat but most companies,\n\n54\n00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,370\ntheir IT department was\nusually a copier repair man.\n\n55\n00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,090\nA photocopier was the most advanced piece\nof equipment that a lot of offices had and\n\n56\n00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,520\nthat really changed in the 90s.\n\n57\n00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,130\nSo companies that didn't need a dedicated\nIT department before, all of a sudden did.\n\n58\n00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,200\nA lot of them were implementing\nit poorly and when that happens,\n\n59\n00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040\nyou get these huge cost overruns and\nit's detrimental to your company.\n\n60\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,280\nSo following a proper structure to\nensure that all of that is maintained is\n\n61\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,890\nreally critical to keeping\nyour business successful and\n\n62\n00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370\nthat's what ITIL seeks to help out with.\n\n63\n00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,440\nNow, it was developed by the British\nGovernment, so it's a product of the U.K.\n\n64\n00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,520\nand I know the majority of our viewers\nare here in the U.S., it doesn't matter.\n\n65\n00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,620\nITIL focuses on IT departments and\ntheir governance and operation.\n\n66\n00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,760\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat country you're in,\n\n67\n00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,770\nthere's proper practices you take\nregardless of where you are and\n\n68\n00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,980\nwe've seen over the last ten years, a real\nrapid adoption here in the United States.\n\n69\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,480\nIf you're a viewer on the West coast\nhere in the U.S., like in California,\n\n70\n00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,080\nWashington, Oregon,\nyou see ITIL all over the place there.\n\n71\n00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,750\nA lot of organizations, big and small,\nare following this framework because it\n\n72\n00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,470\nhelps to make sure they're\ndoing things right and\n\n73\n00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,930\nit makes it easier to\ntransition in employees.\n\n74\n00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,580\nIf you've worked in an ITIL organization\nbefore and you go to work somewhere else\n\n75\n00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,600\nand they're following the same practices,\nyou know what to expect.\n\n76\n00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,540\nYou know how to snap in and\nthe processes are there and available.\n\n77\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,215\nIt's kind of like you don't have to\nbe completely educated on day one,\n\n78\n00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,280\nthey do orientation and all that.\n\n79\n00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,110\nYou kind of already know what to expect.\n\n80\n00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,980\nSo real handy stuff and\nwe're seeing adoption of that over here on\n\n81\n00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,110\nthe East coast a lot more rapidly\ntoo in more recent years.\n\n82\n00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,800\nSo what is ITIL Foundation?\n\n83\n00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,190\nThe ITIL Foundation certification\nis your starting point,\n\n84\n00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,350\nit's where you kick things off\nwith getting ITIL certified.\n\n85\n00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,450\nIt is basically an overview.\n\n86\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,960\nRonnie, you called it a survey, right?\n\n87\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,770\nThat would be what we'd\ncall it in a college and\n\n88\n00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,130\nthat's where you're not\ngoing to be an expert.\n\n89\n00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,070\nWhat we're going to do is we're going\nto walk you through all the various\n\n90\n00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,980\naspects of ITIL, the different components,\nfrom a high level.\n\n91\n00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,640\nYou learn about them, you get this\nbasic understanding of what ITIL is and\n\n92\n00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,290\nwhat the various pieces are, and it's not\nenough to let you then go back to work and\n\n93\n00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,160\nsay we're going to\nbecome an all ITIL shop.\n\n94\n00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,960\nITIL Foundation does not get you ready for\nthat.\n\n95\n00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900\nIt gets you ready to\nparticipate in an environment\n\n96\n00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,650\nthat is following the ITIL framework.\n\n97\n00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,500\nSo, once you get certified,\nit's really to do one of two things.\n\n98\n00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,750\nEither one, you're an employee\nworking in an organization that\n\n99\n00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,990\nalready follows the ITIL framework and\nyou wanna learn more about it, so\n\n100\n00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,530\nyou can participate better.\n\n101\n00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,730\nThat kind of person,\n\n102\n00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,180\nit's encouraged that everybody in that\ncompany does the ITIL Foundation.\n\n103\n00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,010\nIt makes sense for every single employee\nthat's working in that framework\n\n104\n00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,920\nto understand the framework\nfrom a high level.\n\n105\n00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,740\nThen beyond that, if you want to\nlearn the more advanced things,\n\n106\n00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,040\nyour average employee doesn't need that.\n\n107\n00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800\nThe average employee doesn't\nneed to know the advanced stuff,\n\n108\n00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870\nthey just need to know\ntheir little aspect.\n\n109\n00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,770\nSo that's the first side of\nwhere ITIL Foundation is.\n\n110\n00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,190\nThe second thing is,\nif you're just not sure about it.\n\n111\n00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,450\nMaybe you've heard about ITIL,\nyou think it's a good idea, you might roll\n\n112\n00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,360\nit out in your organization but\nyou decide, I need to learn a little more.\n\n113\n00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,050\nITIL Foundation is a great way\nto get that high level view,\n\n114\n00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,340\nwith very little commitment.\n\n115\n00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,380\nIt's not a ton of data, the exam is\nactually not all that challenging.\n\n116\n00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,900\nIt's fairly low cost, so you can jump in\nand test the waters and you could say,\n\n117\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,420\nI really like that, I think we should\nlook into doing that at my company.\n\n118\n00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,910\nOr you can look at it and say,\nI really just don't think that's right and\n\n119\n00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,170\nthat's kind of the end of it.\n\n120\n00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,520\nSo this ITIL Foundation certification\nis that stepping stone,\n\n121\n00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,810\nthat beginning part where\nyou make the decision.\n\n122\n00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,980\nNow if you decide to embrace it, and\nyou wanna go whole hog, or whatever crazy\n\n123\n00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,410\neuphemism we wanna use, then there are\na whole suite of additional courses and\n\n124\n00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,070\ncertifications and tons of stuff to\nget up to the expert level in ITIL.\n\n125\n00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,610\nSo there's a lot of information out there.\n\n126\n00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,950\nMarvin in the chat room just mentioned\nsomething that's kind of important,\n\n127\n00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,190\nwhich is ITIL's actually a requirement for\nsome government contracts now.\n\n128\n00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,740\nIf you wanna work with\na government project,\n\n129\n00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,870\nor bid on it, they may require you\nto follow the ITIL framework, so\n\n130\n00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,390\nthat they know you're\noperating in a stable manner.\n\n131\n00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,060\nThey wanna know that you're not gonna\ngo out of business next month because\n\n132\n00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,170\nyou did something dumb, and\ndidn't follow proper procedures.\n\n133\n00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,800\nSo that's all part of\nwhat ITIL helps us do.\n\n134\n00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,610\nLet's talk a little bit more about\nthe certification itself, and\n\n135\n00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,750\nI've got just too many windows\nopen here on my laptop.\n\n136\n00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,090\nSo let me jump over to a web browser.\n\n137\n00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,330\nHere we go.\n\n138\n00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,870\nIf you wanna learn more about ITIL,\nthey have a website.\n\n139\n00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,410\nIt's www.itil-officialsite.com.\n\n140\n00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,743\nSo the itil-officialsite.\n\n141\n00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:54,610\nNow it is kind of a weird URL, and I know\nway back when I first started with it,\n\n142\n00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,296\nI did a Google search looking for it,\nand I came across this, and I said,\n\n143\n00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,365\nwow that- Kinda looks like a fishy URL.\n\n144\n00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:04,679\nBut the main reason they have that is\nthis was originally developed by the UK\n\n145\n00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,508\ngovernment.\n\n146\n00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:11,780\nAnd they contract it out to these other\norganizations to actually run it.\n\n147\n00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,000\nAnd so while it is a government product,\n\n148\n00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,760\nit is actually run by\na company called Axelos.\n\n149\n00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,350\nSo, when you go to this website, when\nyou browse to www.itil-officialsite.com,\n\n150\n00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,883\nit redirects you to www.axelos.com/itil.\n\n151\n00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,140\nAlright?\n\n152\n00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,850\nNow, don't think that's unusual, or weird.\n\n153\n00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,000\nDon't think that you're getting fished.\n\n154\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,920\nIt just,\nAxelos is the organization that runs.\n\n155\n00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,850\nThat governs the ITIL framework,\nthe certifications, the whole process.\n\n156\n00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,860\nThat you're not allowed\nto get the certification\n\n157\n00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,730\nunless you meet the requirements\nthat Axelos has set forth.\n\n158\n00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,260\nThey're the ones who control all that.\n\n159\n00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,150\nAnd that is subject to change.\n\n160\n00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,970\nEvery couple of years they reevaluate and\n\n161\n00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,340\nthey can always transition it to\nanother organization later on.\n\n162\n00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,800\nBut for now it's Axelos.\n\n163\n00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300\nAnd that's why there's the two URLs, so\n\n164\n00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,720\nyou can always be redirected\nsomewhere else in the future.\n\n165\n00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,930\nAll right,\nnow if you go to Axelos website,\n\n166\n00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,880\nthey have a great amount\nof information out there,\n\n167\n00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,770\nyou can just find out about ITIL\nin general But becoming ITIL\n\n168\n00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,330\nqualified is what we're looking for,\nthe ITIL Foundation certification.\n\n169\n00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,810\nAnd so they lay out that\ninformation right here and\n\n170\n00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,300\nthey just kinda give you some basic\ninformation about foundation and\n\n171\n00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,090\nhow it's a stepping stone\nto the intermediate level.\n\n172\n00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,190\nThere's a whole extra\nlevel of certifications.\n\n173\n00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,700\nAnd if this is your first time\ngetting exposed to this stuff,\n\n174\n00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,210\nthey have a little brochure\non their page somewhere.\n\n175\n00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,420\nI've got it downloaded in the background,\n\n176\n00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,470\nwhich I think it's back\non their main page.\n\n177\n00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,630\nIf we choose find out about ITIL,\nactually,\n\n178\n00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,340\nI think it's on the qualified page.\n\n179\n00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,965\nThen on one of them,\nthey've got a brochure.\n\n180\n00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,745\nHere it is.\nLet's download brochure.\n\n181\n00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,475\nAnd I've got that pulled up in\nthe background here because the brochure\n\n182\n00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:51,065\nactually has some neat stuff in it.\n\n183\n00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,625\nIt's got a ton of stuff in there.\n\n184\n00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,945\nBut what I'm looking for\nis this diagram right here.\n\n185\n00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,410\nThis is what is called the ITIL\nqualification scheme, and\n\n186\n00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,270\nit lays out how the certifications work.\n\n187\n00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,330\nWhat you'll see is that ITIL\nfoundation is that first step.\n\n188\n00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,462\nEvery one should do it,\nevery employee that works for\n\n189\n00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:14,580\na company that follows the ITIL\nframework should do that one, right?\n\n190\n00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,700\nAnd then after that if\nyou're in management,\n\n191\n00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,760\nyou move up to the next steps, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,930\nSo really everything above that is\ngonna be something that management\n\n193\n00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,830\npeople will fall into.\n\n194\n00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,840\nAnd you'll see they divide\nit into two pieces,\n\n195\n00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,760\nthe intermediate life cycle and\nintermediate capability.\n\n196\n00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,710\nAnd these are just dictating different\nareas of your company and what they do.\n\n197\n00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,960\nAnd inside of that they break it\nup into various certifications.\n\n198\n00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,050\nAnd when people talk\nabout the ITIL framework,\n\n199\n00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,210\nthey're usually talking\nabout these five right here.\n\n200\n00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,060\nAnd for ITIL foundation, those\nare the five that you need to be aware of.\n\n201\n00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,900\nThat's what the bulk of\nthe exam comes from.\n\n202\n00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,620\nThese all center around how\nyou run your IT department.\n\n203\n00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,640\nHow you plan your business.\n\n204\n00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,850\nHow IT integrates with the business,\nand so on.\n\n205\n00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,040\nAll the things that we\nreally need to know.\n\n206\n00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,520\nThe other side starts\nto dive into some other\n\n207\n00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,550\nmore governance type issues that aren't\nappropriate for your typical users.\n\n208\n00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,940\nAnd so that's on the capability side.\n\n209\n00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,950\nAfter that, it moves up to\nmanaging across the lifecycle,\n\n210\n00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,060\nwhich is integrating all of this together.\n\n211\n00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,190\nUsing all the different pieces together.\n\n212\n00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,790\nYou may have some managers,\nwho are in the executive branch.\n\n213\n00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,670\nAnd, so\nthey go into these service design side, or\n\n214\n00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,200\nservice strategy side is\nusually where they'd be.\n\n215\n00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,790\nBut then you might have\nyour help desk people, and\n\n216\n00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,130\nhelp desk people don't need\nto be in the strategy side.\n\n217\n00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,730\nThey need to be in the operation side.\n\n218\n00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,030\nSo you'll move them into the various other\nareas based on what it is that they do.\n\n219\n00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,730\nYou might have project managers that\nwould fall under certain areas here.\n\n220\n00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,450\nAnd so they may only go to\none of these courses or\n\n221\n00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,540\nstudy only one of these\nbodies of knowledge.\n\n222\n00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,820\nBut if you're the person\nwho's heading up ITIL.\n\n223\n00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,780\nOr if you're the CIO for your\norganization, you need to know them all.\n\n224\n00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,910\nAnd so you hit all of those, which\nmoves you into that ITIL expert level.\n\n225\n00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,610\nAnd if you're the person responsible for\ndeploying the ITIL framework for\n\n226\n00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,630\nan entire company, or\nif you're a contractor that goes out and\n\n227\n00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,390\ndo it, you're gonna move\nup that ITIL master level.\n\n228\n00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,248\nYou wanna know the entire\nset of information so\n\n229\n00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:14,960\nthat you could help people and\nadvise them in what pieces are needed.\n\n230\n00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,830\nThe cool thing about a framework is\nthat you don't have to do 100% of it.\n\n231\n00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,850\nYou look at it and you find\nthe areas that are important to you.\n\n232\n00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,680\nBecause some of the stuff\nthey recommend is\n\n233\n00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,610\nnot necessarily applicable\nto your company.\n\n234\n00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,980\nAnd so you might look at it and say yeah,\nI think it's great that they've got this,\n\n235\n00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,680\nlet's say,\na requirements management function.\n\n236\n00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,440\nBut we're not a software\ndevelopment house,\n\n237\n00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,910\nwe don't deal with requirements in\nthat way, so it doesn't make sense.\n\n238\n00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,020\nSo we just leave that piece out, right.\n\n239\n00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,880\nAnd that's what you need to do.\n\n240\n00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,650\nYou pick and\nchoose the components you need, but\n\n241\n00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,040\nif you don't know all the components\nhow do you know which ones to pick?\n\n242\n00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,780\nAnd so it's that person at the expert and\n\n243\n00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,970\nmaster level they're the ones\nthat are gonna know that.\n\n244\n00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,690\nAnd we usually see them in\ncontractor adviser type roles\n\n245\n00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,160\nwhere they're going out and\nhelping organizations.\n\n246\n00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,930\nOnce your implementation is in place\n\n247\n00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,840\nyou don't normally have to change\nit unless something new happens.\n\n248\n00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,790\nAnd there are updates and\nchanges over time.\n\n249\n00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,890\nBut it's not a regular thing.\n\n250\n00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,990\nIt's not like a full time job.\n\n251\n00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,360\nAll right, so\nthat's the certification scheme, and\n\n252\n00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,050\nwe are just starting out right here, ITIL\nfoundation, basic foundation knowledge.\n\n253\n00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,730\nAll right, now on their site,\nif you go into the ITIL Foundation page,\n\n254\n00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,710\nthey actually have\nthe syllabus that's available.\n\n255\n00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,580\nYou can go and download it and\n\n256\n00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,300\nit'll show you all of the different things\nthat are going to be covered on the exam.\n\n257\n00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,160\nNow the syllabus is not the easiest\nthing to read, because they were very,\n\n258\n00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,390\nvery thorough.\n\n259\n00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,820\nSo let me just pull it up here.\n\n260\n00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,400\nLet me get to the top.\n\n261\n00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,435\nAll right, so when you pull up the\nsyllabus for it, what it's laying out is\n\n262\n00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:45,245\nreally the information that people\nlike us use to create these courses.\n\n263\n00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:48,543\nThe stuff we need to cover because\nit's going to be on the exam.\n\n264\n00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:53,332\nAnd so when list it they're laying\nit all out in here based on\n\n265\n00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,522\nsections inside of their books.\n\n266\n00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:59,212\nAnd the ITIL framework,\nthe one that we deal with,\n\n267\n00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:03,342\nthe service framework, is really\nbuilt up of five different books.\n\n268\n00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,202\nAnd so with each of these objectives that\nthey list, there's a little note down\n\n269\n00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,662\nhere at the end, and\nits telling you what book to look in.\n\n270\n00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:13,132\nSo, this one's in the Service Strategy\nbook, versus one that might be in\n\n271\n00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:17,530\nthe Service Design, or whatever,\nthe different books that we've got.\n\n272\n00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,030\nSo it's just laying out all the different\nthings that you need to know.\n\n273\n00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,460\nAnd you'll normally see concepts and\n\n274\n00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,830\nprocesses all kinda listed that\nyou've gotta be familiar with.\n\n275\n00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,600\nSome of them will say hey,\nthere should actually be an hour and\n\n276\n00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,090\na half of training on\nthese topics right here.\n\n277\n00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,890\nOther ones might not have\nanytime attached to them at all.\n\n278\n00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,910\nSo for example as I go down here.\n\n279\n00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,240\nI'll find one here, this one.\n\n280\n00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,060\nAnd it's just saying that,\n\n281\n00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,050\nhey these things you're gonna cover\nthem as part of covering other things.\n\n282\n00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,700\nSo, you don't need to dedicate it, but you\nshould be able to look down this list and\n\n283\n00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400\nknow what these elements\nare to understand them.\n\n284\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,830\nSo, if you get a question on the exam\nabout a known error database.\n\n285\n00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,550\nYou probably need to know what\na known error database is, don't you?\n\n286\n00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,290\nBut you're gonna learn about that\nas part of some of the other\n\n287\n00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,750\nprocesses we go through.\n\n288\n00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,110\nSo the outline is not the most\nterribly easy thing to work with.\n\n289\n00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,640\nAnd you'll find during the show\nwe've made our own outline.\n\n290\n00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,760\nWe've rearranged all of this to\nmake a little more sense, and\n\n291\n00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,370\nkind of divide it up in a way\nthat it's easier to handle.\n\n292\n00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,990\nBut the best part of this brochure\nis actually on the very last page.\n\n293\n00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,790\nIf we go all the way to the end\nit tells us about the exam.\n\n294\n00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,410\nThe exam is a multiple choice exam.\n\n295\n00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,160\nSo, you'll have 40 questions and\nthey've got A, B, C, D answers,\n\n296\n00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240\nyou read the question,\nyou choose your answers.\n\n297\n00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,340\nSo it's a very straightforward exam,\nno tricks or anything like that,\n\n298\n00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,980\njust straightforward whether you\nknow the information or not.\n\n299\n00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,020\nThey have an exam pool that is\nwell over 300 questions and so\n\n300\n00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,120\nwhen you take that exam it's possible\ntwo people could be sitting right\n\n301\n00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,390\nnext to each other and\nnot have a single question in common.\n\n302\n00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,635\nSo if you take the exam more than\nonce do not count on seeing the same\n\n303\n00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:51,589\nquestions again.\n\n304\n00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,844\nStatistically you're probably\ngonna see a couple again, but\n\n305\n00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:58,341\nyou could see a completely new exam.\n\n306\n00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,017\nJust kind of depends on how\nyour odds fall that day.\n\n307\n00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:04,814\nSo, 40 questions, you use 60 minutes,\nso not a terribly long amount of time,\n\n308\n00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,514\nthat's over a minute per question.\n\n309\n00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:10,250\nIf you read an answer, it is not stressed.\n\n310\n00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,990\nWhen I took mine, I finished in\nthirty five or forty minutes.\n\n311\n00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,750\nYou have plenty of time.\n\n312\n00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,110\nI did not feel pressured when I did mine.\n\n313\n00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,480\nIf English is not your native language,\n\n314\n00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,680\nbecause that is the language\nthe exam is proctored in, they have\n\n315\n00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,110\nconverted it over to other languages\ntoo but not every language is covered.\n\n316\n00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,840\nSo if you want to take the exam\nin a language that's not offered\n\n317\n00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,250\nthey do offer you 15 extra minutes.\n\n318\n00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,330\nAnd that's just to help because it's tough\nto take an exam in a different language.\n\n319\n00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,900\nThere are no real prerequisites for\nthis one.\n\n320\n00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,890\nThey do recommend that you do\nofficial ITIL Foundation Training.\n\n321\n00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,200\nYou know,\nkind of like what our show is going to be.\n\n322\n00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,420\nNow our show is not,\nwe're not accredited by ITIL.\n\n323\n00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,000\nSo, for any of the higher level training,\n\n324\n00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,230\nyou absolutely have to be accredited\nby ITIL, so we won't do those.\n\n325\n00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,320\nBut on the foundation side,\nyou can do your training wherever.\n\n326\n00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,940\nAnd that's what they say, it's\nrecommended, but is not a prerequisite.\n\n327\n00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,140\nThe exam is supervised and\nI'll talk more about that in a minute.\n\n328\n00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,150\nIt used to be that you had to\ntake the exam in person and\n\n329\n00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,560\nthat's changed a lot over the years.\n\n330\n00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,165\nSo it's supervised electronically now so\nit's a little bit different.\n\n331\n00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,545\nIt is not open book.\n\n332\n00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:22,563\nThe knowledge needs to be in your head,\nand you've got to score a 65% to pass.\n\n333\n00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:26,045\nYou've got to get 26 questions out of 40,\n\n334\n00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,485\nand that's not the hardest\nbar in the world to hit.\n\n335\n00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,835\nSo I find this is a really friendly exam.\n\n336\n00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:33,115\nAnd that's because it's\nthat starting point, right?\n\n337\n00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,855\nIt's just high level information.\n\n338\n00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,355\nYou'll find the exams get a lot harder\n\n339\n00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,615\nwhen you move up to\nthe intermediate level.\n\n340\n00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,300\nAll right.\nSo that's the basics on the exam.\n\n341\n00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,860\nA few other pieces we might want to\nthrow out here is how do we take it?\n\n342\n00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,690\nAnd you've got a few choices.\n\n343\n00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,270\nLike most of our exams, we can go and\n\n344\n00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,290\ntake it at a regular testing center,\nright Ronnie?\n\n345\n00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,380\n>> Right. Yeah. You can go to your Pearson\nVUE testing center to be able to do so.\n\n346\n00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,267\nIf you take a look online and\ngo to vue.com,\n\n347\n00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:03,170\nV U E.com, that normally will bring\nyou into the view testing center, and\n\n348\n00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,080\nthen you'll be able to select from\nthat list and be able to register.\n\n349\n00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,750\nAnd you'll probably have to go through\na little bit more registration than normal\n\n350\n00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,260\nbecause they'll give you another exam\nnumber that you'll have to keep track of.\n\n351\n00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,670\nBut once you get in there you\njust follow the steps along and\n\n352\n00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,780\nyou'll be able to register there.\n\n353\n00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,190\nBut that's not the neatest\nway to take the exam.\n\n354\n00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,680\nThe other way is the one that\nDon's about to show you.\n\n355\n00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,820\n>> Now remember how I mentioned AXELOS and\nhow they're running the show.\n\n356\n00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,460\nAnd they determine what testing\nproviders you're allowed to test with.\n\n357\n00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,110\nAnd so they've got approved\norganizations around the globe.\n\n358\n00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,870\nAnd for us here in the U.S.\n\n359\n00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,190\nI always found the easiest one to work\nwith is an organization called EXIN.\n\n360\n00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,330\nAnd E X I N.\n\n361\n00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,840\nAnd EXIN they do testing,\npartnered with Pearson VUE.\n\n362\n00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,660\nSo you can go to any VUE center,\nwhich they're all over the world.\n\n363\n00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,860\nThere are other organizations that do it,\nthough.\n\n364\n00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,320\nLet me pull up the official page here.\n\n365\n00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,640\nSo here's the AXELOS page that\nlists their Examination Institutes.\n\n366\n00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,050\nAnd you'll see other companies.\n\n367\n00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,650\nAPMG, there's EXN, PEOPLECERT.\n\n368\n00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,730\nSo pick whichever one is convenient for\nyou if you want to go down and take it.\n\n369\n00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,450\nBut the EXN guys, and some of the other\nguys do this too, but I tested in EXN so\n\n370\n00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,320\nthat is the one I know best, the EXN guys\nactually have something really neat.\n\n371\n00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,030\nIf you go to their website,\nthey'll provide information about ITIL.\n\n372\n00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,255\nSo here's the XIN website.\n\n373\n00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,050\nXIN.com.\n\n374\n00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,830\nAnd you'll see information about ITIL.\n\n375\n00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,490\nI guess I could have saved time on\nthat brochure and used their diagram.\n\n376\n00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,740\nBut they lay out the foundation\ncertification and\n\n377\n00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,910\nall the certifications too.\n\n378\n00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,740\nYou'll see there's quite a bit of them.\n\n379\n00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,840\nBut basically we see\ntheir information here.\n\n380\n00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,500\nWe learn about it.\n\n381\n00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,280\nWhatever.\n\n382\n00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,240\nAnd then when you're ready to go and\ntake the exam they've got where you\n\n383\n00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,050\ncan pull up the information on\nthe exam and sign up for it.\n\n384\n00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,090\nAnd you can jump over\nto view at that point.\n\n385\n00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,460\nAnd you register to take the EXIN ITIL\nfoundation exam through you.\n\n386\n00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,800\nTake it wherever you want.\n\n387\n00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,010\nBut they also have this new thing\nthat's called EXIN ANYWHERE.\n\n388\n00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,910\nAnd with EXIN ANYWHERE, you can take\nthe exam right from your own computer.\n\n389\n00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,480\nSo you can be at your home or office,\nand not have to go anywhere, and\n\n390\n00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,080\njust take the exam right there, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,530\nNow if you do that,\nthey have a little test they make you do.\n\n392\n00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,320\nSo if I hit like book my exam now, it'll\nsay that you need to test your computer\n\n393\n00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,350\nto make sure that it meets\nthe requirements, all right.\n\n394\n00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,820\nOne of the main requirements, is that it\ndoes require a microphone and camera.\n\n395\n00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,690\nRemember this is a supervised exam.\n\n396\n00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,170\nAnd while there won't be a living\nperson sitting there watching you.\n\n397\n00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,970\nThey do record.\n\n398\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,410\nAnd so it is watching you\nwhile you take the exam.\n\n399\n00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,040\nSo it will see if you used your book.\n\n400\n00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,720\nIf you had somebody standing behind\nyou telling you the answers.\n\n401\n00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,910\nThat will get recorded.\n\n402\n00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,970\nAnd they might not audit it today.\n\n403\n00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,950\nBut they'll audit it eventually,\nand when they do,\n\n404\n00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,780\nthey will see that there was cheating or\nwhatever.\n\n405\n00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,230\nSo it is just as good as\na proctored exam in person.\n\n406\n00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,290\nSo, they make you do that test, and it is\njust going to check your hardware to make\n\n407\n00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,100\nsure you have the various requirements,\nso it is checking for each of those and\n\n408\n00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,120\nit's a straight forward process if you've\ngot the equipment it'll run through and\n\n409\n00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480\ndo the test.\n\n410\n00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,910\nIt tells you what to do here.\n\n411\n00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,100\nI'm going to allow that.\n\n412\n00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,570\nAnd so it sees me.\n\n413\n00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,100\nHi.\n\n414\n00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,700\nSo, it's just checking to make sure\nI'm there and that it can see me.\n\n415\n00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,090\nThere we go.\nSo, it picked it up.\n\n416\n00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,890\nAnd it's just going to\ncontinue on this little wizard\n\n417\n00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,450\nas it identifies whether I've got\na microphone, in speakers and so on.\n\n418\n00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,060\nAnd it's checking my audio right now.\n\n419\n00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,820\nSo it heard me talking and so on.\n\n420\n00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,430\nOnce that's done you can sign up for\nthe eggs and\n\n421\n00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,720\nanywhere exam and you can take\nit right from your own computer.\n\n422\n00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,190\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n423\n00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,490\nYou can get your ITIL Foundation\nwithout even leaving the house.\n\n424\n00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,070\nAll right.\n\n425\n00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,240\nOh, it's trying to play audio right now.\n\n426\n00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,190\nI'm going to close this.\n\n427\n00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870\nWell, I guess it passed it, didn't it?\n\n428\n00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,980\nWell, we'll let it finish I guess.\n\n429\n00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,300\nAll right, few other things to mention.\n\n430\n00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,320\nIf you take the exam through VUE,\nwe're going to go U.S.\n\n431\n00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600\nbecause most of our viewers are U.S.\n\n432\n00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,440\nbut understand that your different\ncurrencies are priced different ways, but\n\n433\n00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,360\nhere in the U.S. with Pearson VUE\nit's $208 to take the exam, which is\n\n434\n00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,570\nmore than some, but less than a lot of\ncertifications that are out there today.\n\n435\n00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,540\nNow if we do the EXIN anywhere,\nif you take it online,\n\n436\n00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,860\nit's more expensive, it's $226.\n\n437\n00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,420\nAnd there's various reasons for that,\nmainly the remote viewing, and so on.\n\n438\n00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,780\nThe convenience, too.\n\n439\n00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,480\nBut also keep in mind that\nif you're a European tester,\n\n440\n00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,890\nthen they do have to attach that to that,\nand so it might get more expensive.\n\n441\n00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,730\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n442\n00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,780\nThe pricing can be subject to change, but\nas of right now, right before the show\n\n443\n00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,210\nit was $208 to take it in person,\n$226 US dollars to take it online.\n\n444\n00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,090\nAll right so that's pretty much it for\n\n445\n00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,220\ntaking the exam,\nlike I said it is pretty straight forward.\n\n446\n00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,750\nA few other things worth\nmentioning here before we wrap up.\n\n447\n00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,260\nThe ITIL framework itself is\ndivided amongst five books and\n\n448\n00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260\nwhen I say books I'm not using\na euphemism for something else.\n\n449\n00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,460\nI'm talking about actual books.\n\n450\n00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,720\nAnd let me bring up my outline real quick.\n\n451\n00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,290\nNot that one.\n\n452\n00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,230\nThis one.\n\n453\n00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,350\nHere's my quick outline that we'll be\nusing during the show as we go through.\n\n454\n00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,890\nAnd you'll see I've divided them\nup into these big sections.\n\n455\n00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,180\nService Strategy, Service Design,\nService Transition, Service Operation, and\n\n456\n00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,770\nContinual Service Improvement.\n\n457\n00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,120\nThose are not names that I made up.\n\n458\n00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,990\nThose are books.\n\n459\n00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,380\nSo with ITO they have a physical book\ncalled Continual Service Improvement.\n\n460\n00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,530\nAnd in it is the entire framework for\n\n461\n00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,080\nhow to properly implement\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n462\n00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,470\nNow the books are huge.\n\n463\n00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,070\nThey are 300-400 pages each.\n\n464\n00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,460\nSome of them are a little bit longer.\n\n465\n00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,980\nThey're pretty expensive too.\n\n466\n00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,940\nThe whole set of five books will run\nyou a little over 500 US dollars.\n\n467\n00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,850\nSo they're not inexpensive books.\n\n468\n00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,070\nWe don't need to know the whole book for\nITIL foundation.\n\n469\n00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,990\nWe just need to know\nwhat's in those books.\n\n470\n00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,020\nRight.\nThe general concepts around them.\n\n471\n00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,590\nSo we'll break it down this way,\nall right?\n\n472\n00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,310\nSo each of these are the different\ncomponents that we're going to go through\n\n473\n00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,170\nas we're learning what ITIL is and\n\n474\n00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,220\nwhat areas contain what functionality,\nall right.\n\n475\n00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,190\nSo that's important to keep in\nmind as we get ready to study and\n\n476\n00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,520\nwe get ready to move into that.\n\n477\n00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,880\nAnd then when we take the certification\nit will be pulling from all these areas.\n\n478\n00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,050\nYou know, I feel like I'm\nleaving something out, Ronnie,\n\n479\n00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,830\nthere was something else I wanted\nto mention here at the end.\n\n480\n00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,920\n>> I don't know of any.\n\n481\n00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040\n>> You can't read my mind?\n\n482\n00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,770\nShoot.\n\n483\n00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,435\nWell, I can't read my own mind either.\n\n484\n00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,970\n[LAUGH] Seems like there was one\nmore thing I wanted to mention,\n\n485\n00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,990\nbut I guess we'll see that later.\n\n486\n00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,620\nSo, yes that's basically it.\n\n487\n00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,400\nOur show will cover all that you\nneed to know to pass the exam.\n\n488\n00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,930\nWhich is always important.\n\n489\n00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,750\nYou'll be able to jump in and\ntake that and\n\n490\n00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,770\nhopefully pass on\nthe first try if you study.\n\n491\n00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,460\nIt's not the most challenging\nexam that you'll encounter.\n\n492\n00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,900\nSo, which is kind of a pleasant\nsurprise compared to some of the ones\n\n493\n00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,410\nwe go through.\n\n494\n00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,200\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen\nthat's probably enough about ITIL.\n\n495\n00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,490\nIf that sounds like something\nthat you are interested in,\n\n496\n00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,130\nmaybe if you think that this is something\nthat you want to learn more about,\n\n497\n00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,896\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n498\n00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:44,270\nAnd you'll want to jump into our episodes,\nwhich, well by the time you see this,\n\n499\n00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,000\nmight be completed.\n\n500\n00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,100\nBut we're actually about to start\nhere in just a few minutes,\n\n501\n00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,132\nso I hope to see you there.\n\n502\n00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:53,166\n[SOUND]\n\n",
