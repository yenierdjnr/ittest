  "description": "The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was created to help businesses manage their IT operations more efficiently and reliably. The ITIL framework provides a collection of practices that businesses can choose to adopt that focus on aligning IT operations with the goals of the business. These practices range from creating new service offerings to day-to-day operations and managing incidents. Many organizations choose to follow ITIL because it prevents them from having to \"reinvent the wheel\" when it comes to IT processes and operations. The ITIL Foundations certification is designed to introduce the candidate to the general processes in ITIL and how they can be used to benefit an organization.",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,110\nThe ITIL Foundation\ncertification is one that\n\n2\n00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,000\npeople seek out when they are looking\nto get introduced to ITIL.\n\n3\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,880\nNow, if you have stumbled\nacross this video and\n\n4\n00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,910\nyou don't even know what ITIL is,\nyou're in the right place.\n\n5\n00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,980\nLet's take a minute to discuss the\nInformation Technology Industry Library,\n\n6\n00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,620\nwhat it is,\n\n7\n00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,732\nwhy we'd even want to know about it and a\nlittle bit about the certification exam so\n\n8\n00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,090\nthat you too, can get your\nITIL Foundation certification.\n\n9\n00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,250\nLet's start with the basics of what it is.\n\n10\n00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,250\nThe Information Technology Industry\nLibrary, it's a little bit of a mouthful,\n\n11\n00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,960\nITIL is what everybody calls it.\n\n12\n00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,400\nThe ITIL framework was designed\nby the British government to help\n\n13\n00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,265\nfacilitate companies plan IT departments\nbetter, I shouldn't just say plan.\n\n14\n00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,860\nITIL is a service management framework.\n\n15\n00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,010\nSo it covers everything from\nplanning in the early stages,\n\n16\n00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,430\nall the way to operations and ongoing\nactivities throughout your business.\n\n17\n00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,430\nIt really says here's how you\nshould run you IT department and\n\n18\n00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,670\na lot of companies find\nthat very valuable.\n\n19\n00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,370\nYou don't wanna have to reinvent\nthe wheel if other companies have\n\n20\n00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,020\nalready successfully created IT department\nstructures and are operating efficiently\n\n21\n00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,440\nand successfully,\nyou should just be able to mirror them.\n\n22\n00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,650\nThat's exactly what ITIL does is,\nit says here's a framework,\n\n23\n00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,101\nhere's a collection of processes and\n\n24\n00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,234\nresources that other companies have\nused very successfully to create stable,\n\n25\n00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:32,800\nmature and efficient IT departments\nthat support the business.\n\n26\n00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,530\nSo think of ITIL as a helping hand,\nit doesn't do any work for you.\n\n27\n00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,400\nITIL's not some kind of working entity.\n\n28\n00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,950\nIt gives you that framework and\n\n29\n00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,340\nif you follow their guidance,\nit helps you get started really fast.\n\n30\n00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,260\nThe big problem we have in IT is\ncompanies will start out small,\n\n31\n00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,610\nand then they'll explode and become\nmassive organizations almost overnight,\n\n32\n00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,160\nif they have a commercial go viral,\nor something like that.\n\n33\n00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,310\nHow do you deal with that growth,\n\n34\n00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,030\nhow do you ensure you're\nfollowing proper practices?\n\n35\n00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,270\nOne of the best ways to do that is\nto follow a framework like ITIL.\n\n36\n00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,579\n>> Now Don,\nyou mentioned the term practices,\n\n37\n00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:13,200\nITIL really goes into the realm\nof talking about best practices\n\n38\n00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,920\nis what they really want to\nmake sure that they emphasize.\n\n39\n00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,160\nEven though they have learned\nfrom different industries,\n\n40\n00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,390\neven though there are many different\ngroups that have actually contributed to\n\n41\n00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,790\nthe foundation, what they've tried to\ndo with the ITIL, the entire library,\n\n42\n00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,250\nwas to say here are what we believe\nare the best governances and\n\n43\n00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,810\npractices that will make sure that\nyou're successful as an IT department.\n\n44\n00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,280\nRegardless, of the industry\nthat you end up serving.\n\n45\n00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,730\nBy providing enough information, so\nthat you don't really get lost in\n\n46\n00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,750\nsomebody else's tracks of doing things\nwhen their company is not exactly based in\n\n47\n00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,730\nthe same way that yours is or\nfunctioning in the same way.\n\n48\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,160\nSo it really is about best practices.\n\n49\n00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,920\n>> If you think about the time when\nthis came out ITIL was originally being\n\n50\n00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,380\ndeveloped back in the 1980's and\nback then it was uncommon for\n\n51\n00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,070\na company to have an IT department.\n\n52\n00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,900\nIf you did, it usually meant you had\nsome sort of mainframe deployed and\n\n53\n00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,240\nyou needed an IT guy for\nthat but most companies,\n\n54\n00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,370\ntheir IT department was\nusually a copier repair man.\n\n55\n00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,090\nA photocopier was the most advanced piece\nof equipment that a lot of offices had and\n\n56\n00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,520\nthat really changed in the 90s.\n\n57\n00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,130\nSo companies that didn't need a dedicated\nIT department before, all of a sudden did.\n\n58\n00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,200\nA lot of them were implementing\nit poorly and when that happens,\n\n59\n00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040\nyou get these huge cost overruns and\nit's detrimental to your company.\n\n60\n00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,280\nSo following a proper structure to\nensure that all of that is maintained is\n\n61\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,890\nreally critical to keeping\nyour business successful and\n\n62\n00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370\nthat's what ITIL seeks to help out with.\n\n63\n00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,440\nNow, it was developed by the British\nGovernment, so it's a product of the U.K.\n\n64\n00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,520\nand I know the majority of our viewers\nare here in the U.S., it doesn't matter.\n\n65\n00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,620\nITIL focuses on IT departments and\ntheir governance and operation.\n\n66\n00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,760\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat country you're in,\n\n67\n00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,770\nthere's proper practices you take\nregardless of where you are and\n\n68\n00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,980\nwe've seen over the last ten years, a real\nrapid adoption here in the United States.\n\n69\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,480\nIf you're a viewer on the West coast\nhere in the U.S., like in California,\n\n70\n00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,080\nWashington, Oregon,\nyou see ITIL all over the place there.\n\n71\n00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,750\nA lot of organizations, big and small,\nare following this framework because it\n\n72\n00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,470\nhelps to make sure they're\ndoing things right and\n\n73\n00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,930\nit makes it easier to\ntransition in employees.\n\n74\n00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,580\nIf you've worked in an ITIL organization\nbefore and you go to work somewhere else\n\n75\n00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,600\nand they're following the same practices,\nyou know what to expect.\n\n76\n00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,540\nYou know how to snap in and\nthe processes are there and available.\n\n77\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,215\nIt's kind of like you don't have to\nbe completely educated on day one,\n\n78\n00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,280\nthey do orientation and all that.\n\n79\n00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,110\nYou kind of already know what to expect.\n\n80\n00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,980\nSo real handy stuff and\nwe're seeing adoption of that over here on\n\n81\n00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,110\nthe East coast a lot more rapidly\ntoo in more recent years.\n\n82\n00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,800\nSo what is ITIL Foundation?\n\n83\n00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,190\nThe ITIL Foundation certification\nis your starting point,\n\n84\n00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,350\nit's where you kick things off\nwith getting ITIL certified.\n\n85\n00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,450\nIt is basically an overview.\n\n86\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,960\nRonnie, you called it a survey, right?\n\n87\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,770\nThat would be what we'd\ncall it in a college and\n\n88\n00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,130\nthat's where you're not\ngoing to be an expert.\n\n89\n00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,070\nWhat we're going to do is we're going\nto walk you through all the various\n\n90\n00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,980\naspects of ITIL, the different components,\nfrom a high level.\n\n91\n00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,640\nYou learn about them, you get this\nbasic understanding of what ITIL is and\n\n92\n00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,290\nwhat the various pieces are, and it's not\nenough to let you then go back to work and\n\n93\n00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,160\nsay we're going to\nbecome an all ITIL shop.\n\n94\n00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,960\nITIL Foundation does not get you ready for\nthat.\n\n95\n00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900\nIt gets you ready to\nparticipate in an environment\n\n96\n00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,650\nthat is following the ITIL framework.\n\n97\n00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,500\nSo, once you get certified,\nit's really to do one of two things.\n\n98\n00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,750\nEither one, you're an employee\nworking in an organization that\n\n99\n00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,990\nalready follows the ITIL framework and\nyou wanna learn more about it, so\n\n100\n00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,530\nyou can participate better.\n\n101\n00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,730\nThat kind of person,\n\n102\n00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,180\nit's encouraged that everybody in that\ncompany does the ITIL Foundation.\n\n103\n00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,010\nIt makes sense for every single employee\nthat's working in that framework\n\n104\n00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,920\nto understand the framework\nfrom a high level.\n\n105\n00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,740\nThen beyond that, if you want to\nlearn the more advanced things,\n\n106\n00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,040\nyour average employee doesn't need that.\n\n107\n00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,800\nThe average employee doesn't\nneed to know the advanced stuff,\n\n108\n00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870\nthey just need to know\ntheir little aspect.\n\n109\n00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,770\nSo that's the first side of\nwhere ITIL Foundation is.\n\n110\n00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,190\nThe second thing is,\nif you're just not sure about it.\n\n111\n00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,450\nMaybe you've heard about ITIL,\nyou think it's a good idea, you might roll\n\n112\n00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,360\nit out in your organization but\nyou decide, I need to learn a little more.\n\n113\n00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,050\nITIL Foundation is a great way\nto get that high level view,\n\n114\n00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,340\nwith very little commitment.\n\n115\n00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,380\nIt's not a ton of data, the exam is\nactually not all that challenging.\n\n116\n00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,900\nIt's fairly low cost, so you can jump in\nand test the waters and you could say,\n\n117\n00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,420\nI really like that, I think we should\nlook into doing that at my company.\n\n118\n00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,910\nOr you can look at it and say,\nI really just don't think that's right and\n\n119\n00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,170\nthat's kind of the end of it.\n\n120\n00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,520\nSo this ITIL Foundation certification\nis that stepping stone,\n\n121\n00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,810\nthat beginning part where\nyou make the decision.\n\n122\n00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,980\nNow if you decide to embrace it, and\nyou wanna go whole hog, or whatever crazy\n\n123\n00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,410\neuphemism we wanna use, then there are\na whole suite of additional courses and\n\n124\n00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,070\ncertifications and tons of stuff to\nget up to the expert level in ITIL.\n\n125\n00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,610\nSo there's a lot of information out there.\n\n126\n00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,950\nMarvin in the chat room just mentioned\nsomething that's kind of important,\n\n127\n00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,190\nwhich is ITIL's actually a requirement for\nsome government contracts now.\n\n128\n00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,740\nIf you wanna work with\na government project,\n\n129\n00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,870\nor bid on it, they may require you\nto follow the ITIL framework, so\n\n130\n00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,390\nthat they know you're\noperating in a stable manner.\n\n131\n00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,060\nThey wanna know that you're not gonna\ngo out of business next month because\n\n132\n00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,170\nyou did something dumb, and\ndidn't follow proper procedures.\n\n133\n00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,800\nSo that's all part of\nwhat ITIL helps us do.\n\n134\n00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,610\nLet's talk a little bit more about\nthe certification itself, and\n\n135\n00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,750\nI've got just too many windows\nopen here on my laptop.\n\n136\n00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,090\nSo let me jump over to a web browser.\n\n137\n00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,330\nHere we go.\n\n138\n00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,870\nIf you wanna learn more about ITIL,\nthey have a website.\n\n139\n00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,410\nIt's www.itil-officialsite.com.\n\n140\n00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,743\nSo the itil-officialsite.\n\n141\n00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:54,610\nNow it is kind of a weird URL, and I know\nway back when I first started with it,\n\n142\n00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,296\nI did a Google search looking for it,\nand I came across this, and I said,\n\n143\n00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,365\nwow that- Kinda looks like a fishy URL.\n\n144\n00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:04,679\nBut the main reason they have that is\nthis was originally developed by the UK\n\n145\n00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,508\ngovernment.\n\n146\n00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:11,780\nAnd they contract it out to these other\norganizations to actually run it.\n\n147\n00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,000\nAnd so while it is a government product,\n\n148\n00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,760\nit is actually run by\na company called Axelos.\n\n149\n00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,350\nSo, when you go to this website, when\nyou browse to www.itil-officialsite.com,\n\n150\n00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,883\nit redirects you to www.axelos.com/itil.\n\n151\n00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,140\nAlright?\n\n152\n00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,850\nNow, don't think that's unusual, or weird.\n\n153\n00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,000\nDon't think that you're getting fished.\n\n154\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,920\nIt just,\nAxelos is the organization that runs.\n\n155\n00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,850\nThat governs the ITIL framework,\nthe certifications, the whole process.\n\n156\n00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,860\nThat you're not allowed\nto get the certification\n\n157\n00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,730\nunless you meet the requirements\nthat Axelos has set forth.\n\n158\n00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,260\nThey're the ones who control all that.\n\n159\n00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,150\nAnd that is subject to change.\n\n160\n00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,970\nEvery couple of years they reevaluate and\n\n161\n00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,340\nthey can always transition it to\nanother organization later on.\n\n162\n00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,800\nBut for now it's Axelos.\n\n163\n00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300\nAnd that's why there's the two URLs, so\n\n164\n00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,720\nyou can always be redirected\nsomewhere else in the future.\n\n165\n00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,930\nAll right,\nnow if you go to Axelos website,\n\n166\n00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,880\nthey have a great amount\nof information out there,\n\n167\n00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,770\nyou can just find out about ITIL\nin general But becoming ITIL\n\n168\n00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,330\nqualified is what we're looking for,\nthe ITIL Foundation certification.\n\n169\n00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,810\nAnd so they lay out that\ninformation right here and\n\n170\n00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,300\nthey just kinda give you some basic\ninformation about foundation and\n\n171\n00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,090\nhow it's a stepping stone\nto the intermediate level.\n\n172\n00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,190\nThere's a whole extra\nlevel of certifications.\n\n173\n00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,700\nAnd if this is your first time\ngetting exposed to this stuff,\n\n174\n00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,210\nthey have a little brochure\non their page somewhere.\n\n175\n00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,420\nI've got it downloaded in the background,\n\n176\n00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,470\nwhich I think it's back\non their main page.\n\n177\n00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,630\nIf we choose find out about ITIL,\nactually,\n\n178\n00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,340\nI think it's on the qualified page.\n\n179\n00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,965\nThen on one of them,\nthey've got a brochure.\n\n180\n00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,745\nHere it is.\nLet's download brochure.\n\n181\n00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,475\nAnd I've got that pulled up in\nthe background here because the brochure\n\n182\n00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:51,065\nactually has some neat stuff in it.\n\n183\n00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,625\nIt's got a ton of stuff in there.\n\n184\n00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,945\nBut what I'm looking for\nis this diagram right here.\n\n185\n00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,410\nThis is what is called the ITIL\nqualification scheme, and\n\n186\n00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,270\nit lays out how the certifications work.\n\n187\n00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,330\nWhat you'll see is that ITIL\nfoundation is that first step.\n\n188\n00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,462\nEvery one should do it,\nevery employee that works for\n\n189\n00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:14,580\na company that follows the ITIL\nframework should do that one, right?\n\n190\n00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,700\nAnd then after that if\nyou're in management,\n\n191\n00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,760\nyou move up to the next steps, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,930\nSo really everything above that is\ngonna be something that management\n\n193\n00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,830\npeople will fall into.\n\n194\n00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,840\nAnd you'll see they divide\nit into two pieces,\n\n195\n00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,760\nthe intermediate life cycle and\nintermediate capability.\n\n196\n00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,710\nAnd these are just dictating different\nareas of your company and what they do.\n\n197\n00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,960\nAnd inside of that they break it\nup into various certifications.\n\n198\n00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,050\nAnd when people talk\nabout the ITIL framework,\n\n199\n00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,210\nthey're usually talking\nabout these five right here.\n\n200\n00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,060\nAnd for ITIL foundation, those\nare the five that you need to be aware of.\n\n201\n00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,900\nThat's what the bulk of\nthe exam comes from.\n\n202\n00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,620\nThese all center around how\nyou run your IT department.\n\n203\n00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,640\nHow you plan your business.\n\n204\n00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,850\nHow IT integrates with the business,\nand so on.\n\n205\n00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,040\nAll the things that we\nreally need to know.\n\n206\n00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,520\nThe other side starts\nto dive into some other\n\n207\n00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,550\nmore governance type issues that aren't\nappropriate for your typical users.\n\n208\n00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,940\nAnd so that's on the capability side.\n\n209\n00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,950\nAfter that, it moves up to\nmanaging across the lifecycle,\n\n210\n00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,060\nwhich is integrating all of this together.\n\n211\n00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,190\nUsing all the different pieces together.\n\n212\n00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,790\nYou may have some managers,\nwho are in the executive branch.\n\n213\n00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,670\nAnd, so\nthey go into these service design side, or\n\n214\n00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,200\nservice strategy side is\nusually where they'd be.\n\n215\n00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,790\nBut then you might have\nyour help desk people, and\n\n216\n00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,130\nhelp desk people don't need\nto be in the strategy side.\n\n217\n00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,730\nThey need to be in the operation side.\n\n218\n00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,030\nSo you'll move them into the various other\nareas based on what it is that they do.\n\n219\n00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,730\nYou might have project managers that\nwould fall under certain areas here.\n\n220\n00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,450\nAnd so they may only go to\none of these courses or\n\n221\n00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,540\nstudy only one of these\nbodies of knowledge.\n\n222\n00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,820\nBut if you're the person\nwho's heading up ITIL.\n\n223\n00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,780\nOr if you're the CIO for your\norganization, you need to know them all.\n\n224\n00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,910\nAnd so you hit all of those, which\nmoves you into that ITIL expert level.\n\n225\n00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,610\nAnd if you're the person responsible for\ndeploying the ITIL framework for\n\n226\n00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,630\nan entire company, or\nif you're a contractor that goes out and\n\n227\n00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,390\ndo it, you're gonna move\nup that ITIL master level.\n\n228\n00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,248\nYou wanna know the entire\nset of information so\n\n229\n00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:14,960\nthat you could help people and\nadvise them in what pieces are needed.\n\n230\n00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,830\nThe cool thing about a framework is\nthat you don't have to do 100% of it.\n\n231\n00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,850\nYou look at it and you find\nthe areas that are important to you.\n\n232\n00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,680\nBecause some of the stuff\nthey recommend is\n\n233\n00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,610\nnot necessarily applicable\nto your company.\n\n234\n00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,980\nAnd so you might look at it and say yeah,\nI think it's great that they've got this,\n\n235\n00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,680\nlet's say,\na requirements management function.\n\n236\n00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,440\nBut we're not a software\ndevelopment house,\n\n237\n00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,910\nwe don't deal with requirements in\nthat way, so it doesn't make sense.\n\n238\n00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,020\nSo we just leave that piece out, right.\n\n239\n00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,880\nAnd that's what you need to do.\n\n240\n00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,650\nYou pick and\nchoose the components you need, but\n\n241\n00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,040\nif you don't know all the components\nhow do you know which ones to pick?\n\n242\n00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,780\nAnd so it's that person at the expert and\n\n243\n00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,970\nmaster level they're the ones\nthat are gonna know that.\n\n244\n00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,690\nAnd we usually see them in\ncontractor adviser type roles\n\n245\n00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,160\nwhere they're going out and\nhelping organizations.\n\n246\n00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,930\nOnce your implementation is in place\n\n247\n00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,840\nyou don't normally have to change\nit unless something new happens.\n\n248\n00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,790\nAnd there are updates and\nchanges over time.\n\n249\n00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,890\nBut it's not a regular thing.\n\n250\n00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,990\nIt's not like a full time job.\n\n251\n00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,360\nAll right, so\nthat's the certification scheme, and\n\n252\n00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,050\nwe are just starting out right here, ITIL\nfoundation, basic foundation knowledge.\n\n253\n00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,730\nAll right, now on their site,\nif you go into the ITIL Foundation page,\n\n254\n00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,710\nthey actually have\nthe syllabus that's available.\n\n255\n00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,580\nYou can go and download it and\n\n256\n00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,300\nit'll show you all of the different things\nthat are going to be covered on the exam.\n\n257\n00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,160\nNow the syllabus is not the easiest\nthing to read, because they were very,\n\n258\n00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,390\nvery thorough.\n\n259\n00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,820\nSo let me just pull it up here.\n\n260\n00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,400\nLet me get to the top.\n\n261\n00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,435\nAll right, so when you pull up the\nsyllabus for it, what it's laying out is\n\n262\n00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:45,245\nreally the information that people\nlike us use to create these courses.\n\n263\n00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:48,543\nThe stuff we need to cover because\nit's going to be on the exam.\n\n264\n00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:53,332\nAnd so when list it they're laying\nit all out in here based on\n\n265\n00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,522\nsections inside of their books.\n\n266\n00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:59,212\nAnd the ITIL framework,\nthe one that we deal with,\n\n267\n00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:03,342\nthe service framework, is really\nbuilt up of five different books.\n\n268\n00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,202\nAnd so with each of these objectives that\nthey list, there's a little note down\n\n269\n00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,662\nhere at the end, and\nits telling you what book to look in.\n\n270\n00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:13,132\nSo, this one's in the Service Strategy\nbook, versus one that might be in\n\n271\n00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:17,530\nthe Service Design, or whatever,\nthe different books that we've got.\n\n272\n00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,030\nSo it's just laying out all the different\nthings that you need to know.\n\n273\n00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,460\nAnd you'll normally see concepts and\n\n274\n00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,830\nprocesses all kinda listed that\nyou've gotta be familiar with.\n\n275\n00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,600\nSome of them will say hey,\nthere should actually be an hour and\n\n276\n00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,090\na half of training on\nthese topics right here.\n\n277\n00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,890\nOther ones might not have\nanytime attached to them at all.\n\n278\n00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,910\nSo for example as I go down here.\n\n279\n00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,240\nI'll find one here, this one.\n\n280\n00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,060\nAnd it's just saying that,\n\n281\n00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,050\nhey these things you're gonna cover\nthem as part of covering other things.\n\n282\n00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,700\nSo, you don't need to dedicate it, but you\nshould be able to look down this list and\n\n283\n00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400\nknow what these elements\nare to understand them.\n\n284\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,830\nSo, if you get a question on the exam\nabout a known error database.\n\n285\n00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,550\nYou probably need to know what\na known error database is, don't you?\n\n286\n00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,290\nBut you're gonna learn about that\nas part of some of the other\n\n287\n00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,750\nprocesses we go through.\n\n288\n00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,110\nSo the outline is not the most\nterribly easy thing to work with.\n\n289\n00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,640\nAnd you'll find during the show\nwe've made our own outline.\n\n290\n00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,760\nWe've rearranged all of this to\nmake a little more sense, and\n\n291\n00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,370\nkind of divide it up in a way\nthat it's easier to handle.\n\n292\n00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,990\nBut the best part of this brochure\nis actually on the very last page.\n\n293\n00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,790\nIf we go all the way to the end\nit tells us about the exam.\n\n294\n00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,410\nThe exam is a multiple choice exam.\n\n295\n00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,160\nSo, you'll have 40 questions and\nthey've got A, B, C, D answers,\n\n296\n00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240\nyou read the question,\nyou choose your answers.\n\n297\n00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,340\nSo it's a very straightforward exam,\nno tricks or anything like that,\n\n298\n00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,980\njust straightforward whether you\nknow the information or not.\n\n299\n00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,020\nThey have an exam pool that is\nwell over 300 questions and so\n\n300\n00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,120\nwhen you take that exam it's possible\ntwo people could be sitting right\n\n301\n00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,390\nnext to each other and\nnot have a single question in common.\n\n302\n00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,635\nSo if you take the exam more than\nonce do not count on seeing the same\n\n303\n00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:51,589\nquestions again.\n\n304\n00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,844\nStatistically you're probably\ngonna see a couple again, but\n\n305\n00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:58,341\nyou could see a completely new exam.\n\n306\n00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:01,017\nJust kind of depends on how\nyour odds fall that day.\n\n307\n00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:04,814\nSo, 40 questions, you use 60 minutes,\nso not a terribly long amount of time,\n\n308\n00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,514\nthat's over a minute per question.\n\n309\n00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:10,250\nIf you read an answer, it is not stressed.\n\n310\n00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,990\nWhen I took mine, I finished in\nthirty five or forty minutes.\n\n311\n00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,750\nYou have plenty of time.\n\n312\n00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,110\nI did not feel pressured when I did mine.\n\n313\n00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,480\nIf English is not your native language,\n\n314\n00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,680\nbecause that is the language\nthe exam is proctored in, they have\n\n315\n00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,110\nconverted it over to other languages\ntoo but not every language is covered.\n\n316\n00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,840\nSo if you want to take the exam\nin a language that's not offered\n\n317\n00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,250\nthey do offer you 15 extra minutes.\n\n318\n00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,330\nAnd that's just to help because it's tough\nto take an exam in a different language.\n\n319\n00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,900\nThere are no real prerequisites for\nthis one.\n\n320\n00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,890\nThey do recommend that you do\nofficial ITIL Foundation Training.\n\n321\n00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,200\nYou know,\nkind of like what our show is going to be.\n\n322\n00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,420\nNow our show is not,\nwe're not accredited by ITIL.\n\n323\n00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,000\nSo, for any of the higher level training,\n\n324\n00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,230\nyou absolutely have to be accredited\nby ITIL, so we won't do those.\n\n325\n00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,320\nBut on the foundation side,\nyou can do your training wherever.\n\n326\n00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,940\nAnd that's what they say, it's\nrecommended, but is not a prerequisite.\n\n327\n00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,140\nThe exam is supervised and\nI'll talk more about that in a minute.\n\n328\n00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,150\nIt used to be that you had to\ntake the exam in person and\n\n329\n00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,560\nthat's changed a lot over the years.\n\n330\n00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,165\nSo it's supervised electronically now so\nit's a little bit different.\n\n331\n00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:18,545\nIt is not open book.\n\n332\n00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:22,563\nThe knowledge needs to be in your head,\nand you've got to score a 65% to pass.\n\n333\n00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:26,045\nYou've got to get 26 questions out of 40,\n\n334\n00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,485\nand that's not the hardest\nbar in the world to hit.\n\n335\n00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,835\nSo I find this is a really friendly exam.\n\n336\n00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:33,115\nAnd that's because it's\nthat starting point, right?\n\n337\n00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,855\nIt's just high level information.\n\n338\n00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:37,355\nYou'll find the exams get a lot harder\n\n339\n00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,615\nwhen you move up to\nthe intermediate level.\n\n340\n00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,300\nAll right.\nSo that's the basics on the exam.\n\n341\n00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,860\nA few other pieces we might want to\nthrow out here is how do we take it?\n\n342\n00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,690\nAnd you've got a few choices.\n\n343\n00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,270\nLike most of our exams, we can go and\n\n344\n00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,290\ntake it at a regular testing center,\nright Ronnie?\n\n345\n00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,380\n>> Right. Yeah. You can go to your Pearson\nVUE testing center to be able to do so.\n\n346\n00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,267\nIf you take a look online and\ngo to vue.com,\n\n347\n00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:03,170\nV U E.com, that normally will bring\nyou into the view testing center, and\n\n348\n00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,080\nthen you'll be able to select from\nthat list and be able to register.\n\n349\n00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,750\nAnd you'll probably have to go through\na little bit more registration than normal\n\n350\n00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,260\nbecause they'll give you another exam\nnumber that you'll have to keep track of.\n\n351\n00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,670\nBut once you get in there you\njust follow the steps along and\n\n352\n00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,780\nyou'll be able to register there.\n\n353\n00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,190\nBut that's not the neatest\nway to take the exam.\n\n354\n00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,680\nThe other way is the one that\nDon's about to show you.\n\n355\n00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,820\n>> Now remember how I mentioned AXELOS and\nhow they're running the show.\n\n356\n00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,460\nAnd they determine what testing\nproviders you're allowed to test with.\n\n357\n00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,110\nAnd so they've got approved\norganizations around the globe.\n\n358\n00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,870\nAnd for us here in the U.S.\n\n359\n00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,190\nI always found the easiest one to work\nwith is an organization called EXIN.\n\n360\n00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,330\nAnd E X I N.\n\n361\n00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,840\nAnd EXIN they do testing,\npartnered with Pearson VUE.\n\n362\n00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,660\nSo you can go to any VUE center,\nwhich they're all over the world.\n\n363\n00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,860\nThere are other organizations that do it,\nthough.\n\n364\n00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,320\nLet me pull up the official page here.\n\n365\n00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,640\nSo here's the AXELOS page that\nlists their Examination Institutes.\n\n366\n00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,050\nAnd you'll see other companies.\n\n367\n00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,650\nAPMG, there's EXN, PEOPLECERT.\n\n368\n00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,730\nSo pick whichever one is convenient for\nyou if you want to go down and take it.\n\n369\n00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,450\nBut the EXN guys, and some of the other\nguys do this too, but I tested in EXN so\n\n370\n00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:11,320\nthat is the one I know best, the EXN guys\nactually have something really neat.\n\n371\n00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,030\nIf you go to their website,\nthey'll provide information about ITIL.\n\n372\n00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,255\nSo here's the XIN website.\n\n373\n00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,050\nXIN.com.\n\n374\n00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,830\nAnd you'll see information about ITIL.\n\n375\n00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,490\nI guess I could have saved time on\nthat brochure and used their diagram.\n\n376\n00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,740\nBut they lay out the foundation\ncertification and\n\n377\n00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,910\nall the certifications too.\n\n378\n00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,740\nYou'll see there's quite a bit of them.\n\n379\n00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,840\nBut basically we see\ntheir information here.\n\n380\n00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,500\nWe learn about it.\n\n381\n00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,280\nWhatever.\n\n382\n00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,240\nAnd then when you're ready to go and\ntake the exam they've got where you\n\n383\n00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,050\ncan pull up the information on\nthe exam and sign up for it.\n\n384\n00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,090\nAnd you can jump over\nto view at that point.\n\n385\n00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,460\nAnd you register to take the EXIN ITIL\nfoundation exam through you.\n\n386\n00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,800\nTake it wherever you want.\n\n387\n00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,010\nBut they also have this new thing\nthat's called EXIN ANYWHERE.\n\n388\n00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,910\nAnd with EXIN ANYWHERE, you can take\nthe exam right from your own computer.\n\n389\n00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,480\nSo you can be at your home or office,\nand not have to go anywhere, and\n\n390\n00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,080\njust take the exam right there, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,530\nNow if you do that,\nthey have a little test they make you do.\n\n392\n00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,320\nSo if I hit like book my exam now, it'll\nsay that you need to test your computer\n\n393\n00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,350\nto make sure that it meets\nthe requirements, all right.\n\n394\n00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,820\nOne of the main requirements, is that it\ndoes require a microphone and camera.\n\n395\n00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,690\nRemember this is a supervised exam.\n\n396\n00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,170\nAnd while there won't be a living\nperson sitting there watching you.\n\n397\n00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,970\nThey do record.\n\n398\n00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,410\nAnd so it is watching you\nwhile you take the exam.\n\n399\n00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,040\nSo it will see if you used your book.\n\n400\n00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,720\nIf you had somebody standing behind\nyou telling you the answers.\n\n401\n00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,910\nThat will get recorded.\n\n402\n00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,970\nAnd they might not audit it today.\n\n403\n00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,950\nBut they'll audit it eventually,\nand when they do,\n\n404\n00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,780\nthey will see that there was cheating or\nwhatever.\n\n405\n00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,230\nSo it is just as good as\na proctored exam in person.\n\n406\n00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,290\nSo, they make you do that test, and it is\njust going to check your hardware to make\n\n407\n00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,100\nsure you have the various requirements,\nso it is checking for each of those and\n\n408\n00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,120\nit's a straight forward process if you've\ngot the equipment it'll run through and\n\n409\n00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480\ndo the test.\n\n410\n00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,910\nIt tells you what to do here.\n\n411\n00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,100\nI'm going to allow that.\n\n412\n00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,570\nAnd so it sees me.\n\n413\n00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,100\nHi.\n\n414\n00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,700\nSo, it's just checking to make sure\nI'm there and that it can see me.\n\n415\n00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,090\nThere we go.\nSo, it picked it up.\n\n416\n00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,890\nAnd it's just going to\ncontinue on this little wizard\n\n417\n00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,450\nas it identifies whether I've got\na microphone, in speakers and so on.\n\n418\n00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,060\nAnd it's checking my audio right now.\n\n419\n00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,820\nSo it heard me talking and so on.\n\n420\n00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,430\nOnce that's done you can sign up for\nthe eggs and\n\n421\n00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,720\nanywhere exam and you can take\nit right from your own computer.\n\n422\n00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,190\nSo that's pretty cool.\n\n423\n00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,490\nYou can get your ITIL Foundation\nwithout even leaving the house.\n\n424\n00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,070\nAll right.\n\n425\n00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,240\nOh, it's trying to play audio right now.\n\n426\n00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,190\nI'm going to close this.\n\n427\n00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,870\nWell, I guess it passed it, didn't it?\n\n428\n00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,980\nWell, we'll let it finish I guess.\n\n429\n00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,300\nAll right, few other things to mention.\n\n430\n00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,320\nIf you take the exam through VUE,\nwe're going to go U.S.\n\n431\n00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600\nbecause most of our viewers are U.S.\n\n432\n00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,440\nbut understand that your different\ncurrencies are priced different ways, but\n\n433\n00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,360\nhere in the U.S. with Pearson VUE\nit's $208 to take the exam, which is\n\n434\n00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,570\nmore than some, but less than a lot of\ncertifications that are out there today.\n\n435\n00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,540\nNow if we do the EXIN anywhere,\nif you take it online,\n\n436\n00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,860\nit's more expensive, it's $226.\n\n437\n00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,420\nAnd there's various reasons for that,\nmainly the remote viewing, and so on.\n\n438\n00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,780\nThe convenience, too.\n\n439\n00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,480\nBut also keep in mind that\nif you're a European tester,\n\n440\n00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,890\nthen they do have to attach that to that,\nand so it might get more expensive.\n\n441\n00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,730\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n442\n00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,780\nThe pricing can be subject to change, but\nas of right now, right before the show\n\n443\n00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,210\nit was $208 to take it in person,\n$226 US dollars to take it online.\n\n444\n00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,090\nAll right so that's pretty much it for\n\n445\n00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,220\ntaking the exam,\nlike I said it is pretty straight forward.\n\n446\n00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,750\nA few other things worth\nmentioning here before we wrap up.\n\n447\n00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,260\nThe ITIL framework itself is\ndivided amongst five books and\n\n448\n00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260\nwhen I say books I'm not using\na euphemism for something else.\n\n449\n00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,460\nI'm talking about actual books.\n\n450\n00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,720\nAnd let me bring up my outline real quick.\n\n451\n00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,290\nNot that one.\n\n452\n00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,230\nThis one.\n\n453\n00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,350\nHere's my quick outline that we'll be\nusing during the show as we go through.\n\n454\n00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,890\nAnd you'll see I've divided them\nup into these big sections.\n\n455\n00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,180\nService Strategy, Service Design,\nService Transition, Service Operation, and\n\n456\n00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,770\nContinual Service Improvement.\n\n457\n00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,120\nThose are not names that I made up.\n\n458\n00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,990\nThose are books.\n\n459\n00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,380\nSo with ITO they have a physical book\ncalled Continual Service Improvement.\n\n460\n00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,530\nAnd in it is the entire framework for\n\n461\n00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,080\nhow to properly implement\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n462\n00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,470\nNow the books are huge.\n\n463\n00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,070\nThey are 300-400 pages each.\n\n464\n00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,460\nSome of them are a little bit longer.\n\n465\n00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,980\nThey're pretty expensive too.\n\n466\n00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,940\nThe whole set of five books will run\nyou a little over 500 US dollars.\n\n467\n00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,850\nSo they're not inexpensive books.\n\n468\n00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,070\nWe don't need to know the whole book for\nITIL foundation.\n\n469\n00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,990\nWe just need to know\nwhat's in those books.\n\n470\n00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,020\nRight.\nThe general concepts around them.\n\n471\n00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,590\nSo we'll break it down this way,\nall right?\n\n472\n00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,310\nSo each of these are the different\ncomponents that we're going to go through\n\n473\n00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,170\nas we're learning what ITIL is and\n\n474\n00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,220\nwhat areas contain what functionality,\nall right.\n\n475\n00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,190\nSo that's important to keep in\nmind as we get ready to study and\n\n476\n00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,520\nwe get ready to move into that.\n\n477\n00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,880\nAnd then when we take the certification\nit will be pulling from all these areas.\n\n478\n00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,050\nYou know, I feel like I'm\nleaving something out, Ronnie,\n\n479\n00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,830\nthere was something else I wanted\nto mention here at the end.\n\n480\n00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,920\n>> I don't know of any.\n\n481\n00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,040\n>> You can't read my mind?\n\n482\n00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,770\nShoot.\n\n483\n00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,435\nWell, I can't read my own mind either.\n\n484\n00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:07,970\n[LAUGH] Seems like there was one\nmore thing I wanted to mention,\n\n485\n00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,990\nbut I guess we'll see that later.\n\n486\n00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,620\nSo, yes that's basically it.\n\n487\n00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,400\nOur show will cover all that you\nneed to know to pass the exam.\n\n488\n00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,930\nWhich is always important.\n\n489\n00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,750\nYou'll be able to jump in and\ntake that and\n\n490\n00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,770\nhopefully pass on\nthe first try if you study.\n\n491\n00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,460\nIt's not the most challenging\nexam that you'll encounter.\n\n492\n00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,900\nSo, which is kind of a pleasant\nsurprise compared to some of the ones\n\n493\n00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,410\nwe go through.\n\n494\n00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,200\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen\nthat's probably enough about ITIL.\n\n495\n00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,490\nIf that sounds like something\nthat you are interested in,\n\n496\n00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,130\nmaybe if you think that this is something\nthat you want to learn more about,\n\n497\n00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,896\nthen you're in the right place.\n\n498\n00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:44,270\nAnd you'll want to jump into our episodes,\nwhich, well by the time you see this,\n\n499\n00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,000\nmight be completed.\n\n500\n00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,100\nBut we're actually about to start\nhere in just a few minutes,\n\n501\n00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,132\nso I hope to see you there.\n\n502\n00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:53,166\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n4\n00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:38,684\ngood evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:41,296\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:42,190\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,920\nHow's it going Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,310\n>> It is going swell today.\n\n9\n00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,640\nI finished watching the entire\ncollection of Glee.\n\n10\n00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,750\nAnd so I'm ready for today's show.\n\n11\n00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,790\n>> That's normally the type of thing\nwe don't want people to find out about.\n\n12\n00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,475\n>> That's true.\n\n13\n00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:55,910\n>> [LAUGH] Let's get that recorded.\n\n14\n00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,650\nI'm totally clipping out that and\nposting it on the web.\n\n15\n00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,150\n>> Yes.\n\n16\n00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,750\n>> All right.\n\n17\n00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,320\nLadies and gentlemen, we are kicking\noff our ITIL foundation today.\n\n18\n00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,120\nSo always fun to start a new\ncertification on the show.\n\n19\n00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,890\nWe always get excited about it.\n\n20\n00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,720\nWe're gonna be diving in.\n\n21\n00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,830\nThis is our introduction episode.\n\n22\n00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,880\nWe're gonna take a look at what\nthe ITIL foundation certification is.\n\n23\n00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,110\nAnd what we need to know to\nbe successful on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,600\nFor a lot of you viewers this will\nbe your first exposure to ITIL.\n\n25\n00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,980\nMany of you may have heard the term thrown\naround or seen it as a requirement on\n\n26\n00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,420\na job posting but\nnot had actual exposure to the process.\n\n27\n00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,270\nAnd so this is the starting point.\n\n28\n00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,160\nThis is the very beginning for\nsomeone learning and\n\n29\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,620\ntaking that first step on a career\nthat involves the ITIL frame.\n\n30\n00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,160\nLet's start.\n\n31\n00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,470\nAt the very beginning.\n\n32\n00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,040\nWhat the heck is ITIL?\n\n33\n00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,780\nIt stands for the Information\nTechnology Industry Library.\n\n34\n00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,670\nAlthough you'll never\nhear anybody say that.\n\n35\n00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,720\nThey just call it ITIL.\n\n36\n00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,060\nAnd what it is a collection of\n\n37\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,530\nadvice that helps you to build up\nthe IT department for a company.\n\n38\n00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,160\nAll right?\n\n39\n00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,830\nAnd it really stems from things\nthat happened earlier on.\n\n40\n00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,600\nBack in the 1980s, it was really uncommon\nfor companies to have an IT department.\n\n41\n00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,580\nIf you had computers at all,\nit was usually mainframe based, and\n\n42\n00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,480\nyou relied on the vendors\nlike IBM to support it.\n\n43\n00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,220\nAnd so\nyou didn't normally have an IT department.\n\n44\n00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,360\nIf you did, it was a copy repair man,\nit wasn't computers.\n\n45\n00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,150\nWell, in the 90s, having an IT\ndepartment became pretty common.\n\n46\n00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,200\nAnd a lot of organizations were\nhaving to figure out how to run that.\n\n47\n00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,880\nHow do you run an IT department?\n\n48\n00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,620\nHow do you properly deal with the finances\nand the expenses, the operations,\n\n49\n00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,400\npicking what services people want and\nwhich ones not to, and\n\n50\n00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,752\nso the IT framework was\ncreated to help with that.\n\n51\n00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:47,235\nTo say you're going to\nhave an IT department?\n\n52\n00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,945\nHere's some of the things\nyou should consider doing.\n\n53\n00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:53,085\nAnd it is a collection\nof a ton of information.\n\n54\n00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,615\nAnd it saves you from having\nto reinvent the wheel.\n\n55\n00:02:56,615 --> 00:03:00,305\nWhy go through that process of creating\nan all new IT management structure,\n\n56\n00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,730\nwhen other people have done it,\nand been very successful with it.\n\n57\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n58\n00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,690\nThe British government is the one that\nreally started off the idea of coming up\n\n59\n00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:13,250\nwith ITIL, because of all of the different\nways that their departments within\n\n60\n00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,430\nthe British government were starting\nto say that they needed IT departments.\n\n61\n00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,790\nBut they didn't know exactly what to do.\n\n62\n00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,240\nSo everybody started coming\nout with their own model.\n\n63\n00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,870\nAnd what ended up happening\nthey said wait a minute.\n\n64\n00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,810\nWe've got to actually do what\nwe call best practices on this.\n\n65\n00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,430\nBecause if we don't,\nwe're gonna end up with so\n\n66\n00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,360\nmany little departments,\nthey're not gonna be able to integrate.\n\n67\n00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,020\nThey're not gonna be able to communicate\nwith each other what the actual\n\n68\n00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,110\nproblem is.\n\n69\n00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,890\nSo when they came up with ITIL.\n\n70\n00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,840\nIt really did start out\nas a foundation model.\n\n71\n00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,270\nIt was a huge body of knowledge so big and\n\n72\n00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,690\nthey created so many different little\ntiny divisions of everything they needed.\n\n73\n00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,400\nAnd then they started kinda\nnarrowing it down and\n\n74\n00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,320\nrefocusing saying what's really important\nis what the end user really needs.\n\n75\n00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,070\nWhat the end user really wants or\nthe customer really ends up doing.\n\n76\n00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,550\nSo this is really a customer oriented type\nof framework that we're talking about.\n\n77\n00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,870\n>> And the nice thing about it being\na frame work is that means you get to pick\n\n78\n00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,950\nand choose the components that you want.\n\n79\n00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,200\nWhen you read through\none of the ITIL manuals,\n\n80\n00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,450\nyou'll see there is a ton of stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,570\nAnd some of it does not apply\nto your company and that's okay.\n\n82\n00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,150\nYou leave those parts out.\n\n83\n00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,530\nYou take the parts you need,\n\n84\n00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,630\nthe parts that apply to your company and\nyou use those and you use them to help\n\n85\n00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,240\nguarantee that you're doing things at\nleast within the best practices model.\n\n86\n00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,460\nAnd then the parts that don't apply to\nyour company you just leave out and\n\n87\n00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,270\nyou don't worry about them.\n\n88\n00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,300\nSo while it can look very daunting in\nthe beginning, it's a lot of information,\n\n89\n00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,600\nyou'll usually only apply a subset of\nit and it typically goes really well.\n\n90\n00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,670\nNow Ronnie,\nyou mentioned the United Kingdom and\n\n91\n00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,030\nthis is where this all came out of.\n\n92\n00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,710\nSo it is a product of Great Britain.\n\n93\n00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,290\nI always mix up the terms for the country.\n\n94\n00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,290\nWe're here in the United States and\nour understanding of British government is\n\n95\n00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,322\npoor at best if you've read\nany of our history books.\n\n96\n00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,860\n[LAUGH] It is a product\nof the UK government.\n\n97\n00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,980\nBut it is something that's\navailable to the entire world.\n\n98\n00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,920\nAnd we've seen a lot of acceptance\nin other places, like right here in\n\n99\n00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,410\nthe United States, where on\nthe West Coast it is really common for\n\n100\n00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,880\ncompanies to use the ITIL framework to\ndictate how their IT departments operate,\n\n101\n00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,690\nand integrate inside of a company.\n\n102\n00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,070\nSo even if you're in Asia,\nAfrica, Australia,\n\n103\n00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,250\nwherever just because this is\na product of the UK doesn't mean\n\n104\n00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,680\nit's not gonna be something used in\nyour country, so keep that in mind.\n\n105\n00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,220\nBut it also means that it gets\nreally confusing to figure out\n\n106\n00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,550\nwho's making this stuff available.\n\n107\n00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,890\nBecause it was developed by the government\nit was originally controlled by what was\n\n108\n00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,320\ncalled the Office of\nGovernment Commerce or the OGC.\n\n109\n00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,100\nAnd that's a element of the UK government.\n\n110\n00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,990\nAnd they're the ones who basically\nbound all this information together and\n\n111\n00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,560\nstarting dealing with the various\nparties that handle ITIL.\n\n112\n00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,540\nNow England, or the United Kingdom,\n\n113\n00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,090\nis not a communist government, so it's\nnot like they run businesses themselves.\n\n114\n00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,550\nA lot of this gets contracted\nout to other entities, so\n\n115\n00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,020\nyou'll see more company names mentioned\nin there other than the UK government and\n\n116\n00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,080\nthat's where the line starts to get\na little blurred and it gets confusing.\n\n117\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,290\nI know when I first started with ITIL I\nhad a really challenging time when I'd\n\n118\n00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,300\ngo out on the internet and do searches for\n\n119\n00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,270\ninformation and I would see websites and\nnot know if they were real.\n\n120\n00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,240\nIs this really the actual ITIL site or\n\n121\n00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,620\nis this some other person that just\nbought up their own ITIL site.\n\n122\n00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,590\nI don't know.\n\n123\n00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,390\nAnd so they've really had to make a big\npush to tighten up on that, to make\n\n124\n00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,640\nsure that all the information was really\nrestricted down to a handful of vendors.\n\n125\n00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,650\nWhat the UK government did,\n\n126\n00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,750\nis they created a partnership\nwith a private entity.\n\n127\n00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,390\nSo you kind of spun off a separate\ncompany that is not the government.\n\n128\n00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,470\nIt's not a private company.\n\n129\n00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,660\nBut it's a partnership or\na cooperation between two.\n\n130\n00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,480\nAnd so the new company that runs\nthis is a company called Axelos.\n\n131\n00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,810\nAnd when you go out on the Internet and\nyou start searching for\n\n132\n00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,460\ninformation on ITIL, anytime you see\nAxelos, A-X-E-L-O-S, when you see\n\n133\n00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,590\nthat name right there you know that\nyou're on the official ITIL information.\n\n134\n00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,290\nIn fact, for\nyears the actual web address for\n\n135\n00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,080\nthe ITIL site was this,\nwww.itil-officialsite.com.\n\n136\n00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,770\nAnd I know, it sounds kind of funny.\n\n137\n00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,170\nBut it says it's official right there,\nso it's got to be official.\n\n138\n00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,720\nWhen you go to that,\nit really just redirects now.\n\n139\n00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,660\nIf I type in that URL and hit Enter, see\nhow it just changed to axelos.com/itil.\n\n140\n00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,440\nAxelos is the organization\nthat is in complete and\n\n141\n00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,410\ntotal control of the ITIL framework today.\n\n142\n00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,002\nNow it's a partnership between, actually\ntwo different companies that you usually\n\n143\n00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:47,880\nwon't see their name mentioned\nanywhere on the site.\n\n144\n00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,337\nAxelos does a great job\nwith their branding and\n\n145\n00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,671\nmaking sure they don't create confusion.\n\n146\n00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:57,117\nBut it's a partnership between\nthey call it the HM government,\n\n147\n00:07:57,117 --> 00:08:02,304\nher majesty's government, so\nthe government arm of the United Kingdom,\n\n148\n00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,963\nand another company called Taffeta.\n\n149\n00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,296\nAnd you'll see Taffeta PLC which is.\n\n150\n00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:11,453\nA public limited company, so\nCapita is more of a private type\n\n151\n00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:15,867\norganization that is working in\ntandem with the UK government.\n\n152\n00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:18,801\nAnd that way they can do sales, and\nrevenue, and all that stuff that\n\n153\n00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,190\nthe government does not normally do,\nbecause there's not a communist.\n\n154\n00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,740\nSo [LAUGH] I'm sure that there's other\npolitical models that do that too, but\n\n155\n00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,760\nbasically that's what theses entities are.\n\n156\n00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,880\nMost of us won't ever have\nto deal with that though.\n\n157\n00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,090\nAXELOS should be your primary source\nof information, regarding ITIL.\n\n158\n00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,980\nWhen you sit down, and take that ITIL\nexam, the questions, the data that's being\n\n159\n00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,860\ncovered on that exam, has all been\ndesigned and set forth by AXELOS.\n\n160\n00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,970\nBut then, they in turn partner with other\ncompanies to handle things like training,\n\n161\n00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,740\ncourse development,\nexam proctoring, and so on.\n\n162\n00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,910\nSo, you might be where you find yourself\ndealing with information from AXELOS, but\n\n163\n00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,360\nyou never actually pay them a single dime.\n\n164\n00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,960\nAnd instead you deal\nwith other organizations.\n\n165\n00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,395\nAnd I'm a great example of that, where all\nthe various books that I've purchased over\n\n166\n00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:11,330\nthe years for ITIL,\nI bought them all from Amazon.com.\n\n167\n00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,500\nThat's where I bought them.\n\n168\n00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,810\nAnd the exams I usually take through\na testing vendor named EXIN.\n\n169\n00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,730\nAnd EXIN is not AXELOS, but\n\n170\n00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,850\nAXELOS has authorized EXIN to\nproctor exams on their behalf.\n\n171\n00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,400\nSo you may develop a very\nclose relationship with\n\n172\n00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,350\none of these directly approved\npartners as you go and get certified.\n\n173\n00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,700\nIn fact, here we're covering\nthe ITIL Foundation certification.\n\n174\n00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,960\nIt's your starting point.\n\n175\n00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,530\nAnd you can do your\nITIL Foundation training anywhere.\n\n176\n00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,220\nSo we're doing it right here on ITProTV.\n\n177\n00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,100\nBut, ITProTV is not one of the officially\naccredited vendors that AXELOS deals with,\n\n178\n00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,550\nthey don't even know who we are.\n\n179\n00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,098\nAnd so, we're not allowed to do\nany of the higher level training.\n\n180\n00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:57,227\nIf you wanna go to the intermediate and\nhigher levels,\n\n181\n00:09:57,227 --> 00:10:01,600\nyou've gotta go to an official,\naccredited, authorized AXELOS vendor.\n\n182\n00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720\nAnd if I remember correctly,\n\n183\n00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,870\nthey won't even let you take\nthe exam unless you do that.\n\n184\n00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,010\nSo even if you study independently,\nyou can't take the exam.\n\n185\n00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,128\nSo it is important to do that.\n\n186\n00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,118\nAnd if that is what you're looking for\n\n187\n00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:16,170\nit's important to understand that this\ncourse is fine for ITIL Foundation.\n\n188\n00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,377\nBut you won't be able to\ncontinue on with ITProTV if you\n\n189\n00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,765\nwanna move into\nthe advanced tiers of ITIL.\n\n190\n00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,789\nAll right now,\nas far as the kind of creation structure,\n\n191\n00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:29,000\nthat's really all we need to know there.\n\n192\n00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,020\nThe AXELOS site is really handy,\naxelos.com/itil.\n\n193\n00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,022\nThey have tons of information\nyou can find out there.\n\n194\n00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,614\nWe're gonna summarize a lot of it\nhere in this introduction though,\n\n195\n00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,027\njust to make sure that you guys know\nit and you don't have to go and\n\n196\n00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:42,370\nread all the different PDFs that\nare available on their site.\n\n197\n00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,360\nNow before we dive into all of that,\nlet's talk a little bit about history.\n\n198\n00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,180\nRonnie, you mentioned these all of\nthis kicked off in the 80s, and\n\n199\n00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,350\nthere's a big reason for that.\n\n200\n00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,760\nRonnie, do you know what it was in\nthe 80s that kind of spurred this along?\n\n201\n00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,088\n>> I don't remember exactly what it was,\n\n202\n00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:59,770\nis there a specific\nincident connected with it?\n\n203\n00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,640\n>> It's not totally specific,\nit is just a thing that was happening.\n\n204\n00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,750\nSo, it was the transition from mainframes\nto distributed computing, right?\n\n205\n00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,760\nSo in the 80s, most companies,\n\n206\n00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,330\nif you had computers your computers\nwere just dummy terminals.\n\n207\n00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,070\nAnd they connect it to a mainframe.\n\n208\n00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,010\nAnd that mainframe,\nyou developed software on it, and so on.\n\n209\n00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,824\nAnd that was basically what people did.\n\n210\n00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:21,940\nAnd if you needed a product you\nusually didn't develop it in-house.\n\n211\n00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,840\nYou contacted a vendor and\npurchased it and that was it.\n\n212\n00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,540\nSo there wasn't a lot of room for\nmistake in that model.\n\n213\n00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,020\nYou really couldn't go wrong cuz it\nwasn't you developing the technology.\n\n214\n00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,990\nBut, towards the end of the 80s,\n\n215\n00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,210\ndistributed computing\nbecame a lot more common.\n\n216\n00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,270\nWhere instead of a dummy terminal sitting\nat my desk, just a screen and a keyboard,\n\n217\n00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,300\nnot an actual computer,\nwe started to see actual computers.\n\n218\n00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,800\nPeople had desktops.\n\n219\n00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,030\nThe IBM PS2 really was catching on,\nand other computers of that day.\n\n220\n00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,820\nUntil you get to today, where it's\nactually uncommon to have a mainframe.\n\n221\n00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,510\nIn the new distributed model, you have\nto invest in a lot of infrastructure.\n\n222\n00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,060\nYou won't just have one mainframe.\n\n223\n00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,620\nYou may have hundreds\nof individual servers.\n\n224\n00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,810\nAnd you might have, not just the same\ndummy terminal deployed a thousand times.\n\n225\n00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,200\nYou might have 1,000 individual PCs that\ncould all be doing something different.\n\n226\n00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,010\nIt becomes a lot more challenging\nto operate in that environment.\n\n227\n00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,560\nAnd so that's what really\nkicked off ITIL was saying,\n\n228\n00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,630\nthings are about to get really complex.\n\n229\n00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,640\nAnd most people are not equipped to\ndevelop a proper framework from scratch.\n\n230\n00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,060\nSo let's help out.\n\n231\n00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,650\nSo ITIL started development\nway back in the 1980s.\n\n232\n00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,082\nNow it wasn't called ITIL originally,\n\n233\n00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,200\nit had a few different\nnames that bounced around.\n\n234\n00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,320\nSo we didn't really see ITIL in\nits modern form until in the 90s.\n\n235\n00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,700\nSo you saw the initial releases of ITIL,\nand you mentioned it earlier Ronnie,\n\n236\n00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,180\nthe original version of\nITIL was pretty big.\n\n237\n00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,550\n>> Yeah.\nIt was something like 30, 40 volumes, and\n\n238\n00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,810\nmaybe even up to 50 volumes\nwhen they first started out.\n\n239\n00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,128\nBecause everybody wanted to make sure that\ntheir little piece of the pie got into\n\n240\n00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,680\nthis framework.\n\n241\n00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,710\nBut then when they started looking\nat the fundamentals, at the idea of\n\n242\n00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,100\ndeveloping a framework they realized,\nwe're not trying to be practice-specific.\n\n243\n00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,790\nWe're not trying to zoom in\non one particular vendor.\n\n244\n00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,280\nWhat we want is something that\ncan be actually provided across\n\n245\n00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,730\nentirety of companies,\nregardless of what they're doing.\n\n246\n00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,650\nAnd so it's not one specific vendor,\n\n247\n00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,260\nit's not any proprietary information,\nor any one system.\n\n248\n00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,050\nAnd so they started dropping them,\nor I shouldn't say dropping,\n\n249\n00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,120\ncondensing them into what was\nonly essential the framework.\n\n250\n00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,930\nAnd that's why a lot of people like it.\n\n251\n00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,660\nSo, that initial form nobody\nshould be using today.\n\n253\n00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,640\nThey don't even mention it\non the website anymore.\n\n254\n00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,810\nIt's basically like this\nforgotten thing that's gone away.\n\n255\n00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,380\nSo the first one that you'll really\nsee mentioned is ITIL Version 2.\n\n256\n00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,710\nAnd Version 2 is what did\nexactly what Ronnie said.\n\n257\n00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,170\nThey consolidated that library\ndown to a smaller set of data.\n\n258\n00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,180\nIt was still big though.\n\n259\n00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,320\nThere were still, was it 26 volumes?\n\n260\n00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,200\n>> Yeah, it was large, yeah.\n\n261\n00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,843\n>> It was still big, but\nit was a lot more generic.\n\n262\n00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,466\nAnd this is where it started\nto see better acceptance,\n\n263\n00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,411\ncuz now it was a little more manageable.\n\n264\n00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,118\nBut it was still big.\n\n265\n00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:11,100\nAnd that was, ITIL Version 2 came out\nin 2001, so that would be about 13,\n\n266\n00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,440\nalmost 14 years ago now.\n\n267\n00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,260\nSo, it was a good while ago.\n\n268\n00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,545\nWell, they continued that process,\nand said let's look at this and\n\n269\n00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:22,810\nlet's find where we've got some things\nthat just don't apply to too many people.\n\n270\n00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,574\nWe can exclude those.\n\n271\n00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:27,451\nAnd we've got other things we\ncan combine and move around, and\n\n272\n00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,410\nstart paying attention to job functions.\n\n273\n00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,350\nAnd so they retooled it a little more.\n\n274\n00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,110\nAnd in 2007 we had ITIL Version 3.\n\n275\n00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,390\nNow Version 3 consolidated\nthings a heck of a lot more.\n\n276\n00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,292\nAnd you ended up with,\nI believe it was like 11 volumes.\n\n277\n00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:46,320\nYou know, I think I still have the,\nlet me see if I have that image pulled up.\n\n278\n00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,150\nI've got the ITIL brochure\nstuck around here.\n\n279\n00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,120\nOh, not 11 volumes, 9 volumes.\n\n280\n00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,002\nSo, they basically condensed it down to\nthese nine volumes and I've got their,\n\n281\n00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,840\nthis is their certification scheme.\n\n282\n00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,956\nTheir certifications are built\naround the books that they produce.\n\n283\n00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:03,340\nAnd so you'll see the five that\nwe're gonna talk about in this show.\n\n284\n00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,270\nAnd then four others for\nadditional planning and strategy.\n\n285\n00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,260\nSo we've got these kind of laid out, and\nit was a much more manageable environment.\n\n286\n00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,920\nIf you wanted to deploy\nITIL in your organization,\n\n287\n00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920\nyou really just needed these\nfive volumes right here.\n\n288\n00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,860\nIt became, not a set that you'd ever wanna\nsit down and try and read cover to cover.\n\n289\n00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,560\nBut it was a manageable set of data\nthat didn't make you go crazy.\n\n290\n00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,285\nIt wasn't an encyclopedia set any more.\n\n291\n00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,465\nNow it was just five books, right?\n\n292\n00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:30,255\nSo much, much smaller.\n\n293\n00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:35,365\nAnd it was ITIL Version 3 that really\nwas the breakout moment for ITIL.\n\n294\n00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:39,821\nThat you saw it a lot in the UK\ngovernment prior to 2007.\n\n295\n00:15:39,821 --> 00:15:44,623\nBut when ITIL Version 3 was being\ndesigned, 2005, 2006, and when it was\n\n296\n00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:49,730\nratified in 2007, that's when you saw,\nhere in the US, I mean it really lit up.\n\n297\n00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,580\nCompanies loved it.\n\n298\n00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,950\nThey looked at it and said this is great!\n\n299\n00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,080\nInstead of us trying to\nfigure out what's right,\n\n300\n00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,500\nwe can use this as our framework and\njust kind of measure against it, and\n\n301\n00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,530\nsay all right,\nare we doing things this way?\n\n302\n00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,200\nNo.\n\n303\n00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,890\nWell, how do they recommend we do it?\n\n304\n00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,020\nMaybe that's a better way.\n\n305\n00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,591\nAll right, let's implement it that way and\ngive it a shot.\n\n306\n00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:09,382\nAnd when you're an ITIL Version 3 shop,\nthen if you hire employees and\n\n307\n00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:13,250\nthey already know ITIL Version 3 they\ncan snap right into your company.\n\n308\n00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,211\nThey know how things\nare supposed to be done.\n\n309\n00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:16,633\nAnd they go.\n\n310\n00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,530\nBut remember one important thing,\nITIL doesn't have all the answers.\n\n311\n00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,150\nYou see that mentioned a lot of web pages.\n\n312\n00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,450\nIt doesn't have all the answers.\n\n313\n00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,790\nAnd what they're saying is,\nthese are the best practices,\n\n314\n00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,570\nthese are some of the things\nyou should be doing.\n\n315\n00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,700\nThis is not 100% of what\nyou should be doing.\n\n316\n00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,660\nYou've got a company to run.\n\n317\n00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,660\nYou produce some kind of product or\nservice, you do something, right?\n\n318\n00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,590\nWell, we don't know\nwhat that something is.\n\n319\n00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,840\nSo we can't tell you how to do that.\n\n320\n00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,530\nIf you work for a car company,\nright, you work for Ford and\n\n321\n00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,150\nyou manufacture vehicles.\n\n322\n00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,180\nWell, I don't think, I haven't seen it,\nin any of the books,\n\n323\n00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,650\nthey never mention\nAutomotive manufacturing.\n\n324\n00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,700\nBecause they don't get specific like that.\n\n325\n00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,260\nSo there are things that will apply to\nyour company that they can't account for.\n\n326\n00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,990\nSo don't think that this is your\nstraight up guide to success.\n\n327\n00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:09,930\nAnd while it will improve the chance of\nyour company succeeding, companies fail.\n\n328\n00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,400\nAnd they can fail for\nall sorts of various reasons.\n\n329\n00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,280\nSo you could be completely complying\nto ITIL's framework and still fail.\n\n330\n00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,550\nIf you didn't properly budget funds,\nif you had fraud, if you had\n\n331\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,350\na product that sucked,\nthere's no way to get around that.\n\n332\n00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,780\nIf you're fully ITIL compliant but\n\n333\n00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,530\nyour product is garbage,\nthen who's going to buy that.\n\n334\n00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,030\nSo there's things that it can't overcome.\n\n335\n00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,960\nSo don't think that it's this magic\npill that will solve every ailment your\n\n336\n00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,370\ncompany has.\n\n337\n00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,620\nBut it will significantly\ndecrease the odds of you failing.\n\n338\n00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,870\nIf you're running your company properly,\nif you're assessing things the right way,\n\n339\n00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,660\nthen you'll avoid a lot of mistakes\nthat other companies make.\n\n340\n00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,470\nAll right, now.\n\n341\n00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,590\nITIL version three, that's what you'll\nhear a lot of people talk about.\n\n342\n00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,550\nVery widely deployed.\n\n343\n00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,450\nYou can find a lot of materials on it.\n\n344\n00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,670\nBut, that was in 2007.\n\n345\n00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,970\nIn 2011, it was revised again, all right?\n\n346\n00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,230\nNow, in previous revisions,\nthey were pretty significant.\n\n347\n00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,540\nA lot of books got eliminated,\ndata got consolidated.\n\n348\n00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,575\nAnd so\nwhen you were ITIL Version Two certified,\n\n349\n00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:15,515\nand then ITIL Version Three came out,\nyou had to take these bridge exams,\n\n350\n00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:18,205\nthese exams that would test you on\nthe differences between the two,\n\n351\n00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:21,970\nso that you could basically upgrade\nyourself to the new certification.\n\n352\n00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,720\nWell, with the 2011 revision,\nthe changes weren't as significant.\n\n353\n00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,820\nHere it was just kind of\nfine-tuning some various pieces.\n\n354\n00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,110\nAnd, so\nthey didn't do bridge exams on this one.\n\n355\n00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,000\nIn fact, if you were certified, they\ndidn't even require you to re-certify,\n\n356\n00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,050\nunless you were up at\nthe really higher levels.\n\n357\n00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,120\nSo, for most people that were certified\nwith ITIL, just kind of snap right in.\n\n358\n00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,370\nIt pretty much followed the same\nprocess with some tweaks.\n\n359\n00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,320\nSo instead of having ITIL version four,\nthey decided to call it the ITIL 2011.\n\n360\n00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,960\nOr you'll hear some people\nsay ITIL 2011 edition.\n\n361\n00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,440\nBut it's ITIL 2011 and\nthat's just referring to that revision.\n\n362\n00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,350\nAnd to avoid confusion.\n\n363\n00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,030\nThey went backwards and\nsaid let's rename version three.\n\n364\n00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,510\nSo instead of calling it ITIL version\nthree, we'll call it ITIL 2007.\n\n365\n00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,580\nSo when you're out there on the internet,\ndoing research.\n\n366\n00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,580\nITIL 2007 and ITIL version three,\nthose are the same thing.\n\n367\n00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,090\nThose terms can be used interchangeably.\n\n368\n00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,720\nBut ITIL 2011, that's the newest one.\n\n369\n00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,560\nAnd if you're going out there and\nbuying books or study materials,\n\n370\n00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,690\nyou want to make sure they say that\nthey were updated for ITIL 2011.\n\n371\n00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,190\nYou want to study the new stuff.\n\n372\n00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,200\nThe old books aren't bad.\n\n373\n00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,040\nThey still work.\n\n374\n00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,270\nBut you do want to have the revisions.\n\n375\n00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:35,130\n>> Yeah, a lot of the focus on the earlier\neditions of ITIL were really about\n\n376\n00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,130\nhere's what everybody we believe\nneeds to actually understand.\n\n377\n00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,620\nWhen we started going to the new\n2011 it did focus more on,\n\n378\n00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,290\nand the phrase I think is,\nthe aligning the business needs.\n\n379\n00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,720\nIn other words, aligning your\nIT company to the business need.\n\n380\n00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,370\nSo if you think about it, it actually\nturned out more business centric.\n\n381\n00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,190\nSo some of the terminology changed.\n\n382\n00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,340\nSo it actually did emphasize that\nis about what the customer wants.\n\n383\n00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,020\nNot about you,\n\n384\n00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,200\nRonnie as an IT director saying here's\nwhat my IT department should look like.\n\n385\n00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,780\n>> And that is a big problem.\n\n386\n00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,830\nA lot of organizations have it.\n\n387\n00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,610\nAnd I know I've experienced that myself.\n\n388\n00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,310\nFor example, I used to work for\nan insurance company.\n\n389\n00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,740\nSo if you're an insurance company,\nwhat do you do?\n\n390\n00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,300\nWhat does your company produce?\n\n391\n00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,230\nWhat does it sell?\n\n392\n00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,430\nWell, insurance policies.\n\n393\n00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,270\nNot a tangible good.\n\n394\n00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,160\nWe don't give them something.\n\n395\n00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,020\nI guess we could give them\na bunch of paper, but\n\n396\n00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,800\nyou don't really give them something.\n\n397\n00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,510\nBut an insurance policy,\nif something goes wrong for\n\n398\n00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,300\nthat person,\nwe'll cover the expenses, right?\n\n399\n00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,220\nSo Life insurance, car or auto insurance,\nhome owner's insurance, life insurance.\n\n400\n00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,820\nThat was what my company sold, right?\n\n401\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,860\nAnd for any body who worked in those\nareas, if you were a claims adjuster,\n\n402\n00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,760\nor a insurance agent, right, if you\nwere an agent you sold the insurance.\n\n403\n00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,170\nIf you were a claims adjuster,\nwhen people called and reported a problem,\n\n404\n00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,440\nyou evaluated how much\nmoney they should get.\n\n405\n00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,930\nAnd if you were in the accounting\ndepartment you'd cut a check\n\n406\n00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,990\nthat went to that person.\n\n407\n00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,860\nBut these are people that all\ndirectly contributed to insurance.\n\n408\n00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,695\nBut there I was.\n\n409\n00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,325\nWorking in the IT department.\n\n410\n00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:08,105\nAnd I was the network manager, so I was\njust running the network, the switches,\n\n411\n00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:12,125\nand routers, and making sure all\nthe various branches could see each other.\n\n412\n00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:14,597\nI didn't deal with the customer, did I?\n\n413\n00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:15,357\nNever.\n\n414\n00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,317\nI don't think I talked to a single\ncustomer the entire time I worked there.\n\n415\n00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:24,307\nI dealt internally, so my customer\nwasn't the same as the customer for\n\n416\n00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:25,317\nrest of the company.\n\n417\n00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,767\nThe IT department's\ncustomer is the company.\n\n418\n00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,207\nAnd so a lot of companies will look\nat the IT department as what's called\n\n419\n00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,490\na cost center.\n\n420\n00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,380\nWe don't generate profits,\nwe generate costs.\n\n421\n00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,550\nOur servers cost money,\nour routers cost money.\n\n422\n00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,110\nOur switches, our network connections.\n\n423\n00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,380\nThey all cost money.\n\n424\n00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,720\nWe don't make money.\n\n425\n00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,510\nVersus that agent that goes out there\nthemselves and they make money.\n\n426\n00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,060\nRight.\n\n427\n00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,310\nSo there's this disparity.\n\n428\n00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,420\nThis disconnect between IT and\nthe rest of the company.\n\n429\n00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,580\nIt's unfortunate.\n\n430\n00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,590\nSo what ITIL does it\nsays let's line this up.\n\n431\n00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,200\nSure you don't deal with the customer but\nyou do contributes to that right.\n\n432\n00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200\nIf you got a call center and\nyou got a bunch of\n\n433\n00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,840\nclaims adjusters in that call center and\nthey're using voice over IP phones.\n\n434\n00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,518\nWhat happens if the voice\nover IP phones go down?\n\n435\n00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:11,870\nWell they can;t take calls they\ncan't deal with the customer.\n\n436\n00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,340\nSo IT by creating that reliable\nvoice over IP network.\n\n437\n00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,010\nSupports the claims adjusters\nwhich support the customers.\n\n438\n00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,300\nSo we're kind of one step back.\n\n439\n00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,690\nAnd so with ITIL they encourage you\nto think of what's called the end to\n\n440\n00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,250\nend service.\n\n441\n00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,450\nThat the service you create may not be for\nthe customer.\n\n442\n00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,190\nAnd most companies look at that and they\nsay well every service we do should be\n\n443\n00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,320\nsomething that brings\nvalue to the customer.\n\n444\n00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,460\nThat's one of the things that ITIL\nspecifically puts in their manual.\n\n445\n00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,110\nYou should always be creating value for\nyour customer.\n\n446\n00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,000\nIf you have Voip phones\nversus analog phones,\n\n447\n00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,640\nwhat value does that\nbring to the customer?\n\n448\n00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,420\nIt's hard to measure that.\n\n449\n00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,760\nAnd it's because it's not.\n\n450\n00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,580\nIt's not bringing value to the customer\ndirectly, it's indirectly.\n\n451\n00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,010\nWe're bringing value to\nthe claims adjusters.\n\n452\n00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,950\nThey know that hey,\nif our analog phone lines go down,\n\n453\n00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,420\nwe can still do voice over\nIP over the internet, right?\n\n454\n00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,810\nSo their phones are available more often.\n\n455\n00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,510\nAnd having the phones available more often\nis what brings value to the customer.\n\n456\n00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,520\nThe customer knows anytime they call\nyour company they can get through and\n\n457\n00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,630\nthey don't get an all circuits is busy\nmessage because your lines are down.\n\n458\n00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,390\nSo we have to be able to look at that.\n\n459\n00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,980\nEverything we do inside of the IT\ndepartment should be, either directly or\n\n460\n00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,940\nindirectly, supporting something\nthat brings value to our customer.\n\n461\n00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,335\nAnd we need you'd be able to chart\nthat out, and a lot of people don't.\n\n462\n00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:33,825\nAnd you find your IT department\ndoing projects sometimes that don't\n\n463\n00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:38,835\nbring value to the customer, that they\njust pursue for no apparent reason.\n\n464\n00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,010\nYou know, maybe somebody's own initiative,\nor just something they felt like doing.\n\n465\n00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,800\nBut if it doesn't bring value to the\ncustomer then it's hard to measure that.\n\n466\n00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,560\nSo that's part of what ITIL helps to do.\n\n467\n00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,650\nCreate that more closer.\n\n468\n00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,280\nShould I do it, Ronnie?\n\n469\n00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,310\nShould I say the word synergy?\n\n470\n00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,000\n>> Synergy.\n\n471\n00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,830\n>> I hate the word.\n\n472\n00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,680\n>> Dude, you love it.\n\n473\n00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,720\n>> So let that synergy that relationship\nbetween the IT department and\n\n474\n00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,590\nthe rest of the business.\n\n475\n00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,340\nThat's what it's all about.\n\n476\n00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,125\n>> Meeting specific business\ngoals should be always part\n\n477\n00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:11,018\nof every department that's in your\ncompany including the IT department.\n\n478\n00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,878\nBut it may be very difficult\nif you don't always take\n\n479\n00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:16,803\nyour entire department such\nas your IT department and\n\n480\n00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:20,964\nsay look this is what we need to do to\nsupport the overall business function.\n\n481\n00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,614\nSo IT really does emphasize that in so\nmany different ways,\n\n482\n00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,151\nespecially in the terminology and\n\n483\n00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:28,550\nyou'll see that as we continue to cover\nsome of the different terminology.\n\n484\n00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,490\n>> All right, so\nwhen we deal with our IT department,\n\n485\n00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,590\nit is difficult to measure this stuff and\nso\n\n486\n00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,590\nyou'll see terms, we'll throw these\naround all throughout the show.\n\n487\n00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,150\nWe talk about services and\nwe talk about supporting services.\n\n488\n00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,090\nAnd we talk about our IT infrastructure,\nand how that all relates.\n\n489\n00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,890\nSo let's start with just some real simple\ndefinitions here at the beginning,\n\n490\n00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,730\njust to make sure that everybody's\non the same page, all right?\n\n491\n00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:57,150\nWhen we say service, to an IT guy,\nto me, I always think of,\n\n492\n00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,980\noh a service, that's an application that\nruns in the background in Windows, right?\n\n493\n00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,360\nManaged by the system.\n\n494\n00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,780\nStarts up when my computer starts up,\nshuts down when my computer shuts down.\n\n495\n00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,920\nAnd from that perspective that's right.\n\n496\n00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,710\nBut in the ideal world a service is\nwhat you are selling to the customer.\n\n497\n00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,310\nSo if you are an insurance company\nthe service you provide is insurance.\n\n498\n00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,590\nYou may have more than one service.\n\n499\n00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,590\nAuto insurance.\n\n500\n00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,190\nLife insurance.\n\n501\n00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,970\nWhatever.\n\n502\n00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,690\nIf you're a bank, the service you provide\nyour customer is a place to store their\n\n503\n00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,480\nmoney, and possibly earn interest,\nalthough I don't think I ever do.\n\n504\n00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,100\nAnd, so, possibly make interest, to be\nable to get at their money rapidly and\n\n505\n00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,020\nquickly, maybe mortgages so\nthey can buy a house even though they\n\n506\n00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,030\ndon't have enough money to pay for\nthe house outright.\n\n507\n00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,180\nSo that's your service.\n\n508\n00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,290\nSo in your company, you need to identify\nwhat the services are that you have.\n\n509\n00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,880\nWhat is it that you bring to the customer.\n\n510\n00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,400\nAnd then underneath that service.\n\n511\n00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,810\nYou have all the supporting\nservices that make that happen.\n\n512\n00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,430\nAll right.\n\n513\n00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,830\nSo running with a banking model,\nfor example.\n\n514\n00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,840\nLet's say mortgages.\n\n515\n00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,090\nA mortgage is just a financial loan you\nmake to somebody so they can buy a house.\n\n516\n00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,720\nEven though they don't have\nthe total amount due for the house.\n\n517\n00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080\nThe house, let's say it's $100,000.\n\n518\n00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,830\nI don't have $100,000 in my bank account.\n\n519\n00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,320\nHow about you, Ronnie?\n\n520\n00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320\n>> No, definitely not.\n\n521\n00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,431\n>> So I need to borrow some.\n\n522\n00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:20,054\nIf I want to buy a $100,000 house,I\ncan't afford it I need to find bank that\n\n523\n00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:24,278\ncan loan me that money maybe I have little\nmoney ,but I don't have all of it so\n\n524\n00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,070\nI need to get a loan.\n\n525\n00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,870\nWell that's the service that I care about.\n\n526\n00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,290\nBut what did it take to\ncreate that service?\n\n527\n00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,530\nI need to go and\ntalk to a mortgage broker, or\n\n528\n00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,690\nwhatever they're called inside of a bank.\n\n529\n00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,990\nAnd I sit down and I talk to them,\nand what are they going to do?\n\n530\n00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,400\nThey're going to run my credit report.\n\n531\n00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,070\nSo they're going to fire up a computer,\nand they're going to punch\n\n532\n00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,570\nin my information some kind of software\nthat will run the credit report.\n\n533\n00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,360\nAnd based on that they will\ngenerate an interest rate and\n\n534\n00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,090\nall those other things and\nI'll either get approved or denied.\n\n535\n00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,210\nSo, that software they are using,\nthat is a supporting service,\n\n536\n00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,865\nokay It's not the service\nthat I care about.\n\n537\n00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:00,345\nI don't care their computer system.\n\n538\n00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:02,325\nI just, I need my loan, right?\n\n539\n00:27:02,325 --> 00:27:06,785\nBut that computer system they're using is\nwhats facilitating me getting that loan.\n\n540\n00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:10,195\nSo, it's very easy to map\nthat to the customer, right?\n\n541\n00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,105\nSo the service is the mortgage.\n\n542\n00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:17,495\nThe supporting service is the software\nthey're using to underwrite the loan or,\n\n543\n00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,945\nwhatever terminology they want to use.\n\n544\n00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:24,360\nNow, beyond that what did it take\nto get that software running?\n\n545\n00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,960\nWell there's probably database\nservers on the back end.\n\n546\n00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,490\nIf it's web based there\nmight be web servers.\n\n547\n00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,630\nIf it's other application based,\nwho knows what there is.\n\n548\n00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,810\nSo there will be various servers.\n\n549\n00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,780\nMaybe physical servers.\n\n550\n00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,990\nMaybe virtual servers.\n\n551\n00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,880\nLet's add that in later right.\n\n552\n00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,840\nThere can be virtual servers\nthat are powering this,\n\n553\n00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,120\nand then underneath that you've\ngot your physical servers.\n\n554\n00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,950\nThis is IT infrastructure.\n\n555\n00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,380\nAnd all of our IT infrastructure\nneeds to be mapped\n\n556\n00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,490\nto at least one supporting service.\n\n557\n00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,220\nAnd that supporting service needs to\nbe mapped to your overall service.\n\n558\n00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,510\nThe real challenge here,\nbecause that is pretty easy.\n\n559\n00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,530\nThe real challenge is looking\nat the supporting services and\n\n560\n00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:02,450\nmaking sure they add up to provide\nthe complete service, all right.\n\n561\n00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,340\nWhen that agent goes to\nissue that mortgage,\n\n562\n00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,790\nthey're probably using more\nthan one supporting service.\n\n563\n00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,660\nMaybe they run credit reports\nin one software package.\n\n564\n00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,170\nAnd issue mortgages with\nanother software package.\n\n565\n00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,870\nAnd maybe there's non IT stuff in there.\n\n566\n00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,820\nThe mortgage agent had to go\nthrough training to learn\n\n567\n00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,010\nabout how to use the software.\n\n568\n00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,440\nAnd so there's a training\ndepartment that was a part of that.\n\n569\n00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,830\nAnd their service was the training.\n\n570\n00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,250\nThat's an important service.\n\n571\n00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,210\nAnd then who knows what other\nthings were involved there.\n\n572\n00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,505\nYou start tacking in facilities.\n\n573\n00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:34,160\nBecause there had to be a building for\nthe agent to sit in.\n\n574\n00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,880\nAll that other stuff that\ngets tacked in to it.\n\n575\n00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,760\nSo you have to look at all\nthe supporting services and\n\n576\n00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,710\nsay if I have all this does that create\nthe service that I'm trying to issue.\n\n577\n00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,750\nright.\nI'm trying to provide to my customers.\n\n578\n00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,640\nAnd if it does then your\njob is kind of done.\n\n579\n00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,360\nAnd if you've got something that you\ncan't map to a supporting service,\n\n580\n00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,770\nthen it's non essential, right?\n\n581\n00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,660\nIt's something that you don't need.\n\n582\n00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,410\nIt's not actually furthering\nyour company's goals.\n\n583\n00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,130\nIt's doing something else.\n\n584\n00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,170\nAnd so that's stuff you might trim off,\nright?\n\n585\n00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,610\nThese are the things that we look at\nwhen we deal with service management.\n\n586\n00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,540\nAnd so, when I call it the ITIL framework,\n\n587\n00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,290\nit's really the ITIL Service\nmanagement framework.\n\n588\n00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:14,368\nAnd there's organizations\nout there like the ITSMF.\n\n589\n00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,020\nAnd they're applying\nservice management to IT.\n\n590\n00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,980\nAnd they're closely related to ITIL.\n\n591\n00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,280\nFind a lot of great information\non their site and stuff,\n\n592\n00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,370\nit's a good organization to deal with.\n\n593\n00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,320\nThey don't define the exam though,\nso don't feel like that's required.\n\n594\n00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,370\nBut that what service management is all\nabout and that's really what ITEL defines.\n\n595\n00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,180\n>> These services that we're talking about\nthere's a lot of weird terminology that\n\n596\n00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,340\nthey also call out on the exam for us.\n\n597\n00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,260\nSo you may hear the term core services\nwhich is the actual loan that\n\n598\n00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,780\nDon was talking about.\n\n599\n00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,720\nAnd then we have the enabling services.\n\n600\n00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,200\nThat's the supporting services that\nDon's also talking about, that really do\n\n601\n00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,770\nhelp to bring the value and make sure that\nwe get the right loan that we need, but\n\n602\n00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,310\nthere is also what they call\nthe enhancing services.\n\n603\n00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,110\nThese are extra.\n\n604\n00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,680\nSo, if all of a sudden Don\ngot the loan that he needed\n\n605\n00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,610\nthere was something else that was running,\nbut also said, Don,\n\n606\n00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,760\nwe can also add in this, too,\nif you want to be able to do it.\n\n607\n00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,550\nWell, that is the overall process of what\nwe as the IT department might also end up\n\n608\n00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,750\nbringing in.is the ability to say look,\neverything that we are doing\n\n609\n00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,330\nreally does contribute to that\noverall end-to-end satisfaction.\n\n610\n00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,010\nOf what my company needs to do, and so\n\n611\n00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,320\nwe want to make sure\nthat we can provide that.\n\n612\n00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,780\nIf we happen to also know all\nof a sudden go well Don do\n\n613\n00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,280\nyou happen to actually\nneed horse insurance.\n\n614\n00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,140\nWell maybe not so much.\n\n615\n00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,920\nThat sounds like enhancement, but\n\n616\n00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,120\nit may actually be so\nfar off the scope it wouldn't count.\n\n617\n00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,470\nSo just remember,\nyou will see this terminology.\n\n618\n00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,940\n>> I can give you a great example,\nbuilding right off of the mortgages.\n\n619\n00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,530\nSo I worked for a bank for several years,\nand at the bank, we did mortgages, right?\n\n620\n00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,330\nSo that example I gave is really\njust based on what we did.\n\n621\n00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,580\nAnd, we were able to do that just fine.\n\n622\n00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,180\nOur whole system was in place.\n\n623\n00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,880\nAnd we followed ITIL, that was how\nwe handled all our deployment.\n\n624\n00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,050\nAnd, one of the things we didn't do,\nis we didn't have a way for our customers\n\n625\n00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:09,780\nto visit our website, check their\nmortgage balance, and pay their mortgage.\n\n626\n00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,990\nWe just didn't view that as important,\nit was financial information.\n\n627\n00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,940\nWe didn't want to mess\nwith a website on it.\n\n628\n00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,030\nThe customers got paper billing\nevery month and so that was that.\n\n629\n00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,980\nWell we did have some\ncustomers request it.\n\n630\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,280\nAnd as banks were advancing,\nmore and more people wanted that.\n\n631\n00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,270\nThey wanted to be able\nto log into a website.\n\n632\n00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,630\nAnd, so we created an all new,\nan additional enhancing service.\n\n633\n00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,940\nWhich was the web based mortgage site.\n\n634\n00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,300\nWe didn't need it, our mortgage system\nworked just fine without it, right.\n\n635\n00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,270\nThe customer could get the service\nthey needed but it enhanced, it\n\n636\n00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,740\nadded value to their experience that once\nthey had the mortgage they could go and\n\n637\n00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,600\ncheck and do online payments and so on.\n\n638\n00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,890\nSo, it wasn't required but our company\nas a whole looked at it and said.\n\n639\n00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,750\nYes, this is something\nthat we want to offer, and\n\n640\n00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,200\nit's in line with our existing services.\n\n641\n00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,842\nSo that is very important.\n\n642\n00:31:56,842 --> 00:32:00,930\nAll right, well Ronnie, what I want to do\nnext, is I want to take a look at the five\n\n643\n00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,570\ndifferent areas that we worry about\nwhen it comes to service management.\n\n644\n00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,932\nI shouldn't say worry, but\n\n645\n00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:09,127\nthat we need to address when it\ncomes to total service management.\n\n646\n00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,096\nBut I know we've run low on time\non this segment, so let's stop and\n\n647\n00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,345\ntake a break and when we get back we're\ngoing to take a look at an outline.\n\n648\n00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:18,612\nWe're going to break apart the various\ncomponents inside the service\n\n649\n00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:19,560\nmanagement suite.\n\n650\n00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,009\nAnd see all the things we're going\nto be learning about in this show.\n\n651\n00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:26,973\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment,\n\n652\n00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:31,809\n[MUSIC]\n\n653\n00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:34,070\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n654\n00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,880\nSo, the service management\nframework inside of ITIL\n\n655\n00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,760\nis broken up into five books.\n\n656\n00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,210\nFive physical books that you can\ngo out and buy, and study from.\n\n657\n00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,920\nThere's a lot of information in there.\n\n658\n00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,670\nBut what they're doing,\n\n659\n00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:50,210\nis they're basically dividing service\nmanagement up by sort of like a job role.\n\n660\n00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,720\nBasically different categories of service\nmanagement and each one pertains to\n\n661\n00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,140\na different area of responsibility\nfrom within the ITIL framework.\n\n662\n00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,700\nSo when we study,\nthat's normally how we study.\n\n663\n00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,390\nWe take each of these individually and\ndivide them up.\n\n664\n00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:10,220\nSo it really breaks into five nice\nparts that make logical sense.\n\n665\n00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,130\nNow if you go to Axelos's website, they\ndo have an outline of exam objectives.\n\n666\n00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,020\nThings that you need to know for the exam.\n\n667\n00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,870\nBut they're not exactly\norganized by the areas.\n\n668\n00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,330\nIt's just basically listing out\nall this stuff we need to know in\n\n669\n00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,980\nno particular order.\n\n670\n00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,130\nAnd that's fine.\n\n671\n00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,590\nIt's because you're not supposed to\nstudy directly from the outline.\n\n672\n00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,320\nOn the ITpro TV show, we normally\nfollow the outlines for our shoes and\n\n673\n00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,510\ngo through it because the outlines\nare written in a logical order.\n\n674\n00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,670\nBut this is one of the few exceptions\nwhere, while there is an outline,\n\n675\n00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,426\nwe're not going to use it.\n\n676\n00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:45,840\nWe are going to cover all\nthe stuff that's in it,\n\n677\n00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,150\nbut we're not going to just go in order\nbecause it wouldn't make any sense.\n\n678\n00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,460\nSo, instead we're going to\nfollow a different outline and\n\n679\n00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,340\nthat's what I want to\nshow you guys here so\n\n680\n00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,950\nwe can have an understanding of how\nwe're going to move through that.\n\n681\n00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,650\nAnd let me pull up mine, here we go.\n\n682\n00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,586\nSo the five books that are a part\nof service management or I.T.\n\n683\n00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:06,750\nservice management the first\none is service strategy.\n\n684\n00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,700\nAnd then we've got service design,\nservice transition,\n\n685\n00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,490\nservice operation, and\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n686\n00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,570\nI know that one looks short, but\nthere's actually a lot in it.\n\n687\n00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,060\nSo those are the five areas.\n\n688\n00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,320\nLet's talk a little bit about each and\nwhat they are.\n\n689\n00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,060\nAll right,\nthe first one is service strategy.\n\n690\n00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,030\nThis one relates to your\ncompany's overall goal.\n\n691\n00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,130\nYour company's overall,\nlike your long term\n\n692\n00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,410\ngoal Is usually to provide some particular\nkind of service to your customer.\n\n693\n00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:39,600\nAnd to be so effective at it that\nyou are the market leader for\n\n694\n00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,610\nwhatever that service is.\n\n695\n00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:44,100\nThat's pretty much what most\npeople's goals boil down to.\n\n696\n00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,380\nAnd so with service strategy,\n\n697\n00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,550\nwhat we're trying to do is identify\nany kind of supporting services,\n\n698\n00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,460\nenhancing services, any of these different\nthings that we can offer, that contribute.\n\n699\n00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,880\nSo that overall service that\nwe're going to be providing.\n\n700\n00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,220\nAnd everything should be in line.\n\n701\n00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,510\nSo, whenever we look at creating some\nnew infrastructure in our company,\n\n702\n00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,630\nwe need to be able to map that\nto our service, to our goal.\n\n703\n00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,380\nAnd if it doesn't map to that, if it\ndoesn't contribute, we shouldn't do it.\n\n704\n00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,940\nOr if it only contributes so much and\n\n705\n00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,730\nthere's an alternative that does better,\nwe should do the alternative, right?\n\n706\n00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,760\nSo, service strategy is all about figuring\n\n707\n00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,240\nout the things that your\ncompany should be doing.\n\n708\n00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,890\nWhat services should you offer,\n\n709\n00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,330\nwhat infrastructures do\nyou have to support that?\n\n710\n00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,710\nAnd cutting out the things that\nyou don't need.> Our second book\n\n711\n00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,660\ngoes into service design.\n\n712\n00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,770\nService design is exactly how it sounds,\n\n713\n00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,210\nwhere we take what the goals that were\ngiven through that service strategy and\n\n714\n00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,980\nsaying, what can we do to ensure\nthat we can achieve those goals?\n\n715\n00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,310\nIt may be where we create\na brand new process.\n\n716\n00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,240\nBut it may be where we actually realize\nthat there is something else that's\n\n717\n00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,460\nactually in place,\nthat's better than what I have, and\n\n718\n00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,250\nthat that's part of what\nwe're going to actually use.\n\n719\n00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,830\nHelp us to achieve that overall goal.\n\n720\n00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,040\nThis one actually requires\na bit more management.\n\n721\n00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,420\nBecause it requires you\nto coordinate resources.\n\n722\n00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,560\nIt requires you to bring in not only\nthe strategy and the element there.\n\n723\n00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,480\nBut to manage those resources\neffectively so we don't over assign or\n\n724\n00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,980\nover allocate our resources there too.\n\n725\n00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,800\nSo design is really a part of what\nwe actually need to make sure, so\n\n726\n00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,680\nthat we can retrieve our overall goals.\n\n727\n00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,300\n>> All right, so there's a lot of\nindividual components here, too.\n\n728\n00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,820\nWe're just trying to go high level here.\n\n729\n00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,330\nSo if you're looking at my outline, and\nI've got all these extra processes,\n\n730\n00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,700\nwe'll tackle those in the show later on.\n\n731\n00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,590\nBut, that's basically the first two.\n\n732\n00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,730\nThe next one is service transition, so\n\n733\n00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,960\nyour company decides that you want to\noffer some kind of a service, right.\n\n734\n00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,880\nYou've designed it, you've got how\nyou're going to be implementing it, and\n\n735\n00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,600\nyou've created it, now you need to\nmove it into production, all right.\n\n736\n00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,570\nSo, service transition is all about\ntaking this product you just created.\n\n737\n00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,290\nAnd making it available for you.\n\n738\n00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,320\nSo there's a lot involved with that.\n\n739\n00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,890\nEverything in the first two stages,\n\n740\n00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,390\ndoesn't affect how your company\nis doing business right now.\n\n741\n00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,490\nSo, while these two things are going on,\nyour company is running,\n\n742\n00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:16,560\ndoing it's normal stuff, just like normal,\nuntil we get to this third stage.\n\n743\n00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,990\nWhen we start moving our new service into\nproduction, there's a lot of stuff to take\n\n744\n00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,680\ninto account, and we'll see all\nthe different aspects of that\n\n745\n00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,050\nas we plan to get it successfully\ndeployed into our production environment.\n\n746\n00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,030\n>> Then that brings us into\nour service operations.\n\n747\n00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,790\nThis is what you and\n\n748\n00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,400\nI do day to day to ensure that everything\nis functioning in the way it needs to.\n\n749\n00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000\nIt means implementing\nall those designs and\n\n750\n00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,810\nalso whatever other goals that were\nactually set so that we can achieve those.\n\n751\n00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:49,170\nIt also means that when we are operating,\nwhen we are doing our day-to-day business,\n\n752\n00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,420\nwhen things fall behind, it is up to\nus to ensure that we actually go back.\n\n753\n00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,420\nWe check out what the processes is, what\nthe processes is, what the processes are,\n\n754\n00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,310\nexcuse me,\n\n755\n00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,030\nand make sure that we go, okay, here is\nthe instant and here is how we fix it.\n\n756\n00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,390\nLet's go ahead and\ncontinue to move forward.\n\n757\n00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,460\nSo this is our everyday work\nthat we would be doing.\n\n758\n00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,360\n>> And then the last book is\ncontinual service improvement, CSI.\n\n759\n00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,550\nAnd here is where we say,\nall right things are running.\n\n760\n00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,670\nThings are going day to day just\nrunning like they're supposed to.\n\n761\n00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,570\nIs there any way we can make this better?\n\n762\n00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,140\nIs there something that we should add?\n\n763\n00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,420\nSomething we can tweak to\nincrease efficiencies?\n\n764\n00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,000\nCan we improve what we have deployed?\n\n765\n00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,160\nAnd we'll see it's all built around\nthis seven step improvement process.\n\n766\n00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,660\nThere's a number of different\nschools of thought out there on it.\n\n767\n00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,840\nBut I'm told to find\nit's one in particular.\n\n768\n00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,860\nWe'll get a chance to see how that works\nand what's involved in that last stage.\n\n769\n00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:45,130\nNow, all of these really\ndefine stages of a service.\n\n770\n00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,310\nAnd you've got an image of this don't you.\n\n771\n00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,620\nThese aren't just one time things, you\ndon't just do service strategy one day and\n\n772\n00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,180\nthen that's it you never do\nstrategy ever again, all right?\n\n773\n00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,660\nSo it's really a continuing cycle that\nyou're going to be in for a long time,\n\n774\n00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,720\nand your is Is labeled the ITEL version\nthree service management life cycle.\n\n775\n00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,490\nIt hasn't changed.\n\n776\n00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,520\nSo in the 2011 it's the same way.\n\n777\n00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,480\nBut what you have is this\nidea of service management.\n\n778\n00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,830\nAnd at the heart of it in the center\nif you were to just delete\n\n779\n00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,380\nthat title out really.\n\n780\n00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,640\nIn the center is where you\nreally have your strategy.\n\n781\n00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,170\nIt's the heart of your business.\n\n782\n00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,000\nYour strategy how you're going to\nachieve the goals of the company.\n\n783\n00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,860\nSo that's something that's\ncontinually going on.\n\n784\n00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,900\nYou should always be looking\nat what your strategy is and\n\n785\n00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,030\nwhere your company needs to be going,\nhow you're going to achieve your goals.\n\n786\n00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,320\nAll right.\n\n787\n00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,920\nBut from there, design,\ntransition, operation.\n\n788\n00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,658\nYou constantly cycle through those three.\n\n789\n00:39:45,658 --> 00:39:50,280\nYou design the service as proposed by\nyour strategy, your transition and\n\n790\n00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,010\nyour production and your operator, right?\n\n791\n00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,780\nMeanwhile, new strategies come about,\nyou're designing the new solutions for\n\n792\n00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,120\nthose strategies, transition,\noperation, right?\n\n793\n00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,150\nNow while you're running through those\nthree, while design, transition and\n\n794\n00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,160\noperation are occurring,\n\n795\n00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,640\nyou always got running side by side\nthe continual service improvement.\n\n796\n00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640\nSo that's always going on.\n\n797\n00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,388\nYou're never done.\n\n798\n00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:18,385\nThere's always some way\nthat you can be better.\n\n799\n00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:21,819\nEven if you've found the best way\nto do something today and there\n\n800\n00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:26,217\nis nothing better, Next year there might\nbe or five years from now there might be.\n\n801\n00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,213\nYou need to be watching for that.\n\n802\n00:40:27,213 --> 00:40:30,777\nWhen that time happens maybe there\nis a better way right now, but\n\n803\n00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:32,450\nit's too expensive.\n\n804\n00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,470\nAnd so you're watching for\nthat time where the expense comes down and\n\n805\n00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,110\nit becomes reasonable, right?\n\n806\n00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,040\nSo that's all happening with CSI.\n\n807\n00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,790\nThese five processes,\nI mean these five service areas.\n\n808\n00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,690\nThey're happening all the time,\nall the time.\n\n809\n00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,600\nSo you're cycling through them and\njust new stuff going on.\n\n810\n00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,910\nSome of them are less common\nthan others operation and\n\n811\n00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,340\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n812\n00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,520\nThose two are always happening.\n\n813\n00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,150\nYou're guaranteed in your company,\nwell I shouldn't say\n\n814\n00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,820\noperation is guaranteed to happen because\notherwise you'd be out of business, right.\n\n815\n00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,510\nYou've gotta be doing your\nday-to-day operations.\n\n816\n00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,730\nContinual service improvement\nshould be happening every day.\n\n817\n00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,910\nIf your company's not following\nthe ITIL framework or\n\n818\n00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,390\nis just not concerned about\nthat then they might not.\n\n819\n00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:17,690\nBut those two should be\nhappening all the time.\n\n820\n00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,330\nYou might have strategy\nmeetings less frequently.\n\n821\n00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,095\nYou might be designing and transitioning\nnew services less frequently, but\n\n822\n00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:27,775\nthe other two are constantly going on.\n\n823\n00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:31,295\nAnd, for the ones that aren't constant,\nthey do happen again and again,\n\n824\n00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:35,155\njust intermittently, so we need to be\nfamiliar with each of those stages.\n\n825\n00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:38,795\n>> Yeah, with understanding that\nthe cycle of the way that these\n\n826\n00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:42,890\nprocesses go on we're talking about\na life-cycle approach to IT management.\n\n827\n00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,150\nIs that we're never satisfied with just\nsaying, I know what the strategy is.\n\n828\n00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,880\nBecause tomorrow a new\nstrategy may appear, and\n\n829\n00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,360\nyou may think, look, the strategy that I\nfirst started off with, it doesn't really\n\n830\n00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,690\napply now that we've headed into\nthis new venture in our business.\n\n831\n00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,010\nSo you do have to actually reevaluate\nyour strategies when new things end up\n\n832\n00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,300\ntriggering it, that cause you to actually\ngo, wait, I can't go into this market,\n\n833\n00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,750\nthere's only so much I can do with\nwhatever process that I'm in.\n\n834\n00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,510\nAnd maybe that market now\njust disappears overnight.\n\n835\n00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,060\nSo are you gonna try and\nstill push the same business model?\n\n836\n00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,380\nIt's not going to happen.\n\n837\n00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,500\nSo always,\nwhen we start approaching IT management\n\n838\n00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,160\nwe're always looking at it in this\nidea of a service life cycle.\n\n839\n00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,127\n>> Now throughout this show we're\ngonna be covering each of these but\n\n840\n00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:30,700\nwe're gonna be doing it from a high level.\n\n841\n00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,210\nWe're gonna explain the things that\nhappen inside of each of those stages and\n\n842\n00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,510\nwhat your company is\ntypically going to be doing.\n\n843\n00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,030\nNow, if you look at this and\nit sounds great,\n\n844\n00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,420\nand you say I wanna go and implement this,\nwhat we're gonna cover here is not enough.\n\n845\n00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,610\nIt's not enough to actually go and\nimplement this technology.\n\n846\n00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,500\nWe wanna familiarize\nyou with what's there.\n\n847\n00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,730\nIf you wanna implement it, inside of\neach of those stages, service strategy,\n\n848\n00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:56,220\nservice design, and so on,\nthere is a wealth of information.\n\n849\n00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,960\nWe're talking about hundreds of pages of\ndocumentation explaining all the different\n\n850\n00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,170\ncomponents inside of it and\nthat's what you're going to need.\n\n851\n00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,660\nSo when we talk about these five phases,\n\n852\n00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,460\nthey really do correspond\nto five physical books.\n\n853\n00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,890\nAnd if you wanna buy those books,\nyou don't need them for\n\n854\n00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,100\nITIL foundation if you're\njust going this far.\n\n855\n00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,890\nBut if you're going intermediate or\nhigher,\n\n856\n00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,680\nright, the next steps, you need the books.\n\n857\n00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,940\nYou've gotta have them, and that's where\nthe information is gonna be that you need.\n\n858\n00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,787\nAnd so if you want those,\nyou can buy them directly from Axelos,\n\n859\n00:43:22,787 --> 00:43:24,790\nto the people who run the show.\n\n860\n00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,400\nSo I've got their website\npulled up on my computer.\n\n861\n00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,350\nI've just gone to shop.axelos.com and\nyou can go on their website,\n\n862\n00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,460\nand they do sell them.\n\n863\n00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,410\nIf you scroll around, you'll see\nall the different stuff they offer.\n\n864\n00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,460\nBe careful to make sure you're\nlooking at the 2011 edition.\n\n865\n00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,590\nThey do still sell 2007 and\neven some of the older stuff because\n\n866\n00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,410\nyour company might not have\ntransitioned to the new version yet.\n\n867\n00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,020\nSo that's why they still have that.\n\n868\n00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,710\nBut you'll see up here where\nthey sell the various things and\n\n869\n00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:55,500\nhere they're breaking down\nthe service strategy service design.\n\n870\n00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,220\nHere's each of those manuals, but if you\ngo down a little bit more, you'll see\n\n871\n00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,530\nthe ITIL service life cycle publication\nsuite and that's all five books.\n\n872\n00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,060\nSo it's just all five of them in one.\n\n873\n00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:13,540\nAnd if you buy the five pack,\nit is 300 Pounds to purchase it.\n\n874\n00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,920\nIn US dollars would be like $475 or\nsomething like that.\n\n875\n00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,230\nI don't remember the conversion right now.\n\n876\n00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,910\nBut about 300 pounds,\nit's not cheap, right.\n\n877\n00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,340\nThey're a good bit,\nthey're about $100 US per book and\n\n878\n00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,570\nyou'll see where you can\nbuy it as a PDF also.\n\n879\n00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,360\nIf you want it electronically.\n\n880\n00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,130\nIt's actually more expensive to do that.\n\n881\n00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,296\nOh, no, I think there's a 299 or\nwith that, it's more expensive,\n\n882\n00:44:37,296 --> 00:44:38,170\nthat's what I said.\n\n883\n00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,800\nAnd then you'll see there's an online\nsubscription you can do also.\n\n884\n00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,540\nThe online subscription is kinda\nneat because when they do updates,\n\n885\n00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,730\nyou get them, and you don't have to\nworry about losing your files or so on.\n\n886\n00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,940\n>> So almost $500, it's $476.30.\n\n887\n00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,000\n>> Oh, I was close.\n\n888\n00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,494\nI said 475, that's not bad for\nnot having looked at the markets in years?\n\n889\n00:44:55,494 --> 00:44:57,300\n>> [LAUGH] So.\n\n890\n00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,140\n>> You day trader, you.\n\n891\n00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,090\n>> So those are the books right there.\n\n892\n00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,250\nYou can go out and buy them.\n\n893\n00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,960\nAgain, for ITIL foundation you\ndon't need the full set of books.\n\n894\n00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,030\nBut it doesn't hurt to have them.\n\n895\n00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,020\nIf you're gonna implement you definitely\nwant to have those books handy.\n\n896\n00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:13,770\nNow if you're in the US, purchasing\nfrom AXELOS can be a little frustrating\n\n897\n00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,020\nbecause they are in England and it's gotta\nship across the pond and all that stuff.\n\n898\n00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,210\nSo I usually just buy it from.\n\n899\n00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,340\n>> Cross the pond.\n\n900\n00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,640\n>> Amazon, I know,\nI've watched some British TV.\n\n901\n00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,700\nI know what to say.\n\n902\n00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,550\nSo if I wanna buy it,\nI usually go to Amazon and\n\n903\n00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,630\nyou'll find a number of\norganizations resell the books.\n\n904\n00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,050\nAnd notice it doesn't\nsay sold by Amazon here.\n\n905\n00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,140\nIt's sold by various people, but\nthey'll resell the books and\n\n906\n00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,520\nsome of them are approved publishing\nhouses here in the US some aren't.\n\n907\n00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,940\nSome are unapproved or whatever.\n\n908\n00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,710\n>> Resellers.\n\n909\n00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,260\n>> So you've got to be careful there.\n\n910\n00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,260\nBut just look at the ones\nthat are available.\n\n911\n00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,240\nSo here for $520 you can get the full set,\nthe five volume set,\n\n912\n00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,490\nand they're just showing\nthe five books there.\n\n913\n00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,540\nYou can get them individually or whatever.\n\n914\n00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,750\nOne of the criticisms of ITIL is\nthe books are kind of expensive,\n\n915\n00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,470\nbut they bring a lot of value.\n\n916\n00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,640\nYou could not create this yourself for\nfive hundred dollars.\n\n917\n00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,210\nYou could not create this yourself for\n$50,000, it is really a great value,\n\n918\n00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:17,350\neven though they cost more than\nother books that are out there.\n\n919\n00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,950\nSo, that's what we are talking about, and\n\n920\n00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:22,380\nas we go through this show we are going\nto divide things up by the book.\n\n921\n00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:29,670\nSo when you take a look at their\nofficial outline which is here.\n\n922\n00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,080\nSo this is their official exam outline and\nas you go through it here,\n\n923\n00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,750\nit breaks things up into service\nmanagement as a practice.\n\n924\n00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,670\nAnd then it starts laying things out and\nyou'll see a lot of this is coming\n\n925\n00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,290\nfrom the service strategy book or you'll\nsee other ones where it's coming from.\n\n926\n00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,580\nHere, take a look at this one.\n\n927\n00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,500\nSo this is the one.\n\n928\n00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,830\nThe ITIL life service lifecycle.\n\n929\n00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:53,520\nAnd they break it up to have service\nstrategy mixed in with service design,\n\n930\n00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,820\nmixed in with service transition.\n\n931\n00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,940\nSo they're all kind of blurred together\nand that's where it doesn't make sense for\n\n932\n00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,060\nus to just to go line by\nline as we go through.\n\n933\n00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,400\nSo we're going to rearrange this.\n\n934\n00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,950\nWe're going to divide it up by the various\nareas and we'll move through each one.\n\n935\n00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:12,990\nIn practice employees in your company\nwill usually fall within certain areas.\n\n936\n00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,290\nYou're executives,\n\n937\n00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,680\nthey're the ones who are gonna\nfall under that service strategy.\n\n938\n00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,140\nThey're the ones coming up\nwith company goals, but\n\n939\n00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,760\nthey're not the ones that\nactually implement it, right.\n\n940\n00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,370\nService design, that's usually gonna\nbe a group of people, people from IT,\n\n941\n00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,010\npeople from the departments that's\nthe stakeholders of the project\n\n942\n00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,910\ninvolved in service design.\n\n943\n00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,200\nWhen you start getting\ninto service transition.\n\n944\n00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,340\nThat's gonna be your IT department.\n\n945\n00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,400\nThey're moving the stuff into production.\n\n946\n00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,440\nAs well as your training teams, human\nresources if you have to hire new people,\n\n947\n00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,210\nall that stuff gets involved.\n\n948\n00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,300\nBy the time you get to service\noperation your day to day.\n\n949\n00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,610\nWell, now you've got your IT helpdesk, and\n\n950\n00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,570\nthe actual employees that are gonna use\nthis new service that was deployed.\n\n951\n00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,220\nAnd when you get to continual service\nimprovement, It's normally an entirely\n\n952\n00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,790\ndifferent set of people that are doing\nthat, that are monitoring for\n\n953\n00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,310\nefficiencies and making improvements\nwhere they can, or identifying them.\n\n954\n00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,230\nSo different people fall under\ndifferent categories inside of this.\n\n955\n00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:10,520\nSo most employees in your company\nwill not need to learn Anything but\n\n956\n00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,780\none of these books and\nusually just a subset of that.\n\n957\n00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,910\nSo the only people who study the whole\nthing are typically the executives,\n\n958\n00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,940\nthe managers and if you have a person\nthat's specifically responsible for\n\n959\n00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,340\nthe ITIL deployment,\nthen they're the ones will do it, too.\n\n960\n00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,130\nSo, you grab the pieces you want.\n\n961\n00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,370\nThat is what our framework is all about.\n\n962\n00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,400\nAll right, well, Ronnie, I think that\npretty much does as far as highlighting\n\n963\n00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,100\nhow our show is going to be structured.\n\n964\n00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,650\n>> Looks good.\n\n965\n00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,400\n>> And I think we have covered everything\nwe need as far as what ITIL is and\n\n966\n00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,140\nwhat its basic premise is.\n\n967\n00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,900\nSo, we're pretty much ready\nto move into the real stuff.\n\n968\n00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,980\nAnd we're just gonna kick off\nwith service strategy and\n\n969\n00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,580\nmove on through there as we go\nthrough the various phases and\n\n970\n00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,160\njust keep in mind as we cycle through\nthose in real life over and over again.\n\n971\n00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,880\nBut we're just gonna kinda break it\nup in a little more logical manner\n\n972\n00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,640\nthan what the outline was.\n\n973\n00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,590\nAll right, well,\nlet me just remind you guys,\n\n974\n00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,200\nif you have questions on any of this,\nfeel free to ask.\n\n975\n00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,830\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live and\n\n976\n00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,040\nyou'll see the chat box beneath the video,\npost your questions there.\n\n977\n00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,850\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n978\n00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,370\nIf you have questions after the show,\nuse our Q and A forms.\n\n979\n00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,593\nAt the top of every page you'll see\nYou'll see a link that says Q and\n\n980\n00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,215\nA that takes you into our forums.\n\n981\n00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:21,165\nYou can post a question there.\n\n982\n00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:23,145\nAnd again we monitor and\nanswer after the show.\n\n983\n00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:26,145\nIt's a great way to get answers to\nyour questions even though we might\n\n984\n00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:26,735\nnot be running live.\n\n985\n00:49:26,735 --> 00:49:30,005\nI know a lot of you guys are in different\ntime zones, so that helps out quite a bit.\n\n986\n00:49:31,237 --> 00:49:34,187\nAlright well I hope you enjoyed today's\nshow and I hope you're excited about ITIL.\n\n987\n00:49:34,187 --> 00:49:36,987\nWe're excited to get in to the real\nmaterial in the next episode so\n\n988\n00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:38,817\ndefinitely stay tuned for that.\n\n989\n00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:41,417\nBut for today signing out for\nITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n990\n00:49:41,417 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening!\n\n5\n00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,810\nWelcome back!\n\n6\n00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,220\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,720\nI'm your host,\nDon Pezet back with Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,580\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,650\n>> It is going well today.\n\n10\n00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,000\nI have another beautiful\nmorning here in Florida.\n\n11\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,486\nAnd we are ready to get started in ITIL.\n\n12\n00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,240\nLet's say, another exciting day.\n\n13\n00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,750\n>> Yeah so this is gonna be the first\nepisode where we launch into\n\n14\n00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,784\nsome of the real nitty gritty\nactual ITIL functionality.\n\n15\n00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:00,840\nIn our first episode we did an overview\nof just kind of what was and\n\n16\n00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,970\nthen some of the history of it.\n\n17\n00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,835\nAnd so on.\n\n18\n00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,335\nNow we're gonna get into\nthe actual practices.\n\n19\n00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,135\nNow, I do wanna remind you guys,\n\n20\n00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:10,975\nbefore we dive in that this\nmore of like a survey course.\n\n21\n00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,275\nWhere we're talking\nabout a lot of concepts,\n\n22\n00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:17,195\nwithout explaining the how\nyou actually do it side.\n\n23\n00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:21,235\nThe reason is, you're getting a feel for\nwhat's available inside of Itil.\n\n24\n00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:23,980\nThat's what ITIL Foundation\nis all about is understanding\n\n25\n00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,520\nwhat is available for you.\n\n26\n00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,690\nAnd if you want to go on to learn\nmore to actually implement this,\n\n27\n00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,980\nthat's when you move into the individual\nbooks and the certification training, and\n\n28\n00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,080\nso on,\nthat pertains to each area inside of ITIL.\n\n29\n00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,900\nSo the area we're starting with today\nis what's called service strategy.\n\n30\n00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,850\nAnd if you go to the TOS,\n\n31\n00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,410\noffice of stationery or any of the various\ncompanies that sell the iTel books,\n\n32\n00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,630\nyou can buy a dedicated manual just for\nservice strategy.\n\n33\n00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,160\nIt is several hundred pages long.\n\n34\n00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,130\nIt's a massive book.\n\n35\n00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,810\nIt's a ton of information.\n\n36\n00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,950\nSo, we're going to summarize all that\ndown into this one little episode.\n\n37\n00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,190\nAnd we're going to cover, actually,\na little more than what's on the exam for\n\n38\n00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,540\nservice strategy for foundation,\n\n39\n00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,790\nbut it's just going to help you understand\nwhat's available and who does it.\n\n40\n00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,750\nNow, what we'll find is that\neach of these areas pertain\n\n41\n00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,680\nto a different type of employee.\n\n42\n00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,500\nAnd when it comes to service strategy, the\ntype of employee this is really designed\n\n43\n00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,780\nfor is your executive, executive branch,\nor whatever you want to call it.\n\n44\n00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,360\nYour CEO, your chief executive officer,\n\n45\n00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,180\nyour presidents,\nyour vice presidents, CFO, CIO,\n\n46\n00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,380\nthose kind of people, they're the ones\nwho are gonna deal with service strategy.\n\n47\n00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,570\nNow in the IT world,\ncuz ITEL is really IT centric,\n\n48\n00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,600\nin the IT world we usually have a CIO,\na chief information officer.\n\n49\n00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,510\nIn a smaller organization you\nmight just have an IS manager,\n\n50\n00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,970\ninformation systems and in today's world,\ninformation systems and\n\n51\n00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,320\ninformation technology\nare really interchangeable.\n\n52\n00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,380\nThere used to be little differences but\nnow they're basically the same.\n\n53\n00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,300\nSo it's typically gonna be your executives\nthat are setting the strategy, but\n\n54\n00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,120\nthis is one of the areas where\nwe can't just focus on IT.\n\n55\n00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,730\nAnd remember one of the things that we\nmentioned in an earlier episode was that\n\n56\n00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,540\nyou've got services\nthat are core services,\n\n57\n00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,690\nwhat you're offering to your customer,\nwhat brings value to your customer.\n\n58\n00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,780\nAnd then we've got our enhancing services,\nand our supporting services.\n\n59\n00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,910\nThese other ones that don't directly\ncontribute to the customer,\n\n60\n00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,570\nbut contribute to the core service.\n\n61\n00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,990\nWho figures what that core service is?\n\n62\n00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,260\nAnd that's going to be the high\nlevel executives of the company.\n\n63\n00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,500\nUsually not the IT department unless\nyou happen to be a tech company right.\n\n64\n00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,050\nIf you're Facebook or\nApple, somebody like that.\n\n65\n00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,280\nThey're a tech company and so\n\n66\n00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,900\nthe IT department obviously very involved\nin the creation of that overall strategy.\n\n67\n00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,080\nBut if you are a hospital,\nmedical care is your primary service and\n\n68\n00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120\nthe IT department.\n\n69\n00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,750\nIsn't skilled or trained in determining\nthe best way to administer medical care.\n\n70\n00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,110\nSo they are a supporting\nrole in that scenario.\n\n71\n00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,510\nI wanted to make sure we understood that.\n\n72\n00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,870\nWho this particular section is really\ntailored for, which is management.\n\n73\n00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,230\nThe other thing we really need to\nunderstand is we're going to talk about\n\n74\n00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,660\nservice strategies.\n\n75\n00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,540\nSo we're figuring out how we're going\nto be offering and handling services.\n\n76\n00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,210\nWe need to make sure we understand\nwhat a service truly is, so\n\n77\n00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,910\nI wanna start this episode with\nthe official ITIL definition of a service.\n\n78\n00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,760\nAnd Ronnie, do you have that one?\n\n79\n00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,750\n>> I do.\n\n80\n00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,410\nWhen we talk about a service,\n\n81\n00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,900\nthe way that ITIL actually defines it is\na means of delivering value to a customer.\n\n82\n00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,910\nBy facilitating outcomes,\n\n83\n00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,360\ncustomer wants to achieve without\nthe ownership of a specific cost and risk.\n\n84\n00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,330\nSo, when you take a look\nat the idea of a service,\n\n85\n00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,400\nit really is about that idea of delivering\nwhat we call a value to the customer\n\n86\n00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,420\nin a way that the customer himself doesn't\nhave to figure out how to create it, have\n\n87\n00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,310\nto be able to make it, or to even be able\nto figure out what he needs to make it.\n\n88\n00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,350\nWe are now providing it so that the\ncustomer goes okay, this is what I want\n\n89\n00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,480\nand it's going to help me achieve\nwhatever business goal that I need.\n\n90\n00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,130\n>> And what that service is is\ngonna vary based on industries.\n\n91\n00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,940\nAnd you'll find that some\nof them are tangible items,\n\n92\n00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,730\nthings that you can hold in your hand.\n\n93\n00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,690\nOthers are more conceptual,\nit's a function somebody provides for you.\n\n94\n00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,620\nSo like here in the United States,\n\n95\n00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,720\nonce a year we have to file our tax\npaperwork with the federal government.\n\n96\n00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,280\nAnd they have gone.\n\n97\n00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,170\nThe extra mile and made it so\ncomplex that it's very difficult for\n\n98\n00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,950\nan individual person to\nfill out their own taxes.\n\n99\n00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,500\nSo when it comes tax time, I could fill\nout my own tax paperwork if I wanted, and\n\n100\n00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,470\nI would be taking on certain costs,\nthe time it took me to fill that out, and\n\n101\n00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,580\ncertain risks,\ncuz if I made a mistake it was my fault.\n\n102\n00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,510\nOr, I can go pay an accountant to do that.\n\n103\n00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,240\nAnd the accountant,\nit will take them far less time to do it.\n\n104\n00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,065\nBecause they know what they are doing\nversus me, where I'm clueless.\n\n105\n00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,430\nWell, they run some program and that's it.\n\n106\n00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,060\nAnd then on the risk side,\nif there's a mistake on my taxes,\n\n107\n00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,440\nit's their fault, they did it.\n\n108\n00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,790\nSo I don't have the risk anymore and\nthat makes life a lot easier for me.\n\n109\n00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,140\nIt's worth it to me to pay for that.\n\n110\n00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,070\nSo if an accountant offers\ntax preparation services.\n\n111\n00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,100\nThat brings value to me, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,990\nJust because your company sells something\ndoesn't mean it brings value to\n\n113\n00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,910\nyour customer.\n\n114\n00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,580\nCompanies that fail typically didn't\nbring value to their customer.\n\n115\n00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,910\nYou see this all the time when companies\nlaunch a new device or a new service.\n\n116\n00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,630\nA cable company offers a new pay channel,\nbut,\n\n117\n00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,830\nthey could make a lot of money if\npeople paid to get that channel.\n\n118\n00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,790\nBut if people don't want it, if that\ndemand is not there, then it didn't bring\n\n119\n00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,790\nvalue to the customer, and it's gonna be\ndetrimental to the company as a whole.\n\n120\n00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,950\nSo, as we set our service strategy,\nthose are the things we're looking for.\n\n121\n00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,190\nWe pick that definition apart.\n\n122\n00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,890\nThe keywords we're looking at.\n\n123\n00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,530\nValue to customer, right?\n\n124\n00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,680\nEvery service we provide has to\nbring value to the customer.\n\n125\n00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,901\nAnd facilitating outcomes, right?\n\n126\n00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,630\nWhat is an outcome?\n\n127\n00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,850\nWell the outcome is the result of our\nservice, and maybe it is a tangible good.\n\n128\n00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,390\nBefore the show we were joking\nabout our cough buttons,\n\n129\n00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,510\nwe have these little buttons down here\nthat are suppose to mute our microphones\n\n130\n00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,510\nand sometimes they work,\nthey're kinda flakey.\n\n131\n00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,210\nAnd we've got a gentleman\non staff here Nate who,\n\n132\n00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,010\nhe's our electrical wizard I suppose,\n\n133\n00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,860\nhe's the one who knows how the resistors\nand capacitors and all that stuff works.\n\n134\n00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,650\nHe could probably build us a cough\nbutton that didn't suck, right?\n\n135\n00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,387\nHe could probably build one that worked\nwell or we could go and buy one.\n\n136\n00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,220\nRight?\nIn that case, it's a tangible item.\n\n137\n00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,280\nWe could build it internally.\n\n138\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,690\nNate could make it or\nwe could go and buy one and\n\n139\n00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,090\nwe wouldn't have to worry about it,\nprobably have a warranty and all that.\n\n140\n00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,490\nSo, the value of us going out and\n\n141\n00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,100\nbuying one is we know it's built up and\nsomebody that was a specialist made it.\n\n142\n00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,340\nThat might be valuable to me.\n\n143\n00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,601\nBut, there might be something\nthat doesn't have that value.\n\n144\n00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,865\nAnd so I decide, let's go ahead and\ndo it internally.\n\n145\n00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:07,740\nIf that cough button that's being sold\nout there online is really expensive.\n\n146\n00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,760\nIt might not match up with\nthe value that I attach to it.\n\n147\n00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,750\nSo when we measure that value, that's\nthe customers prospective and not ours.\n\n148\n00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,290\nThe outcome is what that\ncustomer is expecting to get.\n\n149\n00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,070\nSo if that outcome is a tangible item,\nthey expect to get it and\n\n150\n00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,290\nthey expect it to work, right.\n\n151\n00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,450\nAnd so we'll have issues of warranty and\nutility that we'll talk about later.\n\n152\n00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,400\nBut if it's a service, right, then that's\n\n153\n00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,560\nwhat they're expecting is a service to\nbe performed to their specifications.\n\n154\n00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,160\nAnd that's where IT starts to get really\nflaky because in the IT industry,\n\n155\n00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,420\nsome of the things we can do\ncan be very hard to measure.\n\n156\n00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,790\nSoftware developers have to\nworry about this all the time.\n\n157\n00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,480\nIf you have a customer saying I\nneed you to write this program for\n\n158\n00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,320\nme and I want the program to be fast,\n\n159\n00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,580\nI don't want the users to have to\nwait on responses from the program.\n\n160\n00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,900\nWell, how do you define fast?\n\n161\n00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,590\nThere's a number.\n\n162\n00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,800\nYou can attach a number.\n\n163\n00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,570\nWhen a user clicks on a button,\n\n164\n00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,350\nI need the program to respond\nwithin 200 milliseconds.\n\n165\n00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,930\nThat's as long as I'll let\na customer wait, all right.\n\n166\n00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,140\nNow we can measure that.\n\n167\n00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,140\nBut if, just say, you wanted it to be\nfast, that's just perception and now it's\n\n168\n00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,940\nreally hard to live up to that, to make\nsure we meet the customer's expectation.\n\n169\n00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,000\nSo the outcome is also really\ndefined by the customer and\n\n170\n00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,870\nwe have to live up to that.\n\n171\n00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,300\n>> Yeah.\nI think that the key point that I like,\n\n172\n00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,660\nthat you made Don, is that the values\nis absolutely defined by the customer.\n\n173\n00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,240\nI can absolutely suggest\nwhat the value could be.\n\n174\n00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,940\nI can tell you, hey, this is what this is\nworth, this is why you should appreciate\n\n175\n00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,960\nit, but if you look at it from\nyour own experience and you go,\n\n176\n00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,770\nwell, I got the same value from this guy.\n\n177\n00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,470\nWell what makes yours different?\n\n178\n00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,420\nSo what we're trying to do is actually\nallow the customer to say hey,\n\n179\n00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,180\nhere's what service we need and\nwe try and meet that expectation and\n\n180\n00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,230\nthat's what will end up providing value.\n\n181\n00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,580\nIt's not really from the perspective\nthat I want to give.\n\n182\n00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,820\nIt's always about what\nthe customer needs and\n\n183\n00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,760\nwhat we're actually going\nto have to provide.\n\n184\n00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,040\n>> And that idea of a customer is\nsomething else we need to know.\n\n185\n00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,330\nSo we took a look at what\nan actual service was, right.\n\n186\n00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,930\nSo that service offering that we make.\n\n187\n00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,110\nWhat is our customer?\n\n188\n00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,250\nAnd that can vary too, right?\n\n189\n00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,700\nIn ITIL, your organization is\nwhat's called a service provider.\n\n190\n00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,910\nAnd some people call it\nan IT service provider,\n\n191\n00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,810\nbut you're just a service\nprovider of some sort.\n\n192\n00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,230\nAnd so you are creating or\nfacilitating one of these services that\n\n193\n00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,850\ncreates a value that your customer wants,\nright.\n\n194\n00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,710\nThat creates that outcome that you need.\n\n195\n00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,840\nNow, when you do that,\nwho is your customer?\n\n196\n00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,200\nWho are you serving?\n\n197\n00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,700\nAnd ITIL has three distinct categories or\ntypes of customers.\n\n198\n00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,740\nThey have type one, type two and\ntype three customers, all right.\n\n199\n00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,400\nThe most common, the one we normally\nthink of, is a type three customer.\n\n200\n00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,380\nAnd that's an external customer.\n\n201\n00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,420\nSo here at IT Pro TV,\nwhen we make a video.\n\n202\n00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,430\nSo we're filming this\nITEL series right now.\n\n203\n00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,040\nWe're filming that for\nyou guys, all right.\n\n204\n00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,480\nI already know this stuff,\nI didn't need an ITEL video,\n\n205\n00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,350\nespecially not one that I made.\n\n206\n00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,510\nI might need one from somebody else\nto get a different perspective.\n\n207\n00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,010\nI don't need one from me.\n\n208\n00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,265\nSo my Customer is you guys,\n\n209\n00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:04,565\nyou guys out there on the Internet,\nand if you don't want ITEL training,\n\n210\n00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:08,475\nif you don't need this type of thing,\nthen I'm not creating value to you, right.\n\n211\n00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,285\nSo that's how easy to measure.\n\n212\n00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,335\nWe usually call this market demand, right.\n\n213\n00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:13,845\nIn the financial world,\nit's market demand.\n\n214\n00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,135\nIf you guys are demanding it and\nwilling to pay for it,\n\n215\n00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:20,145\nall we have to do is offer it and you get\nthe value of the product you wanted and\n\n216\n00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,035\nwe get revenue,\nwhich keeps us in business.\n\n217\n00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:22,595\nEverybody's happy.\n\n218\n00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:23,680\nIt's a win-win.\n\n219\n00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,850\nThat's what you expect to see with\na type three external customer.\n\n220\n00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,640\nBut it's not always external is it.\n\n221\n00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,170\n>> No.\n\n222\n00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,410\nThere's also a couple\nof different types but\n\n223\n00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,110\nas we take a look at it,\nthere's a type two\n\n224\n00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,140\ntype of customer that we have which is\ncalled a shared a type of provision.\n\n225\n00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,460\nFor us, that could be internal and\nexternal customers too.\n\n226\n00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,259\nWhere I, as a service provider.\n\n227\n00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:46,813\n>> Let me.\nSorry.\n\n228\n00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:47,960\nIt's internal only.\n\n229\n00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,610\n>> Internal only.\n\n230\n00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,181\nSorry.\n\n231\n00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,599\n>> It gets a little grey area.\n\n232\n00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:51,691\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right.\n\n233\n00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,772\nSo let's run over these real quick then to\nmake sure they're separated because you\n\n234\n00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,356\ncan use,\nyou can have more than one type and\n\n235\n00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,605\nthat's where you start to get blurred,\nright.\n\n236\n00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,438\nIs really strict on this on the exam,\n\n237\n00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:02,814\nI wanna make sure you\ndon't get any confusion.\n\n238\n00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:06,346\nType three is external only and I'm going\nbackwards on this because I'm going from\n\n239\n00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,920\nthe most common to the least common.\n\n240\n00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,660\nSo type three is external customers only,\nyou work for a company,\n\n241\n00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,170\nyou create this service, your customer\nis not working for your company.\n\n242\n00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,260\nMight have a contract a service\nagreement something like that but\n\n243\n00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,020\nthey're not your employee.\n\n244\n00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,670\nWith type 2 it's a shared\ninternal customer, right.\n\n245\n00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,710\nWhat that means is that you are working\nfor a particular business unit in\n\n246\n00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,400\nyour organization, or organizational unit-\nwhatever terminology you wanna use there.\n\n247\n00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,970\nYour organizational unit, your business\nunit It's providing a service for\n\n248\n00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,240\nmore than one other business\nunit that's out there, but\n\n249\n00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,570\nthose business units are all\npart of the same company.\n\n250\n00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,660\nAnd this is very, very common for\nIT departments, because if you're\n\n251\n00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,020\nrunning an IT department and let's say\nyou're on the desktop support team.\n\n252\n00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,040\nSo you're the one that's responsible for\n\n253\n00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,750\nputting desktops on all\nthe employees computers.\n\n254\n00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,560\nYou're helping more than one department.\n\n255\n00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,860\nYou're putting computers on\nthe accounting people's desk.\n\n256\n00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,550\nYou're putting computers on\nthe sales people's desks.\n\n257\n00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,140\nYou're putting computer on the whatever,\nmarketing, accounting, sales,\n\n258\n00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,390\nall these different people.\n\n259\n00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,910\nThey'll all different departments and\n\n260\n00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,430\nyou're providing one service, desktop\nfunctionality, to multiple departments.\n\n261\n00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,740\nSo they call that a shared\ninternal service provider.\n\n262\n00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,070\nSo you are one organizational unit\nproviding services to more than one\n\n263\n00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,450\nall within one company.\n\n264\n00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,310\nThese are tricky because you\ndon't normally build, right.\n\n265\n00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,390\nIf I deal with an external customer,\n\n266\n00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,120\nyou always charge money otherwise\nyou go out of business.\n\n267\n00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,780\nThat's how companies work, but internally,\n\n268\n00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,030\ndoes it make sense for\none business unit to charge another one?\n\n269\n00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,570\nNot normally, but\nthat doesn't mean they don't track.\n\n270\n00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,710\nYou usually do track the time and\npayroll and all of that.\n\n271\n00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,020\nBecause you'll do an internal\nbilling that's not a true billing.\n\n272\n00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,910\nThere won't be money changing hands.\n\n273\n00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,370\nBut they need to keep\ntrack of which departments\n\n274\n00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,680\nare consuming more IT\nresources than others.\n\n275\n00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,140\nAnd when they work that IT budget at\nthe end of the year, the budget will be\n\n276\n00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,201\ndivided up amongst those departments\nappropriately, all right.\n\n277\n00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,160\nNow the least common is a type one,\nand a type one is another internal.\n\n278\n00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,600\nAll right, but it's not shared.\n\n279\n00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720\nThis is where your\nan organizational unit and\n\n280\n00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,320\nyou're providing an IT service for\nonly one other organizational unit.\n\n281\n00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,190\nIt might even be yourself, but it's\nusually a another Organizational unit.\n\n282\n00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,250\nAnd not more than one.\n\n283\n00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:34,160\nSo that means if I'm in the IT department\nand we're doing something specifically for\n\n284\n00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240\nthe marketing department, right.\n\n285\n00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,470\nNo other department is using it.\n\n286\n00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,220\nIt's just marketing.\n\n287\n00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,050\nThen marketing is responsible for\nall of the charges.\n\n288\n00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,620\nAll of the billing that's associated\nwith that activity and Just them.\n\n289\n00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,160\nThat's the true definition\nof an internal customer.\n\n290\n00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,980\nYou got one customer you're dealing with,\nyou're creating that solution and\n\n291\n00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,890\nthat one customer is responsible for\nall the charges.\n\n292\n00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,090\nSo, let's just recap these.\n\n293\n00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,940\nType one, internal, you're dealing\nwith just one business unit.\n\n294\n00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,140\nType two is internal shared.\n\n295\n00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,530\nYou are dealing with more and\nthan one business unit.\n\n296\n00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,780\nIf one service that you are providing\nmore than one business unit,\n\n297\n00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,760\nwhich defray the cost and\nmakes the solution more flexible.\n\n298\n00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,670\nAnd then, type three is external.\n\n299\n00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,410\nYou are dealing with customers\nthat are outside of your business.\n\n300\n00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,370\nWhen you provide services,\nyou might provide 10 services, and\n\n301\n00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,900\nthree of them might be type one, and\ntwo of them might be type two and\n\n302\n00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,400\none of them might be type three.\n\n303\n00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,510\nAnd that's where it\nstarts to get confusing.\n\n304\n00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,650\nAnd so, like you were saying,\n\n305\n00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,520\nRonnie, you were saying the actual\nmost common one, right.\n\n306\n00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,740\nIt's rare that an IT department\ncreates a solution just for\n\n307\n00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,650\none business unit inside of the company.\n\n308\n00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,000\nWe do normally spread them across.\n\n309\n00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,997\nAnd we provide services to the external\nusers so we end up with this mixture of\n\n310\n00:15:51,997 --> 00:15:57,306\ntype two and type three, but when you look\nat a service, it's really really rare\n\n311\n00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:02,720\nthat you would have something that was a\ntype three and a type two service, right.\n\n312\n00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,086\nThere's not a lot of companies that would\nprovide something like, let's say email.\n\n313\n00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:10,068\nRight, so I want to provide email\nfunctionality as a service to my users.\n\n314\n00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:13,800\nWell, I would want to provide email\naccounts to my internal employees, but\n\n315\n00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,630\nnot email accounts to\nthe rest of the world, right?\n\n316\n00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,480\nSo that might be type two,\n\n317\n00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,760\nor I might want to provide email\naccounts to the rest of the world.\n\n318\n00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,770\nBut I want that stuff separate\nfrom my internal stuff,\n\n319\n00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,580\nI don't want them stored\non the same servers.\n\n320\n00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,100\nSo now we have a type 2 service for\n\n321\n00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,920\ninternal email and a type 3 for external,\ncompletely separated and isolated.\n\n322\n00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,880\nCompanies like Microsoft do that\nwhere they've got outlook.com,\n\n323\n00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,820\ntheir public email servers,\n\n324\n00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,665\ncompletely separate from the ones they\nused internally for their own employees.\n\n325\n00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:46,735\nAnd so you really won't,\nwell, it's not impossible but\n\n326\n00:16:46,735 --> 00:16:51,595\nit's pretty uncommon, to see\nsomething be type three and type one.\n\n327\n00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,520\nOr type three and type two.\n\n328\n00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,840\nYou'll never see something\nthat's type one and type two.\n\n329\n00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,660\nThat's not possible, right.\n\n330\n00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,600\nSo you're usually going to have them fall\ninto one of these distinct categories.\n\n331\n00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,450\nBut they can blur the lines a little bit.\n\n332\n00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,190\nAll right so those are the three customer\ntypes that we've got out there and\n\n333\n00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:11,720\nwhen we build a service we're\naddressing one of those types.\n\n334\n00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,130\nAnd that's how we determine\nthe measures for our service.\n\n335\n00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,880\nSo we've got to understand that too.\n\n336\n00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,700\nThese concepts are really important,\n\n337\n00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,550\nbecause as we go to plan our strategies,\nthis is what feeds into it.\n\n338\n00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,970\nThis is how we know our strategy.\n\n339\n00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,690\nThis is how we get that idea\nof what do we need to offer?\n\n340\n00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,030\nWhat's right for our customer?\n\n341\n00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,970\nAre we meeting their needs now?\n\n342\n00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,130\nMaybe we were in the past but\nwe're not anymore.\n\n343\n00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,640\nAll of that stuff stems from\nwhoever is making the demands.\n\n344\n00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,242\nSo real important to make sure\nwe've got that separation out.\n\n345\n00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:44,670\nAll right now, the service strategy\nitself is made up of a lot.\n\n346\n00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,590\nIf you actually go and get the service\nstrategy guide the way it breaks these\n\n347\n00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,320\nthings up is that you'll normally start\nwith a section on key concepts so\n\n348\n00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,910\nit will break down various things.\n\n349\n00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,280\nAnd then it will have a purpose.\n\n350\n00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,180\nAnd an objective for that stage or\nthat particular body of knowledge.\n\n351\n00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,150\nAnd then it'll have\na breakdown of processes.\n\n352\n00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,100\nAnd the processes are how you\nactually implement this stuff.\n\n353\n00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,570\nAnd then beyond that it'll\nhave this huge set of,\n\n354\n00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,300\nfor lack of a better term,\nsamples or examples.\n\n355\n00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,660\nOf ways you implement\nthis in your environment.\n\n356\n00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,340\nAnd that's the real\nvalue of iTil is showing\n\n357\n00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,660\nto actually do that implementation.\n\n358\n00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,940\nBut here at the foundation level we\njust need to understand the concepts of\n\n359\n00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,950\nwhat happens.\n\n360\n00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,930\nAnd I find one of the best ways to do\nthat is to run over the processes that\n\n361\n00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,770\nare involved and how they work.\n\n362\n00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,790\nSo with service strategy as a whole,\n\n363\n00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:36,490\nwe're trying to set our\noverall company direction.\n\n364\n00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,530\nThe direction our company is moving as far\nas the services that we offer so that we\n\n365\n00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,990\nalways create value to the customer and\nthat we stay relevant in the market place,\n\n366\n00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,380\nbecause you might be the number one\ncompany today on top of it all.\n\n367\n00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,830\nAnd then it doesn't take long and\n\n368\n00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,040\nall of the sudden your company\nis at the bottom, right?\n\n369\n00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,010\nIt's actually really easy to think of\nsome big examples that have happened in\n\n370\n00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,990\nrecent times.\n\n371\n00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,530\nI bet if I were to poll our viewers,\n\n372\n00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,840\nthe majority of you have had a Blackberry\nsmart phone at one point or another.\n\n373\n00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,700\nA lot of us did, I know I got my first\none back in probably fourteen or\n\n374\n00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,470\nfifteen years ago and for\na period of about a good eight or\n\n375\n00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,950\nnine years,\nI had a Blackberry on me at all times.\n\n376\n00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,610\nI used the heck out of that thing.\n\n377\n00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,700\nI was a loyal Blackberry customer, I went\nthrough several of them over the years.\n\n378\n00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,510\nI used the heck out of that phone and they\nwere the market leader for Smartphones.\n\n379\n00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,350\nIf you wanted a phone\nthat could do e-mail and\n\n380\n00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,120\nall that stuff,\nthey were the ones to go to.\n\n381\n00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,010\nBut today, they have a market\nshare that is teetering on 1%,\n\n382\n00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,180\nit is just super below\nwhere they used to be.\n\n383\n00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,080\nI mean, they are a giant that toppled\nIn a very short span of time.\n\n384\n00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,810\nWhat happened is advancements\noccurred in their field.\n\n385\n00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,790\nNew technologies came out, and\nthey didn't adapt with that.\n\n386\n00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,610\nThey had a great strategy for a long time.\n\n387\n00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,110\nFor a good ten years they had an amazing\nstrategy that allowed them to provide\n\n388\n00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,240\na service they create a value for\ntheir customer.\n\n389\n00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,740\nThen things change and\nother companies provided a better value.\n\n390\n00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,130\nAnd as a result,\ntheir company is now struggling.\n\n391\n00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,480\nThey actually are profitable again,\nso they've turned that corner,\n\n392\n00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,500\nbut they are doing sales\nfigures 200% below and stuff.\n\n393\n00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,890\nIt's pretty bad.\n>> Nowhere close to where they were.\n\n394\n00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,370\n>> And that all comes from strategy.\n\n395\n00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,020\nStrategy is not about what\nyou're doing right now.\n\n396\n00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,710\nIt's what you need to do next.\n\n397\n00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,160\nIt's that vision, right.\n\n398\n00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,820\nKeeping yourself up to date.\n\n399\n00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,050\nAnd it's constantly changing.\n\n400\n00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,080\nYou can never rest on your laurels.\n\n401\n00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,440\nThe annals of business history\nis littered with that.\n\n402\n00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,920\nSo your executives, your managers, they're\nthe ones who are setting that vision,\n\n403\n00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,860\nsetting that destination\nof where you need to be.\n\n404\n00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,920\nAnd so this is where you will start to\nhear about things like mission, purpose,\n\n405\n00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,750\nvalues, visions, all of those different\nthings that companies come up with to make\n\n406\n00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,900\nsure they're moving in\nthe right direction.\n\n407\n00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,400\nAnd we measure all of\nthe services we provide against\n\n408\n00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,420\nthose dreams, those goals that\nour company is working towards.\n\n409\n00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,520\nAnd everything should be in alignment.\n\n410\n00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,630\nThat's a key word right there, alignment.\n\n411\n00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,950\nService strategy is really about creating\nvalue for the customer and making sure\n\n412\n00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:19,220\nthat all of your services are in alignment\nwith that vision of creating value.\n\n413\n00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,990\nSo, it's a challenging thing,\nit's a constant thing.\n\n414\n00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,540\nIt's constantly going on.\n\n415\n00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,740\nYour average IT person though,\nif you're working at a help desk\n\n416\n00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,640\nyou're probably not setting\nthe strategy for your company.\n\n417\n00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,270\nYou got feedback into it.\n\n418\n00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,750\nYou talk to the customers.\n\n419\n00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,720\nYou get information.\n\n420\n00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440\nYou test the waters.\n\n421\n00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,330\nYou see what's going on out there.\n\n422\n00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,370\nEven not just the customer,\nreading the news, staying informed.\n\n423\n00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,570\nYou hear about new technologies\nthat are coming down the line.\n\n424\n00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,100\nYou can say, hey guys, this touch-screen\nthing I think it's going to be around\n\n425\n00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,170\na while, so we probably need to start\nadapting our software for touchscreens.\n\n426\n00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,330\nI think our customers will\nreally find value in that.\n\n427\n00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,900\nRight?\n\n428\n00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,980\nVersus if we don't and saying, no.\n\n429\n00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,170\nWe're not going to do touchscreens.\n\n430\n00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,760\nWe like our scroll wheel,\nor our mouse, or whatever.\n\n431\n00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,450\nAnd all of a sudden you get left behind.\n\n432\n00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,770\nSo that's really what service\nstrategy centers around.\n\n433\n00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,250\nAll right, now throughout the rest of this\nshow we're going to be covering the five\n\n434\n00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,580\nmain processes inside of service strategy\nand I've get them kind of listed here.\n\n435\n00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,450\nLet's take a look at this here.\n\n436\n00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,750\nI guess I've got a bunch of stuff here on\nmy screen, but it's these guys right here.\n\n437\n00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,390\nThe five processes and so\n\n438\n00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,670\nwe're going to start talking\nabout strategy management, right?\n\n439\n00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,530\nThat's the first part and there's\nstrategy management for the company and\n\n440\n00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,100\nthere's strategy management for\nIT services and they can be different.\n\n441\n00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,670\nHopefully, they're aligned,\nbut they can be different and\n\n442\n00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,490\nthat can be a sign of a problem.\n\n443\n00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,920\nSo we're going to talk about how we\nhandle that strategy management and\n\n444\n00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,450\nwhat we do there.\n\n445\n00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,800\nWe're going to look at\nservice portfolio management.\n\n446\n00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,150\nYou're most likely going to\noffer more than one service.\n\n447\n00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,380\nMaybe even, hundreds of services.\n\n448\n00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,790\nHow do we keep control of that?\n\n449\n00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,290\nWhat services do we offer now?\n\n450\n00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,120\nWhat services we're going\nto offer in the future.\n\n451\n00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,910\nWhat services we should get rid of.\n\n452\n00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,660\nThat's all part of service\nportfolio management.\n\n453\n00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,230\nWe've got Financial management for\nIT services.\n\n454\n00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,930\nAnd again, you've got financial management\nfor the whole company, this is for\n\n455\n00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,580\nthe IT services side.\n\n456\n00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,920\nAnd that can be really tricky.\n\n457\n00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,300\nI know I said this in another episode,\n\n458\n00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,450\nbut the IT department doesn't\nnormally make the company money.\n\n459\n00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,000\nThey normally spend money.\n\n460\n00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,350\nSo it is kind of important that\nwe track our finances on that.\n\n461\n00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,340\nWe're going to cover demand management,\nwhich technically isn't on the exam, but\n\n462\n00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,900\nI think is pretty important and so we need\nto make sure we understand it, which is\n\n463\n00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,040\nhelping to control our customer demand and\nmaking sure that we're ready to handle it.\n\n464\n00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,130\nAnd there's ways that we can increase and\n\n465\n00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,990\ndecrease customer demand\nbased on what we need.\n\n466\n00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,700\nAnd lastly,\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n467\n00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,840\nYou are going to be numerous business\nrelations with your customers\n\n468\n00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,250\nas well as with other businesses that\nyou partner with to create services.\n\n469\n00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,460\nWe've got to be able to handle those and\ncommunicate effectively and\n\n470\n00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,610\nmake sure they stay aligned\nwith what our goals are.\n\n471\n00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,060\nOtherwise the partnership\nis not beneficial anymore.\n\n472\n00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,590\nSo these are the five main\nprocesses that we're going to see.\n\n473\n00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,910\nAnd we'll break each one down and kind of\ntalk about how they work, what they do,\n\n474\n00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,860\nand get an idea of what is expected of\na company as far as service strategy.\n\n475\n00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,530\nAll right.\nSo that's a pretty good spot for\n\n476\n00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,830\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n477\n00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,427\nWhen we get back, we'll pick up with\nthat first one, Strategy Management for\n\n478\n00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:08,089\nIT Services.\n\n479\n00:24:08,089 --> 00:24:10,294\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n480\n00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:15,310\n[SOUND]\n\n481\n00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,354\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n482\n00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:24,391\nSo, in this segment we're gonna kick off\ntaking a look at strategy management for\n\n483\n00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:25,990\nIT services.\n\n484\n00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,300\nNow, when it comes to creating a strategy,\nstep one is your company\n\n485\n00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,200\nhas to have an overall strategy, so\nthat when it comes to your IT services,\n\n486\n00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,500\nwhat you're doing is aligned\nwith that overall strategy.\n\n487\n00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,850\nIf you are a really, really large company,\n\n488\n00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,310\nthen you might actually have separate\nstrategies, just for the IT department.\n\n489\n00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,860\nAll right.\n\n490\n00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,350\nBut most companies aren't at that point.\n\n491\n00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,457\nEven large multinational organizations\ntypically won't have individual strategies\n\n492\n00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:56,260\ninside of their IT department.\n\n493\n00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,210\nBut you could if you were\na big IT company like IBM.\n\n494\n00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,090\nIBM, they have service personnel\nall over the globe and\n\n495\n00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,545\ntons of different initiatives going on.\n\n496\n00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,775\nSo they'll break down and have specific\nstrategies inside of their IT departments,\n\n497\n00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,805\nbut typically we have these\ncorporate level, right.\n\n498\n00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:15,595\nBecause at the end of the day,\nour company provides a product and\n\n499\n00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:20,920\nmost the time that service or product\nis not IT services, sometimes it is,\n\n500\n00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,215\nyou're in ISP or whatever and that my be\ndifferent, but in most cases it isn't.\n\n501\n00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:29,000\nAnd so the overall strategy is simply\nwhat the IT department has to support.\n\n502\n00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,270\nSo when we talk about that strategy\nmanagement for IT services,\n\n503\n00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,930\nwe're saying the strategy management's\nalready happened at the company level.\n\n504\n00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,020\nAnd we're adjusting our IT\nservices to support that.\n\n505\n00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,630\nRight?\n\n506\n00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,480\nSo where's does this kick off?\n\n507\n00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,650\nWhere does this all start?\n\n508\n00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n509\n00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,170\nLot of times when we think about it right,\n\n510\n00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,870\nin terms of people being\ninvolved in the strategy.\n\n511\n00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,410\nWe normally are gonna start off with\nthe executives that are really trying\n\n512\n00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,680\nto push what needs to be done to meet\nthe business goals that they have.\n\n513\n00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,528\nAnd then we as the IT department match and\ngo ahead and\n\n514\n00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:03,542\nthen formulate what we need to do as\na strategy to help meet those goals that\n\n515\n00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:07,470\nsomeone like the actual executives\nactually want to push out.\n\n516\n00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,735\nWe also have to think\nabout the customer too,\n\n517\n00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,855\nand who we're gonna be trying\nto provide a service for.\n\n518\n00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:16,955\nAnd they may all come into play when we\nactually start building the management\n\n519\n00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,493\npart of what we need to do to\npresent the value to our customer.\n\n520\n00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:22,565\n>> Yeah, so\nIT has a specific term for this,\n\n521\n00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:25,720\nthey call it,\nstakeholders in service management.\n\n522\n00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,100\nThat's the official term.\n\n523\n00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,430\nAnd when it comes to creating a strategy,\nthere's more than one person involved.\n\n524\n00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,020\nTypically, not always,\nyou hear these stories like Apple,\n\n525\n00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,160\nwhere you had Steve Jobs who\nis the dictator who was,\n\n526\n00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,780\nit was just his strategy and\nno one else had one.\n\n527\n00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,830\nBut most companies don't\noperate like that.\n\n528\n00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,620\nSo you may have an executive office,\n\n529\n00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,400\nseveral different executives\nthat are involved.\n\n530\n00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,740\nYou might have a board.\n\n531\n00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,320\nYou have a customer, or\nmore than one customer.\n\n532\n00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,090\nThese are all people\nthat are stake holders.\n\n533\n00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,540\nThey have an interest in that service.\n\n534\n00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,080\nRight.\n\n535\n00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,910\nIf you're the customer, you have an\ninterest in the service becoming available\n\n536\n00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,630\nto you and creating value.\n\n537\n00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,900\nIf you are the company,\nyou have an interest in it,\n\n538\n00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,550\nyou wanna create a successful service\nthat moves the company's goals forward.\n\n539\n00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,450\nIf you're an investor, you have\nan interest in the service because\n\n540\n00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,770\nyou want to make sure that\nit makes the company money.\n\n541\n00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,580\nNot all services make companies money but\nthey lead to other benefits.\n\n542\n00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,535\nA great example of that\nis Amazon Web Services.\n\n543\n00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,023\nAmazon Web Services or\n\n544\n00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:23,263\nAWS is one of the largest online\nhosting providers in the world.\n\n545\n00:27:23,263 --> 00:27:26,456\nIf you want to whip up an email server,\na web server,\n\n546\n00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:29,170\nyou can go to Amazon Web Services.\n\n547\n00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,310\nSpin one up right now and\n\n548\n00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,170\nthey charge you in a lot of cases\njust pennies per hour to run it.\n\n549\n00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,030\nSo, it's very inexpensive.\n\n550\n00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,680\nWell, they posted a loss\nof $2 billion last year.\n\n551\n00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,290\nThat's a lot of money.\n\n552\n00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,320\nAmazon is losing money on that.\n\n553\n00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,050\nBut it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing,\nright.\n\n554\n00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,850\nSure they're losing money, but\ncustomers find a lot of value in that.\n\n555\n00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,930\nAnd the more value we find in the service,\nthe more reliably we use it and\n\n556\n00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,360\nthe more married into\nAmazon's ecosystem we become.\n\n557\n00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,040\nAnd so there's other benefits that are\nnon-financial, so keep that in mind, too.\n\n558\n00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,320\nWe need to know who the stakeholders are\nbecause they're the ones who are directing\n\n559\n00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,750\nthis strategy forward, they're the ones\nwho are going to be creating it.\n\n560\n00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,610\nSo, when we deal with strategy\nmanagement it usually\n\n561\n00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,660\ndoes come down to planning meetings,\nthings where we get people together and\n\n562\n00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,430\nthey start working on what that\noverall strategy is going to be.\n\n563\n00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,350\n>> Every company will also end up having\nwhat we call a company culture that will\n\n564\n00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,520\nend up developing.\n\n565\n00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,870\nSo all of the strategy can be\ninfluenced by so many different things.\n\n566\n00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,440\nWe talked about it right before the show,\nbut\n\n567\n00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,215\nit comes down to what we\ncall the four Ps right Don?\n\n568\n00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,320\n>> Mm-huh, yeah.\n\n569\n00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880\nAnd so we were talking about\nit before the show because I\n\n570\n00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,120\ntook some business classes in college and\nI learned about the five Ps and\n\n571\n00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,960\nso I always get confused on this and\ncan't remember which one to leave off.\n\n572\n00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240\nWith I Tel we have the 4 P's.\n\n573\n00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,960\nYou have perspective,\nposition, plans, and patterns.\n\n574\n00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,730\nPerspective, that is your company culture,\nthat Ronny was talking about.\n\n575\n00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,505\nYour company has a way of doing things.\n\n576\n00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:57,615\nLet's look at IT at ITProTV, right?\n\n577\n00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:59,095\nSo for us we have a culture.\n\n578\n00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:02,625\nAnd our culture says\nwe wanna give you guys\n\n579\n00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,780\nas much training as possible\nwithout becoming expensive.\n\n580\n00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,860\nThere's a lot of training out there.\n\n581\n00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,010\nYou guys don't have to watch with us.\n\n582\n00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:12,370\nYou can find hundreds of other\npeople that do ITEL training.\n\n583\n00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,470\nSo, what do we do that's different?\n\n584\n00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,688\nWhat's our culture?\n\n585\n00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,190\nWe try and make it entertaining,\nor you know,\n\n586\n00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,690\nas entertaining as we can and\nwe try to make it affordable.\n\n587\n00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,249\nThose are some of\nthe things that we deliver.\n\n588\n00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:26,830\nYour company has a set of values,\nright and that's what they live up to.\n\n589\n00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,740\nYou hear about companies like Zappos where\nthey have this great employee culture, and\n\n590\n00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,810\nit shows in the services\nthey choose to offer.\n\n591\n00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,950\nThey can offer whatever service\nthey wanted, but they specialize in\n\n592\n00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,510\nsome because they know that's what they're\ngreat at, that's what they wanna do.\n\n593\n00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,040\nThat's their culture.\n\n594\n00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,870\nSo whenever they take on a new service\n\n595\n00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,240\ntheir strategy's heavily\ninfluenced by their culture.\n\n596\n00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,690\nThey've got a way of doing business that\nthey're used to, and that's really what\n\n597\n00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,930\nthey're gonna try and stick with,\nbecause they've been successful with it.\n\n598\n00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,710\n>> Yeah.\nAnother one of\n\n599\n00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,290\nthose Ps is the idea of position.\n\n600\n00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,460\nWe talk about position,\nwe're really talk about the market share,\n\n601\n00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,760\nhow we feel like we're influencing\nwhatever market that we're in.\n\n602\n00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,320\nAnd if we have a larger market share,\nthings may change for\n\n603\n00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,735\nus in what we will provide or\nwhat we can provide.\n\n604\n00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:15,400\nAnd then, if we are actually smaller,\nwe may do more things to help us in our\n\n605\n00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,640\nstrategy to try and be more aggressive at\nsome of those services that we may offer.\n\n606\n00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,490\n>> Yeah.\nYou may find that you're moving into\n\n607\n00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,940\na very crowded marketplace, where there's\nmany other vendors that are out there that\n\n608\n00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,430\nare providing your same service.\n\n609\n00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,300\nAnd so\nwhat is it that's gonna set yours apart?\n\n610\n00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,427\nHow do you fit in that marketplace that\nmakes people want to deal with you?\n\n611\n00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:38,890\nAnd there's a few ways\nthat you can penetrate it.\n\n612\n00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,220\nIf you ever sit down and read the service\nstrategy manual, again not something you\n\n613\n00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,970\nwanna read cover to cover, believe me, but\nthere's some really good stuff in there,\n\n614\n00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,830\nbecause it'll talk about\ndifferent strategies.\n\n615\n00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,110\nFor example, you might say there's\nsmartwatches that are out there.\n\n616\n00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,390\nA lot of companies make\ndifferent smartwatches.\n\n617\n00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,210\nAnd most of the smartwatches are designed\nfor your general consumer, but\n\n618\n00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,940\nthere's niche people, like athletes,\nwho wanted to have more.\n\n619\n00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,540\nHealth monitors, and\nall this extra stuff built into it.\n\n620\n00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,280\nNot everybody wants that, but they do.\n\n621\n00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,765\nSo maybe the way we fit in the marketplace\nis we're gonna create a smartwatch,\n\n622\n00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:15,020\neven though 20 other companies do, but\nwe're gonna focus on that one niche.\n\n623\n00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,430\nWe're gonna create all the different\naspects that one niche needs.\n\n624\n00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,590\nThat's how we're gonna fit,\nwe're gonna specialize.\n\n625\n00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,810\nAnd that customer is going to find value\nin our product over other people because\n\n626\n00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:28,090\nwe specialize in them, or it might be\nthe opposite, that a lot of people\n\n627\n00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,840\nare offering the watches but they\nare all specialized to different needs.\n\n628\n00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,990\nWe might create one super\nwatch that does all of it, so\n\n629\n00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,780\nnow we're covering all of the bases and\nthat's what differentiates our product,\n\n630\n00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,650\nyou get more functionality out of it.\n\n631\n00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,190\nThere's got to be something\nthat your strategy achieves.\n\n632\n00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,970\nIf you're just entering with the exact\nsame strategy as everyone else,\n\n633\n00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,170\nthen you're relying on brand recognition.\n\n634\n00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,460\nThat's all that's left at that point.\n\n635\n00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,560\nIf you're at the same price point,\n\n636\n00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,600\nsame features, it comes down to brand and\nthat's not something you can plan for\n\n637\n00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,780\nbecause brand is a very fickle thing,\nright.\n\n638\n00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,776\nI really sympathize, or\nI don't want to say it that way,\n\n639\n00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:07,377\nI'm respectful of the intelligence\nit takes to be in marketing.\n\n640\n00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:11,437\nMarketing is such a difficult concept and\nto get the customers\n\n641\n00:32:11,437 --> 00:32:16,286\nto relate to your brand is just not\nsomething that you can really count on.\n\n642\n00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:21,300\nOur third one is plans and for\nsome people this is all they have.\n\n643\n00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,590\nThey don't even think about the other P's.\n\n644\n00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,230\nThey just plan,\nwhich is you get your people together and\n\n645\n00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,000\nyou figure out what you're going to do.\n\n646\n00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,120\nYou evaluate the different ways that\nyou can provide that service and\n\n647\n00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,330\nyou select which one you wanna go on.\n\n648\n00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,580\nYou can do that, but if you do\nthat without your other elements,\n\n649\n00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,640\nyou'll find that you can make mistakes.\n\n650\n00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,385\nYou can move in a direction\nthat's not advantageous, or\n\n651\n00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:43,310\nnot as advantageous as some of\nthe other options that are out there.\n\n652\n00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,200\n>> Yeah.\nA lot of time planning leads\n\n653\n00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,010\nto overplanning and\n\n654\n00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,900\nyou tend to micromanage things instead of\nbeing what we call strategic planners.\n\n655\n00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,210\nThe ability to take all those plans and\nsay, hey, here's the goal we're\n\n656\n00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,630\ntrying to achieve and what are the steps\nthat we need to make it happen?\n\n657\n00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,830\nMost of the time,\nwe need to come up with a plan and\n\n658\n00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,170\nthat's when those little tangents, those\nlittle rabbit trails start coming off.\n\n659\n00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,444\nAnd all of a sudden the idea actually what\nwe wanted to do becomes something else\n\n660\n00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:12,550\nthat we feel like that we\nhave to concentrate on.\n\n661\n00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:17,610\nSo strategic planning is really\na part of just making sure.\n\n662\n00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:23,020\nThat we know what we have on hand and that\nwe can achieve whatever the strategy is.\n\n663\n00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,020\nSometimes this is limited depending\non the personnel that you have.\n\n664\n00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,420\nYou may have people that are really\nnot fully bought into the vision.\n\n665\n00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,960\nOr they may not understand fully\nwhat needs to be achieved and\n\n666\n00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,880\nthey can only bring the process so far.\n\n667\n00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,350\nBut this is a good point for\nthings like consultants to come in,\n\n668\n00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,310\nthat help you to go, all right here's what\nyou need to do to get this thing rolling.\n\n669\n00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,790\n>> And then the last one that\nI have are patterns, and\n\n670\n00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,030\nthis is where you look at\nthe history of the company.\n\n671\n00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,770\nAnd the way you've done\nthings in the past and\n\n672\n00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,290\nas you offer new services you just kind\nof mimic what you did in the past,\n\n673\n00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,050\nthen that can be a good thing\nbecause it creates consistency.\n\n674\n00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,960\nSome customers find value in consistency,\nbut\n\n675\n00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,020\nit can also be a bad thing in that\nthe market place may have changed and\n\n676\n00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,960\nyour status quo is no longer\ngoing to meet the needs.\n\n677\n00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,100\nYou see this in the automotive\nindustry a lot.\n\n678\n00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,430\nWhen they create a new body style or\na new design for a car, usually for\n\n679\n00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,380\nthe next four or five years they'll\ncontinue manufacturing different\n\n680\n00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,410\nmodels of that same car, but from\nthe exterior they basically look the same.\n\n681\n00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,610\nThey're saying it was good enough for last\nyear, we'll just do the same this year.\n\n682\n00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,590\nAnd as long as the model is\nsuccessful they'll stay that way.\n\n683\n00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:34,730\nAnd then if sales ever start to drop, then\nthey'll say aright, now let's go ahead and\n\n684\n00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,840\nredesign that body, let's make\nit look a little more modern and\n\n685\n00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,990\nthen they go from there.\n\n686\n00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,490\nThat's patterns, right?\n\n687\n00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,340\nPatterns that they follow and\nit can be very cyclical,\n\n688\n00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,700\nthey just know that this is the way\nthat they are going to do and for\n\n689\n00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,810\npeople that appreciate consistency, if I\nwant that car to look the same year after\n\n690\n00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,230\nyear, I'm not gonna buy\na car every five years.\n\n691\n00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,930\nI'm gonna buy a car every seven,\nten years.\n\n692\n00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,110\nYou do like Ronnie,\nbuy one every 20 years.\n\n693\n00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,300\n>> Right.\n>> [LAUGH] And so if it comes time for\n\n694\n00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,910\nme to buy a new car,\n\n695\n00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,710\nand I want it to look the same way as\nthe one before it, I hate that it changed.\n\n696\n00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,800\nSo some people don't find value in that.\n\n697\n00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,610\nOther people do.\n\n698\n00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,600\nSo it does matter.\n\n699\n00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,910\nPatterns do influence things.\n\n700\n00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,510\nAnd if you're a pattern based company,\nyou just have to figure out whether or\n\n701\n00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,300\nnot that's gonna be a good thing or\na bad thing.\n\n702\n00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,010\n>> Yeah.\nAnd Don,\n\n703\n00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,830\nI like the fact that you\nmentioned the bad pattern.\n\n704\n00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,820\nOver the years, you and\n\n705\n00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,020\nI have both actually been on the customer\nservice end where we've called somebody.\n\n706\n00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,140\nAnd like are you joking?\n\n707\n00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,470\nYou're making me wait, and wait,\nand wait and never get a response.\n\n708\n00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,790\nSometimes you get hung up.\n\n709\n00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,090\nGet a hang up.\n\n710\n00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,540\nSometimes you even get redirected to\nanother company that really had nothing to\n\n711\n00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,930\neven do with that company to try and\nhelp you out.\n\n712\n00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:41,930\nWell, a lot of these companies have\nnow taken their bad patterns, and\n\n713\n00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,600\nthey've went ahead and instead\nstrategic planning, moving forward,\n\n714\n00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,030\nthey've taken a look at their patterns\nsaying we want to cut that out.\n\n715\n00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,310\nWe want to make sure we\ndon't do those things again.\n\n716\n00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,350\nCuz it's that weird definition\nof insanity, right?\n\n717\n00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,080\nDoing the same things over and\nover again and\n\n718\n00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,500\nexpecting a different\nbehavior to come from it.\n\n719\n00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,860\nIt's just not gonna happen.\n\n720\n00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,260\nSo learning from a bad pattern is just as\neffective as actually learning your good\n\n721\n00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,500\npatterns too.\n\n722\n00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,400\n>> And with the customer service model,\n\n723\n00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,860\nthere are entire companies that\nhave built themselves around this.\n\n724\n00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,190\nA great example is hover.com.\n\n725\n00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,850\nThat too, we use for our DNS registration.\n\n726\n00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,730\nThey started out as\na company that just did DNS.\n\n727\n00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,240\nThere focus was not so\nmuch DNS, but customer service.\n\n728\n00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,428\nThey wanted to be the best\ncustomer service company possible,\n\n729\n00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:26,260\nand it just happened to be their\nfirst product was DNS registration.\n\n730\n00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,020\nDomain names.\n\n731\n00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,589\nAnd so what they did was they said,\nwe wanna make it when a customer\n\n732\n00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,500\ncalls we don't want that phone\nto ring more than twice.\n\n733\n00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,710\nAnd when somebody answers,\nwe want it to be a human being.\n\n734\n00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,430\nAnd not just a human being,\nwe want them to be a DNS expert.\n\n735\n00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,110\nWe want you to be able to call in and\n\n736\n00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,420\nimmediately get a person who can help\nyou with every aspect of your question.\n\n737\n00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,130\nAnd I'll tell you guys I've called-\n>> That's great.\n\n738\n00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:53,670\n>> Hover several times over the years and\nI've always gotten a human when I called,\n\n739\n00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,800\nand they were the one\nthat solved my problem.\n\n740\n00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800\nAnd I'm an IT guy, I know a lot about DNS.\n\n741\n00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,885\nI don't call with easy problems, so\n\n742\n00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,700\nthe people on the other side\nthey're really knowledgeable.\n\n743\n00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,450\nJust in DNS, that's what they focused on.\n\n744\n00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,830\nAnd as that company has grown\nthey've added more services.\n\n745\n00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,300\nNow they do Google apps.\n\n746\n00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,710\nNow, you can do Google apps right through\nGoogle if you want, but with them,\n\n747\n00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,280\nyou pay one extra dollar a month for a\nlicense, and they give you phone support.\n\n748\n00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,650\nAnd you can call and you instantly get\na human and they solve your problem.\n\n749\n00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,810\nAnd so, they're growing the company while\nit looks like their product is DNS,\n\n750\n00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,240\nand their product is now Google apps.\n\n751\n00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,210\nTheir product is actually\ngood customer service.\n\n752\n00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,900\nThat's what differentiates them, right.\n\n753\n00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,800\nAnd that's the type of stuff that\nwe have to come up with when we\n\n754\n00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,490\ndo a strategic plan.\n\n755\n00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,730\nWhat exactly is it that's gonna\nmove our company forward and\n\n756\n00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,160\nmake us attractive to customers?\n\n757\n00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,250\nWhen we define it, there's really a couple\nof little things that we're doing here\n\n758\n00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,480\ninside of strategy management.\n\n759\n00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,370\nI kind of boil it down to a few\nsentences that are in my own words.\n\n760\n00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,670\nThis is the way that I usually explain it.\n\n761\n00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,610\nYour strategy basically lists\nwhat you want to achieve,\n\n762\n00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,890\nhow you're going to achieve, and this\nis the part a lot of people leave off,\n\n763\n00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,550\nhow do you know that you achieved it.\n\n764\n00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,520\nThose are the three things\nthat we need to say.\n\n765\n00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,680\nWhat we're trying to do, how we're going\nto do it, and how we know we're done?\n\n766\n00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680\nHow do you know you\nactually met your goal?\n\n767\n00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,760\nIf you don't set measurable limits to be\nable to tell when you've reach your goal,\n\n768\n00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,910\nthen you just don't know.\n\n769\n00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,940\nYou create uncertainty and it will often\ntimes lead to failure of your strategy.\n\n770\n00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,650\nThat's really what we're\ntrying to boil down when\n\n771\n00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,210\nwe start to come up with a strategy for\nour department.\n\n772\n00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,160\nNow at the end of the day, when we come up\nwith a new strategy for our organization,\n\n773\n00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,630\nwe need to make sure that it's aligned\nwith the overall goal of our company.\n\n774\n00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,730\nSo when we have a strategy,\nyou've got that overall strategy and\n\n775\n00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,190\nthen each of the individual services\nthat are all contributing to it.\n\n776\n00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,260\nSo having that overall strategy is\nimportant, but you may have substrategies\n\n777\n00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,680\ninside of it to handle these various\nservice offerings that you've got.\n\n778\n00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,160\n>> Yeah, and that's a great mention it,\n\n779\n00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,820\nto think about in terms of the business\nitself having a service strategy for\n\n780\n00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,110\neverything that it does,\nthen as the IT department.\n\n781\n00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,700\nSo, a lot of times what ends up happening\nis that you get this kind of support thing\n\n782\n00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,490\nthat the service strategy for\n\n783\n00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,800\nthe company helps to direct the strategic\nstrategy for the IT department.\n\n784\n00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,330\nBut when the IT department figures out\nwhat they're really doing to support\n\n785\n00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,720\nthe business model,\nit is validating the business model or\n\n786\n00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,960\nthe business strategies is also good.\n\n787\n00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,290\nSo it is a validation on one point.\n\n788\n00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:29,620\nBut also is an input for\nthe other one to be able to feed into it.\n\n789\n00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,610\nThere always this cyclical\nidea that you have.\n\n790\n00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,470\nAnd at the end when you're done,\n\n791\n00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,258\nwell you're never truly done\nwith a strategy, right?\n\n792\n00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:40,420\nYou're constantly reevaluating but\nif you have a retreat set up and\n\n793\n00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,190\nyou pull all the executives and\nstakeholders in and\n\n794\n00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,160\nyou come up with your strategy for that\nyear, maybe you're doing that planning.\n\n795\n00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,310\nWhat you create as a part of this process,\nit's really just a few simple things.\n\n796\n00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,660\nThe main thing is an overall strategy,\nright?.\n\n797\n00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,610\nSo we create this strategic plan for\nthe organization.\n\n798\n00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,470\nWhat we want to do to keep our company\nvaluable to our customers over the next\n\n799\n00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,800\nseveral years or\nhowever far out we want to plan.\n\n800\n00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,097\nThen we create various plans for\n\n801\n00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:11,441\nthe organizations inside of our\nbusiness or our business units.\n\n802\n00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:14,680\nAnd those could be operational plans,\nso here is how you are gonna operate,\n\n803\n00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,260\nthings you are going to do day to day.\n\n804\n00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,129\nThese might be tactical\nplans that are saying,\n\n805\n00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,332\nhere's something that you\nneed to implement, right?\n\n806\n00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:22,528\nIf we're going to stay\neffective this next year,\n\n807\n00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,130\nwe've got to come up with\na way to do this, right?\n\n808\n00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,720\nAnd these tactical and operational plans,\nthey're things that our\n\n809\n00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,995\nbusiness units will act on and so\nthat's basically defining their strategy.\n\n810\n00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:34,865\nIt's telling them what they\nneed to achieve without\n\n811\n00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,955\nputting shackles on them and\nsaying you've got to achieve it this way.\n\n812\n00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:40,705\nWe let them determine\nthe best way to achieve\n\n813\n00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,225\nwhatever that plan is setting forth.\n\n814\n00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,630\n>> The last measure that we have,\n\n815\n00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,750\nthat we create once the strategy is in\nplace, is a way to govern the strategy.\n\n816\n00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,920\nA way to promote the strategy and\nmove it forward.\n\n817\n00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,810\nThe term governance is really about that.\n\n818\n00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,600\nIt's making sure, that what we can do,\nis have the clear plan set up and\n\n819\n00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,940\nthat we can follow it, and then once\nthat's done, we now have everything in\n\n820\n00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,290\nplace that we need to do to ensure our\ncompany is going to carry out a strategy.\n\n821\n00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,890\n>> IT governance is even\nmore important where\n\n822\n00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,460\nwe need to be open with our information.\n\n823\n00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,220\nWe need to share that with\nthe various powers that be,\n\n824\n00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,640\ninside of organizations, so\nthat they can properly plan for that.\n\n825\n00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,240\nWhen it comes to expenditures, right,\n\n826\n00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,670\nand progress on activities,\nall of that stuff has to be understood so\n\n827\n00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,220\nwe can gauge where the company is going\nand then how successful we're being.\n\n828\n00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,240\nSo part of strategy management is\nmaking sure that the plans are clear.\n\n829\n00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,230\nThat there's no ambiguity.\n\n830\n00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,485\nYou can get that a lot.\n\n831\n00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:38,015\nPlan is just too vague.\n\n832\n00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:40,615\nWe want to be great this year,\nthat's our plan.\n\n833\n00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:41,695\nWell, okay.\n\n834\n00:41:41,695 --> 00:41:44,085\nHow are we going to be great,\nand what exactly is great?\n\n835\n00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:45,885\nHow do I know when our company is great?\n\n836\n00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:47,015\nIt's not a good plan, right?\n\n837\n00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:51,085\nSo part of the governance is\ngoverning the strategy itself.\n\n838\n00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,625\nIs it clear, is it measurable,\n\n839\n00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,405\nis it something that we\ncan actually work towards?\n\n840\n00:41:55,405 --> 00:41:58,905\nAnd then the other part is making sure\nthat people are working towards it.\n\n841\n00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:00,420\nAre they following the plan?\n\n842\n00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,640\nIf I set out this plan for\nthe next three years of my company,\n\n843\n00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,840\nare we actually working towards that,\nor have people get distracted and\n\n844\n00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,560\nstarted doing other things and\nkind of deviated from what that plan is?\n\n845\n00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,200\nYou see a lot of companies\ndoing that today,\n\n846\n00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,210\nwhere they've got this service,\nthat they're known for working towards.\n\n847\n00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,070\nAnd all of the sudden they start pulling\nresources to do things like pushing\n\n848\n00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,740\nsocial media.\n\n849\n00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,410\nThere's a big thing right now where if a\ncompany doesn't have a Facebook presence,\n\n850\n00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,130\nand a Twitter presence, and so on,\nthat they're considered behind the times.\n\n851\n00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,330\nWell, that presence,\nthat's not their service.\n\n852\n00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,060\nThat's not the service they provide.\n\n853\n00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,420\nIt's just a way for\nthe customer to interact with them.\n\n854\n00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,850\nAnd if you start diverting resources now,\nyou're making\n\n855\n00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,400\nyourself more visible to the customer that\nyou're not serving as well as you used to.\n\n856\n00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,080\nIt can actually be detrimental.\n\n857\n00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,370\nYou've got to stay on target.\n\n858\n00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,830\nStay on your plan, and\nif other things, like social media,\n\n859\n00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,170\nif that's important,\nthose need to be worked into the plan.\n\n860\n00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,470\nYou might need to add extra resources,\nemployees,\n\n861\n00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,020\nwhatever to be able to facilitate that.\n\n862\n00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,470\nBut staying on target,\nit's like in Star Wars,\n\n863\n00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:02,080\nstay on target, that's what\nthe governance piece is all about.\n\n864\n00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,930\nAll right, well,\nthat's the service strategy process.\n\n865\n00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,250\nThat's what's entailed and\nactually it's quite a bit, right.\n\n866\n00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,180\nIt's very, very important, but\n\n867\n00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,250\nyou'll see that each of the other\nprocesses are important too.\n\n868\n00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,680\nThis is a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break, so\n\n869\n00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,810\nlet's take a pause here.\n\n870\n00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,950\nThe next one that we're going to be\nhitting is service portfolio management\n\n871\n00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:27,790\nand this is the one that really makes up\nthe bulk of our service strategy section.\n\n872\n00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,420\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n873\n00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,201\nWe'll be back with that after the break.\n\n874\n00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:37,101\n[MUSIC]\n\n875\n00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:40,967\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody.\n\n876\n00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:45,540\nIn this segment we're going to take\na look at service portfolio management.\n\n877\n00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,270\nAnd when we talk about a portfolio, right,\nthat might be a new term for some of you.\n\n878\n00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,130\nWhat it is, is just a collection\n\n879\n00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,810\nof all of the different services\nthat your company offers.\n\n880\n00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,580\nNow, another area where you hear\nthe word portfolio used a lot is in\n\n881\n00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,750\nproject management.\n\n882\n00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,410\nAnd in project management, you hear about\ncompanies that have a portfolio management\n\n883\n00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,430\nor just a portfolio in general and\nthey're talking about for their projects.\n\n884\n00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,200\nThese are short term endeavors\nthat create some kind of outcome.\n\n885\n00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,420\nAnd while your company likely\nhas projects, you also have\n\n886\n00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,480\nongoing day to day activities and\na portfolio is going to include those two.\n\n887\n00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,630\nSo this is different than what\nyou may have seen in some of\n\n888\n00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,440\nthe project management training\nthat you've participated in.\n\n889\n00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,240\nBut it is really that all\nencompassing picture and\n\n890\n00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,620\nit really goes even beyond\nwhat you've got right now.\n\n891\n00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,360\nCompanies have what's\ncalled a service pipeline.\n\n892\n00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,150\nServices go through various\nphases in the organization.\n\n893\n00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,160\nAnd so you might have services\nyou're thinking about.\n\n894\n00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,640\nYou haven't decided to move forward or\noffer them, you're just possibly,\n\n895\n00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,150\npotentially going to be\noffering that services.\n\n896\n00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,450\nYou've got services you're currently\ndeveloping, that you are moving forward\n\n897\n00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,890\nwith, that you've invested in, but\nthey just haven't made it into production.\n\n898\n00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,650\nYou've got your existing services,\nthe ones that are in production,\n\n899\n00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,320\nthe ones that your customers are paying\nfor that are making your company money.\n\n900\n00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,810\nAnd you've got your retired services.\n\n901\n00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,070\nServices that you used to offer that no\nlonger created value for the customer and\n\n902\n00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,780\nyou phased them out by either\nreplacing them with the new service or\n\n903\n00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,460\njust eliminating them all together.\n\n904\n00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:16,340\nSo understanding that we have\nthose different types of services\n\n905\n00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,710\nhelps us to understand what we\ndeal with in portfolio management.\n\n906\n00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,180\nPortfolio management is really all about\nhow we control when services move from\n\n907\n00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,570\none step to another in our\nservice pipeline, right?\n\n908\n00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,320\nEvery service starts out\nas a potential service,\n\n909\n00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,060\nsomething we think we might want to offer.\n\n910\n00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,560\nWe need to make decisions to find\nout if that's the right thing for\n\n911\n00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,090\nour company to do.\n\n912\n00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:40,060\nDoes it fit, going back to strategy,\ndoes it fit our company's strategy.\n\n913\n00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,950\nDoes it create value for our customers?\n\n914\n00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,770\nHow do we make that decision?\n\n915\n00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,500\nThere's a lot of tools that\nare available for that,\n\n916\n00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,230\nyou'll see a lot of business\nmanagers talk about this but\n\n917\n00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,790\njust from a high-level perspective,\nwe've got things like our service model.\n\n918\n00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:57,630\nA service model is where we look at\nthis potential service, and we say,\n\n919\n00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:02,215\nokay, what would our company be\nlike if we offered that service?\n\n920\n00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:03,465\nHow would that fit,\n\n921\n00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:05,955\nhow would that mesh with the existing\nservices we already have?\n\n922\n00:46:05,955 --> 00:46:10,385\nWould it create problems, is it a big\ndeal to convert from one to the other?\n\n923\n00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,645\nOr will it advance us,\nis that getting us ready for tomorrow,\n\n924\n00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,585\ngetting us ready for\nthe next environment, right?\n\n925\n00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:18,565\nAn example of that would be like Verizon.\n\n926\n00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:22,755\nSo here in the US there's a cell\nphone carrier called Verizon,\n\n927\n00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:27,430\nand about ten years ago,\nmost of the cellular providers had to make\n\n928\n00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,660\na decision whether they wanted to\nstay with the older CDMA networks or\n\n929\n00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,200\nif they wanted to move the newer GSM\nnetworks like the rest of the world.\n\n930\n00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,070\nHere in the U.S., our cellphone system is\na mess so whatever country you happen to\n\n931\n00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:42,370\nbe in, if you're not in the US your\ncell phone system is better than ours.\n\n932\n00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,280\nSo they had to make a decision,\n\n933\n00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,720\nand all the other carriers\ndecided to go the GSM route.\n\n934\n00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,970\nBut Verizon didn't.\n\n935\n00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:49,990\nThey said, you know what?\n\n936\n00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,690\nWe can create better value for\nour customers by having more\n\n937\n00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:58,460\nof this older technology antenna than by\nhaving less of this newer technology.\n\n938\n00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,960\nAnd so they stuck with it, and\n\n939\n00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,700\neven today they have different\nantennas than everybody else.\n\n940\n00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,050\nAnd they retrofit them with higher\ndata speeds, so they do get 4g data.\n\n941\n00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:09,530\nBut your voice call is still being\nsent over this very old network.\n\n942\n00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,040\nBut boy, they've got a lot of towers out\nthere and you have really good signal.\n\n943\n00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,490\nSo it's a different decision that they\nmade as to whether or not they would roll\n\n944\n00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:21,120\nforward with a new service,\nto offer this new technology or not.\n\n945\n00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,440\nThey had to make that decision and\nthey're service model was part of that.\n\n946\n00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,370\nIf they went with the new technology,\nthen they'd have two types of towers.\n\n947\n00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,170\nOverall, all their existing towers.\n\n948\n00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,520\nIt really didn't fit with\nwhat they were trying to do,\n\n949\n00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,610\nwhich was provide great\nreception to their customers.\n\n950\n00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,390\nSo that is what factored into that.\n\n951\n00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,820\nAnd the service model is\njust what we mock it up.\n\n952\n00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,179\nWe pretend, here's what it would look\nlike if we offered that service.\n\n953\n00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,060\n>> Another way that we can do this is\nby using what we call a business case,\n\n954\n00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,670\na business case helps us to determine if\nwhat we want to bring is actually going to\n\n955\n00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,960\ngive the value that we think it's\ngoing to give to our company.\n\n956\n00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,100\nSo sometimes it could just be\na plain monetary value itself.\n\n957\n00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,170\nYou go yes,\nwe believe that if we offer this,\n\n958\n00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,190\nit's going to help us to\nenter into that market.\n\n959\n00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,087\nIt's going to help provide this.\n\n960\n00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:08,170\nThen you don't think about all\nthe other things that might also end up\n\n961\n00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:08,975\nbringing to you.\n\n962\n00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:12,504\nWhat I think of, Don, when I think\nabout this is the idea of cable TV.\n\n963\n00:48:12,504 --> 00:48:14,524\nAt one time we're like, want just cable.\n\n964\n00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:19,180\nAnd all of a sudden they became telephone,\nthey became entertainment, they became so\n\n965\n00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,770\nmany other things.\n\n966\n00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,385\nAnd as much as we enjoy that package deal,\nit may have actually been too much for\n\n967\n00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:29,205\nthem at one particular point in time,\nuntil they were able to catch up.\n\n968\n00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:32,215\n>> If you offer a new service but\nyour customers aren't asking for\n\n969\n00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:34,175\nit, what value did that really create?\n\n970\n00:48:34,175 --> 00:48:36,575\nSo remember,\nvalue's not necessarily dollars but\n\n971\n00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:41,525\nalso your customer's appreciation and\nwillingness to do business with you.\n\n972\n00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:43,405\nThat's kind of what we're catering to.\n\n973\n00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:47,330\nSo that business case is\nhow will this service\n\n974\n00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,650\nadvance our company towards our strategy,\ntowards our goal, right?\n\n975\n00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,450\nAnd if it doesn't line up, then we don't\nhave a good business case to do it.\n\n976\n00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,660\nThere's no reason to invest time and\nmoney and\n\n977\n00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,100\nresources into a service that's\nnot going to forward our company.\n\n978\n00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,250\nThe other thing that we'll\nfactor in is risk management.\n\n979\n00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,640\nEvery service has risks.\n\n980\n00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,160\nWhen you offer a new service\nthere's liabilities,\n\n981\n00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,760\nthere's service level agreements, there's\nall sorts of things that we have to\n\n982\n00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,580\ntake into account, and\nit's possible that even in the process of\n\n983\n00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,470\ncreating the service that we could\nfail to create what we wanted.\n\n984\n00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,360\nIt happens.\n\n985\n00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,330\nLet's stick with\nthe cellular as an example.\n\n986\n00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:24,880\nOne of the guys in our office,\nNate, love Sprint.\n\n987\n00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,440\nSo Sprint is another cellular\nprovider here int he US,\n\n988\n00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,280\nthey're actually owned by\na Japanese company, SoftBank?\n\n989\n00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,840\n>> I don't know.\n\n990\n00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,070\n>> It's not a yes.\n\n991\n00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,960\nSo they're owned by a Japanese\ncompany called SoftBank but\n\n992\n00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,630\nhere in the US it's Sprint.\n\n993\n00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:42,509\nAnd a few years back when the whole\n4G movement was happening many of\n\n994\n00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:47,306\nthe providers backed a technology\ncalled LTE and Sprint decided to\n\n995\n00:49:47,306 --> 00:49:52,206\nback WiMax they said look lets go\nwith WiMax, this other standard.\n\n996\n00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:52,834\nThey said it's better.\n\n997\n00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:55,140\nNow, I don't actually know\nwhether it's better or not.\n\n998\n00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,570\nThere's pros and cons of each, but\nthey backed a different technology.\n\n999\n00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,400\nWhen they looked at the services they\ncould offer, they evaluated WiMAX and\n\n1000\n00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,330\nthey said that was the better way to go.\n\n1001\n00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,630\nAnd they dumped a bunch of money,\na bunch of resources,\n\n1002\n00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,450\nthey put antennas all over and\nthey started turning these things up.\n\n1003\n00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:12,480\nAnd now,\neveryone else has moved away from that.\n\n1004\n00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,650\nEveryone has moved to LTE and\nWiMax is like the also ran.\n\n1005\n00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,180\nThe second place guy.\n\n1006\n00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,470\nAnd so they invested a lot of time,\nmoney, and\n\n1007\n00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:26,560\nresources in there and\nit ended up not being successful.\n\n1008\n00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,670\nThat doesn't mean they\nshouldn't have done it,\n\n1009\n00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,570\nat the time they made the best decision\nthey could with the information they had.\n\n1010\n00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,990\nThey did a business case and they said,\nif we invest in this technology and\n\n1011\n00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:41,860\nit becomes successful, we'll be the first\nnetwork that has this widely deployed.\n\n1012\n00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,500\nPeople will want to come to Sprint to take\nadvantage of our faster towers, right?\n\n1013\n00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,450\nIt didn't pan out, that happens, right?\n\n1014\n00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,330\nAnd a risk manager will\nhelp to identify that.\n\n1015\n00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,090\nThey'll identify the risks, and\n\n1016\n00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,230\nwhat they're looking at\nare probability and impact.\n\n1017\n00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,430\nThose are the two things.\n\n1018\n00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,210\nSo, how likely it is for\nan issue to occur and the impact.\n\n1019\n00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,630\nIf that issue does occur,\nwhat's it going to cost us?\n\n1020\n00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,900\nWhat's it gonna do to affect the service?\n\n1021\n00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,165\nAnd they'll quantify that.\n\n1022\n00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:09,710\nThey'll turn it into numbers, and\nthey'll compare all the various risks\n\n1023\n00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,380\nassociated with the service and come up\nwith a total risk rating for the service.\n\n1024\n00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,970\nAnd your company will decide based on the\namount of risk they are willing to take\n\n1025\n00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:20,270\nwhether or not that is a good idea.\n\n1026\n00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:26,980\nGoogle just did this with,, they had this\nlike at home DNA test kit you can do and\n\n1027\n00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,740\nthey would actually catalog your DNA and\nstore it on their health servers and\n\n1028\n00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,680\nyour medical records, you can store\nall of this stuff in Google Health.\n\n1029\n00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,690\nWell there's a huge risk with that,\nthat the FDA may shut it down,\n\n1030\n00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,270\nthat people might just not like it, that\nthe data inside of it could get hacked.\n\n1031\n00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,590\nAnd now your medical information gets out.\n\n1032\n00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:46,680\nThere's a lot of risk.\n\n1033\n00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,990\nBut they evaluated it and they said you\nknow what it's worth it to take the risk\n\n1034\n00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,090\nand create this product\nthat's revolutionary.\n\n1035\n00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,200\nWe think our customers\nwill really appreciate it.\n\n1036\n00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,207\nNow, Google, that's a big company,\nand at the end of the day,\n\n1037\n00:51:57,207 --> 00:52:00,443\ncustomers didn't appreciate it and\nthe FDA didn't like it either,\n\n1038\n00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:03,705\nand it did get shut down, and so\nGoogle Health is basically dead now.\n\n1039\n00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:06,480\nIt's not very healthy,\nbut that happens, right?\n\n1040\n00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,240\nBut for every case that happens,\nthere's other cases where it's very,\n\n1041\n00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,270\nvery successful.\n\n1042\n00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:13,450\nWhere are company takes a new service and\nsays, we're going to try and\n\n1043\n00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:14,690\noffer this, and\n\n1044\n00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:19,640\nit becomes a big deal and may even become\nthe focal point of that company, right.\n\n1045\n00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,685\nLook at Apple with their iPhone, they\nweren't a phone company prior to that.\n\n1046\n00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:27,745\nBut they said, here's a new service we\nthink that our users would appreciate,\n\n1047\n00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:31,245\nhaving a phone that's easier to use,\nand they jumped into it.\n\n1048\n00:52:31,245 --> 00:52:31,835\nThere was risks.\n\n1049\n00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:33,775\nThey were getting into\nthe telecommunications industry,\n\n1050\n00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,885\nthe FCC was getting involved and\nall that, but\n\n1051\n00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:38,930\nthey went that route and\nit turned out to be very successful.\n\n1052\n00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,250\nSo it's nice to be able to\npredict that ahead of time and\n\n1053\n00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,520\nrisk management can do it.\n\n1054\n00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,470\nThe larger your organization is the more\nlikely you'll have a risk manager\n\n1055\n00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,170\non staff, especially with IT.\n\n1056\n00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,510\nBecause in IT when we deploy equipment,\nthere is an equipment cost.\n\n1057\n00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:56,750\nSo no matter what happens, successful or\nfailure we've got to pay for\n\n1058\n00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,290\nthat equipment, right?\n\n1059\n00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:02,290\nVersus other departments\nthat might have a concept,\n\n1060\n00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,030\na change in procedure\nthey might implement.\n\n1061\n00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,150\nAnd if it doesn't work out,\nthey just change back to the other one.\n\n1062\n00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,420\nAnd so it's not like they have\na bunch of equipment laying around.\n\n1063\n00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,450\nIn IT we do.\n\n1064\n00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,780\nSo risk managers are pretty\ncommon to help with that.\n\n1065\n00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,300\nThese are all things that are involved in\nselecting that new service to move forward\n\n1066\n00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,980\nwith, even before we actually spend out\nfirst dollar implementing the service.\n\n1067\n00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,980\nSo all part of portfolio management.\n\n1068\n00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,750\nAnd beyond that we've got our other ones.\n\n1069\n00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,050\nIf we decide that we're going\nto move forward with one,\n\n1070\n00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,030\nthen we actually move forward with it,\nright?\n\n1071\n00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,380\nAnd we'll see more of\nthat in service design.\n\n1072\n00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,260\nIn that section of the show that's where\nwe're going to dive into that kind of\n\n1073\n00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,440\ncreation process.\n\n1074\n00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,990\nBut for our portfolio management, this is\nwhere we're approving that service to move\n\n1075\n00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:46,340\nforward, transitioning it into the design\nstage, and letting the development go.\n\n1076\n00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,760\nAnd we're just keeping track of that.\n\n1077\n00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,540\nPart of portfolio management\nis simply managing metrics.\n\n1078\n00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,460\nBy keeping track of how much money has\nbeen spent, how much progress is going on.\n\n1079\n00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:00,560\nAnd even once a service is active and\ndeployed, we still track it.\n\n1080\n00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,966\nIt's all part of governance, making sure\nthat service is running as expected.\n\n1081\n00:54:03,966 --> 00:54:05,812\nThat's delivering the way\nwe anticipated it.\n\n1082\n00:54:05,812 --> 00:54:11,620\nAnd if it isn't,\ntaking some kind of corrective action.\n\n1083\n00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,400\nSo those are some examples of\nthings we do with new projects.\n\n1084\n00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,090\nFor the existing ones, we're going to\nmaintain what's called a service catalog.\n\n1085\n00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:25,010\nA service catalog, it might be\na database stored in software or\n\n1086\n00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:29,080\nit might just be a piece of paper where\nyou list all of the different services\n\n1087\n00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,560\nthat your company offers and\nyou just keep track of that, right.\n\n1088\n00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,670\nThat can be really hard for\nsome companies.\n\n1089\n00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:38,420\nFor us it's easy, ITProTV,\nwe have one service.\n\n1090\n00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,310\nYou can come to our website and you can\nbasically rent access to our video,\n\n1091\n00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,470\nit's very, very simple.\n\n1092\n00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,320\nWe don't have any other service.\n\n1093\n00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,910\nBut if you take a company like Symantec.\n\n1094\n00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,600\nSymantec has so many services\nthat it's hard to keep track of.\n\n1095\n00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,220\nIBM has so\nmany services you don't even know of.\n\n1096\n00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,420\nYou go to their web pages,\nlike if you go to Symantec's web page,\n\n1097\n00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,530\nI can name 15 different\nproducts that Symantec sells.\n\n1098\n00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,940\nBut if you go to their home page,\nthey don't list their products.\n\n1099\n00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,930\nThey have a little menu\nthat says solutions.\n\n1100\n00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,290\nWhat are you trying to achieve?\n\n1101\n00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,740\nAnd then we'll guide you to the group\nof products we sell that might help\n\n1102\n00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,550\nyou achieve that.\n\n1103\n00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,030\nIt's so confusing.\n\n1104\n00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,148\nSo, the more and\nmore services your company offers,\n\n1105\n00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:15,524\nthe more difficult this becomes.\n\n1106\n00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:18,598\nSo you got to have a catalog to\nkeep track of what you offer and\n\n1107\n00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:20,965\nmake sure that it's all aligned.\n\n1108\n00:55:20,965 --> 00:55:23,325\nAnd that where companies like\nSymantec are have to restructure.\n\n1109\n00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,487\nHP is restructuring right now.\n\n1110\n00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,515\nThey're dividing into two companies\nbecause they were out of alignment.\n\n1111\n00:55:27,515 --> 00:55:29,665\nAnd they were so\nfar out of alignment they said,\n\n1112\n00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:32,085\nyou know what,\nwe just can't bring this back in line.\n\n1113\n00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:33,645\nWe'll split into two companies.\n\n1114\n00:55:33,645 --> 00:55:38,080\nImagine what a nightmare that must be,\nit's definitely gonna be a mess.\n\n1115\n00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,480\nSo normally, when you see a company\ntaking those kind of steps,\n\n1116\n00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,940\nit means that they've made it to the point\n\n1117\n00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,970\nwhere they're ready to just sell off\nthe parts that aren't in alignment.\n\n1118\n00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,000\nAnd that's a good thing, right?\n\n1119\n00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,220\nThey're doing portfolio management.\n\n1120\n00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,150\nThey just didn't do it early enough\nto stop it from happening but\n\n1121\n00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,580\nnow they're using it to correct,\nthey're saying, we got all these services.\n\n1122\n00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,050\nIf it's not in line with what we\nwant to do, let's branch it off.\n\n1123\n00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,840\nIBM, where they sold their laptop\ndivision and desktop division to Lenovo,\n\n1124\n00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,180\nand now they've sold their\nserver division to Lenovo.\n\n1125\n00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,460\nThey're saying hardware manufacturing\nis not in line with what we want now.\n\n1126\n00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,210\nIt's in line with what we wanted\nten years ago, but not today.\n\n1127\n00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:12,381\nSo let's sell that off to somebody else,\nand we'll focus in on what we want to do.\n\n1128\n00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:15,725\nSo your existing services\nmay transition to retired\n\n1129\n00:56:15,725 --> 00:56:18,313\nservices if you decide to sell them off.\n\n1130\n00:56:18,313 --> 00:56:19,512\nOr you maintain them.\n\n1131\n00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:22,330\nThat's part of maintaining our portfolio.\n\n1132\n00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,160\nAll right, so that whole process\nis called a service life cycle.\n\n1133\n00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,230\nWhen we select a service, we design it,\nwe employ it into our environment,\n\n1134\n00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,410\nwe integrate it.\n\n1135\n00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:37,890\nAnd then we maintain it,\nwe do the operations and run it.\n\n1136\n00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,880\nAnd then, eventually, retire it, right?\n\n1137\n00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,490\nThat's all part of the life cycle.\n\n1138\n00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:45,860\nAnd, portfolio management\ntracks every piece of that.\n\n1139\n00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,360\nAll right,\nwhat have I left out here, Ronnie?\n\n1140\n00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,600\nI know there's some more stuff.\n\n1141\n00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,300\n>> Well, we've already talked about\nwhat we're currently offering, and\n\n1142\n00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,155\nthen also how we might end up\nchoosing to retire a service?\n\n1143\n00:56:55,155 --> 00:56:56,805\nBut, what about bringing on a new service?\n\n1144\n00:56:56,805 --> 00:56:58,795\nThat's where we're actually\nheaded at this point,\n\n1145\n00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:03,365\nis to take a look is evaluating\na potential new service, and whether or\n\n1146\n00:57:03,365 --> 00:57:06,300\nnot we want to bring that\ninto our portfolio as well.\n\n1147\n00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,900\nSo, when we talk about what service we\nwanna bring, we always want to define it\n\n1148\n00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,150\nin terms of utility and possibly,\neven the idea of warranty.\n\n1149\n00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,120\n>> And these two, everybody thinks about\nthem when you offer a new service.\n\n1150\n00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,120\nBut, you can actually apply\nthese to your existing services,\n\n1151\n00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,720\ntoo because things in\nthe environment might change.\n\n1152\n00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,490\nWhile it did provide utility and\n\n1153\n00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,920\nwarranty in the beginning,\ndown the road it doesn't.\n\n1154\n00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,900\nSo, let's break apart these ideas\nto understand what they are.\n\n1155\n00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,140\nThat first one, utility, right?\n\n1156\n00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,310\nI usually describe that really simply is,\n\n1157\n00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,105\ndoes this service contribute\nto the costumer's need, right?\n\n1158\n00:57:42,105 --> 00:57:44,365\nIs this providing what\nthe customer's asking for?\n\n1159\n00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:45,985\nIt may or may not.\n\n1160\n00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:51,135\nAnd the term you'll hear associated with\nthis more commonly is, fit for purpose.\n\n1161\n00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:55,165\nThe service I'm providing, is it fit for\nwhat the customer's purpose is.\n\n1162\n00:57:55,165 --> 00:57:56,075\nWhat they want.\n\n1163\n00:57:56,075 --> 00:57:58,885\nSo, if I have a customer that\ncomes to me and says, Don.\n\n1164\n00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:04,210\nI really need a series of videos,\nsome kind of online training.\n\n1165\n00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:06,340\nThat'll teach me how to use Lotus 123.\n\n1166\n00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,350\nAnd I say, well, shoot, Lotus 123,\nthat's really old spreadsheet software.\n\n1167\n00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:15,460\nAnd I don't think we're gonna do a video,\nbut we have some Excel videos and\n\n1168\n00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,780\na spreadsheet's a spreadsheet.\n\n1169\n00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,170\nSo, maybe I'll just send them\nover to the Excel videos instead.\n\n1170\n00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,490\nWell, a spreadsheet's a spreadsheet.\n\n1171\n00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,640\nBut, on the utility side, am I providing\nsomething that meets their purpose?\n\n1172\n00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,918\nAnd in that case, I'm not.\n\n1173\n00:58:28,918 --> 00:58:31,580\nThat Lotus 123 has different\ncommand structures,\n\n1174\n00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,730\ndifferent functions than what Excel does.\n\n1175\n00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,000\nAnd so, what they learn from\nmy video won't match up with\n\n1176\n00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,100\nwhat they actually wanted.\n\n1177\n00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:43,830\nIt's not fit for purpose, so that goes\nback to respecting your customer's needs.\n\n1178\n00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:48,560\nWhat your customer wants,\nwe gotta make sure we live up to that.\n\n1179\n00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,840\nAnd then warranty.\n\n1180\n00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,160\nSo warranty says,\nonce we give them the service.\n\n1181\n00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,990\nDoes it actually perform as planned?\n\n1182\n00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,510\nDoes it deliver on what we promised?\n\n1183\n00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,520\nAnd they call this fitness for use.\n\n1184\n00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,500\nAre they actually able to use it?\n\n1185\n00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,380\nSo for example, I used to have\na really good example on this,\n\n1186\n00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,200\nbut let's say that somebody asks for\na hammer.\n\n1187\n00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,600\nThat they need a hammer.\n\n1188\n00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,500\nSo, we decide to offer a new service,\n\n1189\n00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,150\nwe're gonna manufacture hammers and\nsell them.\n\n1190\n00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,000\nAll right.\nSo, we're gonna meet this customers need,\n\n1191\n00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,550\nby providing them with a hammer.\n\n1192\n00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:24,365\nAnd so, as we start to do our design\nwe go to our engineers and we say,\n\n1193\n00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:28,515\nlook guys we need to increase our\nprofit margin as much as possible.\n\n1194\n00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:32,775\nSo, I want you to use the cheapest\ncomponents absolutely possible,\n\n1195\n00:59:32,775 --> 00:59:34,740\njust the bare minimum.\n\n1196\n00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,780\nBecause they asked for\na hammer that could drive in a nail.\n\n1197\n00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,680\nLet's be specific.\n\n1198\n00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,580\nWe're gonna drive in a nail just one.\n\n1199\n00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:47,510\nGive us the strength in that hammer,\nto drive in just one nail.\n\n1200\n00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,990\nWe don't care beyond that right?\n\n1201\n00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,200\nIf you can pound in one nail\nthat's a successful hammer.\n\n1202\n00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,410\nSo we design it, and\nwe give it to the customer.\n\n1203\n00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:56,010\nNow technically, the utility is there.\n\n1204\n00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,120\nDoes it perform?\n\n1205\n00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:57,640\nYes.\n\n1206\n00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,970\nI can use this hammer to bang in one nail.\n\n1207\n00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:04,860\nBut, when I set that second nail up and\nI go to bang it in, the hammer breaks.\n\n1208\n01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,090\nIt was only good for\none nail and that's it.\n\n1209\n01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:12,320\nNow the customer has an expectation, that\nthey need a hammer that can bang in nails,\n\n1210\n01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,270\nand they need to be able to bang\nin more than just one nail,\n\n1211\n01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:17,000\nand if it breaks before that.\n\n1212\n01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,380\nYes it had the utility,\nthat matched what they asked for, but.\n\n1213\n01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,730\nIt didn't, it wasn't fit for\n\n1214\n01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:26,980\ntheir use what they wanted to use it for,\ndriving in repeated nails.\n\n1215\n01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:32,300\nSo, that's a symptom of projects that\ndon't have detailed requirement lists.\n\n1216\n01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,903\nSo, a customer won't specify that they\nwon't say, I need you to make me a hammer,\n\n1217\n01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:39,130\nand it needs to be able to\ndrive in at least 2000 nails.\n\n1218\n01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:41,540\nAnd that needs to be our\nmean time between failure,\n\n1219\n01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,580\nthat we can do two thousand nails before\nsomething goes wrong with the hammer.\n\n1220\n01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,100\nAnd now we design it,\npeople don't think that way.\n\n1221\n01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,450\nThey say I need a hammer.\n\n1222\n01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:50,710\nIt's kind of built in that assumption\nthat it's gonna work for a long time.\n\n1223\n01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:52,700\nIt's a hammer,\nthere's no moving parts, right?\n\n1224\n01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,240\nSo that's a problem, and as we define\nour services we can skip all we want.\n\n1225\n01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,830\nBut, what's that gonna do to\nthe value of the customer?\n\n1226\n01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:01,080\nAnd what's that gonna do long term,\n\n1227\n01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,590\nin terms of the value of\nthe services that we offer?\n\n1228\n01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:03,160\nIt's going to hurt it.\n\n1229\n01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,300\nIt's not gonna be very effective.\n\n1230\n01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,910\nSo, utility and warranty.\n\n1231\n01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,370\nThose are two pieces\nthat factor into this.\n\n1232\n01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,320\nWhen we're picking a service to offer,\n\n1233\n01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,710\nwe may not have enough information to\ndo utility and warranty at that point.\n\n1234\n01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,970\nBut in the design phase,\nwe definitely will.\n\n1235\n01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,530\nSo, when we're designing that service\nto offer, we need to focus on that.\n\n1236\n01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:26,240\nAnd then when we actually\noffer the service,\n\n1237\n01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,130\nwe know we've lived up to the utility and\nwarranty that we designed.\n\n1238\n01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,300\nAnd we've even backed that with\nan express warranty, right?\n\n1239\n01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,390\nOne that we've written on paper that says,\nwe will warrant this,\n\n1240\n01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,450\nif it breaks within 2000 hits of a nail,\nthen send it back and we'll replace it.\n\n1241\n01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:43,200\nWe back up our warranties, but\nwe need to keep monitoring beyond that.\n\n1242\n01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,390\nBecause maybe three years from now,\n\n1243\n01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,690\nsomething happens in the construction\nindustry, and they say what?\n\n1244\n01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,120\nWe're gonna go to all galvanized nails.\n\n1245\n01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,500\nI'm making this up Ronnie.\n\n1246\n01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,130\nI don't actually know if nails\nare galvanized or not, but so\n\n1247\n01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,265\nmaybe we've got all galvanized nails, and\nall of a sudden our hammer that could do\n\n1248\n01:01:59,265 --> 01:02:03,390\n2,000 nails before, now can only do\n1,000 because the nails are harder.\n\n1249\n01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,920\nAnd so I need to keep an eye on that, and\n\n1250\n01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,010\nsay well the construction industry\nhas changed, now I need to change.\n\n1251\n01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,360\nMy service needs to change\nto match up with that,\n\n1252\n01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,000\nto maintain the level of utility and\nwork that we used to have.\n\n1253\n01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,440\nThat happens all the time, and we're\nseeing that with like gas mileage in cars,\n\n1254\n01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,943\nwhere the EPA here in the US is\nforcing certain miles per gallon to\n\n1255\n01:02:21,943 --> 01:02:25,480\nimprove car efficiency.\n\n1256\n01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,860\nSo, your car might have met all\nthe standards before, and now it doesn't.\n\n1257\n01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,790\nSo we've gotta reevaluate,\nthat's all part of portfolio management.\n\n1258\n01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,850\nAnd this is another area that's really\nbeing handled at the top by management.\n\n1259\n01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,900\nThis is what they do,\nit's how they make their money?\n\n1260\n01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,760\nAnd as the hands on person, the doer,\nyou're just operating within this\n\n1261\n01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,150\nrealm as you keep the services running and\nmoving along, all right?\n\n1262\n01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:49,960\nSo, that is basically\nportfolio management.\n\n1263\n01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,090\nIt's really important, right?\n\n1264\n01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,130\nI mean, this is really one of\nthe main aspects of management inside\n\n1265\n01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:54,679\nof an organization.\n\n1266\n01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,520\nWe've got a few more processes to cover.\n\n1267\n01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,838\nThis is actually a pretty good\nspot to wrap up the show though.\n\n1268\n01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:03,480\nSo, we're gonna stop and\n\n1269\n01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,940\nwe'll pick up with another show where we\njump into the remaining three processes in\n\n1270\n01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:12,000\nthis one, we don't wanna\noverload our minds all at once.\n\n1271\n01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,450\nSo, let's stop here.\n\n1272\n01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:15,600\nJust to kinda recap what we've hit, right?\n\n1273\n01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,710\nSo, we started talking about service\nmanagement as a whole, right?\n\n1274\n01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:24,250\nSo, that was our very beginning,\njust our Service Strategy.\n\n1275\n01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:26,810\nThen, we took a look at that\nstrategy management for IT,\n\n1276\n01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:32,170\nso as we begin to offer these things, how\nwe set up our strategy, our overall goal?\n\n1277\n01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,790\nAnd then, we started diving\ninto our portfolio management.\n\n1278\n01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,160\nSo, how we kind of get all of\nthese services coordinated, and\n\n1279\n01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,190\nobserved to make sure they're moving\nalong in the right direction.\n\n1280\n01:03:41,202 --> 01:03:43,930\nAll right, but the remaining ones we've\nstill got are still sitting out there.\n\n1281\n01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,980\nWe've got financial management,\nand some of those other guys.\n\n1282\n01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,650\nDemand management, and\nbusiness relationship management.\n\n1283\n01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,620\nSo, we'll tackle those\nin the next episode.\n\n1284\n01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,400\nBe sure to stay tuned for that.\n\n1285\n01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,820\nIn the meantime, if you have questions\non anything, feel free to ask.\n\n1286\n01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,290\nLive during the show you\ncan go to

ITProTV,\n\n11\n00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,371\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:42,120\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n13\n00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,850\n>> It is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,310\nNo one took down my Dark Web site.\n\n15\n00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,096\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm joking,\n\n16\n00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:46,113\nI don't have a Dark Web site.\n\n17\n00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,856\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Well, now you will.\n\n18\n00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,704\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right ladies, and\n\n19\n00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:50,380\ngentleman.\n\n20\n00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,180\nWell, we are gonna be\njumping right back into ITIL.\n\n21\n00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,580\nAnd if you've been following\nalong in all our shows,\n\n22\n00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,112\nwe got about halfway through\nthe service strategy.\n\n23\n00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:00,522\n>> Strategy.\n>> [CROSSTALK] I can't get my mind in\n\n24\n00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:01,322\nthe right place here.\n\n25\n00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,760\nThe service strategy processes\nin our last episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,820\nWe're picking right back up with that.\n\n27\n00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,300\nAnd moving through the final three\nprocesses in service strategies.\n\n28\n00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,490\nSo, our very next process is financial\nmanagement, for IT services.\n\n29\n00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,780\nNow, that last little bit is important.\n\n30\n00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,080\nThere is financial management for\nyour company as a whole.\n\n31\n00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,120\nITIL does not address that.\n\n32\n00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,280\nRemember it's the information\ntechnology industry library.\n\n33\n00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,950\nIt's IT, not your company.\n\n34\n00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,110\nSo, every company does finances different.\n\n35\n00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,770\nOften times,\nthey don't even have control over it.\n\n36\n00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,850\nThe government steps in with regulations,\nand other things that they have to follow.\n\n37\n00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,110\nBut inside of IT, there's various\nrecommended practices we can follow.\n\n38\n00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,430\nAnd they almost all center around\nthe fact, that IT departments rarely,\n\n39\n00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,090\nmake any money.\n\n40\n00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,900\nMost of the time an IT department\nis what's called a cost center.\n\n41\n00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300\nWe generate cost.\n\n42\n00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,250\nWe would cost money to operate,\nwe swallow money.\n\n43\n00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,880\nBut we don't actually generate a product\nthat we then turn around, and sell.\n\n44\n00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,980\nSo, most of the time we're\nproviding supporting services,\n\n45\n00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,680\nenhancing services, that aren't\nthe true service the customer buys.\n\n46\n00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,860\nAnd I know I've given examples of that in\nother shows, but just to kind of recap it.\n\n47\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,430\nIf our customers want to get\na email invoice every month.\n\n48\n00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,980\nSo, they can invoice of what\nthey spent with us, and\n\n49\n00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,950\nthen they use that to pay the bill.\n\n50\n00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,700\nWell, the service they're getting from us,\nmaybe we're a cellphone company.\n\n51\n00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,930\nSo, they get the cell phone service.\n\n52\n00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,150\nAnd they get the bill, and they pay\nthe bill, so that causes money to come in.\n\n53\n00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,120\nBut it's the cell phone\nservice they're paying for,\n\n54\n00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,730\nnot the fact that we sent them the bill.\n\n55\n00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,410\nSo, the IT department is not\ndirectly generating that revenue,\n\n56\n00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,840\nwe're just generating a part of it,\na service that supports that happening.\n\n57\n00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,410\nIf we didn't send the bill,\nwould the customer pay it?\n\n58\n00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,030\nProbably not.\n\n59\n00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,655\nThey need to get a bill to know,\nto pay, so it's essential.\n\n60\n00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,000\nNo, don't ever think\nthat it's not essential,\n\n61\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,020\nit's just not directly generating revenue.\n\n62\n00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,480\nAs we manage our finances inside of\nIT we need to keep that in mind, and\n\n63\n00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,140\nwe need to be very\ntransparent about our costs.\n\n64\n00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,060\nBecause here's what happens if your not.\n\n65\n00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,570\nYour company has a strategy.\n\n66\n00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,530\nThey have a goal,\nthey're trying to achieve.\n\n67\n00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,510\nAnd everything we do in IT needs to\nbe in alignment with that strategy.\n\n68\n00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,720\nWell, if they don't give us enough\nfunding to achieve the goal.\n\n69\n00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,560\nSo, we need money to achieve the goal,\nto work in the strategy.\n\n70\n00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,490\nAnd if they don't give us\nenough funding to do it,\n\n71\n00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490\nwe can't work within the strategy.\n\n72\n00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,090\nAnd if that happens,\nas an IT department, we're failing.\n\n73\n00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,140\nAnd they'll look at that, and they'll\nview it as bad performance on our part.\n\n74\n00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,280\nAnd we'll get blamed.\n\n75\n00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,390\nBut the actual cause of\nthe problem was not that we didn't\n\n76\n00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,090\nchoose to operate within the strategy.\n\n77\n00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,840\nWe just couldn't,\nwe didn't have the funding.\n\n78\n00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,970\nAnd so, if we're tracking our expenses.\n\n79\n00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,170\nHow our funds are being distributed.\n\n80\n00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,140\nWe can report that back, and\nwe can say hey guys we are not gonna\n\n81\n00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,200\nbe able to meet the strategy,\ncuz we don't have enough money.\n\n82\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,730\nAnd when that happens, there's really\njust two actions that you can take.\n\n83\n00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,410\nAction number one,\n\n84\n00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,110\nis to increase the funding,\nthat's not what we want to happen.\n\n85\n00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,870\nBut option number two,\nis we can re-evaluate our strategy.\n\n86\n00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,100\nAnd we can say, hey, we've got this\nstrategy's goal, and it's great,\n\n87\n00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,330\nwe'd love to hit it.\n\n88\n00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,390\nBut, we just can't afford it.\n\n89\n00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,640\nWe can't afford to offer, what we want.\n\n90\n00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,470\nAnd so, we've got to re-evaluate\nour strategy, and reduce it.\n\n91\n00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,400\nSo that, we can operate with\nthe money that we have.\n\n92\n00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,395\nA lot of people have great visions.\n\n93\n00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:23,351\nI would love for ITProTV to be free.\n\n94\n00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,100\nI would love for you guys to be\nable to watch our stuff, and\n\n95\n00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,197\nnot have to pay a dime.\n\n96\n00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,428\nI think that would be awesome.\n\n97\n00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:32,446\nI think that we would have hundreds of\nthousands of users, and tons of activity,\n\n98\n00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:33,875\nand it would be really cool.\n\n99\n00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,980\nBut you can't keep the lights on for free.\n\n100\n00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,360\nSo, you've got to have some way\nto generate the revenue, and\n\n101\n00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,060\nso your model changes,\nyour strategy changes.\n\n102\n00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,918\nAnd you end up with a company that\nis viable versus the one that you\n\n103\n00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,072\nactually wanted.\n\n104\n00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:50,312\nAnd that's part of what\nstrategy comes down to.\n\n105\n00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,808\nBut with IT, it's just really\nimportant to keep track of that,\n\n106\n00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:57,110\ncuz if we're not keeping track\nof where our funds are going,\n\n107\n00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,476\nthen we may not be getting enough funding.\n\n108\n00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,481\nAnd we're not meeting the strategy, but\n\n109\n00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,267\nall the company is able to see is that we\ndidn't stay in line with the strategy.\n\n110\n00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,680\nWe're doing something wrong.\n\n111\n00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920\nSo, that's why it is so important.\n\n112\n00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,865\nAnd that's why we have financial\nmanagement, just for IT services.\n\n113\n00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:12,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n114\n00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,550\nA lot of times the financial management\npart really does help us to make sure,\n\n115\n00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,740\nthat when we design something,\nwhen we develop it, and\n\n116\n00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,680\nwe deliver it, that we do have the money\nthat we need to be able to do so.\n\n117\n00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,270\nIf we don't,\nwe have to figure out how to procure it.\n\n118\n00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,060\nWe may also in the financial\nmanagement part,\n\n119\n00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,530\ntake a look at what we can do effectively,\nand well.\n\n120\n00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,150\nAnd then what we can't do effectively,\nand well either.\n\n121\n00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,820\nSo, we may take on something a little\nbit too big for what we need,\n\n122\n00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,660\nand well, wait a minute, that's too much.\n\n123\n00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,700\nSo, knowing what we can do, and\nwhat we can't do is an important part.\n\n124\n00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,590\nAs well as knowing, what the value\nthat we want to present is worth.\n\n125\n00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,130\nSometimes we go well,\nI wanna present this, and this.\n\n126\n00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,420\nBut I wanna charge this for it.\n\n127\n00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,120\nJust like what Don said,\nwe want this to be free, but\n\n128\n00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,210\nright now we can't keep our eyes on it,\nif it is.\n\n129\n00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,610\nSo, it may not be able to be something.\n\n130\n00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,315\nAnd these are all part of somebody that\nactually is able to come into your\n\n131\n00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:08,772\ncompany, or a part of your team,\nthat can manage those finances,\n\n132\n00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,968\nto help put that into clear perspective.\n\n133\n00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:14,150\nIt also helps us to meet a lot of\nthose business needs that we have.\n\n134\n00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,102\n>> Yeah.\nAnd if you've done any project management,\n\n135\n00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:19,349\nin project management you have a scope.\n\n136\n00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,643\nAnd part of what defines that are these\nthree, they call them the project\n\n137\n00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:25,676\nconstraints, and they really\napply to even non-project stuff.\n\n138\n00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:32,932\nYou have schedule, budget, and resources.\n\n139\n00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:36,148\nI'm sorry, is requirements there?\n\n140\n00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,582\n>> No.\n>> So here, it will be a little different.\n\n141\n00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:41,902\nBut basically, when you want to make\none of those three things better,\n\n142\n00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,703\nthe other two have to suffer.\n\n143\n00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,305\nThey are all inter-related.\n\n144\n00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,411\nAnd so, when we do our\nfinancial management for IT,\n\n145\n00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,888\nwe are tracking three different things.\n\n146\n00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:54,563\nWe're tracking our money, so\nwhere the dollars are going?\n\n147\n00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:59,045\nWe're tracking our time, how long things\ntake, and time often reflects money.\n\n148\n00:06:59,045 --> 00:06:59,985\nTime is money.\n\n149\n00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:03,220\nIf you have an hourly employee,\nthat's absolutely true.\n\n150\n00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,990\nAnd then lastly, we have our resources.\n\n151\n00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,210\nAnd the resources are typically people.\n\n152\n00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,010\nBut they don't have to be.\n\n153\n00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,220\nThey could be other things like equipment,\nor facilities, or whatever.\n\n154\n00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,030\nBut it's typically people.\n\n155\n00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,860\nSo, we're tracking how those things are\nbeing used, within the realm of finance.\n\n156\n00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,530\nAnd it's all because we need to make sure\nthat the time we spent providing services,\n\n157\n00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,180\nthe money we spent on those services,\nand the people we have working on those\n\n158\n00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,990\nservices, are all doing things that are in\nline with our overall company strategy.\n\n159\n00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,860\nSo, the way we see that\nin actual practice,\n\n160\n00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,940\nto put it in accounting terms,\nwe see budgeting.\n\n161\n00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,840\nBudgeting, that's controlling\nwho gets money when.\n\n162\n00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,330\nI might have a million dollars sitting\nin my bank reserves, for the year.\n\n163\n00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,290\nSo, I've got a million dollar budget.\n\n164\n00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,310\nWhen do I take money out of that?\n\n165\n00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,310\nI need to take money out to\nsupport services that build to\n\n166\n00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,420\nthe companies strategy.\n\n167\n00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,355\nI don't need to take money out, for things\nthat don't align with that strategy.\n\n168\n00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:03,000\nSo, budgeting is just being a traffic cop,\ncontrolling the flow of money.\n\n169\n00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,273\nIt's normally coupled with accounting\nWe're just keeping track of that, right?\n\n170\n00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:09,903\nSo once the money goes out, it gets spent,\nwe get our receipt back and\n\n171\n00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:14,640\nthe other information so we tally what\nhappens after the money was spent.\n\n172\n00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,140\n>> Accounting is an important part of this\nprocess because it gives us the ability to\n\n173\n00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,910\nforecast into the future\nabout what we might need for\n\n174\n00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,190\nthe next development that comes along.\n\n175\n00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,540\nIf we don't have that accounting part,\nwe may go oh just set aside this and\n\n176\n00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,590\nthey're like but there's no justification.\n\n177\n00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,250\nSo accounting is a very important part\nof the project along with the budgeting.\n\n178\n00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,690\nWhich leads us to the last part,\nwhich is the charging.\n\n179\n00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,915\n.\n>> And charging is where things get\n\n180\n00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:38,990\ntricky, right.\n\n181\n00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,140\nIf you're an IT company.\n\n182\n00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,380\nIf your company's service is\nsomething that's IT related,\n\n183\n00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,680\nthen when we talk about charging,\nwe're talking about billing the customer.\n\n184\n00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,300\nSo if you work for Facebook, right?\n\n185\n00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,560\nThey provide a website,\nthat's their service.\n\n186\n00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,860\nTheir IT department runs that website and\nyou can throw ads on it.\n\n187\n00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,700\nAnd if you want those ads,\nthe IT department will take those ads and\n\n188\n00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,710\nhost them and send you a bill for\nthe clicks or whatever that you got.\n\n189\n00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,620\nSo in that case you're\ncharging an external customer,\n\n190\n00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,920\nit makes absolute sense.\n\n191\n00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,870\nBut, if you're going way back to\nthe beginning of the last show,\n\n192\n00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,560\nwe were talking about the type one,\ntype two, and type three customers.\n\n193\n00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,100\nIf it's a type one or type two situation,\nthose are internal customers.\n\n194\n00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,130\nType one being one business unit,\n\n195\n00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,540\ntype two being multiple business units\nthat we're basically selling to.\n\n196\n00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,960\nAnd in those cases we don't necessarily\nsend them a bill saying well,\n\n197\n00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,100\nhere's how much time we spent and here's\nhow much that service cost and so on.\n\n198\n00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,250\nInstead we keep track of how much of our\nbudget was used to achieve that goal,\n\n199\n00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,030\nso that at the end of the year when\nwe're planning next years budget and\n\n200\n00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,060\nwe say, all right we need\na million dollars for 2015,\n\n201\n00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,080\nour budgets going to be a million\ndollars across the year, all right?\n\n202\n00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,850\nWhere does that come from?\n\n203\n00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,900\nWhere does that money come from?\n\n204\n00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,470\nIt's not coming from the customer it's\ncoming from the other business units.\n\n205\n00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,100\nSo in the marketing department,\nif they accounted for,\n\n206\n00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,290\nlet's say 200,000 of our expenses, right?\n\n207\n00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,440\nSo if marketing accounted for\n\n208\n00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,570\nthat percentage of our expenses, then\nin their budget, they put that flag in\n\n209\n00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,280\nthere that says this amount of money goes\nto IT to cover the services that we use.\n\n210\n00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,530\nSo it's making sure that it\ndoesn't create the impression\n\n211\n00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,690\nthat IT is spending all of this money.\n\n212\n00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,340\nAll of our money should be in alignment\n\n213\n00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,930\nwith services that are being provided\nto facilitate our overall strategy,\n\n214\n00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,520\nother business units and so\nit should be all able to be matched up.\n\n215\n00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,800\nSo at the end of the year when they say,\n\n216\n00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,100\nman the IT department spent a million\ndollars, we should cut back on that.\n\n217\n00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,970\nRight?\n\n218\n00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,130\nIT doesn't make us any money,\nlet's cut it back.\n\n219\n00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,830\nBut then they look at it and they say well\nthis portion actually goes to marketing,\n\n220\n00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,510\nand this portion comes from accounting,\nthis portion comes from sales.\n\n221\n00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,510\nSo if we cut those back,\nwe're actually cutting back on marketing,\n\n222\n00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,270\nwe're actually cutting back on sales,\nnot cutting back on IT.\n\n223\n00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,190\nIT, they'd probably like it\nif they had less servers.\n\n224\n00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,850\n>> They'd probably like it if they\nhad less phones on the help desk so\n\n225\n00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,290\nthey didn't get so many calls or whatever,\njust kind of send them to voicemail.\n\n226\n00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,890\nSo, in those scenarios it's\nkind of counterproductive to\n\n227\n00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,760\ncut the IT budget when it's actually the\nother departments that's source of it, but\n\n228\n00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,760\nyou don't know that unless you track it.\n\n229\n00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,340\nAnd that's what financial management for\nI.T. services is all about.\n\n230\n00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,900\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n231\n00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,460\nI just kind of threw a few personal notes,\nI don't know that I mentioned this in\n\n232\n00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,700\nthis show, but we use these show notes\nto keep track of what to talk about.\n\n233\n00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,910\nAnd I'll post the show\nnotes with each episode.\n\n234\n00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,040\nSo they'll be posted beneath the video,\nyou'll get a chance to see them.\n\n235\n00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,570\nBut basically we just take our expenses,\nwe have a number attached to them, right.\n\n236\n00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,330\nAnd if it's something like we had to buy a\nserver, attaching a number is really easy.\n\n237\n00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,460\nBut if it's something like doing\nWindows updates on a server,\n\n238\n00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,960\nwe got to qualify that in the time\nit took the person to work on it.\n\n239\n00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,690\nSo we just have to assign a value, right,\nwe need to quantify, assign a cost.\n\n240\n00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,340\nTo everything that we do and\n\n241\n00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,160\nmap that to what part of\nthe business it occurred in, right?\n\n242\n00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,040\nAnd then that also needs\nthe map to one of our services,\n\n243\n00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,319\neverything should be supporting a service\nthat our company offers to the customer.\n\n244\n00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,690\nSo we identify those, and\nwe manage them, we control it.\n\n245\n00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,880\nBut then the key pieces is\nwe then communicate it.\n\n246\n00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,570\nWe send that information\nback up to the higher ups.\n\n247\n00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,010\nAnd so\nwhen they are planning the strategy.\n\n248\n00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,870\nThey can then plan for\n\n249\n00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,990\nthat over the next year and and\ndo the forecast and the runners.\n\n250\n00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,980\nSo this is all a part of\nour overall strategy.\n\n251\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,830\nThat's why it's in\nthe service strategy section.\n\n252\n00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,660\nAnd it's really just one piece of a bigger\nfinancial management policy that your\n\n253\n00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,490\nwhole company will have.\n\n254\n00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,610\nITIL doesn't address that.\n\n255\n00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,270\nSo you got this big financial policy.\n\n256\n00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,030\nThe IT financial management\nneeds to fall within that.\n\n257\n00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,920\nAnd a lot of times they're\ncompletely separate and\n\n258\n00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,660\nwe're just kind of keeping track of\nit as its own independent process.\n\n259\n00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,130\nBut the money is part of\nthat bigger strategy.\n\n260\n00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,085\nSo it may or may not be a part of the\noverall company's financial management.\n\n261\n00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:55,700\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,340\nThat's about it for financial management.\n\n263\n00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,070\nWe don't need to dive\ntoo much more into that.\n\n264\n00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,170\nThere is more that's available out there,\nbut\n\n265\n00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,690\nfor the ITIL foundations\nthat's all we need to know.\n\n266\n00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,350\nAll right, our next process\ngroup is demand management.\n\n267\n00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,890\nAnd this is the first topic that\nwe're going to cover that's not\n\n268\n00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,500\nreally on the exam.\n\n269\n00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,960\nIf you look at the ITIL foundation\noutline that they make, the syllabus.\n\n270\n00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,900\nThere's some entities\nto just skip over but\n\n271\n00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,920\nI find that it's good to understand\nwhat all's there just to be aware.\n\n272\n00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,980\nSo demand management is one of those,\nthis is a weird one.\n\n273\n00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:28,970\nBecause, and\n\n274\n00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,190\none of the main reasons I want to\ncover it is people confuse this a lot.\n\n275\n00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,100\nWhen we're talking about demand,\n\n276\n00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,930\nwe're really talking about like supply and\ndemand.\n\n277\n00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,840\nOkay?\n\n278\n00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,720\nIf your customer really wants a service\nfrom you, but you're too busy.\n\n279\n00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,700\nYou don't have the capabilities to\nhandle that, you can't meet the demand.\n\n280\n00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,220\nRight?\n\n281\n00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,920\nAnd so you've got customers who would\nfind value with your service, but\n\n282\n00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,280\nyou can't serve them.\n\n283\n00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,190\nAnd now they're not finding value and\nthey're just going to go and\n\n284\n00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,320\nfind somebody else.\n\n285\n00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,560\nSo, you're hurting your company.\n\n286\n00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,670\nDemand is something\nthat has to be managed.\n\n287\n00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,430\nBut when people hear about this,\nthey always mix it up.\n\n288\n00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,010\nIt's real easy to mix this up and\n\n289\n00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,560\nfuse it with a similar topic\nwhich is capacity management.\n\n290\n00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,870\nAnd they're two different things,\nall right?\n\n291\n00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,330\nLet's talk about\nthe difference real quick.\n\n292\n00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,760\nI don't know if I put this in my notes or\nnot.\n\n293\n00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,239\nBut it is important to\nunderstand from the beginning.\n\n294\n00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,270\nLet's use, what's big in IT lately,\nthe new iPhones.\n\n295\n00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,300\nSo depending on when you watch this show,\nthis might not be timely.\n\n296\n00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,640\nBut just last month, Apple launched\nnew iPhones, they do it every year.\n\n297\n00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,330\nAnd so they launched the iPhone 6 and 6+.\n\n298\n00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,130\nWell, you know people want those phones.\n\n299\n00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,440\nPeople really want that phone and\nthey'll have lines out their store doors\n\n300\n00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,490\nat 4 AM in the morning when the stores\nopen when they have a new phone available.\n\n301\n00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,380\n>> And people will be crying\n>> Yeah,\n\n302\n00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,410\nthey'll cry if they get it\n>> Yeah\n\n303\n00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,330\n>> Crying with happiness that people love\n\n304\n00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,870\ntheir phones\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,660\n>> I'm not that passionate but\n\n306\n00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,060\napparently a lot of people are.\n\n307\n00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,190\nSo Apple has to do demand\nmanagement to handle that.\n\n308\n00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,440\nNow, they could do capacity managing,\ncapacity just says hey we anticipate\n\n309\n00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,200\nselling two million phones\nin that first month, so\n\n310\n00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,730\nlet's ramp up our factories and let's get\ntwo million phones manufactured, right?\n\n311\n00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,370\nNow, if I have people that want 2 million\nphones, I've got 2 million phones.\n\n312\n00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,600\nI met the demand, and we're done, right?\n\n313\n00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400\nThat's capability management.\n\n314\n00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,370\nDo we have the capability of\nmeeting the demand as it is, okay?\n\n315\n00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,400\nThat's not what demand\nmanagement is all about.\n\n316\n00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,860\nCapability management is kind of separate.\n\n317\n00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,270\nAnd we don't really tackle that with ITIL.\n\n318\n00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,210\nInstead, what we say is,\nsometimes we can't meet the demand.\n\n319\n00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,980\nWe just can't do it, all right?\n\n320\n00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,920\nAnd, so we've got to find someway,\n\n321\n00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,020\nnot to change our capability\nbecause we can't do anything.\n\n322\n00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,410\nBut instead to change demand.\n\n323\n00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,030\nAll right.\n\n324\n00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,230\nAnd there's several ways to handle that.\n\n325\n00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,650\nAnd I've dealt with this personally.\n\n326\n00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,100\nSo I don't really do consulting anymore.\n\n327\n00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,010\nI used to do a lot of consulting.\n\n328\n00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,460\nI did teach classes and then sometimes\nI'd go out to companies privately and\n\n329\n00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,330\nhelp them out.\n\n330\n00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,440\nI still help two companies now.\n\n331\n00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,200\nBut I got to the point where\nI just didn't have time.\n\n332\n00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,512\nThere's not enough time in the day for\nme to be able to support that.\n\n333\n00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:09,310\nAnd I couldn't add more time in the day.\n\n334\n00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,886\nI've got a wife and two kids and\nI need to spend time with them.\n\n335\n00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,011\nI just couldn't do it.\n\n336\n00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:19,200\nSo what I did is I didn't just tell\npeople, hey, I'm not doing it anymore.\n\n337\n00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,700\nInstead, I increased my rate.\n\n338\n00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,250\nI said, all right, instead of charging x\namount of dollars, I'll just double it.\n\n339\n00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,200\nI'm gonna double that amount.\n\n340\n00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,860\nNow most people are going to hear that and\nsay, I really need help, but\n\n341\n00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,300\nI can't afford that.\n\n342\n00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,800\nAnd they'll go somewhere else,\nor if they say,\n\n343\n00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,430\nI really need help and\nI'm willing to pay that.\n\n344\n00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,480\nThen I'll look at it and say, well,\n\n345\n00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,200\nif you are willing to pay\nthat I'm willing to do it.\n\n346\n00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,920\nThere's a level that I'm willing to meet.\n\n347\n00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,790\nAnd that didn't adjust my capability.\n\n348\n00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,670\nI can't work any more or less.\n\n349\n00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,770\nI still can still work\nthe same amount of time, but\n\n350\n00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,670\nI get less demand because\nit's a higher rate.\n\n351\n00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,220\nAnd that's a technique that\na lot of companies use.\n\n352\n00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,700\nIt's demand management.\n\n353\n00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,750\nJust separate those ideas in your mind.\n\n354\n00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,928\nCapability, that comes down to logistics,\nright?\n\n355\n00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:07,800\nHow many factories you have,\nhow many employees you have,\n\n356\n00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,545\nall of that stuff, that's logistics and\nwe don't deal with that with ITIL.\n\n357\n00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:15,067\nBut, demand, that's something your\nmarketing team, your accounting team,\n\n358\n00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,204\nthese are all things that\npeople can influence.\n\n359\n00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,078\nIf there's not enough demand for\nyour product,\n\n360\n00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,298\nmaybe you've created something like,\nwell, like ITProTV, right?\n\n361\n00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,298\nIt's not like we have a tangible good,\nso we don't have an inventory to track,\n\n362\n00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,145\nwe have videos.\n\n363\n00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:33,078\nAnd we have enough bandwidth to\nsupport millions of customers all at\n\n364\n00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,570\nthe same time.\n\n365\n00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,741\nBut we don't have millions of customers,\nso we need to increase demand to make more\n\n366\n00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,680\ncustomers, to fill up that\navailable space that we have.\n\n367\n00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,315\nAnd then, hopefully,\n\n368\n00:17:42,315 --> 00:17:43,948\nhave the problem where we run\nout of space, need to add more.\n\n369\n00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:47,152\nSo, in that scenario,\nwe want demand to go up.\n\n370\n00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,171\nYou may want it to go up or down, but\n\n371\n00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:51,904\nthat's what demand\nmanagement Is all about.\n\n372\n00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,455\nNow the tools we use to do that,\nthere are several different ones.\n\n373\n00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,170\nBut one of the main things is we need to\ntake a look at our business patterns.\n\n374\n00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,620\nDemand is a fickle thing,\nit comes and goes.\n\n375\n00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,415\nIt might be seasonal.\n\n376\n00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,370\nRight?\nIf you look at the the US Postal Service,\n\n377\n00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,410\nor really any parcel service that's\nout there, the holiday seasons,\n\n378\n00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,230\nwhen it gets to be around Christmas time,\npeople ship a lot of packages.\n\n379\n00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,330\nSo they know that there\nwill be more demand for\n\n380\n00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,680\ntheir service during the holidays.\n\n381\n00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,380\nAll right?\n\n382\n00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,050\nAnd because they know\nthat they can predict it,\n\n383\n00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,310\nthen capability management\nbecomes practical, right?\n\n384\n00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,680\nThey can deal with that.\n\n385\n00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,990\nBut what if you're a website and\nyour site goes viral, right?\n\n386\n00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,860\nYour videos get out there and\npeople are really hitting it and\n\n387\n00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,040\nyour run out of bandwidth.\n\n388\n00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,080\nWell, you might not be in a position\nwhere you can increase capability.\n\n389\n00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,110\nAnd so that's where you have to\nstart kind of adjusting that demand,\n\n390\n00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,670\nmanaging it, making the video protected,\nmake people have to pay for it,\n\n391\n00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,610\nwhatever, and now you start\ncontrolling that access to get to it.\n\n392\n00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,180\nThis is all a tool of the trade,\nall right?\n\n393\n00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,050\nSo that business patterns, ITIL calls that\na PBA, a pattern of business activity.\n\n394\n00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,950\nAnd they're predictable, they're things\nthat we know that are going to happen.\n\n395\n00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,290\nBut keep in mind there's always\nsome things that are unpredictable.\n\n396\n00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,650\nSometimes stuff just happens randomly.\n\n397\n00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,560\nYou know, some celebrity on TV wears\nthe shoe that your company sells, and\n\n398\n00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,200\nall of a sudden demand for it skyrockets.\n\n399\n00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,640\nYou didn't know it was gonna happen,\nit happened incidentally.\n\n400\n00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,990\nAnd now you're the bigwig, right?\n\n401\n00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,890\nThere was a story I read\nyears ago about Mountain Dew,\n\n402\n00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,240\nwhere there was this report that said one\nof the food colorings in Mountain Dew\n\n403\n00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,040\nactually contained some kind of steroid.\n\n404\n00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,160\nAnd there's different kinds of steroids,\nbut\n\n405\n00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,230\nin most people's minds they think weight\nbuilders, like oh, I'm gonna get strong.\n\n406\n00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,710\nAnd sales for\nMountain Dew actually went up.\n\n407\n00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,130\nAnd, the report was kind of a scathing,\nnegative report, but sales went up.\n\n408\n00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,780\nAnd they didn't know that was\ngonna happen it just happened and\n\n409\n00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,090\nthey have to manage that, right?\n\n410\n00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,910\nSo sometimes demand is unpredictable and\nwe don't get the PBA for that.\n\n411\n00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,960\nAll right, now when we come to managing\ndemand, where does demand come from?\n\n412\n00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,190\nWell, it's always the result\nof some activity.\n\n413\n00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,030\nSome activity happens, and\nusually we're the ones who take it.\n\n414\n00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,840\nAnd it's either going to create\nincreased demand or decreased demand.\n\n415\n00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,311\nSo the outcome of an activity\nis gonna manipulate that demand.\n\n416\n00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:07,316\nAnd if I raise my price,\nthat's the activity I take.\n\n417\n00:20:07,316 --> 00:20:10,680\nThe outcome is that my service\nis more expensive, and\n\n418\n00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,900\nas a result less people will find\nit valuable, reducing the demand.\n\n419\n00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,290\nOr if I lower my price,\nthat's the activity I take,\n\n420\n00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,940\nthe outcome is that my service is\nnow more valuable to people, and\n\n421\n00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,350\nI'll get more customers, increased demand,\nbecause it's less expensive, right?\n\n422\n00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,840\nSo that's what demand management\nboils down to right there,\n\n423\n00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,060\nsteps we can take to\nmanipulate people's behavior.\n\n424\n00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,360\nNot manipulate the amount\nof output our company has.\n\n425\n00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,400\nIt's kind of negative, I guess,\nwhen you look at it that way.\n\n426\n00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,108\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're manipulating people.\n\n427\n00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:41,574\n[LAUGH] But it's a necessary tool.\n\n428\n00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:46,365\nAll right, so those are some\nof the basic principles there.\n\n429\n00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:49,045\nWe've got other things that we\ncan use to influence demand.\n\n430\n00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:52,010\nITIL calls out a few, specifically,\nlike incentives, right?\n\n431\n00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,430\nYou see automotive dealerships\nwill do this a lot.\n\n432\n00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,669\nWhere, hey,\nour car might normally cost $25,000, but\n\n433\n00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,142\nif you buy today, we'll give you\nfree oil changes for two years, or\n\n434\n00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:06,700\nwe will give you $2000 cash back,\nor whatever.\n\n435\n00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,555\nYou see it online with software.\n\n436\n00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:10,614\nIf you buy now, you'll save 15%.\n\n437\n00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:12,088\nOr, you have a coupon, right?\n\n438\n00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,955\nThese are things that are incentives for\npeople to buy,\n\n439\n00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:19,310\nif they buy your product now instead of\nwaiting, they can get it at a lower price.\n\n440\n00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,580\nSo that can manipulate demand.\n\n441\n00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,090\n>> One that Don mentioned earlier,\n\n442\n00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,340\nthe seasonal idea,\nwhere you might actually see where's there\n\n443\n00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,180\na different price because the holiday\nseason and demand has gone up.\n\n444\n00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,870\nWell now all of sudden that toy now\ncosts more than it actually had before.\n\n445\n00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,430\nSo they can keep the same\nlevel of what they have, but\n\n446\n00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,570\nstill be able to make the money and\n\n447\n00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,370\nactually even make more money because they\ndon't have everything that they need.\n\n448\n00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,990\nSo the idea of, you called it differential\ncharging here, is what you called it.\n\n449\n00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,120\n>> Yeah, differential charging, I mean,\n\n450\n00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,850\nthat's effectively what\nI do with my own rate.\n\n451\n00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,425\nBut you really see it,\na great example are hotels, right?\n\n452\n00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:57,466\nWe live in Gainesville, Florida, or I do.\n\n453\n00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:58,987\nRon you live out in the boonies.\n\n454\n00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,728\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But [LAUGH] it's a university town.\n\n455\n00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,356\nWe have the University of Florida here,\nand\n\n456\n00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,211\nthey have a football team\nthat Is sometimes good.\n\n457\n00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:07,341\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so the alumni,\n\n458\n00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:10,236\npeople flock to these\nfootball games like crazy.\n\n459\n00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:13,986\nAnd if there is a football game on\na weekend, all of the hotels sell out.\n\n460\n00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:17,486\nAnd all of the hotels are twice\nas expensive as normal.\n\n461\n00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:20,960\nThey still sell out, but\nthey're way more expensive.\n\n462\n00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,710\nAnd a lot of people look\nat that as price gouging,\n\n463\n00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,480\nwhich I guess it sort of is, but\na hotel only has so many rooms.\n\n464\n00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,380\nThey can't add more rooms on-demand,\nright?\n\n465\n00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,630\nYou can't say, oh we'll need 100\nextra rooms just for December, and\n\n466\n00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,550\nthen we can put them in storage, right?\n\n467\n00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,100\nSo they can't really adjust their\ncapability, they have to adjust demand,\n\n468\n00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,840\nand they do that by manipulating price,\nright?\n\n469\n00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,450\nRaise the price, and\nthen some of the people that would've\n\n470\n00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,990\nwanted to stay there will say,\noh, it's too expensive.\n\n471\n00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,190\nBut others will afford it, they'll go\nahead and they'll buy that room and\n\n472\n00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,560\nthey'll book up, and\nthe hotel's booked solid, right?\n\n473\n00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,870\nBut then during the summer, when college\nis out, there's no football games,\n\n474\n00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,500\nthere's nothing going on here.\n\n475\n00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,260\nAll the hotels are really inexpensive,\nand it's just cuz there's no demand.\n\n476\n00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,470\nPeople aren't looking for hotel rooms,\nso they've gotta lower the price\n\n477\n00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,700\nto create that, to make it attractive\nto people in a low-demand area.\n\n478\n00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,870\nSo that's differential charging.\n\n479\n00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,390\nThe only other one is a penalty, right?\n\n480\n00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,770\nAnd a penalty is where we penalize\npeople for certain types of purchases.\n\n481\n00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,650\nAnd you see that, it's really just\nthe opposite of an incentive.\n\n482\n00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,816\nIf you look at companies, well,\nI guess we kind of do this, right?\n\n483\n00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:27,202\nSo if you look at ITProTV.\n\n484\n00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:31,793\nIf you sign up for\na monthly subscription, there's one rate.\n\n485\n00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:37,027\nIf you sign up for an annual subscription,\nyou get two months free, right?\n\n486\n00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:39,689\nIt's a 17% discount, or something,\n\n487\n00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:44,870\nwhatever two months out of 12 months\nbeing free would equal out to.\n\n488\n00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,380\nSo you get basically, a discount.\n\n489\n00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,760\nThat's an incentive,\nyou're rewarded for doing a year.\n\n490\n00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,180\nNow you could look at it the other way and\nsay that you're penalized for\n\n491\n00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,760\ndoing just a month-by-month, except\nthe month is our normal rate, right?\n\n492\n00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,540\nCell phone companies will\ndo this with your contract.\n\n493\n00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,252\nIf you go off contract, they penalize you.\n\n494\n00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:09,501\nYou pay more if you get phones off\ncontract, than if you go on contract, and\n\n495\n00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,811\nthey'll subsidize some of that phone.\n\n496\n00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:18,790\nSo penalties and\nincentives kinda work In tandem.\n\n497\n00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,877\nWhen it comes to dealing with all this\nstuff we're really focused on that demand\n\n498\n00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:27,320\nmanagement, on the capability\nmanagement well, we interact with that.\n\n499\n00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,750\nCapability, its when we saturate our\ncapability that we realize we have to deal\n\n500\n00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,670\nwith demand or\n\n501\n00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,240\nif we have more capability that we're\nusing when you increase demand to fill it.\n\n502\n00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,560\nSo these two are very close to relating,\neven though they're separate.\n\n503\n00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,420\nWe need to keep track of our budget.\n\n504\n00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,615\nWhat money we have available\nto handle this stuff?\n\n505\n00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,970\nCuz that's gonna impact\ncapacity quite a bit.\n\n506\n00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,580\nAnd then to influence demand\nit usually requires budget,\n\n507\n00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,570\nif we discount our product, for example.\n\n508\n00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,550\nThat is going to be important.\n\n509\n00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,080\nWe will continue using us as an example.\n\n510\n00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,350\nLet's say that at ITProTV,\nwe absolutely wanted to get as\n\n511\n00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,790\nmany subscribers as possible,\nas fast as we could.\n\n512\n00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,720\nWell, I'll tell you\na great way to do that.\n\n513\n00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,070\nCut the price in half.\n\n514\n00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,135\nWe can just cut the price\nof our product in half,\n\n515\n00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,920\nmore people will sign up if it costs less.\n\n516\n00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,000\nBut the instant you cut your product price\nin half, what happens to your budget?\n\n517\n00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,650\nIt just got cut in half too.\n\n518\n00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,865\nThat money that you were making each\nweek or each month or whatever,\n\n519\n00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,385\nis now cut in half cause\nyou cut your price in half.\n\n520\n00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:30,635\nSo over the next couple\nof months you've gotta\n\n521\n00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,975\nrebuild all those new\nsubscribers coming in.\n\n522\n00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:35,355\nAnd when you double\nyour customer base now,\n\n523\n00:25:35,355 --> 00:25:38,010\nyou're back to what you\nwere making before the cut.\n\n524\n00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,170\nAnd then you start growing beyond that.\n\n525\n00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,590\nSo you've got to be able to cover\nthat period that of time while,\n\n526\n00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,240\nyou grow your business to fill\nup that price cut that you did.\n\n527\n00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,290\nAnd a lot of companies, that's where\nthey take venture capital funding.\n\n528\n00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,210\nThey bring in a lot of funding to\ncoast through that couple of years\n\n529\n00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,370\nwhere they do that.\n\n530\n00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,150\nAnd then they become\na real successful company.\n\n531\n00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,430\nThat's why places like Twitter can still\nbe around even though they've never\n\n532\n00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,540\nposted a profit a single time\nin the life the company.\n\n533\n00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,140\nOr Amazon is okay, losing a few\nbillion here or a few billion there.\n\n534\n00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,320\nWhen they know that they're gonna\nbe making money in the future.\n\n535\n00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,730\nSo it's all being kind funded.\n\n536\n00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,470\nSo those are all important\nconcepts to remember.\n\n537\n00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,210\nOther things to keep in mind\nis that we've got three\n\n538\n00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,080\nterms that ITIL specifically calls out.\n\n539\n00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,890\nWhich are assets, resources,\nand capabilities.\n\n540\n00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,500\nAnd they factor into all of this too,\neach one is a little bit different.\n\n541\n00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,760\nSo what is an asset?\n\n542\n00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,915\nAn asset is anything\nthat supports a service.\n\n543\n00:26:34,915 --> 00:26:37,355\nAnd it's typically people.\n\n544\n00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:41,875\nBut it can include other things,\nmoney, processes, infrastructure,\n\n545\n00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,765\ninformation, anything like that.\n\n546\n00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,815\nThat's all an asset.\n\n547\n00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:49,150\nSo when we're doing capability management,\n\n548\n00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,750\nour assets are typically\nwhat creates our capability.\n\n549\n00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,400\nAnd when we do demand management,\nwe're controlling access to those assets.\n\n550\n00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,190\nSo it's all hand in hand.\n\n551\n00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,970\nAssets though, that's a real generic term.\n\n552\n00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,520\nSo you'll see another term\nthey use which is resource.\n\n553\n00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,180\nAnd whenever they say resource,\nthat is almost always people.\n\n554\n00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,650\nWe're really talking about people, and\n\n555\n00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,550\nsometimes money,\npeople really equal money.\n\n556\n00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's super cynical to say that,\n\n557\n00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,690\nbut if I have a person,\nthe person is there because I pay them.\n\n558\n00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,490\nAnd so\nthat person really does equal money.\n\n559\n00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,570\nAnd so when we say a resource that's\nwhat we're usually talking about.\n\n560\n00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,540\n>> Yeah, a lot of times when you take\na look at it from ITIL's perspective and\n\n561\n00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,620\nthen you start reading it,\nyou also see that the idea of the resource\n\n562\n00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,760\nis when that one person or\n\n563\n00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,590\nproduct that you have is going to provide\nthe value and service to the customer.\n\n564\n00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,700\nSo think about it as not\njust being a person,\n\n565\n00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,750\nbut a person with the capabilities to\ndo what the customer wants them to do.\n\n566\n00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,340\nSo when that person brings their skill,\nwhen they bring their particular talent,\n\n567\n00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,010\nwhatever it might be, to that customer,\nthat is what we call the resource.\n\n568\n00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,740\n>> Yeah, and then capability.\n\n569\n00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,140\nWe've used that term several times, and\nthat's just the ability of our company\n\n570\n00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,110\nto be able to provide whatever our\nservice is, to carry out that activity.\n\n571\n00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,420\nAnd if you don't have the capability for\nit, and\n\n572\n00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,430\nyou're not set up to handle\nthat then you're going to fail.\n\n573\n00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,027\nAnd if you don't have the capability for\nit,\n\n574\n00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:11,760\nthen you need to reevaluate\nwhat you're doing.\n\n575\n00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,260\nYou need to change your strategy, so\n\n576\n00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,350\nthat's no longer something that you\nprovide or manage the demand to make sure\n\n577\n00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,670\nthe demand falls within\nthe capabilities that you have.\n\n578\n00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,730\nSo that is all a part of\nour service strategy.\n\n579\n00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,330\nThat's why it's here in this section,\nand it is important.\n\n580\n00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:32,410\nYou won't see it on the exam,\nbecause it's kind of an ephemeral thing.\n\n581\n00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,770\nIt's different for every company, how they\nmanage, that's why it's hard to test on.\n\n582\n00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,340\nBut it's important to be aware.\n\n583\n00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,800\nAnd you'll see the ITIL manuals actually,\ngo really in depth on that.\n\n584\n00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,120\nWe've got one more to tackle, Ronnie, but\n\n585\n00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,220\nwe have shot way past our\nbreak time on this one.\n\n586\n00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,960\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n587\n00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,380\nAnd when we get back we are going to\ntackle business relationship management,\n\n588\n00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,850\nwhich is on the exam.\n\n589\n00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,550\nSo definitely an important one to hit.\n\n590\n00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,180\nAnd then we'll probably\nwrap things up from there.\n\n591\n00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,078\nSo stay tuned.\n\n592\n00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,407\nWe'll be back with more, after this.\n\n593\n00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:04,411\n[MUSIC]\n\n594\n00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:08,631\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n595\n00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:13,453\nSo our last process inside a service\nstrategy is one that is called\n\n596\n00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:16,320\nBusiness Relationship Management.\n\n597\n00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,540\nAnd if you're like most IT people,\nyou hear this relationship management, and\n\n598\n00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,770\nyou're like, oh goodness,\nthere's more of that touchy feely stuff.\n\n599\n00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,760\nAnd you'd be right,\nthat's basically what it is.\n\n600\n00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,620\nBusiness Relationship Management\nis all about the communication and\n\n601\n00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,150\nrelationship and experience,\nbetween your company and the customer.\n\n602\n00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,120\nThat customer might be external,\nmight be internal, always remember that.\n\n603\n00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,860\nBut you've got some kind\nof relationship with them.\n\n604\n00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,510\nYou're creating a product that in theory\nbrings value to that customer and\n\n605\n00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,870\nthe customer is receiving value in\nexchange for not having to worry about\n\n606\n00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,050\nthe risks and cost of production for\nwhatever that service is.\n\n607\n00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,030\nSo it should be a win,\nwin, everybody is happy.\n\n608\n00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,750\nAnd the relationship goes on great and\n\n609\n00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,770\nyou go on to be an amazingly\nsuccessful company.\n\n610\n00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,640\nBut that doesn't always happen.\n\n611\n00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,430\nVarious things can occur that can\nmake that relationship breakdown,\n\n612\n00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,400\nand BRM is all about maintaining that\nmaking sure that doesn't happen right.\n\n613\n00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240\nKeeping things healthy.\n\n614\n00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,507\nKeeping things running the way that\nwe want, and if something arises,\n\n615\n00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:16,165\nhandling it.\n\n616\n00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:20,055\nNow, your IT HelpDesk person\nyour system administrator,\n\n617\n00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,556\nthey're not normally doing the BRM.\n\n618\n00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:26,925\nYou may have IT representatives that\nare higher up in the management ranks or\n\n619\n00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:31,070\nyou might even have sales people that\nare a part of the IT department.\n\n620\n00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,830\nWe have pre sales and\npost sales support, and\n\n621\n00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,830\npeople like that are handling\nthe relationships.\n\n622\n00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,800\nSo what all gets wrapped up in that?\n\n623\n00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,460\nWell, we've got several different\nthings that we need to cover here.\n\n624\n00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,150\nSo first off,\nit's really all about monitoring.\n\n625\n00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,410\nMonitoring what's going on.\n\n626\n00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,390\nWhen you enter into that relationship with\na customer, they give you requirements,\n\n627\n00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,870\nwhat they expect in your service and\nyou should fill those requirements.\n\n628\n00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,060\nSo in the very early stages, we have to\nmake sure those requirements are accurate.\n\n629\n00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,730\nIf they're not accurate in the beginning.\n\n630\n00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,940\nBy the time we roll out our service, it\nmight not match up with what the customer\n\n631\n00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,070\nwas actually expecting and\nnow we've got a problem.\n\n632\n00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,590\nAnd that's usually the first brush\nwe have with an issue on a project,\n\n633\n00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,760\nis when the customer was\nexpecting something a little\n\n634\n00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,600\ndifferent than what they\nindicated in what we provide.\n\n635\n00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,760\nSo how do we handle that?\n\n636\n00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,600\nDo we just say, forget you guys,\nthis is what you asked for and we did it?\n\n637\n00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,670\nWell, that's not gonna result in any\nkinda lasting business relationship.\n\n638\n00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,820\nSo you've gotta take steps to correct it,\nyou smooth that issue and move on.\n\n639\n00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,650\nSo we have to always evaluate that,\n\n640\n00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,006\nand we don't just stop with\nthe initial delivery of the service.\n\n641\n00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:38,418\nWe have to keep watching,\n\n642\n00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:42,668\nbecause things can happen where that\nservice might have been great on day one.\n\n643\n00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:46,164\nBut by the time you get to day 720 or\nwhatever,\n\n644\n00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:50,360\nthen maybe it is not operating\nat the levels it was before.\n\n645\n00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,301\nWe see that with issues\nof scale very often.\n\n646\n00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:56,794\n>> Yeah, at the beginning, when we take a\nlook at business relationship management,\n\n647\n00:31:56,794 --> 00:32:01,034\nwe always start off with trying to make\nsure that we have a clear understanding of\n\n648\n00:32:01,034 --> 00:32:02,832\nwhat the customer really needs?\n\n649\n00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:07,712\nAnd that we can articulate that, so\nthat the people that we're actually\n\n650\n00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:12,433\ncounting on to deliver those services,\nare able to understand that.\n\n651\n00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:17,297\nSecondly, we also have to understand that\nwe can actually, meet those requirements.\n\n652\n00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:18,597\nOr that we can't.\n\n653\n00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:22,986\nAnd that way we can articulate back to\nthe customer, yes, we can do that, or\n\n654\n00:32:22,986 --> 00:32:24,560\nwe can't.\n\n655\n00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,260\nIt's when that process breaks down,\nthat communication,\n\n656\n00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,510\nthat articulation that's not happening.\n\n657\n00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,990\nWhen that business channel, that\ncommunication channel does break down.\n\n658\n00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,730\nThat's why we want to ensure instead,\n\n659\n00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,690\nby keeping confident monitoring in\nthis process, in this relationship.\n\n660\n00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,570\nBecause if not, we'll end up\nassuming that everything is okay,\n\n661\n00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,490\nwhen now the customer's unhappy,\n\n662\n00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,340\nor we're not actually performing up\nto what the customer is expecting.\n\n663\n00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,710\n>> So there's four things we can monitor\nthat help us, not necessarily prevent\n\n664\n00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,380\nthat, but see it coming and take action\nto correct it as quickly as possible.\n\n665\n00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,310\nHopefully, we could see it coming and\nfix it before it happens.\n\n666\n00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,810\nThen the problem never actually\ncomes to fruition and you're fine.\n\n667\n00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,740\nOther times, you can at least get a head\nstart to resolving that issue, right?\n\n668\n00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,790\nSo when we provide a service,\nfirst off we need to monitor\n\n669\n00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,080\nwhether we're actually meeting\nthe needs of the customer.\n\n670\n00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,640\nIf they gave us requirements,\nare we meeting those requirements?\n\n671\n00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,760\nAnd one of the most common ways to do that\nis with an SLA, a service-level agreement.\n\n672\n00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,940\nThat's an agreement,\na contractual agreement,\n\n673\n00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,550\nthat you enter into with a customer\nthat says, here's the level of service.\n\n674\n00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,580\nHere's what we're gonna provide to you.\n\n675\n00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,920\nAnd if we don't,\nif something happens where we don't,\n\n676\n00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920\nhere's the penalties that\nwe're willing to pay.\n\n677\n00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,100\nI get that with my cable service at home.\n\n678\n00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,970\nThey say that they want me to have\ncable all the time, but they allow for\n\n679\n00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,050\na 2% downtime each month,\nsomething like that.\n\n680\n00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,530\nAnd if it's over that, they'll credit my\nbill, they'll prorate it or whatever.\n\n681\n00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,340\nSo they've got penalties\nkinda built into that SLA.\n\n682\n00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,020\nNow I don't worry about that much, but\nthey do cuz they wanna provide me with\n\n683\n00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,490\ngood service,\nwhich they utterly fail at doing.\n\n684\n00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,360\nBut most companies will actually try and\nbe successful at that.\n\n685\n00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,810\nSo are we meeting the needs\nof the customer, right?\n\n686\n00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,380\nAnd then the customer,\nslash user satisfaction.\n\n687\n00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,010\nMaybe we're meeting their needs,\ntheir base needs.\n\n688\n00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,480\nBut they are just not really happy.\n\n689\n00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,570\nTheir might be other providers out their\nthat can meet the needs just as well as we\n\n690\n00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,150\ncan, but might be creating a better\noverall experience for them.\n\n691\n00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,930\nSo for example, maybe their customer\nrequired a website to be able\n\n692\n00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,530\nto allow customers to come and\npurchase things.\n\n693\n00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,690\nThey wanted an e-commerce site set up.\n\n694\n00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,010\nWe are servicing that.\n\n695\n00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,710\nWe're creating the e-commerce website,\nhosting it,\n\n696\n00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,500\nproviding all that functionality.\n\n697\n00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,250\nBut then they find that\nevery time they call us for\n\n698\n00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,360\nsupport, they're getting put on hold for\nlong periods of time.\n\n699\n00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,650\nThe website is meeting their needs.\n\n700\n00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,530\nIt's allowing customers to come and\nbuy products from them.\n\n701\n00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,090\nWe're hosting it, it's available.\n\n702\n00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:58,160\nBut our customer service is not\ncreating a positive experience.\n\n703\n00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,120\nAnd so that customer may be driven away,\nmay move somewhere else.\n\n704\n00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,100\nAnd that's something that we\nshould have been able to recognize\n\n705\n00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,970\nif we were monitoring things like that.\n\n706\n00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,640\nIf we were doing surveys every so\noften for\n\n707\n00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,100\nour customers to say hey,\nwhat's your experience been like?\n\n708\n00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,990\nHow have things been going with you?\n\n709\n00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,520\nAnd get that feedback from them.\n\n710\n00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,450\nNow ITIL specifically calls out\ncustomer and user satisfaction.\n\n711\n00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,930\nWhat's the difference?\n\n712\n00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,130\nWell, oftentimes the customer is not\n\n713\n00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,400\nthe person that actually uses the service,\nall right?\n\n714\n00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,130\nIn my example a moment ago, the customer\nhad us create an e-commerce page for them.\n\n715\n00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,860\nWell if you work for a company, and you\nhave an e-commerce page, do you use it?\n\n716\n00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,580\nSo I work for ITProTV.\n\n717\n00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,680\nDo I go and\nbuy subscriptions from ITProTV?\n\n718\n00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,210\nNo.\nI'm in the videos.\n\n719\n00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,400\nIt doesn't pertain to me.\n\n720\n00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,440\nI'm not a good example\nof a user of the system.\n\n721\n00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,140\nI may be the customer in that I\ninitiated the system being created.\n\n722\n00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,200\nSo the customer satisfaction is\n\n723\n00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,512\nreally important to us cuz they're\nthe ones paying us to do the work.\n\n724\n00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:11,530\nBut oftentimes the user satisfaction, the\nperson that actually uses the system, if\n\n725\n00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,480\nthey get upset and they start grumbling,\nthat reaches back to the customer.\n\n726\n00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,030\nAnd while we met all the customer's needs,\nif the users are unhappy,\n\n727\n00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,130\nthe customer is gonna be unhappy.\n\n728\n00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,310\nSo we've gotta remember that separation.\n\n729\n00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,640\nThe person who uses the service\nmight not be the one,\n\n730\n00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,910\nmight not even know who the person is\nthat paid to commission the service.\n\n731\n00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,560\nThe actual customer, right?\n\n732\n00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,900\n>> We also have to monitor for changes\nthat could impact what service we provide.\n\n733\n00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,670\nSometimes companies say, yes, this is\nexactly what I need and this is exactly\n\n734\n00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,670\nwhat I want, but then there's a downturn\nin the market that they're serving in.\n\n735\n00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,010\nAnd now all of a sudden our particular\nservices are not as needed, and\n\n736\n00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,990\nnow we actually have to monitor for\nthose things too.\n\n737\n00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:57,430\nIf not, we may create an unusual burden\nin which they no longer need us and\n\n738\n00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,148\nthey can't afford to pay us too.\n\n739\n00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,730\n>> So\nwe wanna make sure that we can monitor for\n\n740\n00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,220\nthose impacts and changes that can happen.\n\n741\n00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,790\n>> One great example of a change is\n\n742\n00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,560\nnew regulations being\npassed by the government.\n\n743\n00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,180\nSo maybe this e-commerce\nsite you created was for\n\n744\n00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,010\na company that sells medical equipment.\n\n745\n00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,150\nSo that's fine.\n\n746\n00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,890\nYou meet all the needs and off you go.\n\n747\n00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,300\nAnd then the government of the country\nyou're in passes some new rules that\n\n748\n00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,700\ndictate how organizations that deal with\nmedical equipment are able to sell and\n\n749\n00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,370\nsecure their data.\n\n750\n00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,320\nLike here in the US, maybe they decide\nthat falls under HIPAA compliance, and\n\n751\n00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,880\nthey need to make sure that all\ntheir data's encrypted and secured.\n\n752\n00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,510\nWell, our original service offering met\ntheir needs before the regulation, but\n\n753\n00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,130\nwhat about after it?\n\n754\n00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,340\nWe probably don't meet their needs\nanymore, and so we need to evaluate that.\n\n755\n00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,030\nThat's going to be more work coming up\n\n756\n00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,272\nto make sure that we can\ncontinue to meet their needs.\n\n757\n00:37:45,272 --> 00:37:47,850\nWe could've seen that\ncoming if we were watching.\n\n758\n00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,870\nHere in the US we have the Senate and\nHouse,\n\n759\n00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,195\nthat's our little bicameral\ngovernment structure whatever mess.\n\n760\n00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:59,610\nAnd [LAUGH] it's not like new\nlaws come out of nowhere.\n\n761\n00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,655\nThey usually spend a good year or two in\ndevelopment, so you get an idea of what's\n\n762\n00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:06,313\ncoming down the pipe, and whether or\nnot it's gonna be successful.\n\n763\n00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:08,735\nSo you could start planning early,\nand saying all right,\n\n764\n00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,885\nlet's find out what requirement's are new,\nwhat we might have to change.\n\n765\n00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:12,325\nLet's get that plan rolling.\n\n766\n00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:16,900\nAnd it might require more cost, but\nyour customer will understand that because\n\n767\n00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,680\nit's not you that's putting this change\nin, it is the environment that's doing it.\n\n768\n00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,830\nWe're seeing that with other things today,\nlike maybe not on a great scale,\n\n769\n00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,100\nbut you're seeing BitCoin\nused as a currency.\n\n770\n00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,410\nAnd so some companies are working\nto add BitCoin as an accepted\n\n771\n00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,171\ncurrency on their site.\n\n772\n00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,280\nIn the past,\nnobody would've even thought of that.\n\n773\n00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,990\nWhatever your normal US dollar or whatever\nit is you're using, is what you'd accept.\n\n774\n00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,950\nBut now this crazy non-regulated,\n\n775\n00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,290\ndecentralized BitCoin,\nyou might wanna add that.\n\n776\n00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,650\nSo that's something that\na customer might choose to do.\n\n777\n00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,920\nSo they're initiating the change,\nbut it could be a third party,\n\n778\n00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,540\nlike the government that's doing it too.\n\n779\n00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,000\n>> Yeah, here's another great example for\nchanges that we might have to monitor for.\n\n780\n00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,410\nWhich is instead of actually just\n\n781\n00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,950\ndoing just a few things that fit our\nbusiness needs, we may actually end up\n\n782\n00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:07,640\nfiguring out that there are technological\nchanges that are coming down the line.\n\n783\n00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,600\nNow Don when ITProTV started,\nwe only thought about a website.\n\n784\n00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,360\nBut it wasn't long before we realized\nthat people were asking for Android apps,\n\n785\n00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,856\nand iPad apps, or iPhone apps.\n\n786\n00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:24,545\nAnd so these are considerations that we\nmay not have planned for in the beginning,\n\n787\n00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:27,655\nbut then all of a sudden we started seeing\nthat there was more value to it and\n\n788\n00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,045\nwe started changing for that.\n\n789\n00:39:29,045 --> 00:39:30,555\n>> Yeah, and it can even be bigger.\n\n790\n00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:36,175\nIf you were in IT in the 90s,\nNovell NetWare,\n\n791\n00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:40,075\nthat was the operating system\nplatform used for businesses.\n\n792\n00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,885\nSo it was rare to find a business that\ndidn't have Novell NetWare deployed for\n\n793\n00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:45,410\ntheir file server,\ntheir directory server, all that stuff.\n\n794\n00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,950\nWell things changed over time as\n\n795\n00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,510\nMicrosoft Windows took over in that market\nspace, and people started moving over.\n\n796\n00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:58,300\nThey had this technological need to\ndo that as Novell just went downhill.\n\n797\n00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,850\nAnd now we we see that with\nLinux servers and other servers.\n\n798\n00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,301\nYou have Apple starting to take\na portion of that market share.\n\n799\n00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:07,059\nSo our technological resources\ncan start to change.\n\n800\n00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:09,163\nNew advances happen all the time, and\n\n801\n00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:12,202\nit really does impact the way\nwe deliver our services.\n\n802\n00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:16,134\nSo we just have to keep\nan eye on that stuff.\n\n803\n00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:21,318\nAs part of BRM, that business relationship\nmanagement, part of your job is\n\n804\n00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:26,915\nto make sure that you understand the needs\nof the customer and do this monitoring.\n\n805\n00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:31,150\nAnother part of your job though is dealing\nwith it when things are out of sync.\n\n806\n00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,110\nWhen you're not meeting\nthe customer's needs.\n\n807\n00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,580\nWhen there's a problem.\n\n808\n00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,330\nIn that scenario, whoever's got\nthe business relationship management\n\n809\n00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,700\nrole is also gonna be doing mediation.\n\n810\n00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,740\nThey're gonna mediate to try and\ncorrect the situation.\n\n811\n00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,690\nBring it back in line and\nget everybody back to where they wanna be.\n\n812\n00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:50,210\nBecause what you don't want is to\nhave the relationship to get so\n\n813\n00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,080\nout of sync that the customer\nmoves on somewhere else.\n\n814\n00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,010\nNow if it's an internal customer, That's\nnot gonna happen and you're just doing\n\n815\n00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,110\na detriment to your company by not\nbeing able to progress efficiently.\n\n816\n00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,290\nBut if it's an external customer,\nthey'll often times just switch ships.\n\n817\n00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,680\nThey'll just move on to another\nprovider and that's that.\n\n818\n00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,780\nSo we need to make sure\nthat's being handled.\n\n819\n00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,660\nIf we're focused on creating value for\nthe customer, this happens automatically.\n\n820\n00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,810\nAnd so I tell labels that as\nvalue creation through services.\n\n821\n00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,630\nWe're creating value by offering\nthe services the customer wants.\n\n822\n00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,400\nAnd the services the customer\nwants may change.\n\n823\n00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,110\nSo we continue to just add value\nby creating more services or\n\n824\n00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,010\nmodifying services to match\nwhat the customer wants.\n\n825\n00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,890\nAnd it's all just a part of that process.\n\n826\n00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,100\nSo, other things we need to keep in mind,\nright?\n\n827\n00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,910\nAre we offering the necessary services?\n\n828\n00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,090\nA customer may actually have\nan entire set of needs and\n\n829\n00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,640\nwe've offered the bare minimum\nto meet one of their needs\n\n830\n00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,795\nwhen in reality they have other\nthings that need to be addressed too.\n\n831\n00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,045\nThey may not even realize that.\n\n832\n00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:57,975\nSometimes a customer will come to you with\nrequirements that are incomplete, and so\n\n833\n00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,305\nwe need to always reevaluate\nthat to find out whether or\n\n834\n00:42:00,305 --> 00:42:02,055\nnot they've gathered everything together.\n\n835\n00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,445\nAnd then that way we can look at it and\n\n836\n00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:06,670\nwe can say all right, this service\nthat you're requesting is it enough?\n\n837\n00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,550\nAnd if it isn't what\nelse do we need to add?\n\n838\n00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,720\nWhat could we add to create a full suite?\n\n839\n00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,790\nAll services that you need to create\nthe outcome that is gonna make you happy.\n\n840\n00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,110\nThat's all a part of this of adding\nthat value to the creation services.\n\n841\n00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,546\n>> Speaking of added value Don,\n\n842\n00:42:22,546 --> 00:42:26,380\none of the things that we may not\neven think about especially in IT.\n\n843\n00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,860\nIs the image that's presented for\nus as a service to the customer.\n\n844\n00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,870\nSometimes even though we may\npresent the best possible technical\n\n845\n00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:41,750\nsupport that we can, it may be the image\nthat when somebody walks in they're like,\n\n846\n00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,650\nhow did, why is that guy working for them?\n\n847\n00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,590\nOr, why are they even in this building?\n\n848\n00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,330\nAnd a lot of it has to do with image.\n\n849\n00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,620\nMaking sure that the image that we're\npresenting is that same level of\n\n850\n00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,040\nprofessionalism as what that\ncustomer expects to see.\n\n851\n00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,100\nSometimes if it's not they may be very\ndisappointed with the very fact that we\n\n852\n00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,380\nmay be allowing employees walk\nin with flip-flops and t-shirts.\n\n853\n00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,640\nI'm not going to say that really\nhappens but it may be that.\n\n854\n00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,970\n>> And it all comes down to\ncustomer expectations right?\n\n855\n00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,690\nWhich you'll only find\nby talking to them and\n\n856\n00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,210\nthat's why you'll have to have a,\nwhat they call it, a relationship.\n\n857\n00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:13,520\nYou know, not just a contract, right?\n\n858\n00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,930\nThat you actually have to communicate and\ndraw all this information.\n\n859\n00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,530\nNow, I mentioned SLAs\nearlier in the segment, and\n\n860\n00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,340\nI want to just touch base\non that one more time.\n\n861\n00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,310\nWith BRM, we're actually planning for\nthose SLAs, we create them.\n\n862\n00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,800\nWe talk to the customer,\nwe agree on a level of service, and\n\n863\n00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,650\nwe say, if you do business with us,\nthis is the service we're providing,\n\n864\n00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,450\nthis is the availability you're gonna get,\nthis is what we agreed to provide.\n\n865\n00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,035\nBRM is limited to creating the SLAs.\n\n866\n00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,530\nBRM isn't associated with actually\nliving up to the SLAs, right?\n\n867\n00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,150\nSo we have service level agreements, and\nthen we have service level management.\n\n868\n00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,530\nAnd service level management\nis a part of our operations.\n\n869\n00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,280\nAnd so, we'll see that later on as\nwe move through the ITIL series.\n\n870\n00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,530\nWhen we tackle that later on,\nbut separate that in your mind.\n\n871\n00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,230\nThat with BRM we create the SLAs.\n\n872\n00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,640\nOther parts of our organization will\nhave to actually live up to them.\n\n873\n00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,850\nAnd then if we fail to\nlive up to the SLAs.\n\n874\n00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,830\nBRM is the one that is going to handle\nthe mediation to get us back in line.\n\n875\n00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,740\nBut there again, not actually going to\ndo the work to put us back in line,\n\n876\n00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,130\nthat's going to be the SLM side,\nthe service level management.\n\n877\n00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,270\nYou may find over time that\nyour SLAs need to change.\n\n878\n00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,770\nThat's another thing that\nyou've gotta evaluate.\n\n879\n00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,430\nA customer may come to you with a set\nof requirements that are valid for\n\n880\n00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,370\nthat point and time in their company.\n\n881\n00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,270\nAnd so you create a service\nthat's of great value to them.\n\n882\n00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,300\nBut as the years go on, maybe\nthe company grows or their needs change.\n\n883\n00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,760\nAnd while you provided great\nvalue in the beginning\n\n884\n00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,940\nnow you're not quite\nproviding that same value.\n\n885\n00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,500\nAnd so it does need to be reevaluated and\nrenegotiated.\n\n886\n00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,770\nYou're SLAs may need to change for a time.\n\n887\n00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,160\nSo maybe you've done business with\nthis customer for a long, long time.\n\n888\n00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,970\nBack when dial up phone systems\nwere used and so you had\n\n889\n00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,020\nan SLA that stated things like, you'll\nhave this amount of phone lines available.\n\n890\n00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,615\nWell does that create any value today when\nnobody uses dial up networking anymore,\n\n891\n00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:13,215\nnot on a regular basis?\n\n892\n00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:13,785\nIt doesn't.\n\n893\n00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:17,215\nAnd so there's extra things in the SLA\nthat might be driving up costs,\n\n894\n00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,025\ncuz you're maintaining those\nlines that aren't needed anymore.\n\n895\n00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:21,965\nAnd so that just needs to be revisited\nwith the customer each year.\n\n896\n00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:23,985\nAs you say, well,\nlet's take a look at these SLAs,\n\n897\n00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:26,490\nand do you guys still need\nthese dial up lines anymore?\n\n898\n00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,700\nIf we remove that we can actually reduce\ncosts, which will create value for you.\n\n899\n00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,149\nOr if you find it valuable to have those\nlines in place as a backup connection or\n\n900\n00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,760\nwhatever we can keep them.\n\n901\n00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,470\nIt's what the customer needs,\n\n902\n00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,080\nnot necessarily what you can provide\nthat will keep that relationship tight.\n\n903\n00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,580\nAnd that's really what the whole process\nof business relationship management is.\n\n904\n00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,810\nThe key concept to remember, the phrase.\n\n905\n00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,180\nIf you just remember one phrase for\n\n906\n00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,860\nthe exam,\nit's value creation through services.\n\n907\n00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,840\nThat's not something I'm making up,\n\n908\n00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,720\nthat's a quote straight from\nthe service strategy guide.\n\n909\n00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,730\nValue creation through services.\n\n910\n00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,890\nIf your company doesn't\ncreate any services,\n\n911\n00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,690\nthen you're not doing anything of\nvalue that your customers'll want.\n\n912\n00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,675\nThere's nothing for them to buy.\n\n913\n00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:12,345\nAnd if you do create services,\n\n914\n00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:15,185\nyou want them to be ones that\nthe customers actively want.\n\n915\n00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:18,365\nThat they're not just forced to\npurchase for some various reason.\n\n916\n00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:21,645\nSo creating value by offering\nthe services the customer wants.\n\n917\n00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,107\nWell Ronnie I think we've pretty much\n\n918\n00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:28,467\ncovered service strategy\nas much as we need to.\n\n919\n00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:29,927\nCan you think of anything\nelse to throw in?\n\n920\n00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:34,853\n>> No just make sure you pay attention to\nthe phrases we specifically mentioned.\n\n921\n00:46:34,853 --> 00:46:37,363\nBecause a lot of it does have\nto deal with terminology so\n\n922\n00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:41,053\nwe want to make sure that we learn that\nbut we want to keep a context too.\n\n923\n00:46:41,053 --> 00:46:46,543\nScenarios and context are very important\nbecause that's what this is really about.\n\n924\n00:46:46,543 --> 00:46:49,661\nIs the beginning of making sure\nwe understand strategy and\n\n925\n00:46:49,661 --> 00:46:52,980\nhow it plays into all the services\nthat we're gonna provide.\n\n926\n00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,040\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen this is a pretty good spot for\n\n927\n00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,180\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n928\n00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,710\nSo let me just remind you guys if\nyou have questions on any of this,\n\n929\n00:47:01,710 -->

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:10,459\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:23,125\n[SOUND]\n\n3\n00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:33,771\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:36,039\nAll right.\nGood morning, good afternoon, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,280\ngood evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,720\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,560\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,290\n>> It is going well today.\n\n9\n00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,240\nI did not get yelled at by M&M on\nthe red carpet, so I'm pretty good.\n\n10\n00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,860\n>> That is a common\noccurrence around here.\n\n11\n00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,480\n>> I know.\n>> But we've\n\n12\n00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,228\nmanaged to dodge it this time.\n\n13\n00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:53,780\n>> That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,320\n>> [LAUGH] We're jumping back into\nthe wonderful world of ITIL and today,\n\n15\n00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,350\nwe're gonna be tackling\nour second service area.\n\n16\n00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,130\nWe're actually diving into service design.\n\n17\n00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,420\nSo by this point you should of already\nwatched our material on service strategy\n\n18\n00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,620\nas a company figures out what\nservices they want to implement to\n\n19\n00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,970\ncreate their vision,\ntheir overall goal for the company.\n\n20\n00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,550\nOnce you figured that out,\nnow you need to make that happen, and\n\n21\n00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,670\nservice design is the first\nleg of that journey.\n\n22\n00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,182\nThat's where we start to evaluate\nboth the methods that we can use to\n\n23\n00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:29,757\ncreate that service and ultimately\ndeliver it, but there's a lot of\n\n24\n00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,580\nplanning that goes into that process and\nthat's what falls under service design.\n\n25\n00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,690\n>> Yeah, service design is really what\nmoves us from the strategy, in which we're\n\n26\n00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,150\njust talking about what we really want\nto accomplish as our overall goal and\n\n27\n00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,950\nour mission,\nto now putting those visions and\n\n28\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,240\nthose particular purposes with feet\non them and plans that we make.\n\n29\n00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,010\nSo we're moving from strategy to\nplanning now, and we're gonna make sure\n\n30\n00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,010\nthat we cover everything that\nwe need to in our design phase.\n\n31\n00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,840\nSo as we move further on,\n\n32\n00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,540\nwe're really not having to go\nback to the drawing board again.\n\n33\n00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,410\nSo here's our drawing board.\n\n34\n00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,440\n>> There's a saying that I have a lot,\n\n35\n00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,702\nwhich is there is no\nsubstitute to good planning.\n\n36\n00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:13,240\nNow, I also have another saying-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,810\n>> That I hope,\n\n38\n00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,400\nI don't usually have to say which is,\nlet's chalk this one up to poor planning.\n\n39\n00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,510\nI've said that one more than once too,\nbut basically, if you have a proper\n\n40\n00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,400\nplan in place for an implementation,\nthen things should go nice and smoothly.\n\n41\n00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,930\nIf anything goes wrong,\nyou should already have your contingencies\n\n42\n00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,210\nplanned to be able to correct that and\nget back in line.\n\n43\n00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,840\nIf you take the time\nto do proper planning,\n\n44\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,470\nyou will increase your\nodds of being successful.\n\n45\n00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,550\nNow, you can overdo it and\nthat's where we have to be careful there,\n\n46\n00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,240\nyou can over plan and\nyou end up wasting time and\n\n47\n00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,650\nresources on something that\nshould've already been done.\n\n48\n00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,350\nI know, there have been some funny\ncomic strips about that over the years,\n\n49\n00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,090\nbut you can be paralyzed by fear,\nand not move a project forward, and\n\n50\n00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,560\nthat can be very negative.\n\n51\n00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,460\nSo we've got to find that right balance,\nand\n\n52\n00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,660\nwe'll talk a little bit about\nthat as this show goes on.\n\n53\n00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,140\nOne key thing that I wanna point out here,\nis it's really easy in our minds\n\n54\n00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,160\nto think of service design as\nonly designing new services.\n\n55\n00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,028\nBut we're gonna reach back to this a few\ntimes, especially towards the end of\n\n56\n00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,659\nthe series when we get into continual\nservice improvement because CSI,\n\n57\n00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,710\nContinual Service Improvement, is all\nabout looking at your existing services\n\n58\n00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,763\nand saying, how do we make them better?\n\n59\n00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,070\nHow do we keep them relevant?\n\n60\n00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,480\nHow do we keep them producing value for\nour customers?\n\n61\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,018\nAnd the way you do that is typically\nthrough change, and any time you implement\n\n62\n00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:37,110\na change to a service, you really\njump right back here to your design.\n\n63\n00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,809\nAnd you say okay,\nthis is the change that we want to do,\n\n64\n00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,406\nwhat's the best way to do that?\n\n65\n00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,200\nAnd you put your plan together.\n\n66\n00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,380\nSo it's not just creating new services,\nit's modifying the services that you have,\n\n67\n00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,070\nand you even go one step further and\nsay, if it's time to retire a service,\n\n68\n00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,390\nto take it out of production, you need\nto go and do a design for that too.\n\n69\n00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,433\nWhat's the best way to remove\nthis service from production and\n\n70\n00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,337\nimpact our customers\nas little as possible?\n\n71\n00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:06,840\nAnd some companies historically\nhave done a great job of that\n\n72\n00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,790\nwhere a transition happens and\nmost of us don't even notice.\n\n73\n00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,380\nOther companies have had some missteps and\na transition occurs and\n\n74\n00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,590\nit's a big debacle.\n\n75\n00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,442\nSo some examples of that would be\nlike here in the United States with\n\n76\n00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,910\nthe HDTV switch over.\n\n77\n00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,940\nWe had analog TV for\na long time, for years and\n\n78\n00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,750\nyears, and\nthey wanted to switch over to digital TV.\n\n79\n00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,290\nSo for a period of like two years, they\ndid all sorts of public announcements and\n\n80\n00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,480\nwarnings, they even sent\nletters in the mail.\n\n81\n00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,990\nThey made these little converter box\navailable to people that requested them.\n\n82\n00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,240\nThey took all these steps and\n\n83\n00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,740\nwhen the cut over finally happened,\nmost people weren't affected at all.\n\n84\n00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,720\nWorst case scenario, you had some\nreally old TVs that no longer work, but\n\n85\n00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,510\nit was a nice, smooth transition.\n\n86\n00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,420\nThey did a good design for\n\n87\n00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,750\nhow to implement that new service,\nit was done very smoothly.\n\n88\n00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,590\nOther examples, though, might be like\nApple, when Apple rolled out their new\n\n89\n00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,440\nApple Maps program,\npeople were up and arms about this.\n\n90\n00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,570\nPrior to that you had\nGoogle Maps on an iPhone or\n\n91\n00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,330\niPad, and Apple decided to switch\nout to their own mapping system,\n\n92\n00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,900\nintroducing a new service and\nphasing out the old, retiring Google Maps.\n\n93\n00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,110\nWhen they did that, their new\nservice wasn't at feature parody,\n\n94\n00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,320\nit didn't offer the same\nfeatures as what Google Maps had.\n\n95\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,770\nSo most of the users viewed\nthat as a step backwards.\n\n96\n00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,880\nAnd so that impacted the customers.\n\n97\n00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,690\nSo retiring a service\nrequires good design.\n\n98\n00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,550\nYou've gotta make sure we take that step.\n\n99\n00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,360\nA lot of people don't pay attention to\nthat and they say, that service is done,\n\n100\n00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,370\nlet's just go flip the switch.\n\n101\n00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,137\nThen you end up in a situation that\nis really gonna create negative PR,\n\n102\n00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,768\nand potentially reduce income.\n\n103\n00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,714\n>> Yeah, so when we take a look then,\nat designing new processes, and\n\n104\n00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:59,940\nthen having to make changes to\nthe processes that we're already doing or\n\n105\n00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,650\nthe services that we're providing and\nalso retiring it.\n\n106\n00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,590\nDon, it sounds a lot like project\nmanagement at this point.\n\n107\n00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,460\nWhen we start with the initiation,\nand then the execution and\n\n108\n00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,180\nthe monitoring and then moving into\nclosing phases sounds very similar.\n\n109\n00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,035\n>> It really does and\n\n110\n00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:19,830\nITIL as a whole, does match up in\na lot of ways with project management.\n\n111\n00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,980\nSo this area particularly, service design,\n\n112\n00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,406\nit really is probably the most closely\naligned phase with project management.\n\n113\n00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:32,933\nAnd what you have to remember is that\nwhat project management does, let's say,\n\n114\n00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:37,795\nyou follow the PMI's PMBOK, and that's the\nway that you do your project management or\n\n115\n00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:42,570\nyou follow any of the various other\nproject methodologies that are out there.\n\n116\n00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,480\nThat when you follow those it is\ndesigned to help you take a simple,\n\n117\n00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,950\nshort term activity and take it from start\nto completion within a certain budget,\n\n118\n00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,010\nwithin a certain time frame,\nwithin a certain amount of\n\n119\n00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,800\nrequirements that you have to meet, and\nthose are all just temporary endeavors.\n\n120\n00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,610\nSo project management doesn't account for\nour day to day,\n\n121\n00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,750\nour ongoing activities,\nit doesn't handle that.\n\n122\n00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,090\nITIL does both.\n\n123\n00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,420\nITIL covers your ongoing, your day to\nday activities, that are not projects,\n\n124\n00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,980\nbut it provides some of the framework for\nproject management.\n\n125\n00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,996\nBut it leaves a lot of this open-ended,\n\n126\n00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:26,920\nand the reason it does that is because\nthey want you to be able to pick\n\n127\n00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,850\nwhatever project management methodology\nyou want and snap it on top of ITIL.\n\n128\n00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,865\nSo you may use ITIL for your service\nmanagement, your overall service\n\n129\n00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:42,560\nmanagement, but then you use the PMI for\nyour project management or PRINCE2 or\n\n130\n00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,673\none of the other project management\nmethodologies that are out there.\n\n131\n00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,185\nYou just choose which one is appropriate\nfor your organization and you snap it on.\n\n132\n00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,714\nSo as we go through design,\n\n133\n00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,835\nthis really does match up with\nthe planning phase in project management,\n\n134\n00:07:55,835 --> 00:08:00,086\nand if you're a project manager,\njust- Try and align that you might have,\n\n135\n00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:04,600\nhow does my project management methodology\nmatch up with the design here.\n\n136\n00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,900\nAnd we'll see we've got eight different\nprocesses we're gonna tackle, and each\n\n137\n00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,720\none does match up with a lot of the stuff\nthat we do inside of project management.\n\n138\n00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:18,070\nAll right, so all of this integrates\njust into our overall change process.\n\n139\n00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,690\nAny time you introduce a new service,\nit's a change.\n\n140\n00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,008\nAny time you modify an existing service,\nthat's a change.\n\n141\n00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:25,922\nAny time you remove a service,\nthat's a change.\n\n142\n00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:31,170\nAnd so any time you make a change,\nwe go into service design, all right.\n\n143\n00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,764\nAnd we have like five steps that we\nmove through when implementing change\n\n144\n00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:39,831\nin a business, and\nITIL calls these out specifically, right,\n\n145\n00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:43,400\nwe start with the business process change.\n\n146\n00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840\nRight, so we identify a change.\n\n147\n00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,030\nThere's a process that we have in place,\nor a process that we need,\n\n148\n00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,040\nand we're going to do\na change to fix that, right.\n\n149\n00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,310\nSo step two,\nwe figure out what our requirements are.\n\n150\n00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,440\nI know I've mentioned\nthat in other episodes.\n\n151\n00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,290\nUnderstanding your requirements\nis really important.\n\n152\n00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,090\nIf you don't know what\nyou need to achieve,\n\n153\n00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,470\nif you don't know it specifically\nwith unambiguous terms,\n\n154\n00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,430\nthen our two main problems are gonna\nbe one, how do we know we're done?\n\n155\n00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,060\nHow do we know that we've met\nthe requirements if we don't know what\n\n156\n00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,300\nthe requirements were.\n\n157\n00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,595\nAnd then two, if we have kind of moved\nforward on that and we do or don't know\n\n158\n00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:25,336\nwhat we've done, how do we know that we\nare delivering what the customer wants?\n\n159\n00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:27,008\nRight, how do we meet that expectation?\n\n160\n00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:30,194\nSo it really does create problems,\nand you're setting yourself up for\n\n161\n00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,800\nfailure when you have that.\n\n162\n00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,829\nSo gathering those requirements\nare really important,\n\n163\n00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:39,400\nand a lot of people do focus on that,\nbut ITIL also tacks on feasibility.\n\n164\n00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,600\nWe've gotta figure out whether or not it's\neven feasible for us to do this change.\n\n165\n00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,810\nIf somebody comes to you with\na great giant list of requirements,\n\n166\n00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,030\nyou may look at that and say man,\nwe just do not have the resources.\n\n167\n00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,800\nWe don't have the money for that or\nwe don't have the people for that.\n\n168\n00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,130\nWe don't have the capability,\n\n169\n00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,560\njust something is causing us not to\nbe able to meet those requirements.\n\n170\n00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,760\nSo, that needs to happen early on because\n\n171\n00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,880\nyou might need to kill the project there\nbefore it moves on, and you don't wanna\n\n172\n00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,300\nwaste a bunch of resources on something\nthat's gonna die on the vine anyway.\n\n173\n00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,450\n>> And our third step, we also talk\nabout process development too.\n\n174\n00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,665\nAnd this actually means taking not only\none and go, okay, well we're done and\n\n175\n00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:20,860\ncomplete, but always considering what\nthe next step is going to need to be and\n\n176\n00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,270\nwhatever comes our way in the changes.\n\n177\n00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,260\nSo we're not ever caught in, well we\nshould have thought about that before.\n\n178\n00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,210\nDevelopment means that we've always\ngot this process to make sure that\n\n179\n00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,010\nwe're in different steps, and\nthat we're progressing through it.\n\n180\n00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,230\n>> After that once we've got\nour process developed, right,\n\n181\n00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,650\nwhich is what we're kind of\ndoing here in service design,\n\n182\n00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,350\nthen we move into implementation,\nbusiness process implementation.\n\n183\n00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,040\nIt's been designed, and it's ready to\ngo and get moved into our production\n\n184\n00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,320\nenvironment input and use, and that kind\nof transitions us to that final stage,\n\n185\n00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,575\nwhich is benefits realization, right?\n\n186\n00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,760\nNow that it's in production,\n\n187\n00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,548\nwhatever benefits you were hoping to\ngain from this you should now meet.\n\n188\n00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:02,955\nNow, that might not be financial, I always\nthink financially, like oh now we're gonna\n\n189\n00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,951\nstart making money on this, but maybe it\nwas that a new government regulation was\n\n190\n00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:11,085\npassed, and as a completion of these\nfive steps, I now meet the regulation.\n\n191\n00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:14,005\nI'm not gonna make anymore money, but I'm\ngonna able allowed to stay in business,\n\n192\n00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,825\nI'm not gonna get any\npenalties from the government.\n\n193\n00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,940\nSo it might be something like that.\n\n194\n00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,230\nNow, when we think of steps like these,\n\n195\n00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,370\nwe always need to think about\nhow IT plugs into it, right?\n\n196\n00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,320\nWhere does the IT\ndepartment fit into this?\n\n197\n00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,901\nMost business process changes don't\noriginate from the IT department,\n\n198\n00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,505\nright, unless you work for a tech company.\n\n199\n00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:39,865\nSo if you work for an insurance company,\na bank, a hospital, the business\n\n200\n00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,177\nprocess changes are going to come from\npeople that actually work creating\n\n201\n00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:48,357\nthe product that your organization sells,\nright, whatever that primary service is.\n\n202\n00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:52,167\nSo in a hospital the doctors might\nhave recommended changes for\n\n203\n00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,137\nbetter ways of handling\nprescribed medicines or\n\n204\n00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:59,657\nsomething of that nature, so\nthat starts without the IT department.\n\n205\n00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:01,617\nThe IT department doesn't really\nget involved until step two,\n\n206\n00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:03,547\nwhen it's requirements,\n\n207\n00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:06,897\nbecause the IT department needs to\nunderstand, what servers are we gonna use?\n\n208\n00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,400\nWhat software are we gonna need?\n\n209\n00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,360\nHow are we gonna implement this?\n\n210\n00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,930\nWhat security protocols do we need\nto put in place to protect this?\n\n211\n00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,202\nThat's where they start getting involved,\nand when the doctor said boy,\n\n212\n00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,930\nit would be nice if we had a new\nway to track which medicines were\n\n213\n00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,820\nbeing prescribed to a patient.\n\n214\n00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,090\nThey're not thinking about servers and\nsoftware.\n\n215\n00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,950\nThey're just thinking\nabout the actual use.\n\n216\n00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,230\nThe actual service itself.\n\n217\n00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,600\nAnd not how it's done.\n\n218\n00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200\nSo the IT department snaps\nin to provide that piece.\n\n219\n00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,310\nThat, how it's done.\n\n220\n00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,917\nWhat we need to know to get that moving,\nright.\n\n221\n00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,040\n>> In the next step that we have where\nthe IT department really fits in,\n\n222\n00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,090\nis in the implementation stage.\n\n223\n00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,650\nA lot of times the executive will come and\nsay, here is what I need.\n\n224\n00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,840\nHow am I gonna get this?\n\n225\n00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,520\nWell that's where the IT department says\nwell, here's what you're gonna need to\n\n226\n00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,880\nhave, you're gonna need to have tablets\nthat will be able to connect in to this.\n\n227\n00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,970\nOr we need thin clients at every\nsingle room inside of the hospital so\n\n228\n00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,190\nthat we can get access to the information,\nand that's where our job comes in,\n\n229\n00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,860\nis being able to figure out what the\ntechnical requirements are so that we can\n\n230\n00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,290\nput in place all those elements that will\nbring that plan together for the business\n\n231\n00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,540\n>> And then implement it, right, so\n\n232\n00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,970\non the requirement side we\nare figuring out what to do,\n\n233\n00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,966\non the implementation side, we do it.\n\n234\n00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,640\nSo now that we've got this software\ndesign or whatever the solution is,\n\n235\n00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,750\nwe owe when we get that software\ninstalled on the tablets,\n\n236\n00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030\non the desktops, on the think clients.\n\n237\n00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,230\nWhen we get those deployed.\n\n238\n00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,060\nSo we actually do that work and\nput it in place.\n\n239\n00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,490\nSo many of these steps will be handled by\nproject management teams, by executives,\n\n240\n00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,930\nby project stakeholders, outside of IT and\nwe just see the little pieces of it.\n\n241\n00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,170\nAnd the design, will hopefully\ninvolve the IT department so\n\n242\n00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,980\nthat we can help make the right decisions.\n\n243\n00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,780\nSo, we're in more of\na support role on this one.\n\n244\n00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,170\nSo as we look at each of the processes\ninside of service design, remember that,\n\n245\n00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,260\nthat a lot of this is actually being\ndone by other people outside of the IT\n\n246\n00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,560\ndepartment and we're looking\nat it from our IT perspective,\n\n247\n00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,580\nthat's important to keep in mind.\n\n248\n00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n249\n00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,910\n>> All right, so what we'll see is as we\ndive into service design, we're really\n\n250\n00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:14,860\nfocused on just a couple of things, and\na primary concern that we have is how we\n\n251\n00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,660\nbalance what's available to us to get this\nthing done, and designed, and successful.\n\n252\n00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,990\nSo if we have a proper plan in place,\nwe can kinda see the future, right?\n\n253\n00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,780\nWe can anticipate what's gonna\nhappen we do this deployment.\n\n254\n00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,630\nThat's really what all this is about.\n\n255\n00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,890\nAnd going back to kind\nof our project world,\n\n256\n00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:37,100\nin the project world, you have schedule,\nhow long something's gonna take.\n\n257\n00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,910\nYou have budget,\nwhich is how much something is gonna cost.\n\n258\n00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,858\nAnd you have scope which are your\nrequirements, what you need to get done.\n\n259\n00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:46,372\nWell from ITIL's perspective\nit's a little bit different.\n\n260\n00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:50,722\nWe have our cost and our time just like in\nproject, but instead of the requirements\n\n261\n00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:55,136\nwe have resources, we've gotta have people\navailable to provide this service and\n\n262\n00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:59,360\nthe requirements are nonnegotiable,\nwe know the requirements that have to get\n\n263\n00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,825\ndone, we've gotta meet those or\nwe might as well not do this, and\n\n264\n00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:07,020\nthen we substitute that out with the\nresources that we have to have available.\n\n265\n00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,570\nSo when we look at it from an ITIL\nperspective, it's cost, time, resources.\n\n266\n00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,490\nAll right, inside of the service\ndesign section, we're gonna see\n\n267\n00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,650\neight different processes that address\ndifferent areas of that, and let me just\n\n268\n00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,710\nbring up a list here real quick so we can\nsee, I wanna bring these up on the screen.\n\n269\n00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,790\nSo these are the eight processes\nright here that we're gonna tackle,\n\n270\n00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,120\nand I've put them in the same order as\nthey are in the service design manual, but\n\n271\n00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,190\nthese aren't necessarily\nlike chronological.\n\n272\n00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,590\nYou don't necessarily start right at\nthe beginning and run through the end,\n\n273\n00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,120\nalthough you might.\n\n274\n00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,790\nThese typically all happen\nat the same time, right?\n\n275\n00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,840\nSo if we start at the beginning,\nwe've got design coordination,\n\n276\n00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,610\nwhich is when we get ready\nto put their heads together.\n\n277\n00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,584\nWe've got to figure out what\nwe're trying to achieve, and\n\n278\n00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,277\nthis is where a lot of our\nrequirements will come out.\n\n279\n00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:55,527\nWe've got our service catalog management,\n\n280\n00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:58,902\nthat's dealing with all the various\nservices our company offers,\n\n281\n00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:03,184\ncuz we might have overlap that we can take\nadvantage of and that's really important.\n\n282\n00:16:03,184 --> 00:16:09,670\nService level management, we talked about\nSLAs in these service strategy side.\n\n283\n00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,914\nHere is where we figure out how\nwe're gonna meet those SLAs,\n\n284\n00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:14,380\nhow we're gonna meet those requirements.\n\n285\n00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,120\nAvailability management,\nwhenever you introduce an IT service,\n\n286\n00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,800\nyou got to account for\nthings like system failures and so\n\n287\n00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,950\nwhat availability levels do we need and\nhow are we gonna meet those?\n\n288\n00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,130\nCapacity management,\n\n289\n00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,840\nthe amount of resources we're gonna\nneed to provide this new service.\n\n290\n00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,850\nWe've got IT service\ncontinuity management.\n\n291\n00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,130\nWhen there's a failure,\n\n292\n00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,310\nhow do we continue providing that\nservice inside of a failure event?\n\n293\n00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,210\nInformation security management,\nso how to secure all this.\n\n294\n00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,767\nAnd boy, that is a step that a lot of\npeople don't seem to be paying attention\n\n295\n00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:47,333\nto lately.\n\n296\n00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,730\nSo, we need to make sure that\nwe have everything secured.\n\n297\n00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,480\nAnd then, the last one is not really on\nthe exam but, is important, nonetheless,\n\n298\n00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,230\nwhich is supplier management.\n\n299\n00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,260\nAs an IT Department, you probably\nare not making your own equipment, so\n\n300\n00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,080\nyou are gonna be purchasing these\nthings from outside, and so\n\n301\n00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,160\nwe've got supplier management involved.\n\n302\n00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,830\nThese are the eight processes that\nwe're gonna take a look at, and\n\n303\n00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,140\nthey all deal with what\nthe IT Department is responsible for.\n\n304\n00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,460\nSo, some of the things we talk about up\nhere, like identifying a process change.\n\n305\n00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,980\nWell, those don't really come into here.\n\n306\n00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,090\nAnd defining the requirements,\n\n307\n00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,250\nthose weren't in here either because\nthose are coming from outside.\n\n308\n00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,210\nWe step in with working\nwith those requirements and\n\n309\n00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,222\nimplementing the solution and that's where\nwe start to see all these processes.\n\n310\n00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:37,670\nSo, let's dive into the first one.\n\n311\n00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,380\n>> Sounds great\n>> The first one we've got on our list is\n\n312\n00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,120\nthe design coordination.\n\n313\n00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,190\nIf you let just a bunch of non-IT\npeople put their heads together and\n\n314\n00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,708\nstart to come up with a design, they're\nnot gonna consider things like servers,\n\n315\n00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,889\nbackups, availability, software.\n\n316\n00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,248\nThey're not gonna think of any of that.\n\n317\n00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,190\nThey're just gonna think of\nthe features that they want,\n\n318\n00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,280\nand that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n319\n00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,630\nBecause the service that you're offering\nat the end of the day, isn't supposed to\n\n320\n00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,510\nmake life easy for the IT department,\nit's supposed to make life easy for\n\n321\n00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,800\nthe people providing the core\nservices of your organization.\n\n322\n00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,980\nSo, having them not worry about\nthe infrastructure beneath this is\n\n323\n00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,400\nnot that big of a deal.\n\n324\n00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,096\nThe problem comes in where they don't\nunderstand actually the cost of what\n\n325\n00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:21,520\nthey're asking for.\n\n326\n00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,112\nSo, normally,\nwhen we do design coordination,\n\n327\n00:18:24,112 --> 00:18:27,507\nwe're kind of starting off with\nthis idea of come up with your wish\n\n328\n00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,230\nlist of the best possible\nsolution you could have.\n\n329\n00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,010\nLet us know.\n\n330\n00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,850\nLet us know exactly what it is you want.\n\n331\n00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,920\nCome up with just your dream solution.\n\n332\n00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,130\nWe'll take a look at it and\n\n333\n00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,970\nstart to figure out what that\ncost is gonna look like.\n\n334\n00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,900\nIf that's not shocking to you,\nif the costs and the time and\n\n335\n00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,560\nthe resources aren't shocking,\nthen we'll move forward.\n\n336\n00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,650\nBut if not, we may need to do a few\nrevisions of those requirements.\n\n337\n00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,610\nThere may be some things that you'd really\nlike to have, but they weren't critical.\n\n338\n00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,080\nAnd so, we can trim those off and\nstart to get it back in line.\n\n339\n00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,670\nThat can require a couple of reiterations.\n\n340\n00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,610\nAnd so, it's a good idea to have\na service design framework in place.\n\n341\n00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,050\nNow, ITIL is a framework, so you might\nbe wondering why another framework?\n\n342\n00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,170\nWell, this is gonna be\ncustomized to your organization.\n\n343\n00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,590\nIn your organization,\nwhat process do you wanna go through?\n\n344\n00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,610\nAnd what you might say is,\n\n345\n00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,990\nokay, whenever we design a new service,\nwe're always gonna start off\n\n346\n00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,610\nby having a brainstorming session with\nthe stakeholders without IT involved.\n\n347\n00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,790\nJust keep IT out of it, because I'm an IT\nguy, so I don't feel bad saying this.\n\n348\n00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,820\nBut IT departments as a whole\nwill generally be change averse.\n\n349\n00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,230\nThey don't like change, and\nso when there's new ideas,\n\n350\n00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,320\nespecially grandiose ideas,\nIT departments are not always on board.\n\n351\n00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,770\nThat's not always true.\n\n352\n00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,250\nDifferent people have different\napproaches to risk and change, but\n\n353\n00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,270\nIT departments as a whole aren't usually\nvery progressive, and it's a shame.\n\n354\n00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,520\nSo, you might have in your framework where\nyou say brain storming session without\n\n355\n00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,800\nthe IT department, and\nthen we'll take the results of that and\n\n356\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,190\nturn it over to the IT department for\nreview.\n\n357\n00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,940\nThen, we'll have another\nbrain storming session and\n\n358\n00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,480\nwe will include the IT department and\nwe'll start moving forward.\n\n359\n00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,990\nWe're setting the framework for\n\n360\n00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,380\nhow we design new services in our company\nregardless of what the service is.\n\n361\n00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,130\nJust here's the basic steps\nthat we're gonna follow.\n\n362\n00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,540\nSo, you find out what works out for\nyou and you put that in place.\n\n363\n00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,660\nNow, this leads us to\na couple of benefits.\n\n364\n00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,910\nWhen you've got that\nconsistent framework in place,\n\n365\n00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,440\nyou get a consistent design methodology.\n\n366\n00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,530\nEvery time somebody comes\nup with a new idea,\n\n367\n00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,650\nthey can anticipate what\nthey're gonna need.\n\n368\n00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,455\nSo, they say,\nhere's the information I need to gather.\n\n369\n00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:34,780\nCuz I know this first brainstorming\nsession is gonna come up, and\n\n370\n00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,770\nhere's how I get prepared for it.\n\n371\n00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,570\nThat consistency is really handy.\n\n372\n00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,340\n>> Sometimes,\nwhat will also end up happening,\n\n373\n00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,983\nis that you may choose instead,\nsay your team, your team, your team,\n\n374\n00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:49,655\nyou're gonna come up with different\ndesigns to help meet what we need.\n\n375\n00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:53,208\nAnd the coordination part is\nactually taking all those and\n\n376\n00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,670\ntrying to put them into some recognizable\npattern that we can then go at.\n\n377\n00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,170\nWell, that one we really don't like, and\n\n378\n00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,260\nthis one we don't like here, but\nwhen we established a framework,\n\n379\n00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,800\nwe're actually giving everybody\nthe same benefit of the doubt.\n\n380\n00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,906\nAnd saying, here's what we need to\ngo through to make sure that we get\n\n381\n00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:11,570\nthe proper coordination in the design and\nto achieve what we wanna do.\n\n382\n00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,470\nSo, having that and being able to have\nthis holistic service design is really\n\n383\n00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,400\nwhat we're trying to achieve so that\neverybody's on board in the same process.\n\n384\n00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,720\n>> Yeah, holistic service designing\nis specifically called out as\n\n385\n00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,660\na tool available from ITIL.\n\n386\n00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,680\nAnd, I mean, it's not a tool\nlike you hold in your hand.\n\n387\n00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,400\nBut a concept in your mind that\nhelps you to structure this.\n\n388\n00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,650\nHave you ever been to a brainstorming\nmeeting and it just deviated, it went way\n\n389\n00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:42,150\noff course, or started to fixate on\none particular aspect of the service?\n\n390\n00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,540\nThis happens a lot.\n\n391\n00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,430\nWhere you get usually contention, two\ndifferent groups that are in disagreement,\n\n392\n00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,870\nand all of a sudden, you have what should\nhave been a one hour meeting becomes\n\n393\n00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,850\na four hour meeting and you spend the\nwhole time discussing one design aspect.\n\n394\n00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,280\nSo, when you have a brainstorming\nsession like this,\n\n395\n00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,160\nyou need to be paying attention not just\nto one piece but really the whole thing.\n\n396\n00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,780\nAll the different aspects of that.\n\n397\n00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,910\nAnd so, holistic service design just takes\ninto account those different components.\n\n398\n00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,720\nSo, we've got things like\nthe service solution itself.\n\n399\n00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,970\nSo, we've got a new service or\nsome kind of changing service, and we need\n\n400\n00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,640\nsolutions for it and it might be that we\ndon't need to make this ourselves at all.\n\n401\n00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,360\nThat there's actually other people that\nalready sell a solution that we can just\n\n402\n00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,040\npurchase and that needs to be an option\non the table or we can make our own but\n\n403\n00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,400\nunderstanding some of the different\nsolutions that are available.\n\n404\n00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400\n>> We also have something that\nis a little bit more unusual,\n\n405\n00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,780\nthose are phrase that I think Tim uses, he\nsays, you don't know what you don't know.\n\n406\n00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,180\nSometimes, we may actually come to this\npoint where we take a look at a design and\n\n407\n00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,980\nwe go, what are we missing.\n\n408\n00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,420\nWhat don't we have?\n\n409\n00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,190\nWell, having the available tools necessary\nis also part of this service design too.\n\n410\n00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,445\nSo, being able to bring those proper tools\nin place, knowing where to go get them,\n\n411\n00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,785\nknowing what to do,\nis also part of this design process.\n\n412\n00:22:58,175 --> 00:23:00,615\n>> So, some of the other things called\nout in holistic service design.\n\n413\n00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:04,095\nWe've got our management\ninformation systems and tools.\n\n414\n00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:07,755\nSo, you may have software that helps\nyou with how to structure these.\n\n415\n00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,425\nOr you might even just have external\nconsultants that you can reference to\n\n416\n00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:12,495\npull data from.\n\n417\n00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:16,340\nA management information system,\nwe do normally refer to software.\n\n418\n00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,670\nBut it could be a database that's\nactually in a consultant's head,\n\n419\n00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:22,800\na subject matter expert,\nuse it like a database.\n\n420\n00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,940\nSo, you can rely on that knowledge\nas you start to structure this.\n\n421\n00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,820\nWe've got our technology and\nmanagement architectures.\n\n422\n00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,810\nSo, you've already gotten an architecture\nin place that you may follow for\n\n423\n00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,970\nother solutions and\nthat may be a viable solution here too.\n\n424\n00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,510\nReuse what you have when possible, don't\nreinvent the wheel if you can avoid it.\n\n425\n00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,160\nBut the real important one, in my opinion,\nis when you're designing a new service,\n\n426\n00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,037\nyou need to understand all of the\nprocesses that will be needed to create\n\n427\n00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:49,892\nthat service.\n\n428\n00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:54,209\nSo, for example,\nmaybe your organization has a brick and\n\n429\n00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:59,318\nmortar store, a physical building\nthat you sell your product from,\n\n430\n00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:04,269\nand you decide it's time to move\ninto To the Internet age, right?\n\n431\n00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:06,218\nSo you're going to create\na storefront on the web and\n\n432\n00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:08,520\nyou're going to start\nselling from the web.\n\n433\n00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,410\nSo what processes need to be in place for\nthat?\n\n434\n00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,680\nWell, we're going to have to have\nprocesses for changes to the website.\n\n435\n00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,360\nSo once the website is up,\nhow do we update pricing,\n\n436\n00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880\nhow do we update inventory, and so on.\n\n437\n00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,740\nWe've got to have processes for\npushing new processes to the website.\n\n438\n00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,850\nWe've got to have processes for\nchecking the orders and\n\n439\n00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,360\nmaking sure the payments were successful.\n\n440\n00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840\nAnd if a payment was declined,\nthat we do collections.\n\n441\n00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,240\nRight?\nThat's another process.\n\n442\n00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,420\nWe've gotta have a process in place for\nthe shipping side.\n\n443\n00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,700\nSomebody just placed an order,\nnow we've got to go stick it in a box and\n\n444\n00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,860\nmail it to them.\n\n445\n00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,280\nThese are all components that will be\nneeded to provide that one service.\n\n446\n00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,380\nSo the big idea people,\nthey come to you with the service and say,\n\n447\n00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,480\nwe want a web-front store.\n\n448\n00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,470\nAnd here's the requirements.\n\n449\n00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,160\nWe need to be able to\nsell all of our products.\n\n450\n00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,520\nWe need to be able to do coupons.\n\n451\n00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,240\nWe need to be able to have special,\nseasonal sales.\n\n452\n00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,377\nThey're thinking of the web-front, but\n\n453\n00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:03,115\nyou've got the the back end, the processes\nthat go into that and on the IT side,\n\n454\n00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,925\nwe're thinking, all right we're gonna need\nservers to host that and, if we host it in\n\n455\n00:25:06,925 --> 00:25:10,175\nour own facility we're gonna need\nredundant Internet connections and so on.\n\n456\n00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,705\nWe might wanna look at some external\nhosting, like a co-location facility to\n\n457\n00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:18,980\nget better redundancy, we're gonna need\nsome security and security audits.\n\n458\n00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,650\nThe web front end, that's a web server,\nbut it's gotta get data from somewhere.\n\n459\n00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,100\nSo now I need a database server.\n\n460\n00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,740\nThat's gotta be secured cuz I don't\nthe public to be able to get right to\n\n461\n00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,820\nthe database.\n\n462\n00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,490\nAnd so we're thinking about all of\nthose components on the back end,\n\n463\n00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,300\nand the processes that\nare gonna be required there.\n\n464\n00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,010\nBut there will be other members of the\nteam outside of IT who are thinking about\n\n465\n00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,920\nthings like shipping, and\nlogistics, and so on.\n\n466\n00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,620\nSo, we've got to make sure\nthat the areas get covered.\n\n467\n00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,960\nIf they start fixating over logistics and\nthey're neglecting the IT processes.\n\n468\n00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,820\nAnd then the brainstorming session ends,\nand it wasn't addressed.\n\n469\n00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,530\nPeople are leaving with\nthe wrong impression of\n\n470\n00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,380\nwhat needs to be done for the project.\n\n471\n00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,170\nAnd all of the processes need to be able\n\n472\n00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,500\nto add up to provide 100%\nof what the service needs.\n\n473\n00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,700\nIf any piece of it's missing then\nthe service is not complete and\n\n474\n00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,770\nit's likely going to fail.\n\n475\n00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,710\n>> Yeah, this is where it's actually\nalways good to have a goals list,\n\n476\n00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,970\nsome type of metric that's also\ninvolved in the design process itself.\n\n477\n00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,070\nSo that we know that when we come\nto the end of that meeting or\n\n478\n00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,550\nwhen we are in the mist of this that\nwe are actually starting to move\n\n479\n00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:27,370\neverything forward in the design\nprocess to meet the overall goal.\n\n480\n00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,930\nWithout some type of metric or\nmeasurement, well we're gonna be lost\n\n481\n00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,190\nbecause we can assume that something's\nbeen done when it hasn't, so\n\n482\n00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,280\nI like just at least a simple\nchecklist if nothing else.\n\n483\n00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,850\nA lot of times you may have even\nmore demanding metrics than\n\n484\n00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,830\nthat\n>> Yeah, and you guys may have heard of\n\n485\n00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,640\na smart analysis and ITIL mentions smart\nanalysis in the service design guy,\n\n486\n00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,550\nbut they actually kind of call it our for\nnot being enough.\n\n487\n00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,300\nBut, it is a very simple idea and.\n\n488\n00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,410\nAnd the SM,\nthe very beginning is the important part.\n\n489\n00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,140\nIt's an acronym.\n\n490\n00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,820\nActually I can't remember what\nthe whole thing stands for.\n\n491\n00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,130\nBut the S and the M.\n\n492\n00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,730\nSpecific and measurable.\n\n493\n00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,120\nWhen you create a service design,\n\n494\n00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,810\nhow do you know you've met\nthe requirements of that design?\n\n495\n00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,060\nEvery requirement that we have has\nto be specific so we can't interpret\n\n496\n00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,650\nit different ways, and it needs to be\nmeasurable so that we can go back and\n\n497\n00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,490\nfind out whether or\nnot we've actually met the requirements.\n\n498\n00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,590\nThat's really important to do and\nthat's part of our design phase.\n\n499\n00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,900\nIf you don't do it in the design phase,\nif you create it later on right?\n\n500\n00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,519\nSo now you're rolling, the project is\nin implementation at this point and\n\n501\n00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,220\nyou're like,\nwell we wanted the software to be fast and\n\n502\n00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,130\nin development it seemed fast enough.\n\n503\n00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,757\nBut we just had ten\ndevelopers in there and\n\n504\n00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:43,029\nnow that it's in production we got a few\nthousand users in there it's pretty slow.\n\n505\n00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:48,087\nWell we didn't take into account how\nwe were gonna measure performance and\n\n506\n00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:51,800\nso that kind of activity\nis really important.\n\n507\n00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,450\nProper planning will help us to\nsee the future effectively and\n\n508\n00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,460\ntake it into account\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n509\n00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,540\nBut if we don't do that, if we don't set\nthese metrics up, we end up in trouble.\n\n510\n00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,760\nSo those are some of the components\nwe need to be thinking about as\n\n511\n00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,610\nwe launch into this design coordination.\n\n512\n00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,382\nNow, we've got more to it,\nbut looking at the clock,\n\n513\n00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:16,240\nit's probably a good spot to stop, so\nlet's pause and take a breather, and\n\n514\n00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,435\nwhen we get back, we're gonna continue\non with design coordination after this.\n\n515\n00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:23,265\n[SOUND]\n\n516\n00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:28,927\nAll right.\n\n517\n00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:29,815\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n518\n00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:33,583\nSo we left off talking\nabout our service design.\n\n519\n00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:37,770\nAnd we were kind of focused\non design coordination.\n\n520\n00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,510\nAnd these are the early stages\nof the design of the service.\n\n521\n00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,920\nAnd by the time the IT department gets in\nwe're starting to take a look at it from\n\n522\n00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,180\nour perspective of what's going to\nbe required to provide this service.\n\n523\n00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,370\nAnd that leads us to our next idea,\n\n524\n00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,820\nwhich is a concept that ITIL\ncalls balanced design, right.\n\n525\n00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,240\nPart of what we're doing with this project\nis gonna be managing the resources that we\n\n526\n00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,340\nhave available to us, and making sure\nthat if we don't have enough resources\n\n527\n00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,440\navailable that we get them as\npart of this new service design.\n\n528\n00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,960\nNew services will often require\nadditional funding, additional employees,\n\n529\n00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,970\nadditional equipment.\n\n530\n00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,040\nThese are all things that we're going\nto need, we have to identify that.\n\n531\n00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,400\nSo to do that, we're really having to\nbalance across a couple of different\n\n532\n00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,920\nthings, different items.\n\n533\n00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,420\nSo that the first one is\nthe functionality, the requirements.\n\n534\n00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,820\nFunctionality just means what\nare services going to be doing?\n\n535\n00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,030\nAnd the more advanced that service is,\nthe more functionality it'll provide.\n\n536\n00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,270\nAnd the more resources and\ntime it's gonna take for us to do it.\n\n537\n00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,970\nSo we've gotta be able to figure out,\nwhat's that perfect mix?\n\n538\n00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,030\nWhen they come up with that dream\nsolution, it may offer tons of amazing\n\n539\n00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,630\nthings, But we trim some of them off\nto bring it back in line, right.\n\n540\n00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,040\nSo that's pretty much functionality and\nthen we've go out our others.\n\n541\n00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,920\n>> We have resources and\nwe also have scheduling.\n\n542\n00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,380\nSo when we talk about resources\nit's the people that we need\n\n543\n00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,870\nto make that design actually happen.\n\n544\n00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,190\nWe may find out that somebody\nsays here's what we want.\n\n545\n00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,950\nAnd we may figure out generically, here's\nthe resources that we need to have on to\n\n546\n00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,310\nbe able to do this, and then we realize,\nwe don't have the capabilities.\n\n547\n00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,945\nWe don't have that resource\ndirectly on hand, and\n\n548\n00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:20,910\nDon we may not even be able to\nafford that resource right then.\n\n549\n00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,170\nSo it could be something that really\ndoes tell us that, in this design,\n\n550\n00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,090\nit's really out of balance if we try\nto do this with the resources on hand.\n\n551\n00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,980\n>> Yeah, and remember by ITIL's definition\na resource, we normally think of people,\n\n552\n00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,070\nbut it can be money, or equipment,\ntechnology, it can be various things\n\n553\n00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,920\nbecause, if we wanna be cynical,\nwe can treat people as money, right.\n\n554\n00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,010\nA person has a salary or an hourly rate\nand that, that's the money, equipment.\n\n555\n00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,090\nYou buy it, it costs money.\n\n556\n00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,180\nSo most things can be\nrelated back to money.\n\n557\n00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,150\nSo you may treat resources as\ncost in your organization, or\n\n558\n00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,640\nyou may treat them as\nthe individual pieces.\n\n559\n00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,310\nWe normally think in terms of people,\n\n560\n00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,700\nbecause ITProTV is a service organization\nand so that's how we treat it.\n\n561\n00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,720\nYour organization may be the same way,\nright.\n\n562\n00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,840\nEverybody kind of treats\nit a little different.\n\n563\n00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,590\nBut that last one, schedule,\nthat's the same for everybody.\n\n564\n00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,880\nTime is time.\n\n565\n00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,000\nHow long is it gonna take to do this?\n\n566\n00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,020\nThe more requirements, right,\n\n567\n00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,920\nthe more functionality you're trying to\nget, the more time you're gonna need.\n\n568\n00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,730\nBut maybe you could shorten that\ntime if you had more people, right?\n\n569\n00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,870\nThese three are all interrelated.\n\n570\n00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,200\nThey create a triangle,\nwhere if you increase one,\n\n571\n00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,280\nit's gotta borrow from the others,\nand the analogy I always give.\n\n572\n00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,560\nI had a terrible car\nwhen I was in college.\n\n573\n00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,030\nAnd I had to take it to the mechanics\non a number of occasions.\n\n574\n00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,130\nAnd the mechanic I went to\nhad a sign in his repair bay.\n\n575\n00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,390\nAnd it said we do three\nkinds of jobs here.\n\n576\n00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,330\nFast, good, and cheap.\n\n577\n00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,490\nPick two.\nYou can only pick two.\n\n578\n00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,000\nIf you wanted it to be fast and\ngood, It wasn't gonna be cheap.\n\n579\n00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,344\nIf you wanted it to be good and\ncheap, it wasn't going to be fast.\n\n580\n00:31:57,344 --> 00:32:01,425\nThey all balanced each other,\nand you gotta pick two.\n\n581\n00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:05,065\nWell, that's the same thing we\nsee here in our balanced design.\n\n582\n00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:10,312\nIf you want a lot of functionality,\nwell you're gonna need some money,\n\n583\n00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:13,080\nyou're gonna need some resources.\n\n584\n00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,720\nBut if you don't have the resources,\n\n585\n00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,320\nyou can still get that functionality\nyou're just gonna need more time.\n\n586\n00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,740\nIf you want less time you need\neither to get more resources or\n\n587\n00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,850\nreduce your functionality to achieve\nit in a smaller amount of time.\n\n588\n00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,150\nThese three things are interrelated,\ntheir tied together and\n\n589\n00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,530\nwe're trying to find that balance.\n\n590\n00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,390\nAnd that's what we bring to\nthe table as the IT department,\n\n591\n00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,190\nwe're the ones that can actually\nattach a cost to the service.\n\n592\n00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,030\nWhat's this gonna cost us and\n\n593\n00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:44,210\nhow long will it take us to build out that\nservice when's it gonna be available?\n\n594\n00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,970\nBecause your company might be trying\nto react to a market condition.\n\n595\n00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,220\nA market condition that's happening\nright now and when you come in and say,\n\n596\n00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,790\nwell yeah we can build that service,\nit's gonna take us a year.\n\n597\n00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,520\nThen they're gonna look at that and\nsay, well you know what,\n\n598\n00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,770\nlet's do this,\nlet's just pay more money and\n\n599\n00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,030\nbuy the service externally from someone\nelse and that way we can have it tomorrow.\n\n600\n00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,830\nWe shorten the time by spending\nmore money or they say well okay,\n\n601\n00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,740\nyou know what, we're fine with that.\n\n602\n00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,440\nWe'll take the year, more time and\nwe'll get what we want.\n\n603\n00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,660\nwanted, but were going to miss that\nmarket condition so that's that\n\n604\n00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,000\nbalancing act that we have to play, and\nthat's a key part of service design.\n\n605\n00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n606\n00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,100\nSo in service design we\nestablish a framework and\n\n607\n00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,270\nwe also talk about the management of these\nthree balancing acts that we have to\n\n608\n00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,910\npull of on functionality,\nresources and time, But overall,\n\n609\n00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,545\nwe're really trying to create something\nwe call a Service Design Package or SDP.\n\n610\n00:33:37,545 --> 00:33:39,590\n>> Yeah, this is the hardest part so\n\n611\n00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,640\nfar design coordination has sounded pretty\neasy it's mostly negotiations, right.\n\n612\n00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,115\nBut the last part of design coordination\nis creating that SDP and the service\n\n613\n00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:54,555\ndesign package is really a collection of\nall of the data regarding that service.\n\n614\n00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:57,285\nAnd in my mind,\nI always think of a physical book,\n\n615\n00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,765\nit's normally like E documents and stuff.\n\n616\n00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:04,258\nBut you collect all the data your\nstrategies that you came up with yhat\n\n617\n00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:06,985\nkinda lead to this process being creative,\nthis new service.\n\n618\n00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:10,060\nYour design for\nhow you're going to create this service.\n\n619\n00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,100\nAll the status reports while you're doing\nintegration and as you do implementation.\n\n620\n00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,980\nAnd then even more documentation for how\nyou're going to the retirement when that\n\n621\n00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,720\ncomes, if you can do that\nto kind of peg that in.\n\n622\n00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,650\nSo you basically have the whole life\ncycle of that service from initiation\n\n623\n00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,490\nwhen we come up with the idea all the way\nto retirement when you get rid of it.\n\n624\n00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:35,530\nThat becomes part of that service design\npackage and in the service design section\n\n625\n00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,950\nthat's what we are coming up\nwith the whole life of it.\n\n626\n00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,030\nAnd we're trying to plan for that and\n\n627\n00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,780\nif you've got all that data together,\ngreat, wonderful.\n\n628\n00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,990\nYou can launch that service, and\n\n629\n00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,810\nyou've got a wealth of\ninformation collected together.\n\n630\n00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,820\nIf this is gonna be a massive endeavor,\nright.\n\n631\n00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,380\nIf this service is something\nthat's gonna take many,\n\n632\n00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,520\nmany years to complete your SDP\nwill likely be a living document.\n\n633\n00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,420\nYou may be doing like rolling\nwave planning where you plan for\n\n634\n00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,815\na few years out.\n\n635\n00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:08,165\nAnd then as you move forward in time,\nyou continue to plan out.\n\n636\n00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:11,548\nSo I might be planned out for the next\nthree years and then next year I plan for\n\n637\n00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:14,891\nthe fourth year, and two years from\nnow I plan for the fifth year, right.\n\n638\n00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:18,040\nSo I'm constantly moving ahead but\njust in smaller increments.\n\n639\n00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,350\nMost companies don't bother\nplanning beyond five years\n\n640\n00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,300\nbecause market conditions change,\nthat's why we have five year plans, right,\n\n641\n00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,280\nthat's why that's such a common term.\n\n642\n00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,310\nSo, we don't necessarily plan too far out,\n\n643\n00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,750\nif the service is gonna take a long,\nlong time to deploy.\n\n644\n00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,190\nMost companies these days don't get\ninvolved in long-term deployments like\n\n645\n00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,880\nthat, so it will happen much earlier and\nit becomes easier to plan for\n\n646\n00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,990\nthe whole thing.\n\n647\n00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,436\nService design package it's tough.\n\n648\n00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,990\nRight, we're gonna have\nour requirements in there,\n\n649\n00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,760\nthe service design, our organizational\nreadiness assessment, whether a company is\n\n650\n00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,320\nready to actually use and deploy this\nservice, and our service life cycle plan.\n\n651\n00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,810\nHow we're gonna manage that service\nfrom beginning to end, all in the SDP.\n\n652\n00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:05,030\nIt's probably the most challenging of the\nthings the ITIL wants us to create because\n\n653\n00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,130\nunlike project management, where you can\njust gather all your project documents and\n\n654\n00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,540\nstick them together here,\n\n655\n00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,450\nwe've got to have our ongoing\noperational information too.\n\n656\n00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,480\nThe processes, the steps that people\nare going to follow as they implement\n\n657\n00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,440\nthe service, it's a lot of information.\n\n658\n00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,810\nSo, but if you neglect it,\n\n659\n00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,630\nif you don't do it, you're gonna be\nrolling a service into your company that\n\n660\n00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,430\npeople don't have a full understanding\nof and people are gonna miss things.\n\n661\n00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,300\nPeople aren't going to follow\nwhat the original intent was and\n\n662\n00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,590\nyou set yourself up for failure.\n\n663\n00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,803\nAll right, so\nthat wraps up design coordination,\n\n664\n00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:39,840\nthe rest of the services mostly\ncenter around, kinda common sense.\n\n665\n00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,850\nBut the next one is one\nof my most favorite.\n\n666\n00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,710\nIt's service catalogue management.\n\n667\n00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,460\nYour company has a service catalogue.\n\n668\n00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,720\nThe catalogue consists of all\nthe services that your company offers.\n\n669\n00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,240\nIt's your catalogue of what you provide.\n\n670\n00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,910\nSo as part of design coordination, we\ncreate that catalogue if it doesn't exist.\n\n671\n00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,700\nIf this is our very first service,\nwe're creating a catalogue.\n\n672\n00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,190\nOtherwise, we maintain it,\nwe're adding to that catalog,\n\n673\n00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,970\nthe changes that we're\nimplementing this new services.\n\n674\n00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:10,250\nSo, we're keeping this catalog up to day,\nand we're also analyzing it.\n\n675\n00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:15,170\nMaking sure that if there's\noverlap between services,\n\n676\n00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,020\nthat we take advantage of\nthat whenever possible.\n\n677\n00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,910\nYou'll find that that's pretty frequent.\n\n678\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,200\nIf you have to bring up a new web page,\n\n679\n00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,420\nyou probably already have web\nservice from other services.\n\n680\n00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,386\nAnd you might be able to use those\nsame servers to reduce your costs,\n\n681\n00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:29,989\nbut this is where our integration\nplanning has to happen and\n\n682\n00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,560\nwe'll see that more in\nthe service integration section.\n\n683\n00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,830\nThe other thing we need to do is\nreview the catalogue to make sure that\n\n684\n00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,902\nthe services going in it actually\nmeet the needs of the company, right.\n\n685\n00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:44,810\nOur company has a strategy, and\nall of our services build to the strategy.\n\n686\n00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,930\nBut over time, that changes.\n\n687\n00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,350\nSo while we're maintaining that catalogue,\n\n688\n00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,910\nwe're putting changes in, our changes need\nto match up with the company's strategy.\n\n689\n00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,990\nAnd as we implement a new service,\n\n690\n00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,390\nthat may impact another service in a way\nthat makes it no longer meet our strategy.\n\n691\n00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,570\nSo we might want to phase that out.\n\n692\n00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,320\nYou see that especially true\nwhen your strategy changes.\n\n693\n00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,790\nSo your company may have been focused,\nlet's say four years ago your company\n\n694\n00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,670\nwas focused on cutting the bottom line,\nincreasing profit margins.\n\n695\n00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,830\nIt was a real hard time in\nthe economy four years ago.\n\n696\n00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,830\nSo a lot of companies did that.\n\n697\n00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,850\nThey tightened their belt,\nthey said let's put a hiring freeze in,\n\n698\n00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,850\nlet's do things to make sure we stay.\n\n699\n00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,210\n>> Afloat.\n\n700\n00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,310\n>> Viable?\nThere's an economic term for that.\n\n701\n00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,600\n>> Feasible.\n\n702\n00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n703\n00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,470\nWe can pay the bills, right?\n\n704\n00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,940\nSo make it so\nwe can say we paid the bills.\n\n705\n00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,790\nI can't remember it.\n\n706\n00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,190\n>> Yeah, me neither.\n\n707\n00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,380\n>> But, basically, you know,\nyou need it to stay that way.\n\n708\n00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,460\nWell, now, several years have passed and\nyour company is probably recovered and\n\n709\n00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,930\nnow you might be saying, hey,\nwe want to improve customer service.\n\n710\n00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,100\nWe know that's gonna cost us more money,\n\n711\n00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,380\nwe know it's gonna create a better\nexperience for our customer and\n\n712\n00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,750\nwe know that down the road\nthat will lead to more sales.\n\n713\n00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,250\nBut for right now we're gonna eat that\nexpense to make our company better and\n\n714\n00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,930\nthat goes against this previous\nstrategy that we might have and\n\n715\n00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,680\nso there might be services that\nare no longer in line with that,\n\n716\n00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,700\nservices we put in place specifically for\ncost-saving measures that need to go away.\n\n717\n00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,180\nSo maintaining that service\ncatalog is important,\n\n718\n00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,080\nespecially as we develop new services.\n\n719\n00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n720\n00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,140\nOh, Jason and David throw up\na couple of different terms for us.\n\n721\n00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,530\n>> Oh,\nsolvent was the one I was looking for.\n\n722\n00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,810\nThank you, David.\n\n723\n00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,700\n>> Jason threw up viable, which is fine.\n\n724\n00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,830\nSolvent is the one that\nwe were looking for.\n\n725\n00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,450\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n726\n00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,150\nNow, there's also,\nin this process of course,\n\n727\n00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:36,540\nthen what we need to do, is we may\nhave a lack in our service catalogue.\n\n728\n00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,300\nThere may be something\nthat we really do need.\n\n729\n00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,485\nSo in our service service catalog,\n\n730\n00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:44,885\nwe may take the time to actually identify\nwhat will complement the services that\n\n731\n00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:49,775\nwe're offering now, that would really\nhelp to add in that enhancing benefit, or\n\n732\n00:39:49,775 --> 00:39:54,020\nenhancing value to the customer\nthat we want to actually do.\n\n733\n00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,840\nwe want to actually provide for, so\n\n734\n00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,350\nwe wanna make sure that we also think\nabout that in the complementary ideas.\n\n735\n00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,038\n>> Now the last point I wanna\nmake on this is really important.\n\n736\n00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:06,089\nIn a previous show we talk\nabout a service portfolio and\n\n737\n00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:10,484\nhere we're talking about a service\ncatalogue and they sound really similar.\n\n738\n00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:11,674\nAll right.\n\n739\n00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:12,951\nBut they aren't actually different.\n\n740\n00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:16,156\nYour company can choose to implement\nITIL however they want, right,\n\n741\n00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:19,420\nit's not like ITIL,\nthe organization's gonna come audit you.\n\n742\n00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,365\nSo a lot of people change this,\nbut the service portfolio,\n\n743\n00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:29,185\nthose are the actual services that\nyour company offers right now.\n\n744\n00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:30,915\nThose are your live services.\n\n745\n00:40:30,915 --> 00:40:33,615\nAnd in your portfolio\nyou'll normally include\n\n746\n00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:36,525\nthe services that are in\ndevelopment right now too, right?\n\n747\n00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:40,556\nSo it's your existing services and\nthe services that are coming up.\n\n748\n00:40:40,556 --> 00:40:44,242\nRight, that's what's in\nyour service portfolio, but\n\n749\n00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:48,560\nin your service catalog you have\nall of your services, all right.\n\n750\n00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,290\nServices that you're thinking about but\nyou haven't moved forward on.\n\n751\n00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,680\nServices that you're actively\ndesigning that are coming up.\n\n752\n00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,350\nServices that are live in production, and\n\n753\n00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,130\nservices that have been retired,\nthe history of your company, right.\n\n754\n00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,650\nThe service catalog,\nunless your a brand new company,\n\n755\n00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,110\nshould be larger than\nyour service portfolio.\n\n756\n00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,650\nIf you're a brand new company, you're\nservice catalog and your service portfolio\n\n757\n00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:16,460\nwill match, right, cuz you'll have your\nlive services and your upcoming services.\n\n758\n00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,050\nThose two are gonna match, but\n\n759\n00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,990\nas your company moves on,\nthat's where you start to differ.\n\n760\n00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,550\nSo just remember that, the service\nportfolio, that's your actual business.\n\n761\n00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,162\nThat's live services,\nand what's coming up.\n\n762\n00:41:28,162 --> 00:41:30,840\nAll right,\nthat's what people pay the bills with.\n\n763\n00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,140\nAnd then the service catalog has all the\nextra data that's useful for analysis, and\n\n764\n00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,580\ninformation decision making, but doesn't\nactually impact the business today.\n\n765\n00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,360\nAll right, so there is a difference there.\n\n766\n00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,160\nSo when I mentioned earlier that if you\ndon't have a service catalog you might\n\n767\n00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,170\nneed to create one, well if you weren't\nfollowing ITIL practices before,\n\n768\n00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,360\nthen you might only be\ntracking your live services.\n\n769\n00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,570\nAnd so your service portfolio was fine,\nbut you've got to go back and\n\n770\n00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,410\nrecreate that service catalog with the\nmissing services that weren't in there.\n\n771\n00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,801\nSo that's service catalog management,\nit's just a subset of our service design.\n\n772\n00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,610\nAll right, let's tackle our next one here.\n\n773\n00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,180\nI think we've got enough\ntime to wrap this one in.\n\n774\n00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,360\nSo our next process is\nservice level management, and\n\n775\n00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,030\nI know we lead in to this in\nthe last show, right Ronnie?\n\n776\n00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,985\n>> Yep.\n\n777\n00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:21,250\nIn service level management, we're really\ntaking a look at what we call our service\n\n778\n00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,680\nlevel requirements and\nthen the service level agreements too.\n\n779\n00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,520\nAnd when we talk about taking a look\nat them, we mean creating and\n\n780\n00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,050\nthen making sure that\nthey're maintained as well.\n\n781\n00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,510\nThe service level agreement\nis the document or\n\n782\n00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,240\nthe contract between\nthe service provider and\n\n783\n00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,580\nthe customer, to actually say here is\nwhat we're going to be trying to do for\n\n784\n00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,810\nyou or we agree to do for you, and\nthe service level requirements, of course,\n\n785\n00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,060\nis the customer telling us here's\nthe requirements we would really like for\n\n786\n00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,430\nyou to do, and you negotiate out\nthat service level agreement.\n\n787\n00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,735\nSo creating and maintaining it, making\nsure that everything's up to date, and\n\n788\n00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:59,554\nthat we're providing what we need\nis where the management comes in,\n\n789\n00:42:59,554 --> 00:43:01,128\nto be able to negotiate those things.\n\n790\n00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:04,431\n>> And this is one that's kind of\nchanged over the years, because the term\n\n791\n00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:08,063\ncustomer can mean a lot of different\nthings, and so when we talk about the SLA,\n\n792\n00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:11,257\nthe service level agreement,\nthat is almost entirely between us and\n\n793\n00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,944\nour customer, which might be a type one,\ntype two, or type three customer, so\n\n794\n00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:18,500\nit might be an internal business unit\nthat we're providing the service to.\n\n795\n00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,540\nIt might be all of our business units,\ninternal business units,\n\n796\n00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,990\nthat we provide service to, or\nit might be an external customer,\n\n797\n00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,118\nthe person is actually\npaying us to do this stuff.\n\n798\n00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:29,855\nAnd so that service level agreement is\n\n799\n00:43:29,855 --> 00:43:33,870\nbasically a contract that we make with\nthem saying here's level of service.\n\n800\n00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,465\nThe, how much our system\nis going to be online.\n\n801\n00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:37,975\nHow fast it's gonna respond.\n\n802\n00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:41,025\nHow quickly we respond to failure and\nso on.\n\n803\n00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:41,705\nWe agree with that.\n\n804\n00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,265\nAnd there's usually a lot\nof negotiations there.\n\n805\n00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:48,295\nService level requirements, there's not\nnormally a lot of negotiations there.\n\n806\n00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,155\nThese are requirements.\n\n807\n00:43:49,155 --> 00:43:50,495\nWe've got to have these.\n\n808\n00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:53,270\nAnd a lot of times these\nwon't come from the customer.\n\n809\n00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,530\nThe customer, they may have requirements,\n\n810\n00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,080\nand we'll convert those over into\nour service level agreement.\n\n811\n00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,760\nSo that's where they represent, right?\n\n812\n00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,570\nSo they may start as a requirement,\nand shift over.\n\n813\n00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:08,445\nThe exception to that is when\nthe customer is actually referring to\n\n814\n00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,345\nnot somebody that's paying us money but\nthe government or\n\n815\n00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:16,685\nsome other standard that we follow\nthat's pushing a requirement to us.\n\n816\n00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,977\nNow, they're not actually\nusing our product, but\n\n817\n00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:22,932\nthey're giving us a requirement, and\nwe don't enter into a contract with them.\n\n818\n00:44:22,932 --> 00:44:25,027\nThey're forcing us to do it.\n\n819\n00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:31,060\nSo if there's a government regulation\nin place that says you've got to\n\n820\n00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,100\nmaintain backups of your documents for\nseven years, right?\n\n821\n00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,050\nThat's a service level requirement.\n\n822\n00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,170\nYou should be able to check\nyour data right now, and\n\n823\n00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,250\nhave seven years of history in there,\nall right?\n\n824\n00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,375\nAnd if you don't, you don't meet the\nrequirement, and your customers probably\n\n825\n00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:48,497\ndon't even know about it in terms of the\npeople that pay you for your business, but\n\n826\n00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:51,210\nthe government, were they were to\naudit you, whether it be a lawsuit or\n\n827\n00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,290\nwhatever, you didn't have\nthat seven years of data,\n\n828\n00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,998\nyou're in violation of the requirement,\nand you can't negotiate.\n\n829\n00:44:55,998 --> 00:44:57,990\nI mean,\nyou can go to court on that one, right.\n\n830\n00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,416\nSo sometimes the the requirements\nnegotiable and\n\n831\n00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,561\nwhen that happens it becomes an agreement.\n\n832\n00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:05,507\nBut if it's non negotiable,\nit stays a requirement.\n\n833\n00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:11,470\nAnd you'll see, I think I gave\nthe example of the bank didn't I?\n\n834\n00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,460\nI worked for a bank and\nwe were FDIC insured.\n\n835\n00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,305\nSo here in the US, the FDIC is a part\nof the Department of Treasury and\n\n836\n00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:19,680\nthey insure banks.\n\n837\n00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,020\nSo if a bank ever goes bankrupt then\n\n838\n00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,560\nanybody who had deposits in that bank,\nthey're insured.\n\n839\n00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,673\nThey can get their money from\nthe government because the bank\n\n840\n00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:29,635\ndoesn't have it anymore.\n\n841\n00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:31,200\nRight, so it's insurance.\n\n842\n00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,380\nSo we were FDIC insured, and\n\n843\n00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,270\nthe FDIC had service level\nrequirements that we had to meet.\n\n844\n00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:42,360\nIf we ever had a data failure in our bank\nwe had to have our systems back up in\n\n845\n00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,670\noperational to where people can withdraw\nmoney within 72 hours, so we had 3 days.\n\n846\n00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,950\nWe had to be back online.\n\n847\n00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,800\nIf we weren't,\nthen they would take over the bank.\n\n848\n00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,430\nWe'd lose control of the service.\n\n849\n00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,700\nSo that was a requirement,\nnonnegotiable, we had to meet that.\n\n850\n00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,410\nAnd so every service that we ever offered,\nif it impacted the customer's ability\n\n851\n00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,920\nto be able to withdraw funds, we had to\nbuild in a three day recovery period.\n\n852\n00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,115\nThat if anything failed, we had to be\nable to recover it within three days.\n\n853\n00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:15,135\nIf we couldn't,\nthen we couldn't offer that service,\n\n854\n00:46:15,135 --> 00:46:16,625\nso that was really important.\n\n855\n00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,815\nThat impacted a lot of what we did,\n\n856\n00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:22,275\nso service level management is where we\nstep in and we identify these things.\n\n857\n00:46:22,275 --> 00:46:24,575\nSo, they're super important, all right?\n\n858\n00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,015\nWith service level agreements,\n\n859\n00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:30,285\nthis is determining the agreement,\nnegotiating the agreement,\n\n860\n00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:33,960\ngetting it in place, monitoring it,\nand making sure that we live up to it.\n\n861\n00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,500\nRight?\n\n862\n00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,870\nWith a service level requirement, we get\nthe requirement from the customer, and\n\n863\n00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,670\nif it's negotiable,\nwe're converting it over to an SLA.\n\n864\n00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,500\nIf its not,\nthen we leave it as that requirement, and\n\n865\n00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,110\nwe go through and handle that.\n\n866\n00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:48,690\nAnd the activities that ITIL calls out,\nthere's define,\n\n867\n00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,990\nright, that's when we\nfigure out what it is.\n\n868\n00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,930\nDocument, we write it down.\n\n869\n00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,620\nYou'd think you wouldn't have to\nput this stuff down, but you do.\n\n870\n00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,710\nHow do you know what to live up to?\n\n871\n00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,770\nYou hire a new employee,\nhow do they learn about it?\n\n872\n00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,120\nYou got to document.\n\n873\n00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,130\n>> We also talk about agreement.\n\n874\n00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,560\nEnsuring both sides are actually\nsaying this is what's gonna be done,\n\n875\n00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,140\nthat makes sense.\n\n876\n00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,488\n>> Let me add one thing to agree.\n\n877\n00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:14,100\nRight, so you hit the main part, right.\n\n878\n00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,080\nBut there's one extra one that\nmight show up on the exam.\n\n879\n00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,240\nSo you've got to be in agreement\nwith the customers needs, right.\n\n880\n00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,830\nWhatever SLA you create or whatever\nhas to agree with their requirements.\n\n881\n00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,900\nBut it also has to agree\nwith your business strategy.\n\n882\n00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,430\nWe've used the term alignment a lot.\n\n883\n00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,610\nI don't think we've used\nthe term agree yet,\n\n884\n00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,630\nso this might be the first\ntime we've seen that.\n\n885\n00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:38,860\nITIL uses that word, agree,\nin a lot of points to reference aligning.\n\n886\n00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,191\nDo these SLAAs and SLRs, do they agree\nwith what our overall strategy is for\n\n887\n00:47:43,191 --> 00:47:45,800\nour company, our company's goals?\n\n888\n00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,310\nThis might not be something\nwe wanna get involved in,\n\n889\n00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:52,400\nbecause it puts undue burden on our\ncompany and doesn't really live up, so\n\n890\n00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,410\nwe might wanna pass on that business\nif that's the case, all right?\n\n891\n00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:58,770\nHopefully we can reach that agreement with\nthe customer, and that's the main part,\n\n892\n00:47:58,770 --> 00:47:59,710\nwhat Ronnie said.\n\n893\n00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,780\nBut just be aware of that other one, there\nis a time where you fail to agree, and\n\n894\n00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,420\nthat's just as important as\nwhen you succeed to agree.\n\n895\n00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,562\nOh, the next one's the most\ncommon sense one, right?\n\n896\n00:48:08,562 --> 00:48:09,729\nMonitoring.\n>> Yep.\n\n897\n00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:12,791\nYeah, monitoring of course is making\nsure that all the things that\n\n898\n00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:16,959\nwe agreed to That we're tracking and that\nwe're maintaining everything that's there.\n\n899\n00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:21,240\nAnd then, along with that of course,\nnaturally follows measuring.\n\n900\n00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,090\nVerifying that it's there, that we\nactually have metrics that we put in place\n\n901\n00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,390\nthat we know that we're hitting\nthose benchmarks that we need to.\n\n902\n00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,230\n>> And that seems confusing that\nwe have monitor and measure,\n\n903\n00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,280\naren't those the same?\n\n904\n00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,580\nWell, monitoring is just collecting data.\n\n905\n00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,180\nMeasuring is actually evaluating the data,\nright?\n\n906\n00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,230\nSo they kind of work hand in hand,\nwe usually do them together but\n\n907\n00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,757\nthey are separate activities.\n\n908\n00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:44,336\nReports, that's where we take the data and\n\n909\n00:48:44,336 --> 00:48:48,560\nwe convert it into a form that our\npeople can actually interpret.\n\n910\n00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,730\nIf we're monitoring things like\nserver performance reports,\n\n911\n00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:55,100\nwe might have huge\nspreadsheets that dictate,\n\n912\n00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,700\nhow many users were on the server\nevery one minute for hours on end?\n\n913\n00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,860\nAnd how much CPU utilization there was?\n\n914\n00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,520\nAnd how much RAM utilization?\n\n915\n00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,860\nBut at the end of the day,\npeople don't want to see all of that.\n\n916\n00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,149\nSo we might just summarize\nit all into an average.\n\n917\n00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:11,382\nAnd so here's our report that says hey,\n\n918\n00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:14,731\non average we had 300 people\non the site at any given time,\n\n919\n00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:19,520\nand on average, our server farm was\noperating at about 20% utilization.\n\n920\n00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,460\nSo those are numbers that people can grasp\na lot easier than a massive spreadsheet.\n\n921\n00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,284\nSo the reporting piece is important.\n\n922\n00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:30,160\nNow, when you agree,\nwhen you sign up for these SLAs or SLRs.\n\n923\n00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,660\nYou'll normally also agree\non that reporting plan.\n\n924\n00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,760\nHow often do you report\nthe information back?\n\n925\n00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,190\nAnd I know, I have had to set these up for\n\n926\n00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,420\na number of companies to\nwhere it was automated.\n\n927\n00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,580\nSo that you could verify the SLAs\nwere being met by simple reports, and\n\n928\n00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,750\nif they weren't, then you'd kick\ninto the punitive charges or\n\n929\n00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,480\nwhatever it was that you did\nwhen you violated an SLA.\n\n930\n00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,530\n>> Our last activity is\nthe process of reviewing, too.\n\n931\n00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,105\nWe've got to remember that because\ntime and functionality and\n\n932\n00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:02,748\nresources also change,\nthat what could end up happening is that\n\n933\n00:50:02,748 --> 00:50:06,726\nthe service level agreement no longer\nmeets the needs of the company,\n\n934\n00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:09,711\nrequirements from\nthe government may also change.\n\n935\n00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:13,778\nSo the last step here is review, which\nmeans that we wanna make sure that we go\n\n936\n00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:18,102\nover this with the customer, as well as\nwithin our own internal company strategy\n\n937\n00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:22,299\nto make sure that we're actually meeting\nthe service level agreement each and\n\n938\n00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:26,260\nevery time, and that we're actually\nup to whatever we need to be.\n\n939\n00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n940\n00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,230\nAnd things change.\n\n941\n00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,130\nYou might wanna change that agreement,\nand it could come from the customer.\n\n942\n00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,740\nIt could come from you internally.\n\n943\n00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,820\nIt could come from the government.\n\n944\n00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,650\nThere's things that can modify that.\n\n945\n00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,780\nSo while they're really important,\nand we kind of treat them as set and\n\n946\n00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,220\nstone, we may need to modify those.\n\n947\n00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,220\nSo you gotta keep that as an open minded\nand if you repeatedly fail an SLA,\n\n948\n00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,070\nyou need to evaluate why.\n\n949\n00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,748\nSo that's important.\n\n950\n00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:54,417\nThe other thing is if you're reviewing\nyour information, you can do trending, and\n\n951\n00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:55,550\nthat's kind of handy.\n\n952\n00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,190\nI know a great example of that.\n\n953\n00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:02,150\nWe always had an SLA that would define,\nhow long our backups could take?\n\n954\n00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:04,082\nAnd so we would say that at night,\n\n955\n00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:08,786\nwe could do backups in our non-peak time\nwhich was really like midnight to 4 AM.\n\n956\n00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:12,470\nAnd so our backups needed to\ncomplete in that four hour window.\n\n957\n00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,910\nSo we would do reporting on that, and\n\n958\n00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,380\nI can see that last week, maybe\nthe backups only took an hour and a half.\n\n959\n00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,850\nGreat.\nI'm well within the SLA.\n\n960\n00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,670\nI meet that amount of time, but if I look\nat the historical data I can go back.\n\n961\n00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,630\nAnd I can see where maybe it took\nan hour and a half two months ago, or\n\n962\n00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,480\nlet's say five months ago,\nit took an hour and a half.\n\n963\n00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,750\nAnd then, four months ago,\nit took two hours.\n\n964\n00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,390\nAnd three months ago,\nit took two and a half hours.\n\n965\n00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,750\nAnd two months ago, it took three hours.\n\n966\n00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,110\nIt's getting bigger each time.\n\n967\n00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,757\nAnd if I see that trend, I can follow\nthat trend out into the future.\n\n968\n00:51:45,757 --> 00:51:49,370\nAnd I can say well, that was a month ago,\nhow about a month from now?\n\n969\n00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,130\nIf we follow this trend,\nwhere are we gonna be?\n\n970\n00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,180\nAnd you can predict when\nyou're gonna violate the SLA.\n\n971\n00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,460\nThat's one of the real\nvalues of that review side,\n\n972\n00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,820\nand the reporting side, is that we can\npredict when we're gonna violate the SLA.\n\n973\n00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,870\nAnd we can take steps now to\nprevent it from happening.\n\n974\n00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,340\nMaybe I need to add more back up servers,\nadd more band width.\n\n975\n00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,290\nMaybe I need to clear out some archive\ndata to make the backup smaller,\n\n976\n00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:15,800\nwhatever it is,\nI need to do to get back in line so\n\n977\n00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,690\nthat my trend is not going up,\nbut back down.\n\n978\n00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,480\nOr I buy time to extend it another year,\nuntil we figure something else out.\n\n979\n00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,790\nSo you want to predict the future,\nand this is the way you do it.\n\n980\n00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,840\nWell, we've covered quite\na bit in this show and\n\n981\n00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,250\nI think this is probably a good spot for\nus to stop and wrap this one up.\n\n982\n00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,010\nSo let's just kind of\nrecap what all we hit.\n\n983\n00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,500\nWe kicked off the show just with our\ngeneral description of service design.\n\n984\n00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,760\nSo what is service design and\nwhat do we hope to achieve?\n\n985\n00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,740\nAnd then, there is the eight processes,\nand we've tackled the first three.\n\n986\n00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,110\nDesign coordination, which is all part\nof creating that original plan for\n\n987\n00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,130\nhow we are going to implement the service.\n\n988\n00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,320\nWe did service catalog management.\n\n989\n00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,980\nAs we create that catalog that\nindexes all of the different\n\n990\n00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,440\nservices that we've offered through\nthe life cycle of the company.\n\n991\n00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,270\nAnd then lastly,\nwe talked about service level management.\n\n992\n00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,380\nAnd the creation of those SLA's and SLR's.\n\n993\n00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,379\nHow we create them, monitor them, live up\nto them, and take action based on them?\n\n994\n00:53:16,379 --> 00:53:22,079\nBut we still have five more processes.\n\n995\n00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,275\nSo make sure you tune in for\npart two of service design,\n\n996\n00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:27,230\nwhich is gonna be coming up next.\n\n997\n00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:28,310\nBut for right now,\n\n998\n00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:32,670\nif you have questions on anything that\nwe have covered, make sure you ask.\n\n999\n00:53:32,670

00:00:38,090\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,130\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,870\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,080\n>> It is going well.\n\n7\n00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,910\nI'm going to take my camera tonight, go to\nsome old dusty jail, and just turn off all\n\n8\n00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,370\nthe lights, and use the infrared light so\nI can just walk around and see stuff.\n\n9\n00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,240\n>> Yeah, see stuff, like walls.\n\n10\n00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,900\n>> Walls.\n\n11\n00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,954\n>> Exciting.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n12\n00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:59,500\nwe don't have any paranormal\nactivity tonight.\n\n13\n00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,086\nBut we do have more ITIL to jump into.\n\n14\n00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:05,160\nSo that's what we're gonna be doing,\nis getting back into ITIL foundation.\n\n15\n00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,580\nWe're reaching out and\n\n16\n00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,490\npicking up where we left off on the\nservice design side of the ITIL framework.\n\n17\n00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,630\nAnd in the first episode, in part one,\n\n18\n00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,490\nwe tackled what service design was and\nsome of the initial processes.\n\n19\n00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,110\nAnd so\nwe're just gonna jump right back in and\n\n20\n00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,420\npick up with the next process in our list.\n\n21\n00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,980\nAnd that next process is\navailability management.\n\n22\n00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,380\nNow I wanna address one thing\nbefore we dive right into that.\n\n23\n00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,790\nThere's something that's\nreally easy to confuse here.\n\n24\n00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,970\nWe're gonna talk about availability, and\n\n25\n00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,760\nlater we're gonna talk about continuity,\nand those are easy terms to confuse.\n\n26\n00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,530\nSo when we talk about availability,\nwhat we're saying is,\n\n27\n00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,330\nwhat can we do to prevent\nfailures from happening?\n\n28\n00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,890\nSo if something goes wrong and our network\nis completely insulated and our users,\n\n29\n00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,680\nour customers never even experience it.\n\n30\n00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,340\nAvailability is all about\npreventing failure.\n\n31\n00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,800\nContinuity, on the other hand,\nthe failure has happened.\n\n32\n00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,270\nOur customer is impacted.\n\n33\n00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,570\nWhat steps do we take to\ncontinue doing business,\n\n34\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,020\nto stay operational even\nthough the failure occurred?\n\n35\n00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,980\nThe two go hand in hand, right?\n\n36\n00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,390\nYou don't normally just plan for\none and not the other,\n\n37\n00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,430\nbecause you can never truly\nprevent all failures.\n\n38\n00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,220\nSo there's no perfect availability\nsolution that's out there.\n\n39\n00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,540\nSo availability is being proactive,\nsteps we take before a failure.\n\n40\n00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,020\nContinuity is being reactive, steps we\ntake afterwards to react to a failure.\n\n41\n00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,490\nSo they're different ideas.\n\n42\n00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,380\nMake sure you don't\nconfuse them in your head.\n\n43\n00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,290\nYou know, the test questions\nare straightforward, but\n\n44\n00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,930\nif you mix up the terms, then you can\nchoose the wrong answer because of that.\n\n45\n00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,813\nSo these are easy to confuse, and\ndifferent vendors out there use these\n\n46\n00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:52,545\nterms almost interchangeably,\nand I hate that.\n\n47\n00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:56,320\nIn ITIL they're very specific about that.\n\n48\n00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,830\n>> Availability management, when we begin.\n\n49\n00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,350\nWe've talked in another episode\nabout service and about warranty.\n\n50\n00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,230\nRemember that service is the value\nthat we're trying to deliver.\n\n51\n00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,830\nWarranty is the fit for use, making\nsure that things are actually working.\n\n52\n00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,910\nAnd availability really falls more\nunderneath that category of warranty than\n\n53\n00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,200\nit does just about the service itself.\n\n54\n00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,210\nSo I want to make sure\nwe emphasize that too.\n\n55\n00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,630\n>> Yeah, you know, when a customer\napproaches us and we decide to offer a new\n\n56\n00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,640\nservice for them, or if we create\na service based on market demand,\n\n57\n00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,050\nwhen our customers come in they have\nan expectation of the service working.\n\n58\n00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,820\nIf I am a bank and I start to offer\nweb-based mortgage payments, so\n\n59\n00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,250\nyou can log in, check your account, and\npay your mortgage, the customer is going\n\n60\n00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,310\nto expect each month to be able\nto log in and pay their mortgage.\n\n61\n00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,080\nIt's a basic expectation.\n\n62\n00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,000\nAnd if they come and\nthe website is not available, or\n\n63\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,060\nthey can't log in to their account and\nthey try and call the help desk and\n\n64\n00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,125\nthe help desk is not available, then\nthey're not getting the functionality.\n\n65\n00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,450\nWe created it, and it may have worked\nat some point, but it's not working for\n\n66\n00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,460\nthem right now.\n\n67\n00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,550\nSo our product may not actually be fit for\nuse.\n\n68\n00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,041\nIt may not meet the requirements\nof the customer or\n\n69\n00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,250\nit may not just be available\nwhen the customer wants it.\n\n70\n00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,000\nSo are there steps that we could\nhave taken to handle that?\n\n71\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,790\nAnd the answer is yes,\nin the design phase.\n\n72\n00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,890\nWhen we're creating this new service,\nwhen we're designing the plan for how this\n\n73\n00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,490\nservice is going to be implemented, we\nneed to come up with an availability plan.\n\n74\n00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,128\nAnd it's gonna define exactly what\nwe're going to try and achieve.\n\n75\n00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:33,240\nNow you can't really do this\nuntil you have your SLAs.\n\n76\n00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,772\nWhat service lever are you trying achieve?\n\n77\n00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:39,660\nWhat would count as fit for use?\n\n78\n00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,840\nSo if,\nI think I used a hammer example before,\n\n79\n00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,250\nif our service is gonna be\nmanufacturing hammers, how many\n\n80\n00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,120\nnails should somebody be able to drive in\nwith that hammer before the hammer breaks?\n\n81\n00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,890\nWhat would be an acceptable number?\n\n82\n00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,711\nI have no clue.\n\n83\n00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:58,900\nIs it 100, is it 1,000, is it 10,000?\n\n84\n00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,790\nI've never broken a hammer, so I imagine\nthe number is really high, right?\n\n85\n00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,180\nSo if we manufactured a hammer that can\nonly be used 1,000 times, is that fit for\n\n86\n00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,590\nuse or are people going to be really angry\nwhen it breaks after 1,000 nails and\n\n87\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,890\nthey gotta go and buy a new one?\n\n88\n00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,995\nWe've got to evaluate that to figure\nout whether we are fit for use.\n\n89\n00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:16,395\nIf we know that number,\n\n90\n00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:20,705\nif we say it's gotta be 10,000 nails, then\nwe've gotta create an availability plan.\n\n91\n00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:23,325\nWe've got to use materials\nthat are strong enough to make\n\n92\n00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,567\nthat hammer survive those\n10,000 hits reliably.\n\n93\n00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,837\nKnowing that you'll have some outliers,\nmanufacturing flaws and defects.\n\n94\n00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,077\nThat's where your express\nwarranties come in.\n\n95\n00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:36,507\nBut otherwise,\nif a product is manufactured properly and\n\n96\n00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,530\nto quality,\nit should live up to that availability.\n\n97\n00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,730\nIn IT we're normally thinking about\nweb servers, database servers and\n\n98\n00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,380\nthat type of thing.\n\n99\n00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,460\nAnd the way we maintain availability\nis usually through redundancy.\n\n100\n00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,390\nThe best way to make a web\nserver available all the time\n\n101\n00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,210\nis to have a second one or\na third one or a fourth one.\n\n102\n00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,920\nAnd that way if one fails,\nthe others are still churning along.\n\n103\n00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,240\nYour end user never even notices,\nand you stay available.\n\n104\n00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,360\nAnother solution, though, would be\nto say I'll buy better web servers.\n\n105\n00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,442\nInstead of buying the cheapest\nserver that I can buy,\n\n106\n00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,200\nmaybe I'll buy a more expensive one.\n\n107\n00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,057\nThey'll use better parts,\nhigher quality equipment, and\n\n108\n00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:18,920\nthat'll ensure a larger MTBF,\nmean time between failure.\n\n109\n00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,086\nThat we can have that equipment\nrun longer without fail.\n\n110\n00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:24,045\nThere's different solutions that are here.\n\n111\n00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:27,920\nAnd remember, the failure can actually\nbe from any of a number of sources.\n\n112\n00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,790\nMaybe the failure's actually\ncaused by a hacking incident.\n\n113\n00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,650\nA hacker breaks into our web server and\nstarts messing with things and\n\n114\n00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,130\nnow our website's defaced and\nit's no longer functioning.\n\n115\n00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,600\nEven though the servers are up and\n\n116\n00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,350\nrunning, our service is\nno longer available, so\n\n117\n00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,540\nwe need to have security measures in\nplace to prevent the hacking attack.\n\n118\n00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,760\nThat's part of our availability plan.\n\n119\n00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,760\n>> Creating or\n\n120\n00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,050\nmaintaining that availability plan means\nthat we're also currently taking a look at\n\n121\n00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,510\nwhat we do have that's actually going to\nmake sure that the availability is there.\n\n122\n00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,700\nWe may find out that the servers that\nwe're running on, for example, are five or\n\n123\n00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,040\nmaybe ten years old, and\nrealize something that in the next year or\n\n124\n00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,460\ntwo, we've got to retire that server.\n\n125\n00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,160\nSo knowing what we're gonna achieve also\nneed to bring up in the future is part of\n\n126\n00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,580\nthat so that our customer doesn't lose\nany of the availability that they need.\n\n127\n00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,980\n>> You see this factor in with\ncapacity planning, right?\n\n128\n00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,900\nI think we talk about capacity next.\n\n129\n00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,190\nBut when you build out\nyour redundant web farm.\n\n130\n00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,570\nSo you might say, all right,\n\n131\n00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:32,490\nI've got enough customers right now to\nconsume the resources of two web servers.\n\n132\n00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,860\nSo I'm gonna bring up three.\n\n133\n00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,180\nI'm gonna bring up three web servers.\n\n134\n00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,270\nThat way if one fails, I still have two.\n\n135\n00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,660\nI still have enough to\ncover my current user base.\n\n136\n00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,375\nAnd so we can put that in place, and\nthat's a highly available solution, great.\n\n137\n00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:48,683\nBut as your company grows, as you get more\ncustomers, hopefully you're successful and\n\n138\n00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:49,900\nyou get more customers.\n\n139\n00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,180\nThat's what we all hope for.\n\n140\n00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,962\nAs you grow you find out that oh,\n\n141\n00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:56,333\nnow We actually consume\nthe resources of three web servers.\n\n142\n00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,170\nAnd so if one fails, my other two are up.\n\n143\n00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,530\nBut they can't handle\nthe load of all of my users.\n\n144\n00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,090\nAnd so while some users get in and\n\n145\n00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,850\njust have a slow experience,\nother users can't even get in.\n\n146\n00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,190\nSo now our availability needs\nchange as our company grows and\n\n147\n00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,210\nwe need to add to it.\n\n148\n00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,800\nSo we usually add some metrics and\nsay, all right.\n\n149\n00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760\nI'm gonna have three servers.\n\n150\n00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,000\nAs long as the utilization of all three\nservers stays at 50% then I'm fine.\n\n151\n00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,235\nOne server could easily take over the job\nof another server because they're at\n\n152\n00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,200\n50% utilization.\n\n153\n00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,830\nBut if I see my servers getting over that,\nnow I need to start adding more.\n\n154\n00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,120\nAnd so we set a metric to grow our\navailability requirements over time.\n\n155\n00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,100\nSometimes that's easy to do.\n\n156\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,110\nSometimes that's very challenging.\n\n157\n00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,550\nYou might not be able to have\na simple formula like that.\n\n158\n00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,630\nAnd in that scenario you have\nto set up a series of reviews.\n\n159\n00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,790\nReview, check you availability solutions.\n\n160\n00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,560\nIs it still meeting the needs\nof what you set up originally?\n\n161\n00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,360\nAnd update as necessary.\n\n162\n00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,089\nThat's a big part of\navailability management.\n\n163\n00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,730\nThe other thing is, you may\n\n164\n00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,560\nhave built an availability solution when\nyour company was configured one way.\n\n165\n00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,290\nBut over time you have changes.\n\n166\n00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,730\nNew services start to get offered.\n\n167\n00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,670\nEquipment, people,\ntechnology start getting repurposed or\n\n168\n00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,210\nsplit tasks to work on more than\none thing at the same time.\n\n169\n00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,610\nAnd now some of the extra capacity we\nhad before that we didn't worry about\n\n170\n00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,720\nhas got consumed.\n\n171\n00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,290\nAnd so anytime a change is being proposed.\n\n172\n00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,180\nWhen we're in this design phase for\nthat change.\n\n173\n00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,040\nWe have to evaluate the impact\nthat that's going to create on\n\n174\n00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,750\nany of our availability\nsolutions in place right now.\n\n175\n00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,810\nSo going back and\ndouble checking that with any change.\n\n176\n00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,370\n>> One of the things about\nthe availability management is\n\n177\n00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,360\nto always try to be proactive about what\nis actually going to be the best solution\n\n178\n00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,560\nthat we're going to need to\nprovide to ensure availability.\n\n179\n00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,820\nIt's not, remember the reactive side,\n\n180\n00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,290\nit is just saying here are all\nthe things that we can put in place.\n\n181\n00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,130\nAnd this is our chance to do that.\n\n182\n00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,040\nSo with the design ready to go,\n\n183\n00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,870\nwe want to make sure that we're\ntaking the steps necessary.\n\n184\n00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,350\n>> And if a failure does occur,\nthat's where continuity kicks in, right?\n\n185\n00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,690\nBut that doesn't mean we just\ngive up on availability either.\n\n186\n00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,340\nIf a failure does occur,\nit just means you missed something.\n\n187\n00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,490\nYou didn't factor something in.\n\n188\n00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,950\nOr maybe you did, and you just couldn't\nget the funding to take care of it.\n\n189\n00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,140\nThat happens, right?\n\n190\n00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,650\nSometimes management will look at it and\n\n191\n00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,980\nsay you know, I understand that\nwe can prevent a failure here,\n\n192\n00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,575\nbut it doesn't make financial sense\nto spend the money to prevent it.\n\n193\n00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:32,510\nWe'd actually lose less money by just\nletting the failure happen and fix it.\n\n194\n00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,940\nSo that could happen.\n\n195\n00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,220\nAnd in those situations,\nwhether you just overlooked it or\n\n196\n00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,490\nwhether it was purposefully ignored for\nother reasons.\n\n197\n00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,150\nWhen the failure happens, the availability\nteam needs to look at that and\n\n198\n00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,510\nsay, all right,\nlet's analyze the service failure.\n\n199\n00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,940\nLet's see what caused this and\n\n200\n00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,250\nnow we can find out where there steps\nwe could have taken to prevent it.\n\n201\n00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,350\nMaybe it is worth it now, now that your\ncompany has seen what happens in an actual\n\n202\n00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,550\noutage may be all of a sudden it is\nworth it, that happens all too often.\n\n203\n00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,280\nOr you can look at it and say, why\ndidn't our availability techniques work?\n\n204\n00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,740\nWe thought we had these covered,\nhere is the failure, what happened, right?\n\n205\n00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,150\nAnd you can start to analyze it there.\n\n206\n00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,950\nSo the availability team during a failure,\nthey're not the ones responsible for\n\n207\n00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,380\nfixing it or getting us back and running.\n\n208\n00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,130\nThey're analyzing to see how\ncan we prevent that later on.\n\n209\n00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,250\nIt's always proactive actions.\n\n210\n00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,200\nAvailability is always\nlooking to the future.\n\n211\n00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,720\nSo we're gonna talk about\ncontinuity a little bit later.\n\n212\n00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,260\nWhich is not looking to the future.\n\n213\n00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,140\nIt's looking to the now.\n\n214\n00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,070\nAnd I kind of wanted to cover that next\nbecause they're so closely related.\n\n215\n00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,010\nBut I'm following the order in\nthe service design manual, and\n\n216\n00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,900\nthe next one ITIL hits\nis capacity management.\n\n217\n00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,506\nSo, we're going to talk about\ncapacity management now, and\n\n218\n00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,520\nthen we'll jump back to continuity.\n\n219\n00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,620\nBut as far as availability,\nit sounds pretty simple, right?\n\n220\n00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,620\nBut it is actually one of the more\nchallenging processes that we have to go\n\n221\n00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,280\nthrough, because you're trying to\nanticipate failures that out there and\n\n222\n00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,000\ncover your bases and\n\n223\n00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,600\nevery little bit of availability you\nintroduce has a cost associated with it.\n\n224\n00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,750\nSo there's a financial\naspect that has to occur.\n\n225\n00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,220\nYou have to do a cost-to-benefit ratio.\n\n226\n00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,960\nWhat does it cost to\ncreate this availability?\n\n227\n00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,430\nAnd what's my benefit for doing that?\n\n228\n00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,280\nAnd so we'll talk about business\nimpact analyses later, or BIAs, and\n\n229\n00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,190\nthat's a great way to be\nable to find that out.\n\n230\n00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,390\nBut I'll tie that into continuity\na little bit later and we'll see that.\n\n231\n00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,050\nBut a lot of companies like amazon.com,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,940\nThey have a web-based online store.\n\n233\n00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,550\nThey have no physical stores.\n\n234\n00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,450\nIf their website goes offline,\nthey lose over a million dollars an hour.\n\n235\n00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,860\nSo if I were to tell them, hey,\nwe could put this redundancy in here and\n\n236\n00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,260\nit'll cost you $500,000.\n\n237\n00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,345\nThat might sound like a lot of money but\nto them they say, it's a no brainer,\n\n238\n00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:50,890\ncuz if we had the outage it would cost\nus a million dollars an hour, we'll make\n\n239\n00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,800\nthat up in half an hour of an outage,\nright, by avoiding the outage altogether.\n\n240\n00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,380\nCompanies need to look at it that way.\n\n241\n00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,820\nThere's other ones you hear about it\nin automotive industry all the time,\n\n242\n00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,300\nwhere the manufacturer knows about\na flaw in the car and they say well,\n\n243\n00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,820\nit will cost us this amount\nof money to do a recall, or\n\n244\n00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,160\nwe could just let a few people by and\nwe'll settle it out of court.\n\n245\n00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,080\nAnd the settlements will cost us\nthis amount, and that's cheaper.\n\n246\n00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,800\nSo, we'll just go that route.\n\n247\n00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,520\nRight?\nThere have been several movies and\n\n248\n00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,900\ndocumentaries and stuff on this.\n\n249\n00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,970\nIt's a true thing.\n\n250\n00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,940\nWe do that cost to benefit\nanalysis to find out.\n\n251\n00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,130\nWhat those guys don't factor in is the\npublic relations side which has its own\n\n252\n00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,440\ncost, it's just not money.\n\n253\n00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,280\nWell, it ends up being money.\n\n254\n00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,179\n>> Reputation.\n>> If your customers leave you, yeah.\n\n255\n00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,195\n>> So that all factors in.\n\n256\n00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:37,127\nSo that's pretty much it for availability\nmanagement, it's pretty straight forward.\n\n257\n00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:42,505\nAll right,\nour next process is capacity management.\n\n258\n00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:46,165\nAnd we talked a little bit about capacity\nin an earlier segment just as it was\n\n259\n00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:52,703\nrelated to kind of our strategies,\nbut here it's all part of planning.\n\n260\n00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:56,569\nAs we're doing our service design,\nas we're creating the service,\n\n261\n00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,320\nwe have to figure out what levels\nof capacity we're gonna provide.\n\n262\n00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,630\nIf we're providing an online\nmortgage payment website.\n\n263\n00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,012\nHow many customers do we expect\nto be using that at any one time?\n\n264\n00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:12,110\nThat's gonna influence the amount of\nequipment and resources that we need, and\n\n265\n00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,430\nthe way we plan availability.\n\n266\n00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,180\nThis is really important.\n\n267\n00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,903\nIf we're designing software in-house,\nhow many developers are we going to need?\n\n268\n00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:21,420\nHow many QA and\nQC people are we going to need?\n\n269\n00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,032\nHow many testers?\n\n270\n00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,040\nWe've gotta figure out\nthe resources that we need.\n\n271\n00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,820\nAnd that all comes down\nto capacity planning.\n\n272\n00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,622\nOnce the service is implemented,\n\n273\n00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:34,110\nwe need people to manage that capacity and\nto ensure that we're meeting demand.\n\n274\n00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,490\nAnd it was demand where we\nreally talked about this before.\n\n275\n00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,740\nYour customer demand,\nwe've got to live up to that.\n\n276\n00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,430\nAll right.\n\n277\n00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,480\nSo capacity management is one\nof those interesting ones.\n\n278\n00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,670\nIt really is active in every\nsingle part of our life cycle.\n\n279\n00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,260\nIt's in service strategy, service design,\nservice implementation or integration.\n\n280\n00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,310\nAll of that deals with capacity\nin one way or another.\n\n281\n00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,190\nAll right.\n\n282\n00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,680\nBut in design, this is the chance\nwe have to anticipate and\n\n283\n00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,680\ncreate the proper capacity\nbefore it becomes a problem.\n\n284\n00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240\nAll of the other ones center\naround just dealing with it.\n\n285\n00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,310\nHere's our chance to make sure\nit's implemented properly.\n\n286\n00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,400\n>> A lot of times when\ncompanies first start up and\n\n287\n00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,890\nthey start offering services,\nThey may not consider the impact\n\n288\n00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,400\nthat 10,000 people going to a web site is\ngoing to cause their servers any problem.\n\n289\n00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,410\nSo they end up getting a little bump\non a television show that says,\n\n290\n00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,190\ngo here to find out more.\n\n291\n00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,400\nAnd now their web site got hit\nwith 100,000 views in an instant.\n\n292\n00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,770\nAnd their server is no longer available.\n\n293\n00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,070\nSo they didn't plan for the capacity, if\nthey were going to do something like that.\n\n294\n00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,660\nActually be able to host\nsomebody visiting their servers\n\n295\n00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,610\nto make sure that everything\nwould actually still be up and\n\n296\n00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,090\nrunning, while they were\nactually having this big push.\n\n297\n00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,708\n>> Or maybe it's a product, right?\n\n298\n00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:52,428\nI think,\nin that demand segment in the other show,\n\n299\n00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,030\nI mentioned like Apple's iPhone.\n\n300\n00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,850\nWhenever they launch a new phone they know\nthat they're going to get a ton of sales\n\n301\n00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,375\nRight there in the first month.\n\n302\n00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,999\nSo before they announce a phone,\n\n303\n00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:05,422\nthey always do a ramp up where they\nbuild up a huge amount of inventory,\n\n304\n00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,160\nknowing they'll sell it out, and\nthen they go into pre-orders and stuff.\n\n305\n00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,550\nSo they plan for that bump in capacity and\nthey'll always have\n\n306\n00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,690\nmore phones in inventory at that\npoint at launch than they will at\n\n307\n00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,758\nany time in the rest of the life cycle\nof that product that they're selling.\n\n308\n00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,732\nSo it's all about planning for\nthat capacity.\n\n309\n00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,850\nWe've gotta understand\nthe needs of our customer,\n\n310\n00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,560\nand there's other things that change that\ntoo, like seasonal demand and so on.\n\n311\n00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,661\nSo having the right capacity\nin place at the right time but\n\n312\n00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:33,286\nnot having wasted capacity.\n\n313\n00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,550\nYou don't wanna have a bunch of people\njust sitting around doing nothing.\n\n314\n00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,590\nBut you keep them because you know\nyou're gonna need them one day, right.\n\n315\n00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,340\nYou wanna be able to have\nthat adjust as needed.\n\n316\n00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,880\nSo, we create and\nmaintain a capacity plan, right?\n\n317\n00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,420\nWe draw up our plan and we maintain it and\n\n318\n00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,660\nwe update it over time, but the hard\npart is really the monitor and evaluate.\n\n319\n00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,340\nWe've gotta keep an eye on that plan.\n\n320\n00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,460\nSo that we can tell when it's\nliving up to what we wanted it to,\n\n321\n00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,370\nor when it might be falling short.\n\n322\n00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,078\nOr if potentially we see that in\nthe future it's gonna fall short.\n\n323\n00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:07,034\nThen we have that opportunity to\nget in there and change things.\n\n324\n00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:11,545\n>> Yeah, another part of it also is when\nit doesn't meet up to the expectations\n\n325\n00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:13,430\nthat we've raised.\n\n326\n00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:19,680\nWe may have, during the design, not\nconsidered the demand that was on hand.\n\n327\n00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,230\nAnd then, at that point,\n\n328\n00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,950\nwe may not even be able to see why we're\nin the issue that we're in right now.\n\n329\n00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,330\nAnd we may not be able to\nfigure out what the cause is.\n\n330\n00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,000\nSo the design, while we're actually\nin the design process, is better for\n\n331\n00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,080\nus to go through.\n\n332\n00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,130\nThink about every possibility of\nwhatever demands are actually put in and\n\n333\n00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,410\nhave those steps in mind\nbefore we actually proceed.\n\n334\n00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,910\n>> Now, when you're dealing\nwith capacity management,\n\n335\n00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,550\nwe have the four Ps of\ncapacity management.\n\n336\n00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,640\nI know it seems like we have four Ps for\neverything.\n\n337\n00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,530\n>> Yes.\n>> That is confusing, but\n\n338\n00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,418\nhere what we're talking about are our\npeople, processes, products, and partners.\n\n339\n00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,166\nAll right?\n\n340\n00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:02,251\nAnd each of these are the things\nwe need capacity for, people.\n\n341\n00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:06,120\nIf I'm providing some kind of\nservice that is not a tangible good,\n\n342\n00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,240\nI guess even in a tangible\ngood environment.\n\n343\n00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,210\nBut your service is typically going to\nneed people to perform the service.\n\n344\n00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,090\nRight?\nTo provide that service, and\n\n345\n00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,910\nwe've gotta make sure we have\nthe adequate amount of people, so\n\n346\n00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,060\nthis is like human resources.\n\n347\n00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,210\nProcesses, well, I mentioned this earlier\nin, was it this show or the last show?\n\n348\n00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,850\nBut when we design a service,\nwe've gotta make sure we have\n\n349\n00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,850\nall the processes in place\nto provide that service.\n\n350\n00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,100\nIf we leave out even one,\nthe service is nonfunctional.\n\n351\n00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,130\nIt doesn't provide what\nwe want it to provide.\n\n352\n00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,680\nSo we gotta make sure we have\nthe right processes in place.\n\n353\n00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,632\n>> We can also talk about products too.\n\n354\n00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:44,638\nWe wanna make sure that the product\nthat we have is really demanded.\n\n355\n00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:47,948\nWe also wanna make sure, of course,\nthat we have enough of them on hand.\n\n356\n00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:51,190\nWe also wanna make sure that the products\nare good, so of high quality too.\n\n357\n00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,260\n>> Yeah and when we say products for\nIT, it's normally technology.\n\n358\n00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,930\nNot a cell phone, but\na website people can log into,\n\n359\n00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,580\nor email as a service, or whatever.\n\n360\n00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,640\nSo in those scenarios it's not\nlike we have an actual inventory.\n\n361\n00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,430\nWhen I think of an email server I\ndon't think of an inventory like,\n\n362\n00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,792\noh I've got a hundred mail\nboxes I can use, right?\n\n363\n00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,520\nI think in terms of performance.\n\n364\n00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,450\nI've got this much CPU power, I've got\nthis much disk IO available, right?\n\n365\n00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,760\nAnd that's what I'm measuring.\n\n366\n00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,672\nSo product for us really does\nbecome resources on our servers.\n\n367\n00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:28,580\nAnd then last one our partners, and the\npartners are normally suppliers, right?\n\n368\n00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,213\nPeople that are supplying\nus with equipment,\n\n369\n00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,340\nother services that we use, right?\n\n370\n00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,015\nOther related things, so\nthey're people that we partner with, and\n\n371\n00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:41,025\nany time you buy something from somebody,\nyou're partnering, right?\n\n372\n00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,815\nYou're exchanging money to them in\nexchange for them providing a product that\n\n373\n00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:46,715\nyou need to perform whatever it\nis that you're trying to perform,\n\n374\n00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:50,545\nso that's a partnership, and\nyou count on them to be available.\n\n375\n00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:54,055\nSo we've gotta make sure that we've got\npartners that can support that, right?\n\n376\n00:19:54,055 --> 00:19:58,970\nUsing Apple as an example again,\nif they want five million cellphones,\n\n377\n00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,730\nthey get the glass for\nthat screen from one company.\n\n378\n00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,750\nThey get the LCD itself\nfrom another company.\n\n379\n00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,450\nThey get memory from a third company.\n\n380\n00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,690\nThey need partners that can all\nprovide the same level of inventory.\n\n381\n00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,720\nIf can get six million screens, but I can\nonly get four million battery chargers,\n\n382\n00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,870\nwell now I've got two million\nscreens that I can't sell right now\n\n383\n00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,680\nbecause I don't have all the components.\n\n384\n00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,180\nSo, aligning all those various partners to\nmake sure you've got that capacity match.\n\n385\n00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,318\nThat's where all of this comes in.\n\n386\n00:20:26,318 --> 00:20:29,910\nThese four Ps are the things that impact\nthe level of capacity that we can provide.\n\n387\n00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,020\nSo that's capacity\nmanagement in a nutshell.\n\n388\n00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,110\nAnd in the design phase, we're evaluating\nwhat level of capacity we want at launch.\n\n389\n00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,770\nRight?\n\n390\n00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,220\nAnd then we're trying to anticipate\n\n391\n00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,280\nthe capacity we'll need under\ncertain circumstances in the future.\n\n392\n00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,000\nAnd so part of capacity management\nthere is creating a plan to say, okay,\n\n393\n00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,100\nwe know that in the winter time our\nservice will be in more demand, right?\n\n394\n00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,670\nFor whatever this is.\n\n395\n00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,640\nMaybe we're creating a service for\nairline bookings, right?\n\n396\n00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,090\nA web page you can login and\nbook your airline flights.\n\n397\n00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,120\nSo we know that around the holiday\nseasons that's gonna get really busy.\n\n398\n00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,280\nSo, we create a plan that says,\nall right, during that time,\n\n399\n00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,960\nwe're not gonna add more people or\nmore partners, but\n\n400\n00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,150\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna have\nvirtual servers that we can scale out.\n\n401\n00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,800\nWe can spawn more servers as we need them,\nand then when we don't,\n\n402\n00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400\nwe can just kinda trim them back down.\n\n403\n00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,100\nAnd we can use a service like\nAmazon Web Services or Windows Azure or\n\n404\n00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,040\nsomething like that to give us\nthat dynamic server growth.\n\n405\n00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,060\nWe put that plan in place and\nwe establish it.\n\n406\n00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,390\nIt's not set in stone, we can always\nrevise that if our needs change.\n\n407\n00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,425\nBut, we do the plan so\nthat we understand our cost down the road.\n\n408\n00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:37,150\nAll right?\n\n409\n00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,270\nA big mistake a lot of people make\nis they plan capacity at launch,\n\n410\n00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,800\nand they set their\nfinancial values to that.\n\n411\n00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,040\nAnd then when they're planning\nthe budget for the next year,\n\n412\n00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,350\nthey're setting their budget to cover\nthe same capacity they provided at launch.\n\n413\n00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,630\nWell, every company hopes to grow.\n\n414\n00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,899\nIf your company doesn't grow,\n\n415\n00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,350\nit's just a matter of time\nbefore your company ends, right?\n\n416\n00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,440\nCuz you'll definitely shrink.\n\n417\n00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,680\nVery few people have\na fixed customer base.\n\n418\n00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,720\nSo as your company grows,\nyour capacity is decreasing.\n\n419\n00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,250\nYou're gonna run out sooner or later.\n\n420\n00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,100\nAnd so you've gotta plan for that.\n\n421\n00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,660\nYou don't wanna just set that\nsame budget year after year.\n\n422\n00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,360\nAll right, so\nthat's basically capacity management.\n\n423\n00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,490\nAgain, another pretty straightforward and\ncommon sense example.\n\n424\n00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,300\nAll right,\nnow we can jump into continuity.\n\n425\n00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,130\nBut looking at the clock,\nthis segment is about run out.\n\n426\n00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,430\nSo let's stop here and take a break.\n\n427\n00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,355\nWhen we get back, we're gonna\ntalk about continuity management,\n\n428\n00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:31,519\nsome of the stuff that we\nneed to be aware of there.\n\n429\n00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,165\nWhich all compliments the availability\nside that we talked about a moment ago.\n\n430\n00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:38,544\nSo stay tuned we'll be back with\ncontinuity in just a moment.\n\n431\n00:22:38,544 --> 00:22:45,961\n[MUSIC]\n\n432\n00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:47,401\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n433\n00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,652\nSo we're ready to jump into\nour next process, which is,\n\n434\n00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,219\nI just call it continuity.\n\n435\n00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:56,131\nBut the full title is IT service\ncontinuity management, or\n\n436\n00:22:56,131 --> 00:23:00,280\nITSCM is how you'll see it\nabbreviated in most places.\n\n437\n00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,320\nAnd the reason it's got that\nlong name is they wanna\n\n438\n00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,510\nmake sure you understand that this is the\nIT service that we're worried about here.\n\n439\n00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,540\nThere's other aspects of the service that\nkind of get out of the realm of IT that we\n\n440\n00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,640\nmight not be able to deal with.\n\n441\n00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,640\nSo, if this is a web based\ne-commerce store, the web servers,\n\n442\n00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,410\nthe databases, that's stuff that\nwe can plan for continuity.\n\n443\n00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,480\nBut the shipping, that's logistics, right?\n\n444\n00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480\nThat moves outside of the IT department,\n\n445\n00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,904\nso we're focused on the IT side of\ncontinuity management, all right?\n\n446\n00:23:30,904 --> 00:23:33,230\nSo what is continuity management?\n\n447\n00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,410\nWell continuity, the word is based\non the same roots as continue.\n\n448\n00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,250\nAnd the idea is that if a failure happens,\n\n449\n00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,650\nhow do you continue to do business even\nwith that failure In place, all right.\n\n450\n00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,667\nSo it's our back-up plan,\nour plan B if you will, all right.\n\n451\n00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,475\nSo plan A is things are running great,\n\n452\n00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:54,500\nplan B, here's what we do if things aren't\nrunning great and how we can keep going.\n\n453\n00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,878\n>> So we plan for capacity.\n\n454\n00:23:56,878 --> 00:24:01,672\nWe try and do as much as we can, but there\nare still things we can't account for.\n\n455\n00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:06,470\nThings like servers failing or hard\ndrives failing, the connection provider,\n\n456\n00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,890\nthe internet service provider may fail\nwhere we can't get access to them.\n\n457\n00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,980\nAnd so even if we have all the capacity\nin the world in our servers,\n\n458\n00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,720\nthere are other elements\nthat we can't account for.\n\n459\n00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,120\nSo we come now to this continuity\nplanning to help us out.\n\n460\n00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,660\n>> Now, hopefully we've taken\nsteps to ensure availability.\n\n461\n00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,190\nAnd remember from\nthe beginning of the show,\n\n462\n00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,190\navailability is making sure the problem\ndoesn't happen in the first place or\n\n463\n00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,700\nif it does that it\ndoesn't impact us at all.\n\n464\n00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,090\nSo redundant servers redundant\nhard drives, like RAID arrays,\n\n465\n00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,630\nredundant power supplies, redundant ISPs,\nthese are all part of availability..\n\n466\n00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,530\nThese are what are gonna make sure\nthat even though a failure happens\n\n467\n00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,150\nwe keep going.\n\n468\n00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,630\nAnd so people refer to that as high\navailability in a lot of cases that if\n\n469\n00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,560\na failure happens you don't see it,\nit's just invisible.\n\n470\n00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,330\nBut when that doesn't happen, when the\nfailure is visible, when our services get\n\n471\n00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,740\naffected, we need continuity, a backup\nplan, something to go and replace that.\n\n472\n00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,520\nNow, the trick is figuring out\nwhen to do one versus the other.\n\n473\n00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,530\nHow do I know when I should\nworry about availability\n\n474\n00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,800\nversus when I should deal with continuity?\n\n475\n00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,040\nThe two kind of go hand in hand.\n\n476\n00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,480\nIn theory if you had a absolutely\nperfect availability plan,\n\n477\n00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,510\nyou would never need continuity and\nin theory you could not worry about\n\n478\n00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,770\navailability at all and just have a locked\ntight continuity plan and you'd be fine.\n\n479\n00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,300\nSo you could go one way or the other\nexclusively, but you're counting on a lot\n\n480\n00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,210\nof stuff there, a lot of perfection\nthat's probably not going to happen.\n\n481\n00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,750\nSo we're normally get\na balance in-between.\n\n482\n00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,970\nSome resources go to availability,\nsome resources go to continuity.\n\n483\n00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,800\nSo finding that balance\nis the tricky part and\n\n484\n00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,690\nthere's a few ways that that can be done.\n\n485\n00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,750\nAs an IT person we set up a lot of\nsystems, a lot of servers, databases,\n\n486\n00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,160\nweb servers, and so on.\n\n487\n00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,280\nBut we don't necessarily get involved\nin the actual business of our company.\n\n488\n00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,300\nSo, I used to work for\nan insurance company, and\n\n489\n00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,370\nat the insurance company, at no point,\n\n490\n00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,270\nat no point whatsoever did I ever talk\nto a customer, one of our insured.\n\n491\n00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,410\nI never sold an insurance policy,\nso I never\n\n492\n00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,490\nactually participated in the true service,\nthe core service that our company offered.\n\n493\n00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,710\nI participated in\nthe supporting services and\n\n494\n00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,800\nfrom the supporting side, every thing\nI worked on was important to me.\n\n495\n00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,970\nAll the web servers I touched were\nimportant, all the data base servers,\n\n496\n00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,310\nall of that stuff to me was important.\n\n497\n00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:42,390\nBut to the core services they may not\nbe so we have identify what part, what\n\n498\n00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,010\nare our supporting or ancillary services\nare actually critical to the core.\n\n499\n00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:53,915\nAnd the best way to find that is to bring\nan outsider, to bring in a consultant,\n\n500\n00:26:53,915 --> 00:26:59,090\na auditor, to come in and perform what's\ncalled a business impact analysis.\n\n501\n00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,930\nNow if you have a risk management team,\nthey'll often do the BIA for you,\n\n502\n00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,410\na business impact analysis.\n\n503\n00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,416\nBut if you don't, you just bring\nin somebody from the outside.\n\n504\n00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:10,860\nIn the banking industry we\nusually brought in KPMG or\n\n505\n00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,850\nsomebody like that to come and\nevaluate our environment.\n\n506\n00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,820\nAnd what they did is they would basically\ncatalog all your systems, all of your\n\n507\n00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,430\nservers, all of the software that you ran,\nand they would break it down and\n\n508\n00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,780\nsay alright if this server failed,\nwhat systems would stop working?\n\n509\n00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,150\nWhat processes would stop working?\n\n510\n00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,790\nMaybe there's a server that failed and\nno processes stopped working.\n\n511\n00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,840\nIn that case, it's a non-critical server,\nyou don't worry about it.\n\n512\n00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,930\nBut there might be another one that failed\nand it caused the website to go offline.\n\n513\n00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,280\nAll right, but if the website is offline,\nwe might still be able to handle\n\n514\n00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,160\nwithdrawals and issue mortgages so you\nmight still be able to do other things.\n\n515\n00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,220\nSo they'll identify what are the critical\nsystems, the systems that you really\n\n516\n00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,640\nneed to be online to be making money and\nthe systems that\n\n517\n00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,770\ndon't need to be online because they don't\nimpact your bottom line, you making money.\n\n518\n00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:04,210\nOf the ones that are critical, they say\nokay if this server were to go off line\n\n519\n00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,110\nhere's how much money\nyou would lose per hour.\n\n520\n00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,520\nThis is the business impact.\n\n521\n00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,650\nIf that server were to go off\nline here's the dollar signs,\n\n522\n00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,780\nhere's how much it;s going to cost you.\n\n523\n00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,550\nAnd based on that,\nyou'll learn two things.\n\n524\n00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,270\nOne, you learn which\nservers are truly critical.\n\n525\n00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,250\nThese are the ones that you need to\nhave the most effort put in to make them\n\n526\n00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,850\nhighly available.\n\n527\n00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,960\nYou want them to avoid a failure in\nthe first place because their critical.\n\n528\n00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:36,850\nAnd if they do fail, you wanna have a lock\ntight continuity plan, a backup, a plan B\n\n529\n00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,260\nso that you can still resume business\nin the event your availability failed.\n\n530\n00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,310\nAnd you identify the non-critical servers,\nand\n\n531\n00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,550\nthese guys maybe I don't\nworry about availability.\n\n532\n00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,070\nSo if they fail, it's bad, but\n\n533\n00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,180\nit's not that big of a deal, we can always\nfix it and bring it back up online.\n\n534\n00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,200\nAnd then maybe we don't worry about\na plan B on this one, because, again,\n\n535\n00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,760\nif it fails,\nthen we just restore from backup or\n\n536\n00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760\nsomething simple like that and\njust deal with it.\n\n537\n00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,360\nIt's nothing critical, right?\n\n538\n00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,870\nSo that's the first thing that this tells\nus is which servers we need to be planning\n\n539\n00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,660\nfor, for our systems.\n\n540\n00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,560\nAnd then secondly, the dollar signs.\n\n541\n00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,960\nThat helps us to gauge how much we spend.\n\n542\n00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,920\nIf a service fails and\n\n543\n00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,230\nit's gonna cost us twenty dollars an hour\nthat's probably not something we're gonna\n\n544\n00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,620\ntake a lot of action on to get corrected\nbecause it's just not a lot of money.\n\n545\n00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,320\nBut if a service fails and it costs\nus twenty thousand dollars an hour\n\n546\n00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,330\nit's worth it for us to spend a few\ngrand to build in some extra redundancy.\n\n547\n00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,270\nOr if it's gonna cost us\na million dollars now, or\n\n548\n00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,560\nit makes us first to spend hundreds\nof thousands of dollars to make that\n\n549\n00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,920\navailable and\navoid the failure in the first place.\n\n550\n00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,450\nSo, the BIA, the business impact\nanalysis that's what steers us\n\n551\n00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,870\nto where we should focus where we\nshould be making things available.\n\n552\n00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,600\nThe BIAs will normally focus\non existing services, and\n\n553\n00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,130\nso every time you introduce a new service,\nyou kind of have to reevaluate it.\n\n554\n00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,000\nHow's this impact or\nwhat are the impacts of this one?\n\n555\n00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,450\nSo BIAs are things that you'll perform\non a regular basis and it's tough for\n\n556\n00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,160\nus to perform them internally, especially\nas IT guys cuz we don't necessarily\n\n557\n00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,120\nunderstand the true core service\nthat our company provides.\n\n558\n00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,180\nAll right, so that's a BIA.\n\n559\n00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,880\nAnd based on the information from\nthere we'll create usually two things,\n\n560\n00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,510\na business continuity plan and\na business resumption plan.\n\n561\n00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,460\nNow the BRP and the BCP.\n\n562\n00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,570\nA lot of people get these confused but\nthere is a difference between them.\n\n563\n00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,630\nThe business continuity plan\nsays if there's a failure\n\n564\n00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,450\nwhat steps do we need to take\njust to keep doing business?\n\n565\n00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,690\nThat means that we may\nstill have the failure.\n\n566\n00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,610\nWe may not be at full capacity but\nat least we could still do business.\n\n567\n00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,240\nMaybe I have a call center that has 500\nsales reps in it that are answering\n\n568\n00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,390\nphones or support reps or whatever\nanswering phones and talking to customers.\n\n569\n00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,770\n500, and I say all right,\nif something happens and\n\n570\n00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,210\nall those phones go dead in that\ndata center, in that call center,\n\n571\n00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,610\nI might have another call center\nsomewhere else with a 100 reps and\n\n572\n00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,660\nif the main call center fails\nI've still got my other one.\n\n573\n00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,720\nBut it's only got a hundred reps so\nI'm at a much lower capacity but\n\n574\n00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,680\nI can still do business.\n\n575\n00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,010\nI'm continuing, right?\n\n576\n00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,560\nSo a BCP is like a band-aid,\nwhat can we stick on this problem\n\n577\n00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,075\njust to get us by until we can really\nfix it and get back to full test?\n\n578\n00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:33,570\nIf you're lucky your BCP might\nactually maintain full capacity but\n\n579\n00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,990\nnormally it results in\na degraded performance at least.\n\n580\n00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,600\nYou fail back the servers in another\nlocation like might be a little older or\n\n581\n00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,660\nwhatever, so you may see a decrease.\n\n582\n00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,640\nSome people plan for this very, very\nwell like the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n583\n00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,112\nTheir disaster recovery site it's actually\nthe same equipment as in production so\n\n584\n00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,250\nwhen they fail over you don't even\ndon't even see a performance degrade.\n\n585\n00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,500\nSo their BCP, it's not just a band-aid,\nit keeps them at full capacity.\n\n586\n00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,060\nIt's really awesome.\n\n587\n00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,980\nBut if you're a small or medium size\ncompany, that comes at a price and\n\n588\n00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,870\nyou may not be able to do that.\n\n589\n00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:11,200\nSo the BCP we draft first, and that's\njust to keep us going during the failure.\n\n590\n00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,570\nThe BRP, the Business Resumption Plan.\n\n591\n00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,830\nThat's saying, okay we've got the failure.\n\n592\n00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,104\nHow do we fix it to get back to 100%?\n\n593\n00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:24,680\nHow do we resume business as normal?\n\n594\n00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:30,110\nHow do we get back into that to where\nit's like the failure never happened?\n\n595\n00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,270\nAnd that can be a more protracted event.\n\n596\n00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,460\nThat might take longer than we needed.\n\n597\n00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,670\nSo I mentioned earlier the FDIC\nhad given us that three day limit.\n\n598\n00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:41,410\nThat was just to be able to limp along,\nto handle withdrawals.\n\n599\n00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,050\nThat we could take two weeks, if we wanted\n\n600\n00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,935\nto bring other aspects of our business\nback in line., it'd be costing us money.\n\n601\n00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:49,265\nWe wouldn't want that, right?\n\n602\n00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:53,775\nBut we could have taken longer,\nso your BRP is typically longer\n\n603\n00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,735\nin time frame than your BCP\ncuz you're getting everything,\n\n604\n00:32:56,735 --> 00:33:01,172\neven your noncritical systems\ngetting them back up in operation.\n\n605\n00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:05,752\n>> With these in hand, we also want\nto take a look at the management of\n\n606\n00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:10,622\nthe impact that's gonna happen if\nthings do change, as well as make\n\n607\n00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:14,682\nsure that we put in place the measures\nthat will help increase the availability.\n\n608\n00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,112\nBy taking all this\ninformation that we have,\n\n609\n00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:22,640\nwere now putting it into a plan that says,\nhere's what we need to do to now ensure\n\n610\n00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,000\nthat the continuity is gonna continue,\nwhether it's at a less state or if we can\n\n611\n00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,690\nactually do New York Stock Exchange-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n612\n00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,450\n>> Have complete parity, that state.\n\n613\n00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,650\nBut this is where we begin is we\nwanna manage our entire design\n\n614\n00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,850\nto make sure that we handle it that way.\n\n615\n00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,760\n>> And if you're implementing a change,\nthat change is gonna impact this.\n\n616\n00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,440\nWe may have to introduce new measures\nto provide that availability.\n\n617\n00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,220\nWe might, not be impacting us at all.\n\n618\n00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,610\nSo we've gotta evaluate that, and\nkeep that documentation up to date.\n\n619\n00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,820\nAll of these things, the BCP,\nthe BRP, they contain tons of\n\n620\n00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,030\ndata instructions that say,\nhere's how you get back in business.\n\n621\n00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,550\nSo those instructions change as your\nsystems change, as you upgrade servers,\n\n622\n00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,820\nas you replace equipment.\n\n623\n00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,340\nMaybe you had all Cisco routers one year,\nand\n\n624\n00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,480\nthen two years,\nlater you switched to all Juniper routers.\n\n625\n00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,370\nThe routers are performing\nthe same function,\n\n626\n00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,670\nmaybe they're at the same IP addresses and\nso on.\n\n627\n00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,570\nBut during a disaster,\n\n628\n00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,020\nyou might have in your BRP some steps that\nyou should be putting in static routes,\n\n629\n00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,090\nand the commands are different on\nCisco than they are on Juniper.\n\n630\n00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,300\nSo we need to update that\nto reflect those changes.\n\n631\n00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,900\nIt is really important that\nwe keep those up to date and\n\n632\n00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,220\nthat we put in any additional\nmeasures that are necessary.\n\n633\n00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,350\nWe may find though, that there are times\nwhere, it doesn't make sense for\n\n634\n00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,630\nus to put the measures in for ourselves.\n\n635\n00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,500\nThey are too expensive or\nwe may not have the capability,\n\n636\n00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,980\nin those scenario you got to\nreach outside the company.\n\n637\n00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,360\nAnd when you reach out side, what you are\ngonna be doing is entering into contracts\n\n638\n00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,160\nwith other organizations\nto help offset this.\n\n639\n00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,660\nThe most common form is simply insurance.\n\n640\n00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,660\nInsurance says, we are not gonna dump\na ton of money into preventing this.\n\n641\n00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,290\nSo if it happens, we want somebody\nelse to absorb the cost of a failure.\n\n642\n00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,650\nSo I know,\nI'm gonna be losing $20,000 an hour.\n\n643\n00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,051\nSo I go and buy an insurance policy\nthat says, if a failure does happen,\n\n644\n00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:12,051\nthey'll insure me for $100,00.\n\n645\n00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:14,613\nBut I give you five hours,\nthat'll buy me five hours of time,\n\n646\n00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,490\nwhere I won't lose that money cuz I\nget an insurance payment instead.\n\n647\n00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,350\nOther options though, maybe you\nwant to have a remote data center,\n\n648\n00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,710\na disaster recovery center,\nsomewhere else.\n\n649\n00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,670\nBut you don't want to build a building,\ndo redundant power supplies, generators,\n\n650\n00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:32,520\nall of that stuff, it's expensive and\nit requires a lot of maintenance, so\n\n651\n00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,670\nyou might contract out\nwith a hosting provider.\n\n652\n00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,130\nSomebody who will provide you racks inside\nof their data center that's already\n\n653\n00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,450\nhighly redundant and all of that.\n\n654\n00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,850\nAnd you just throw your\nservers in there and go or\n\n655\n00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,510\nmaybe they're not even physical servers,\nmaybe they're virtual servers.\n\n656\n00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,150\nWe use Amazon web services or Windows\nAzure or somebody to host virtual machines\n\n657\n00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,980\nthat mirror our production environment,\nand we can flip over to when we want.\n\n658\n00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,450\nThe cool thing about the contracts,\na lot of times you can negotiate them, so\n\n659\n00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,130\nthat you're only paying for\nthe servers when they're used.\n\n660\n00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,100\nThat's how Windows Azure and\nAmazon web services work.\n\n661\n00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,190\nThe physical data centers, they normally\nhave to charge you no matter what cuz\n\n662\n00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,950\nyou've got the service in there,\nthe consuming power and so on.\n\n663\n00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,190\nBut with Azure and Amazon,\nyou can shut all those servers off.\n\n664\n00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,870\nAnd then when you have a failure you can\njust bring them up, it takes a moment, and\n\n665\n00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,010\nyou're back in business.\n\n666\n00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,040\nSo you contact the other people\nto get that functionality.\n\n667\n00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,760\nIn today's technologies, in today's world,\neven a small company can\n\n668\n00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,605\nafford a good bit of redundancy that\nwould have been a dream years ago.\n\n669\n00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:35,365\nNow, it's pretty easy to achieve.\n\n670\n00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:40,360\nSo that in a nut shell is the IT\nservice continuity management.\n\n671\n00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,695\nIt's a lot of planning,\nit does boil down to budget.\n\n672\n00:36:45,695 --> 00:36:49,625\nThe anecdote, I always give is\nI use to be a field consultant.\n\n673\n00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,700\nI'd go out to various companies and\nhelp them with their design and plans.\n\n674\n00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,184\nAnd there was this question,\nI always loved to ask it,\n\n675\n00:36:56,184 --> 00:36:57,696\ncuz I always got the same answer.\n\n676\n00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:00,915\nAnd I thought it was funny,\nis if you went to a CIO or\n\n677\n00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:04,446\nany executive within the company,\nand you said okay,\n\n678\n00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:09,237\nthis is the service that you offer, and\nhow available do you want it to be?\n\n679\n00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:10,130\nAnd they would say, what do you mean?\n\n680\n00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,440\nAnd I would say well,\nif a customer comes to your site.\n\n681\n00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,670\nWe want to guarantee to get to it.\n\n682\n00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:20,420\nWhat percentage of down time or how much\ndown time do you think is acceptable?\n\n683\n00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,580\nThey would say well, none.\n\n684\n00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,828\nI want it to be available all the time.\n\n685\n00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:26,034\nI would say, okay,\nwe can certainly do that,\n\n686\n00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:29,420\nwe can create a design where\nyou would have zero down time.\n\n687\n00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,176\nWhat does your budget look like?\n\n688\n00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:33,090\nCuz this is gonna cost\nmillions of dollars,\n\n689\n00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,440\nyou don't even have to\nwork out the math on it.\n\n690\n00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,060\nIf you want a zero downtime environment,\nit's gonna cost millions of dollars.\n\n691\n00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,200\nI can guarantee you.\n\n692\n00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,020\nSo then they look at it and they go,\noh okay, well now, we're thinking money.\n\n693\n00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,980\nIt really comes down to how much are you\nwilling to spend to create availability?\n\n694\n00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,740\nFinding that balancing point and\nthen you go and\n\n695\n00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,850\ndesign from there, and that financial side\nas an IT guy, we don't normally know it.\n\n696\n00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,130\nI don't know,\nif we can't sell mortgages right now,\n\n697\n00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,910\nI have no idea how many mortgages we sell\nin an hour or a day or a month, right?\n\n698\n00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,120\nSo that's where we have\nto rely on other people.\n\n699\n00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,290\nOther people in the organization to put\nthis data together and then we act on it.\n\n700\n00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,510\nAnd they say, okay, it makes sense for\n\n701\n00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:18,680\nus to spend about $200,000 to create\na highly available environment.\n\n702\n00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,986\nHow much availability can you give us for\nthat $200,000?\n\n703\n00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:27,430\nAnd we can say, okay we can keep it\ndown to about eight minutes per year.\n\n704\n00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,980\nWith this model in place, this solution we\nkeep down to about eight minutes per year.\n\n705\n00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,690\nIf it's a failure here in our center,\n\n706\n00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,290\nwe can just flip over to\nother servers instantly.\n\n707\n00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,330\nNo down time.\n\n708\n00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,180\nIf it's a big failure like\nthe whole data center.\n\n709\n00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,400\nIt would take us about eight\nminutes to jump to the other one.\n\n710\n00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,750\nAnd we can do that for $200,000.\n\n711\n00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,520\nThat's acceptable,\nwe achieve it, and we move on.\n\n712\n00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,560\nAnd each year we just reevaluate that.\n\n713\n00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,370\nDoes it make sense to\nkeep spending that money?\n\n714\n00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,610\nDoes it make sense to increase it or\ndecrease it based on changes?\n\n715\n00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,846\nWe just evaluate, but\n\n716\n00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:57,760\nin our design phase we're building\nthat initial level of continuity.\n\n717\n00:38:59,709 --> 00:39:04,545\nAll right, the next process that we need\nto jump into is security management,\n\n718\n00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:07,760\ninformation security management.\n\n719\n00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,610\nThis is kind of a given, every\nservice that your company offers, and\n\n720\n00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,600\nit doesn't matter what kind of company you\nare, every service you offer has data,\n\n721\n00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,870\nhas information.\n\n722\n00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,910\nAnd some of that information\nis not something you want to\n\n723\n00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,900\ndisseminate to the public.\n\n724\n00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,010\nIt is a rare, rare service where every\naspect of it is publicly available.\n\n725\n00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,720\nAnd so were gonna have to take\ncertain security measures\n\n726\n00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,430\nto ensure that information is protected.\n\n727\n00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,759\nNow technically,\n\n728\n00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:41,500\navailability and continuity fall\nunder the envelope of security.\n\n729\n00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,838\nSo for those of you who may be security\ncertified, Security+, CISSP, CASP,\n\n730\n00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,725\nsomething like that, you probably\nlearned these all under the realm,\n\n731\n00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:52,640\nunder that one hood- But\nITIL breaks it out.\n\n732\n00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,580\nAvailability, continuity,\ninformation security.\n\n733\n00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,780\nThey're kind of separate components.\n\n734\n00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,840\nSo make sure you don't try and\nmerge all those on the exam.\n\n735\n00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,020\nBut we just need to make sure that\nour data is safe and protected.\n\n736\n00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,310\nAnd it really boils down to managing risk.\n\n737\n00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,130\nSo what is risk?\n\n738\n00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,450\nWell, if you know anybody who's a risk\nmanager, and there's MBA programs and\n\n739\n00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:19,580\nstuff that focus just on risk, it's\nsimply calculating the probability and\n\n740\n00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,770\nimpact of something bad happening.\n\n741\n00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,140\nOr of something good happening,\nthere are good risks too, right?\n\n742\n00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,340\nThe probability impact,\nhow likely is it to occur?\n\n743\n00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,670\nAnd if it does occur,\nhow much is it going to cost us?\n\n744\n00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,950\nWhat's it going to hurt our business?\n\n745\n00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,270\nHow's it going to affect our processes?\n\n746\n00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,140\nAnd then based on that information we can\nevaluate what we want to do about it.\n\n747\n00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,000\nAnd there's various steps we can take\nbased on what it is we're trying\n\n748\n00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,880\nto provide.\n\n749\n00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n750\n00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,505\nNot only is the information security\nmanagement just about managing risk.\n\n751\n00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:50,586\nIt also takes a look at some of the other\nthings that we might have to do,\n\n752\n00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:52,124\nwhat we call compliance.\n\n753\n00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,070\nOverall security goals implement three\nsecurity goals that we want to do.\n\n754\n00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,508\nWant to make sure that we ensure\nconfidentiality of our data.\n\n755\n00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:05,795\nWe want to make sure that the data has\nits integrity, make sure that nothing or\n\n756\n00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,980\nanybody has messed around with the data.\n\n757\n00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,683\nAnd then availability,\n\n758\n00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:14,000\nand even non-repudiation,\nwhich is four instead of three.\n\n759\n00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,410\n>> Yeah, you know, a lot of this goes\nback to IT training versus ITIL.\n\n760\n00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,450\nIn most training providers, so\nSecurity Plus, CISSP, and so\n\n761\n00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,950\non, you have what they\ncall the security triad.\n\n762\n00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,290\nThese three things, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n763\n00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,720\nCIA, that's what a lot of us learned.\n\n764\n00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,118\nITIL has that fourth one,\nwhich is non-repudiation.\n\n765\n00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:35,740\nAnd so that's another one to keep in mind.\n\n766\n00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,850\nIf you're IT security certified already,\nit's a little different.\n\n767\n00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,020\nBut these are all responses to risks.\n\n768\n00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,290\nYou identify a risk,\nthere's a risk that somebody could\n\n769\n00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,410\nintercept my data while\nit's crossing the network.\n\n770\n00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:48,980\nHow do I protect that?\n\n771\n00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,950\nWell, protecting it is\nproviding confidentiality.\n\n772\n00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,660\nConfidentiality simply means I\nonly want this data to be seen\n\n773\n00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,220\nby people I specifically approve.\n\n774\n00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,060\nIf I send an email to Ronnie,\nI want Ronnie to be able to read it.\n\n775\n00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,700\nI don't want anybody else to read it,\nright?\n\n776\n00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,080\nIt's confidential.\n\n777\n00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,960\nIf I send it unencrypted over the network,\nsomebody could intercept it and read it.\n\n778\n00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,820\nIf I encrypt it, now some body could\nintercept it and they can't read it.\n\n779\n00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,040\nSo confidentiality solves the risk of\nan unauthorized user viewing that data.\n\n780\n00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,000\nSo that's how you need to evaluate these,\nis look at them as solutions to a problem.\n\n781\n00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,610\nAnd we can kind of just run down\neach one and see what they do.\n\n782\n00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,120\nThe next one's integrity.\n\n783\n00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,380\n>> Integrity involves making\nsure that the data I send\n\n784\n00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,260\nremains the same as when Don\nreceives it if I do the same thing.\n\n785\n00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,970\nSo integrity really offers us a chance to\nbe able to tell when somebody has actually\n\n786\n00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:49,920\ntried to make an unauthorized change to\ndata as it's moved across the network.\n\n787\n00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,440\n>> Yeah, if I send you an email and\n\n788\n00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,710\nsomebody intercepts it, they could\nmodify it and then forward it along.\n\n789\n00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,810\nAnd so Ronnie gets an email that is\ndrastically different than what I sent,\n\n790\n00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,240\nbut he thinks it's from me.\n\n791\n00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,120\nWell, when we implement data integrity,\nusually we use digital signatures.\n\n792\n00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,180\nYou hash the email and when Ronnie\nreceives it he can calculate the same\n\n793\n00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,530\nhash, and if they match,\nthe email has not been tampered with.\n\n794\n00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,958\nBut if they don't match,\nthe email has been tampered with.\n\n795\n00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,880\nThose are systems we can\nimplement that'll provide that.\n\n796\n00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,490\nAnd for confidentiality and integrity,\nthe most common solution for\n\n797\n00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,710\nthem is a VPN or IPsec or\nsome other privacy protocol.\n\n798\n00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,810\nSo what they do is they use encryption\nto provide confidentiality and\n\n799\n00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,590\nthey use a digital signature\nto provide integrity.\n\n800\n00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:39,350\nSo those are two components that we'll\nsee pretty often that are available.\n\n801\n00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,580\nI'm going to jump to the last one cuz\nit ties into this, non-repudiation.\n\n802\n00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:50,020\nThat means if I send an email to Ronnie,\nhow does he know it actually came from me?\n\n803\n00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,770\nMaybe somebody else is masquerading as me.\n\n804\n00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:57,190\nAnd they digitally sign their email,\nso it passes the digital signature.\n\n805\n00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,995\nIntegrity doesn't necessarily\nprovide authenticity, right?\n\n806\n00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:06,160\nNon-repudiation is that, authentication,\nverifying that it actually came from me.\n\n807\n00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,530\nAnd the term non-repudiation\nmeans that I can't repudiate.\n\n808\n00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,710\nI can't say,\nI didn't send you that email, Ronnie,\n\n809\n00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,750\nthat email that says something bad,\nyou're fired.\n\n810\n00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,670\nThat wasn't from me.\n\n811\n00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:18,740\nI don't know what happened.\n\n812\n00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,420\nWell, if there's a system in place\nthat guarantees that it's from me,\n\n813\n00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:29,360\nif that email is digitally signed\nwith my private key, my certificate.\n\n814\n00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,130\nSomebody else could have drafted\nan email and said it was from me and\n\n815\n00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,540\nsigned it with their certificate.\n\n816\n00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,060\nThat's different than mine.\n\n817\n00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,480\nSo if Ronnie sees that\ncertificate doesn't match,\n\n818\n00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,870\nhe knows that it didn't\nactually come from me.\n\n819\n00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:43,070\nNormally emails don't have a signature\nlike that, it's hard to verify.\n\n820\n00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:45,250\nAnd I'm just using email as an example.\n\n821\n00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,630\nThis could apply to any type\nof communication or data or\n\n822\n00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,802\njust information in\ngeneral on your network.\n\n823\n00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:55,190\nSo non-repudiation very\nclosely related to integrity,\n\n824\n00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,360\nbecause we wanna make sure people\nhaven't tampered with the email,\n\n825\n00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,540\nthat is actually from the person\nthat it says it is, non-repudiation.\n\n826\n00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,320\n>> Last one we have is availability.\n\n827\n00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,410\nAvailability is exactly like it sounds.\n\n828\n00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:10,591\nWe wanna make sure that only\nthe people we need to see it, sees it.\n\n829\n00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:13,685\nOther people don't-\n>> Oh no, that's confidentiality.\n\n830\n00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:14,500\n>> Oh, sorry.\n\n831\n00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,837\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sorry, I did the wrong one.\n\n832\n00:45:16,837 --> 00:45:18,045\n[LAUGH]\n>> Availability, that's making sure that\n\n833\n00:45:18,045 --> 00:45:19,855\nthat we send an email and\nit actually gets there.\n\n834\n00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:21,475\n>> Oh yeah, how it gets there,\nsorry, yeah.\n\n835\n00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:22,965\n>> The system needs to be available.\n\n836\n00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:27,725\nAnd if an attacker is trying to break\ninto your system, and they can't\n\n837\n00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,565\nmodify your emails, they can't read your\nemails, they can't forge your emails.\n\n838\n00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:34,580\nCuz we have confidentiality,\nintegrity, non-repudiation, right?\n\n839\n00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,640\nSo they got all that, what do they do?\n\n840\n00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,350\nThey say, well you know what,\n\n841\n00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,210\nscrew it, I'm just gonna take\ntheir email servers offline.\n\n842\n00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,180\nLet me do a denial of service attack and\noverwhelm their servers so\n\n843\n00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,000\nthey just can't send emails at all.\n\n844\n00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,860\nNow they're affecting the availability.\n\n845\n00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,590\nAnd that availability piece we\nkind of already talked about.\n\n846\n00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,230\nWe had a whole process for\nthat when we do our service design.\n\n847\n00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,500\nWe plan for that availability.\n\n848\n00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,390\nSo it's tied in here, though,\nbecause it can be a response to risk.\n\n849\n00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,860\nA denial of service attack\nis a risk that could happen,\n\n850\n00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,310\nand we need to make sure our\nsystems can survive that.\n\n851\n00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,940\nThat's what availability is all about.\n\n852\n00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,470\nNow I don't want to dive too much\ninto that one because we just\n\n853\n00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,820\nkinda covered it in depth earlier, so.\n\n854\n00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,510\nAll right, now when we're planning for\ninformation security,\n\n855\n00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,510\nwe've seen the type of things\nthat we need to provide.\n\n856\n00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:24,310\nWe have to figure out where we're gonna\nprovide them, how we're gonna provide them\n\n857\n00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:27,480\nand we need to make sure that\nour end users actually do it\n\n858\n00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,480\nbecause as IT guys we're not the ones\nthat are working with that information.\n\n859\n00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,900\nSo if you're an IT guy for a hospital,\n\n860\n00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,640\nyou're not the one who's writing a\nprescription or filling the prescription.\n\n861\n00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,970\nYou're not the one who's\ntracking the medical charts.\n\n862\n00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:42,430\nThe doctors, the nurses, the physicians,\nthey're the ones that are doing it.\n\n863\n00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,552\nSo when it comes to implementing\nall these security measures,\n\n864\n00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,920\noftentimes it's them that have to do it.\n\n865\n00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,420\nThey need to be aware.\n\n866\n00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,350\nAnd so the main thing that we produce when\nwe do information security management,\n\n867\n00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,020\nthe most important piece,\nis a document called Our Security Policy.\n\n868\n00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,484\nAnd it's simply a collection\nof information that\n\n869\n00:47:05,484 --> 00:47:11,600\nsays how our employees are expected to\nsecure and protect their information.\n\n870\n00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,600\nThe steps they need to take, from\nstoring data securely to destroying data\n\n871\n00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,530\nthat's no longer necessary\nto sharing data.\n\n872\n00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,820\nAll of that gets defined in here in a way\nthat your end users can read it and\n\n873\n00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,650\nunderstand what their responsibility is.\n\n874\n00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,700\n>> A lot of times security\npolicy is written in terms of,\n\n875\n00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,100\nhere is how you actually\nknow you are secure.\n\n876\n00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,885\nWe talk about compliance and\nhere is how you know you are not secure,\n\n877\n00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,690\nnon-compliance.\n\n878\n00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,626\nThat way, everybody in the organization\ncan actually very clearly tell,\n\n879\n00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:43,260\nare they skirting the line or\nhave they absolutely crossed the line?\n\n880\n00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,044\nMost policies are written in that way,\nto make it easy for\n\n881\n00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:49,130\nsomeone say, here is how you know\nthat this is gonna be secure.\n\n882\n00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,370\n>> And you bring up a great point.\n\n883\n00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,982\nIf somebody leaks data\nout of the company well,\n\n884\n00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:57,160\nyou want to take disciplinary action, but\nhow do you discipline them if you didn't\n\n885\n00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,650\ngive them the rules of\nthe game ahead of time?\n\n886\n00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,580\nSo they need to know the rules,\nso you can go right here and\n\n887\n00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,540\nsay look,\nyou violated our security policy.\n\n888\n00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,471\nIt's right here,\nthis is what you did, you're fired.\n\n889\n00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:10,530\nOr you're being moved or written up or\nwhatever it is that you do.\n\n890\n00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:12,970\nSo we need to have that document.\n\n891\n00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,650\nIt needs to be black and\nwhite, unambiguous.\n\n892\n00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,820\nHere's our policy.\n\n893\n00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,388\nSo that is important.\n\n894\n00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:21,330\nThere are other aspects of security\nwe need to maintain though.\n\n895\n00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,490\nBut that security policy,\nthat is the big one.\n\n896\n00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,650\nThat's really what we need to be\ncareful with as we generate it.\n\n897\n00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,180\nAnd we'll see that there's a number\nof different components that fall\n\n898\n00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,780\ninside of it.\n\n899\n00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,870\nBut I'm looking at the clock\nover here Ronnie, and\n\n900\n00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,580\nwe have run out of time on this one.\n\n901\n00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,840\nSo let's stop and take a break.\n\n902\n00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,500\nWhen we get back we're gonna finish our\nsecurity, and we still have, what's left?\n\n903\n00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,100\nSupplier.\n\n904\n00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,980\nWe have supplier management to tack on,\ntowards the end.\n\n905\n00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,840\nSo we've got about one more segment\nbefore we wrap up the show.\n\n906\n00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,430\nMake sure you stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n907\n00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:57,805\n[MUSIC]\n\n908\n00:48:57,805 --> 00:48:59,680\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n909\n00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,610\nSo we left off in the last\nsegment partially through\n\n910\n00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,265\nService Design, so\nI'm right there with that.\n\n911\n00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:10,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With our security side, right,\n\n912\n00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,450\nI managing security for IT.\n\n913\n00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,250\nAnd we just need to pick\nback up with that though.\n\n914\n00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,140\nThe thing we left off on was\ntalking about a security policy.\n\n915\n00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,590\nHow we need to draft up how we\nexpect our employees to perform\n\n916\n00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,690\nin order to maintain\na certain level of security?\n\n917\n00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,580\nAnd that's extremely important, your\norganization should have that document.\n\n918\n00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,940\nSo that document is not normally emerging\nbrand new out of one particular service.\n\n919\n00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,450\nYou normally already have it.\n\n920\n00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,720\nAnd as you develop a new service,\n\n921\n00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,990\nas you work on that design,\nyou extend your security policy\n\n922\n00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,700\nto cover the security aspects of that\nparticular service that's being designed.\n\n923\n00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:48,360\nNow, once it's in place well, we've got to\nlive up to that security policy, right?\n\n924\n00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,840\nSo we have what are called\nSecurity Controls.\n\n925\n00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,120\nAnd security controls are the things\nthat actually enforce security.\n\n926\n00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,200\nSo as part of our design we might have\nto create some of these controls and\n\n927\n00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,480\ncontrols at their simplest might be\nsomething, for example, like a door lock.\n\n928\n00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,830\nSo if I have a locked door somebody's\ngotta have a key to get in,\n\n929\n00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,620\nonly certain people should have keys.\n\n930\n00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:12,560\nThe lock on that door is a security\ncontrol, camera, security guards,\n\n931\n00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,680\nthese are all types of security controls.\n\n932\n00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,880\nBut a control can be something\nas simple as just a regulation.\n\n933\n00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,230\nYou write a rule that says,\n\n934\n00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:25,330\nemployees must ensure that documents\nover five years of age are destroyed.\n\n935\n00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,830\nSo it's not a lock, it's not a camera,\nbut it is a security control, because\n\n936\n00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:34,200\nif data's held longer than five years,\nit's an unnecessary liability or whatever.\n\n937\n00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,490\nIt all depends on what you're\naddressing to solve that.\n\n938\n00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,300\n>> Yeah, another example of that might\nbe a password policy, which we require.\n\n939\n00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,870\nThe passwords be changed every 42 days or\nevery 8 weeks or so.\n\n940\n00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,430\nAnd that way, we go ahead and\nimplement that in policy, and\n\n941\n00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,080\nit doesn't matter whether,\nthe person wants to follow it or\n\n942\n00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,220\nnot, it's controlled for them, they're\ngonna have to change their passwords.\n\n943\n00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,850\n>> A few other things that we're\ngonna throw into our design,\n\n944\n00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,940\nwhen it comes into\nthe security side of things.\n\n945\n00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,620\n>> First of all,\nwe need to manage our supplier access.\n\n946\n00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:08,794\nWhen you deal with a new service, you may\nnot be offering or even responsible for\n\n947\n00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,500\nevery single component\ninside that service.\n\n948\n00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,257\nYou might be reaching out to a third party\nvendor to provide a certain portion and\n\n949\n00:51:16,257 --> 00:51:19,596\nas a result they may need\naccess to some of your systems.\n\n950\n00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:23,477\nWe need a way to define exactly what\naccess those third party suppliers\n\n951\n00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:26,200\nare going to need and restrict them to it.\n\n952\n00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,300\nSo again, in our design phase we\nidentify what those needs are.\n\n953\n00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,750\nWhat access does that supplier need?\n\n954\n00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,490\nAnd ensure that that's all they get.\n\n955\n00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,160\nThey call that the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n956\n00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,790\nYou never give someone more\naccess than they need.\n\n957\n00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,514\nYou give them the bare\nminimum to get the job done.\n\n958\n00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:43,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n959\n00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,260\nWe also have managing the incidences and\nevents that may happen,\n\n960\n00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,290\nif it's a security violation.\n\n961\n00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:52,355\nIt's very easy to think\nabout somebody coming in and\n\n962\n00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:56,860\nthen overreacting to what's\nactually gonna be the incident.\n\n963\n00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,768\nWell, what we want to do is have in\nplace the procedures that we need and\n\n964\n00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:04,971\nthe processes that we need, so we know\nthat we are doing everything right.\n\n965\n00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:08,325\nIt is very easy to overact, and\ngo I'm gonna punch that guy in that face.\n\n966\n00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you really don't need to.\n\n967\n00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,595\nYou just need to kind of\nrestrain them a little bit.\n\n968\n00:52:12,595 --> 00:52:14,680\n>> Ronnie, is that your first reaction?\n\n969\n00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,350\n>> A lot of the times it is.\n\n970\n00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,428\nWe are reactionary at times and it becomes\na personal thing when somebody violates\n\n971\n00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:26,110\nmy network, I wanna punch him back-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n972\n00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,130\n>> But in reality the right thing to do of\n\n973\n00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,320\ncourse, is to know what the policy is and\nwhat procedures that\n\n974\n00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,600\nwe need to take to deal with that instead\nof taking things into my own hands.\n\n975\n00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,040\n>> A very common mistake is that if one\nof your servers has been compromised,\n\n976\n00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,830\nas soon as you find out\nit's been compromised,\n\n977\n00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:45,160\na lot of people's first instinct\nis to turn off the server.\n\n978\n00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,950\nHey, if somebody's in there and\nthey're getting in our data,\n\n979\n00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,500\nif I turn the server off-\n>> They're not gonna get access.\n\n980\n00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,150\n>> Then they're not gonna get the data.\n\n981\n00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,940\nBut anybody who's in security forensics or\nIT forensics,\n\n982\n00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,490\nwill know that that's\na really bad thing to do.\n\n983\n00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:02,610\nThe moment you turn that computer off,\nall of the data in RAM gets erased.\n\n984\n00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:03,720\nIt's wiped out.\n\n985\n00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,900\nAnd so sure you got the hard drives and\nyour data, but what was in RAM.\n\n986\n00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,930\nWhat the hacker was actually doing\nat that time is now gone lost.\n\n987\n00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,700\nSo you lose some of the information.\n\n988\n00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,570\nSo in the IT forensics world they,\nwant you to leave the computer on.\n\n989\n00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,830\nYou've already been hacked,\n\n990\n00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,520\nyou can't evaluate how much of your\ndata that user has already obtained.\n\n991\n00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,600\nSo you leave it on, so you can\ncapture that additional information.\n\n992\n00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,040\nSo if we have a policy that\ntells people that hey,\n\n993\n00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,850\nhere is your incident response plan,\nhere's how you deal with that.\n\n994\n00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,470\nIn some situations, yes.\n\n995\n00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,350\nPower it off.\n\n996\n00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,580\nIn other situations, no.\n\n997\n00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,330\nJust unplug the network or\n\n998\n00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:43,160\nthird situation, you just leave the thing\nalone and call the response team.\n\n999\n00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,640\nWe have to come up with those procedures.\n\n1000\n00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,329\nYou never want a situation,\na panic situation,\n\n1001\n00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:51,222\nwhere someone doesn't have\nguidance on what to do.\n\n1002\n00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:54,320\nWhere they have to just fly by the seat\nof their pants and figure out what to do.\n\n1003\n00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,500\nWe should be able to predict\nwith reasonable certainty,\n\n1004\n00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,350\nthe types of events that\nare going to occur in the future.\n\n1005\n00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:04,360\nAnd have a policy in\nplace to service that.\n\n1006\n00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,420\nNow, as we start to draft\nthis security policy,\n\n1007\n00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,280\nas we get it pushed in place,\nthere's really\n\n1008\n00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,570\nseveral different components that are\nhappening inside of the security policy.\n\n1009\n00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,990\nAnd basically it breaks down like this,\n\n1010\n00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:21,080\nwe've got control, plan,\nimplement, evaluate, maintain.\n\n1011\n00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,030\nThese are the phases of\nour security policy.\n\n1012\n00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:28,510\nControl is what we're really talking\nabout, you establish a security framework.\n\n1013\n00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,860\nYou come up with this general security\npolicy that applies to your organization.\n\n1014\n00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,100\nAnd then as you develop each service,\n\n1015\n00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,650\nas part of your design you're tailoring\nthat to match the general framework.\n\n1016\n00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,320\nWell, that design part, that's planned.\n\n1017\n00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,120\nSo control, that's the overall framework.\n\n1018\n00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,300\nPlan is where we customize\nthat to an individual service.\n\n1019\n00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,630\n>> Yeah,\nyou must have the implementation and\n\n1020\n00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,852\nwe are talking about physical\ntype of security control.\n\n1021\n00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:57,012\nWe wanna know where exactly\nwe are gonna implement it and\n\n1022\n00:54:57,012 --> 00:54:59,846\nwhat level implementation\nwe are talking about.\n\n1023\n00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:01,570\nAre we just gonna have electronic locks?\n\n1024\n00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,690\nAre we gonna have doors\nlocks with keys in them?\n\n1025\n00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,290\nWhatever it is,\n\n1026\n00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,070\nwe want to make sure that we implement\nthe proper security for what we need.\n\n1027\n00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,700\n>> Yeah, and\nthen we've got the evaluation piece.\n\n1028\n00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,410\nSo after implementation,\n\n1029\n00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,050\nwe want to make sure that people\nare following the security policy.\n\n1030\n00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,115\nSo as we design our service, we're also\ngonna design the methods we use to\n\n1031\n00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:21,635\nevaluate, to go and\nfind out whether this is being followed.\n\n1032\n00:55:21,635 --> 00:55:25,799\nMaybe this is routine audits or other\ncheck lists, things that we just verify\n\n1033\n00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:30,042\nevery so often, to ensure people remember\nwhat they are supposed to be doing.\n\n1034\n00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:34,227\nBecause what will happen is a lot of\npeople will act nice and secure for\n\n1035\n00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:38,793\na few months, and they start getting\na little more relaxed as time goes on.\n\n1036\n00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,217\nYou used to see this with people\nlike in their cars when they'd get\n\n1037\n00:55:42,217 --> 00:55:44,500\na brand new radio in the car.\n\n1038\n00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,370\nIn the beginning, they'd lock their doors,\nthey'd be take all this extra precaution.\n\n1039\n00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,440\nThey don't want people to steal the radio\nbut after you've had the radio a few\n\n1040\n00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,950\nmonths, all of a sudden, leave the window\ndown, it'll be fine and people do that.\n\n1041\n00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:00,610\nThey get more lax as time goes on, so you\ngotta evaluate what's going on out there.\n\n1042\n00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,570\nWe don't even have to point\nthat far a lot of times,\n\n1043\n00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,080\nyou can just store our own cards.\n\n1044\n00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,446\nThere's times when we implement\na [INAUDIBLE] sync, every door is gonna\n\n1045\n00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:11,050\nlock behind us every time we go out,\nwhich means it requires us to have a key.\n\n1046\n00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,990\nIt doesn't take long before someone\nforgets their key, and so what happens?\n\n1047\n00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,850\nWe let them borrow our key or\nwe just prop the door open, so\n\n1048\n00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,780\nthat somebody that doesn't have their\nkey can make their way back in,\n\n1049\n00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,220\nand you might be thinking, Ronnie,\nwhere in the world would that happen?\n\n1050\n00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,050\nWell, here,\nthis is where that happens, [LAUGH]\n\n1051\n00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,290\n>> You see it all around.\n\n1052\n00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,500\nI get really frustrated here.\n\n1053\n00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,340\nWe have a great key access system here,\nand every time I see a propped door,\n\n1054\n00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,015\nI close it.\n\n1055\n00:56:35,015 --> 00:56:38,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A pet peeve of mine and\n\n1056\n00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,660\nthen the last part is how we're\ngoing to maintain our policy.\n\n1057\n00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,520\nBecause once the policy's been drafted and\nbeen put in place, even for\n\n1058\n00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,890\nan individual service,\nit's not set in stone forever.\n\n1059\n00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:50,170\nNew stuff comes up all the time, so\n\n1060\n00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,200\nwe have to maintain,\nupdate that security policy.\n\n1061\n00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,490\nYou may find that maybe your policy\nis too strict, and so over time,\n\n1062\n00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,410\nyou're able to release that a little bit.\n\n1063\n00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,150\nOr you find new areas where\nyou need to tighten up on, so\n\n1064\n00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,020\nyou're progressively getting more strict.\n\n1065\n00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,320\nIt just depends on the environment but\n\n1066\n00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,720\nyou do need to have a system in\nplace that allows for change.\n\n1067\n00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,470\nThat's really important.\n\n1068\n00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,080\nAll of this together is what we\nhave to design as part of our\n\n1069\n00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,840\nIT security management piece.\n\n1070\n00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,970\nSo, as we start getting that in place,\nwe figure it all out,\n\n1071\n00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,230\nwe throw it into action.\n\n1072\n00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:29,120\nNow, all of this is working\ntowards security governance.\n\n1073\n00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,830\nSecurity governance is where we\nare transparent about what we're doing,\n\n1074\n00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,500\nwe have a security policy that\ndefines exactly what we're doing and\n\n1075\n00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,020\nwhy we're doing it.\n\n1076\n00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,430\nWith governance,\nwe verify that it's happening and\n\n1077\n00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,730\nthat it's still in line with our\nbusiness goals, our overall strategy.\n\n1078\n00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:49,460\nWhen we talk about security governance,\nwe're checking a lot of things.\n\n1079\n00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,600\nThat first thing is strategic alignment.\n\n1080\n00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:58,070\nDoes our security policy match up with\nwhat our company is trying to achieve or\n\n1081\n00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,150\nare we deviating from our original goal?\n\n1082\n00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:05,190\n>> Yeah, the security governance part\nreally does go into the operations\n\n1083\n00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:10,770\nof the service, the overall service\nprovider that we're going to become.\n\n1084\n00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,630\nAt the same time,\nit helps validate the plans and\n\n1085\n00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,840\nprocesses that we already implemented and\nthe strategic goals that we've set.\n\n1086\n00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,970\nSo in the governance part, it also means\nthat we're taking a look at the value\n\n1087\n00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:26,570\nthat's offered every time we actually\nput some service into production.\n\n1088\n00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:30,009\n>> Value when it comes to security\nis a hard thing to measure because\n\n1089\n00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,610\nwhen security is working properly, and\n\n1090\n00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:39,440\neverything is running like normal,\nsecurity generates no real value.\n\n1091\n00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,200\nIt's when security stops an outage,\nstops some kind of system failure,\n\n1092\n00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,317\nstops a data breach,\nthat's when the value of it really shines.\n\n1093\n00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:50,760\nSo with governance, we're evaluating\nwhat we're doing and whether or\n\n1094\n00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,850\nnot it's actually necessary, whether\nthe potential to earn value is there.\n\n1095\n00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,970\nWe also have our risk management piece.\n\n1096\n00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:01,000\nIn governance, we're looking at all of\nthe security measures we took in place.\n\n1097\n00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,770\nWe spent a lot of money because\nwe're mitigating risks,\n\n1098\n00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,800\nwe're pushing off risks by\nenforcing tighter security.\n\n1099\n00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,310\nShould we have gone further?\n\n1100\n00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:13,280\nMaybe we didn't have the money at\nthe time back then but now we do and so\n\n1101\n00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,960\nwe're constantly re-evaluating risk and\nrisks themselves can change.\n\n1102\n00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:25,950\nMaybe you work in a school environment and\nso there's a risk of equipment theft.\n\n1103\n00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,990\nDuring the school year, when you've got\nthousands of students in your building,\n\n1104\n00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:37,410\nthe risk of theft is very, very high but\nduring the summer or the holiday break or\n\n1105\n00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,080\nwhatever, when the students aren't there,\nthe risk becomes much, much lower.\n\n1106\n00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,470\nSo you may change your\nsecurity based on that\n\n1107\n00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,762\nto make sure that you're offsetting\nthe right amount of risk.\n\n1108\n00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:52,160\nMaybe have more security guards\nwhile school is in session and\n\n1109\n00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,060\nless security guards when\nschool is not in session.\n\n1110\n00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,130\nThese things, we adjust.\n\n1111\n00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,310\nIt's all about managing risk and\n\n1112\n00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,020\nevaluating when it's greater or\nwhen it's reduced.\n\n1113\n01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:07,650\n>> We also have performance management to\ndeal with in security governance, as well.\n\n1114\n01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:10,900\nWith performance management, we're\nalso taking a look at diagnostics that\n\n1115\n01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,370\nwe can run, so that we know that\nthose systems are performing\n\n1116\n01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:18,740\nup to the level that they need to be,\nwhen you do go ahead and test them.\n\n1117\n01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,790\nThat way you verify that it's working.\n\n1118\n01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:23,620\nYou may push the door open and\nsee if an alarm gets set.\n\n1119\n01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,610\nYou may go ahead and\nsee if there's logging, somebody that's\n\n1120\n01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,800\nwalking through a door that's unlocked,\nwhen they swipe their key fob.\n\n1121\n01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,450\nIt just verifies that we\nare actually maintaining or\n\n1122\n01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,930\nthat system is performing\nthe way that we need it to.\n\n1123\n01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,700\n>> This is one of the ones that actually\ngoes even beyond what we normally consider\n\n1124\n01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,610\nsecurity but when I think of security,\nI think of criminal activity.\n\n1125\n01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:51,470\nWe're trying to stop the bad guys but\nsecurity covers other areas.\n\n1126\n01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:55,220\nWe saw availability is one of the areas\nthat we were worried about kind of inside\n\n1127\n01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:00,040\nof security and it might not be so much\ncriminal activity, as just regular use.\n\n1128\n01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,160\nAs our customer base grows,\nand we get more and\n\n1129\n01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,630\nmore customers,\ncould we run out of resources?\n\n1130\n01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:06,270\nAbsolutely.\n\n1131\n01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:09,580\nWhen we run out of resources,\nour servers become unavailable.\n\n1132\n01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:15,410\nSome of our users are not able to access\nour services and in most policy standards,\n\n1133\n01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,770\ntheir definition of security\nincludes availability,\n\n1134\n01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,320\nbeing able to access the system.\n\n1135\n01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,220\nSo we have to monitor\nperformance of our systems.\n\n1136\n01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,905\nAre our servers living up to the speeds\nthey're supposed to and if they're not,\n\n1137\n01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:31,070\neither one, we could be under attack and\nnot know it and\n\n1138\n01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,000\nthat's why our performance has degraded.\n\n1139\n01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,580\nOr two, we've got a failure coming soon,\nas our systems get overloaded,\n\n1140\n01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,150\nnow we're going to basically go offline,\nfor at least some of our users.\n\n1141\n01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:45,010\nSo we need to take action on that, and\nthat's why it gets thrown in, and that's\n\n1142\n01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:49,220\nkind of coupled hand in hand with the next\none, which is resource management.\n\n1143\n01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,800\nWith security, we're making sure\nthat our resources are there and\n\n1144\n01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,860\navailable when they should be and\nthat the resources are behaving properly,\n\n1145\n01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,970\nif it's resources in terms of people.\n\n1146\n01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:03,230\nIf it's resources in terms of money,\nwe're insuring that\n\n1147\n01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:08,400\nit's moving where it's supposed to\nmove because you have embezzlement and\n\n1148\n01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,330\nother things of that nature.\n\n1149\n01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:13,430\nSo when you have actual\nfinancial transactions going on,\n\n1150\n01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,970\nthere's a lot of security that needs to be\nput in place to ensure data is encrypted,\n\n1151\n01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,640\nit's secure, people aren't spoofing,\nsending communications in,\n\n1152\n01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,250\nand all sorts of bad things can\nhappen there on the financial side.\n\n1153\n01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,290\nSo that falls under resource\nmanagement of our security policy.\n\n1154\n01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:33,942\n>> Our last little option here is\nthe business process assurance.\n\n1155\n01:02:33,942 --> 01:02:36,010\nRemember, that business has to continue.\n\n1156\n01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,630\nWithout the security\nin place that we need,\n\n1157\n01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,990\nwe can't guarantee the security that\nwe've already been talking about.\n\n1158\n01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:45,240\nSo good security design really does assure\n\n1159\n01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,470\nboth sides that the business that\nthey need can continue to operate.\n\n1160\n01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,170\n>> These are all things that we do.\n\n1161\n01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:57,000\nSecurity governance is all about managing,\ncontrolling, monitoring that whole\n\n1162\n01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,060\nsecurity environment and keeping things\nmoving the way that we designed them.\n\n1163\n01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:05,160\nWe've gotta come up with a design,\noriginally, in that service design phase\n\n1164\n01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,760\nand then, we continually revisit it,\nreinforcing it in our environment.\n\n1165\n01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,240\nSo, that's pretty much it for the ITSCM,\n\n1166\n01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,610\nour information security management\nin general, quite a bit in there.\n\n1167\n01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,230\nA lot of stuff.\n\n1168\n01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:24,393\nYou'll find that the service availability,\nthe IT service continuity management,\n\n1169\n01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:28,991\nITSCM, and information security\nmanagement, those three, they really do\n\n1170\n01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:33,750\noverlap quite a bit, so a lot of companies\njust combine that into one big thing.\n\n1171\n01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,700\nITIL defines them out separately\nbecause you might have different teams\n\n1172\n01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,583\nof employees operating each one.\n\n1173\n01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,833\nSo they give you the ability to have it\nbroken out or you can merge it together.\n\n1174\n01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,293\nIt's very easy to do.\n\n1175\n01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:50,040\nAll right, well Ronnie,\nthat brings us to our very last process.\n\n1176\n01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,580\nI know, this is one of the bigger of\nthe service books that we get into,\n\n1177\n01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,320\ncuz this one has eight processes.\n\n1178\n01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,240\nBut the last process is supplier\nmanagement, and you won't likely see this\n\n1179\n01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,717\none on the exam, but\nI did want to cover it for completeness.\n\n1180\n01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:06,480\nBecause you're gonna deal with suppliers,\nit happens.\n\n1181\n01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,990\nHere at ITProTV,\nwe've got a ton of IT talent, our staff,\n\n1182\n01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:14,594\npretty much everybody here, is at least\nmid level certified for IT stuff.\n\n1183\n01:04:14,594 --> 01:04:16,578\nThe IT stuff.\n\n1184\n01:04:16,578 --> 01:04:17,377\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna make that\n\n1185\n01:04:17,377 --> 01:04:18,270\ncertification next year.\n\n1186\n01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,960\nThe IT stuff cert.\n\n1187\n01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,970\nSo when we wanna offer something new,\n\n1188\n01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:24,910\noften times we've got the in\nhouse talent to do it.\n\n1189\n01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:28,500\nBut we don't have anybody in here\nthat can build a server, right?\n\n1190\n01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,600\nWe don't have a manufacturing plant or\nanything to generate our equipment.\n\n1191\n01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,050\nSo we've gotta buy that from somewhere.\n\n1192\n01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:38,850\nAnd we don't have giant redundant\ngenerators outside of our building,\n\n1193\n01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:41,400\nand five different ISPs\nrun into our building.\n\n1194\n01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,850\nWe don't have stuff like that.\n\n1195\n01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:46,080\nSo we rely on other people to do that for\nus.\n\n1196\n01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,480\nSo that's very, very common, even for\n\n1197\n01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,080\ntech companies that you're not\ngonna create everything internally.\n\n1198\n01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,950\nSo when you deal with the supplier,\n\n1199\n01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:57,920\nwe've got to make sure that's all handled\nin a healthy and responsible manner.\n\n1200\n01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,830\n>> When it comes down to suppliers,\n\n1201\n01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:04,900\nwe of course need to make sure\nthat the supplier that's we're\n\n1202\n01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:10,420\ngonna be purchasing from is also going\nto be providing the value that we need.\n\n1203\n01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,220\nSame time, we also need to ensure\nthat the item that we choose or\n\n1204\n01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,900\nwhatever the product\nthat we choose from them\n\n1205\n01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,310\nis going to help us to also meet\nour own customer needs as well.\n\n1206\n01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:25,790\nSo it does come down to an unusual\nbalancing act, in which we have to pick\n\n1207\n01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:29,440\nthe right supplier who can provide for\nus the right service.\n\n1208\n01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,450\nAnd of course, even at the right cost, so\n\n1209\n01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,690\nthere's a lot of elements that go\ninto this in the managing side.\n\n1210\n01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:37,310\n>> Yeah, you might have\na supplier that originally was\n\n1211\n01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,990\nperfectly in alignment with you.\n\n1212\n01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:41,900\nYou wanted high quality\nequipment that was reliable, and\n\n1213\n01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,590\nthey were making high quality\nequipment that was reliable.\n\n1214\n01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:48,770\nAnd as time goes on maybe, they started\ncutting corners to increase their\n\n1215\n01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,330\nprofit margin, so they started\ncreating lower quality equipment.\n\n1216\n01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:56,610\nWell now, they've gotten out of alignment\nwith what your strategy is, and\n\n1217\n01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,050\nso that might not be the appropriate\nsupplier for you anymore.\n\n1218\n01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,260\nYou may need to switch or you may need\nto just communicate with them and\n\n1219\n01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:07,030\nsay look, if you want me to keep doing\nbusiness with you here's what I need.\n\n1220\n01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:08,890\nCan you do that?\n\n1221\n01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,030\nAnd they may come back into alignment.\n\n1222\n01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,240\nBut we need to keep an eye on that.\n\n1223\n01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,510\nJust because you started with a particular\nvendor doesn't mean you need to stick with\n\n1224\n01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,200\nthem forever.\n\n1225\n01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,145\nYou got to keep your options opened,\n\n1226\n01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:22,426\nbecause you are not doing business\nto support that supplier.\n\n1227\n01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:26,994\nYou are doing business to support your\ncompanies' strategies which is ultimately\n\n1228\n01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:29,250\nservicing your customers.\n\n1229\n01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,340\nSo that's who we would care about,\nnot necessarily the supplier.\n\n1230\n01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,820\nIt doesn't mean to disregard the supplier.\n\n1231\n01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:36,180\nYou need to have a healthy\nrelationship with them.\n\n1232\n01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,760\nSo you need to ensure that things like,\nyour bills are paid on time.\n\n1233\n01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,360\nBecause what supplier is gonna wanna\nhelp you, if you pay your bills late?\n\n1234\n01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,770\nThat kinda thing is really frustrating.\n\n1235\n01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:50,509\nSo we've gotta make sure that when we\nenter into a contract with these vendors,\n\n1236\n01:06:50,509 --> 01:06:54,839\nthat we're getting value, but\nthat it's also aligned with our goals.\n\n1237\n01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,688\nThat everybody's kind of\ngot their ducks in a row,\n\n1238\n01:06:56,688 --> 01:06:58,280\nthey're all moving in the same direction.\n\n1239\n01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,760\nNow, whenever we enter into a contract,\n\n1240\n01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,740\nyou set expectations as a statement\nof work in that contract.\n\n1241\n01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,590\nWhat you expect from that vendor?\n\n1242\n01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,250\nWe need to make sure\nthat they perform to it.\n\n1243\n01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:14,350\nSo during our design stage we're figuring\nout what suppliers we're gonna need\n\n1244\n01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:18,500\nto interact with and we're creating this\nmethodology for interacting with them.\n\n1245\n01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,820\nHow we monitor that performance?\n\n1246\n01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:26,440\nA great example would be a company that I\nworked for, where we had all Dell servers.\n\n1247\n01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:32,760\nSo we had several hundred just Dell\nservers, and we had a conversation\n\n1248\n01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,100\nwith them, and we said, we're looking to\nbuild out a disaster recovery center.\n\n1249\n01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,730\nBut we have several hundred servers, and\n\n1250\n01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:43,140\nwe don't want to just buy\nseveral hundred more over there.\n\n1251\n01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,310\nIt's a big expense to have for servers\nthat hopefully we never have to use.\n\n1252\n01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:50,936\nAnd so we had bought enough from Dell\nthat they were ready to take care of us.\n\n1253\n01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:52,920\nAnd they said, here's what we can do.\n\n1254\n01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,440\nBecause you guys have bought hundreds of\nservers, and you've been our customer for\n\n1255\n01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,640\na long time.\n\n1256\n01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,210\nLet's do this.\n\n1257\n01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:01,850\nBuy physical servers that\nmatch your critical systems.\n\n1258\n01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:04,390\nSo out of our,\nI think we had about 270 servers.\n\n1259\n01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:09,300\nAnd out of that, they were really about 80\nto 85 that were truly critical services.\n\n1260\n01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,230\nAnd say, go ahead and buy those.\n\n1261\n01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:16,150\nAnd then, for the rest of them we will\nsign an agreement with you that says,\n\n1262\n01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:21,620\nif a disaster strikes we will do next day,\nshipping on that equipment to\n\n1263\n01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:27,760\nget it delivered to your facility\nthe very next day, as quickly as we can.\n\n1264\n01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,340\nYour critical service will be up\nright away, but the other ones,\n\n1265\n01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,020\nyou just need to make sure you have your\nback ups and we'll get the servers to you.\n\n1266\n01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,890\nYou can restore your back ups and\nyou'll be back up in business.\n\n1267\n01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:38,240\nAnd it's gonna be a disaster.\n\n1268\n01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,220\nIt might affect other people,\nother people are gonna be ordering, but\n\n1269\n01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,460\nwe will honor yours first.\n\n1270\n01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:44,190\nThat's what this contract states.\n\n1271\n01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:49,250\nSo we purchased a lot from them, and\nthey took care of us because of that.\n\n1272\n01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,100\nWe didn't have to buy those servers,\nand just have them sitting there for\n\n1273\n01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,050\nmonths on end for\na disaster that likely will never come.\n\n1274\n01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,030\nBut in the event the disaster did hit,\nwe had it.\n\n1275\n01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:01,360\nNow, how do we know that\nthey're gonna perform to that?\n\n1276\n01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,310\nWhat if the disaster happens, and we go\nand we say, all right send us the servers.\n\n1277\n01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,400\nAnd they go,\noh actually they're on back-order.\n\n1278\n01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,550\nWell, next day them to you\nas we get them in six weeks.\n\n1279\n01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,840\nAnd how do you know that\nthat's not gonna happen?\n\n1280\n01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:18,690\nSo you've gotta have that relationship,\nbut you've also gotta have penalties\n\n1281\n01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:24,780\ndrafted in that agreement that says,\nif you don't, here's what's gonna happen.\n\n1282\n01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,220\nYou got to refund,\n\n1283\n01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,810\nyou got to have some kind of clause\nin there to handle that, because\n\n1284\n01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:34,340\nsometimes companies don't live up to what\nthey promised unless it is in a contract.\n\n1285\n01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,310\n>> Maintaining the relationship with\nthe supplier will also depend on\n\n1286\n01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:42,060\nhow closely your aligned\nwith that supplier.\n\n1287\n01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,080\nYou may end up having what we call\nstrategic partners that you'll actually\n\n1288\n01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,740\nteam up with a lot more often than\nsomebody you'd call a commodity,\n\n1289\n01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:53,790\na type of supplier who\njust provides you pieces,\n\n1290\n01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,170\nbut that you could get\nthe other piece somewhere else.\n\n1291\n01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:58,310\nSo depending on how you\nsee that relationship,\n\n1292\n01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,345\nwhether you're depending\non them heavily or\n\n1293\n01:10:00,345 --> 01:10:03,611\nwhether you're just kind of dependent\non them because they're cheap,\n\n1294\n01:10:03,611 --> 01:10:07,212\nyou're gonna see that your relationship's\ngonna be different with each one.\n\n1295\n01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:10,331\n>> Yeah, so at this phase,\nwhen we're doing service design,\n\n1296\n01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:14,850\nwhat we're really worried about here\nis just general contract management.\n\n1297\n01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,200\nHow we're going to manage the contracts?\n\n1298\n01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,420\nSo we need to find that way for how we're\ngoing to be monitoring these people,\n\n1299\n01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,130\ninteracting with these people,\nentering into contracts?\n\n1300\n01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:24,510\nOnce the contract is in place,\n\n1301\n01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:28,820\nhow we insure that we're living up to our\npart and they're living up to their part?\n\n1302\n01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,890\nAnd more importantly,\nwhen the contract is done,\n\n1303\n01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,540\nhow we verify that it is done and\nterminated?\n\n1304\n01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,740\nBecause you don't want to end up\ninto a situation where you think\n\n1305\n01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:43,180\nthe contract is over and\nthey think it isn't or vice versa.\n\n1306\n01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:48,430\nAnd work continues to happen or billing\ncontinues to happen when it shouldn't.\n\n1307\n01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,040\nI think we've probably all had that at\nsome point where you cancel an account and\n\n1308\n01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,066\nthen you still get billed-\n>> Another bill, yup.\n\n1309\n01:10:55,066 --> 01:10:55,810\n>> After the cancellation.\n\n1310\n01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,000\nRight?\nIt happens and\n\n1311\n01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,640\nthat's exactly what's going on\nis you've got a contract that\n\n1312\n01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,230\none side believes is terminated,\nthe other side doesn't.\n\n1313\n01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:05,460\nAnd usually very easy to resolve that,\n\n1314\n01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,660\npeople don't normally\ngive you grief over it.\n\n1315\n01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:10,900\nBut you have to be monitoring\nto ensure that hasn't happened,\n\n1316\n01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:11,950\nthat people understand.\n\n1317\n01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:15,400\nSo that's all part of general contract\nmanagement, and you probably,\n\n1318\n01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,700\nin your organization,\nalready have a legal team or\n\n1319\n01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,730\nsomeone who specifically handles\nthe contract management piece.\n\n1320\n01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,240\nSo with ITIL we don't\nnecessarily replace that,\n\n1321\n01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,510\nwe integrate,\nwe get them in to our design process.\n\n1322\n01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,583\nAnd we say okay,\nwhat do we need to do here?\n\n1323\n01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:32,390\nAs part of this new service we're\ngoing to enter in to a few contracts.\n\n1324\n01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:33,950\nSo what do we need to plan for?\n\n1325\n01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:37,529\nAnd that contract management team\nor- There's a few different names it\n\n1326\n01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:38,280\nmight have.\n\n1327\n01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,570\nProcurement team.\n\n1328\n01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,325\nProcurement management is\nanother popular name for it.\n\n1329\n01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:43,600\nThat they will give you the advice.\n\n1330\n01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,381\nThey'll give you the recommendation of\nhow your company handles those contracts.\n\n1331\n01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:52,395\nNow no one of these processes\nis terribly effective by itself.\n\n1332\n01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:57,505\nSo all eight of these processes that we\njust covered are really what makes up\n\n1333\n01:11:57,505 --> 01:11:59,065\nservice design.\n\n1334\n01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:02,815\nAll of this really just\nboils down to good planning.\n\n1335\n01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,725\nWe plan for what's gonna to happen in the\nfuture, as we roll out this service and\n\n1336\n01:12:06,725 --> 01:12:09,735\nwe plan for how we're going to manage\nthe service while it's running,\n\n1337\n01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:11,595\nand we'll be successful.\n\n1338\n01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:15,030\nOr we've at least increased our\nodds of becoming successful.\n\n1339\n01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,170\nAlways remember that.\n\n1340\n01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,980\nIf your service is junk then it's not\ngoing to be the most successful no matter\n\n1341\n01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,320\nhow well you plan.\n\n1342\n01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,980\nBut if it's a good service and\n\n1343\n01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:27,070\nyou put proper planning behind it, then\nyour odds of success are gonna be higher.\n\n1344\n01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:27,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1345\n01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,740\nThe nice thing about following these\nservice design processes that we've talked\n\n1346\n01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:36,000\nabout is it also ensures that you've\ncovered all the major areas that you need,\n\n1347\n01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,910\nand that you didn't leave anything out.\n\n1348\n01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:41,840\nSo, even if you go, well, I think I can\ndo most of it, that's perfectly fine.\n\n1349\n01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,580\nYou can leave out certain pieces\nthat are already taken care of.\n\n1350\n01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:48,270\nBut overall, make sure you follow\nall the processes, and that way\n\n1351\n01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,030\nyou're not sitting there after the design\ngoing, I didn't even consider that.\n\n1352\n01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:56,960\nSo it's a very great part, a good part,\nof what will help build your IT service.\n\n1353\n01:12:58,662 --> 01:13:02,920\n>> All right, well that pretty much\nboils it all down for service designs.\n\n1354\n01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,700\nWe're gonna wrap that one up here.\n\n1355\n01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,840\nYou know,\nwe still have several other areas to get.\n\n1356\n01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,468\nI think we've got service transition next,\nwhich is once we've done our design,\n\n1357\n01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:15,169\nit's time to get the service actually\nready and get it produced and\n\n1358\n01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:17,236\nready to move over into production.\n\n1359\n01:13:17,236 --> 01:13:20,057\nSo that's kind of our next\nstage that we move into.\n\n1360\n01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:22,820\nBut for now, this is a pretty\ngood spot to wrap up our show.\n\n1361\n01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,779\nSo let me remind you guys,\nif you have questions on anything that we\n\n1362\n01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:30,967\ntalked about, live during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1363\n01:13:30,967 --> 01:13:33,660\nAnd you'll see a chat box\nright beneath the video.\n\n1364\n01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:34,640\nPost your questions there.\n\n1365\n01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,870\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1366\n01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,030\nIf you go there and we're not live,\n\n1367\n01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,910\nif it's showing reruns,\nwell, use our Q&A forum.\n\n1368\n01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:43,850\nAt the top of every page you'll\nsee a link that says Q&A and\n\n1369\n01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,110\nyou can jump in there and\npost your questions.\n\n1370\n01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,290\nWe monitor and answer after the show.\n\n1371\n01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:52,382\nSo one way or another we'll get you the\nanswers to the questions that you have.\n\n1372\n01:13:52,382 --> 01:13:54,500\nAll right,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1373\n01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,850\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Don Pezet.\n\n1374\n01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:59,250\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1375\n01:13:59,250 -->

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:39,111\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:41,691\nI'm host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,600\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,940\n>> It is going well today,\nfeeling good and nice crisp and\n\n9\n00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,850\nclear morning here in Florida, and we are\nready to get started in IT foundations.\n\n10\n00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,990\n>> So Ronnie would you say you\nare ready to transition into show mode?\n\n11\n00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,292\n>> I am ready to transition into\na transformer of some sort.\n\n12\n00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,556\n>> It's the best little\nsegue I could think of.\n\n13\n00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:04,173\nToday we're diving back into ITIL\nFoundation, and it is time to start what\n\n14\n00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:08,439\nin my opinion is really the most\nimportant aspect of ITIL in general.\n\n15\n00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,469\nIs the service transition phase.\n\n16\n00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:16,026\nNow, service transition is\na commonly misunderstood area,\n\n17\n00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,740\nit is of the utmost importance.\n\n18\n00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,875\nAnd for companies that are just\ngetting started with ITIL,\n\n19\n00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:25,400\nit's normally service\ntransition is where they start.\n\n20\n00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,790\nI know that sounds weird.Throughout this\nshow we started with service strategy,\n\n21\n00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,190\nwe went through service design, and\nnow we're talking about this transition.\n\n22\n00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,770\nOur third service book.\n\n23\n00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,050\nAnd I'm saying this is where\na lot of people start.\n\n24\n00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,430\nWell what's that all about?\n\n25\n00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,790\nWell let's start with exactly what\nservice transition offers, and\n\n26\n00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,160\nyou'll start to see where\nthis is really valuable.\n\n27\n00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,940\nService transition covers taking\na service from that design process and\n\n28\n00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,700\nmoving it into production.\n\n29\n00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,020\nThose first two service books that we\ntalked about, the Service Strategy and\n\n30\n00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,560\nService Design.\n\n31\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,530\nNeither of them impact our\ncurrent production environment.\n\n32\n00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,330\nSo if your company is churning along\nmaking a certain amount of revenue\n\n33\n00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,960\nthe stuff you do in service strategy and\n\n34\n00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,300\nservice design does not\naffect that revenue yet.\n\n35\n00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,110\nIt's not until we actually roll forward\nwith performing the activities that we've\n\n36\n00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,560\ndesigned, and\nrolling them into production,\n\n37\n00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,080\nthat we start to affect things.\n\n38\n00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,950\nNow we're doing things that could affect\nour customers that absolutely will affect\n\n39\n00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,060\nour bottom line.\n\n40\n00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,550\nWe're moving this into production,\nand we're changing our business, and\n\n41\n00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,280\nthat's a big deal right there.\n\n42\n00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,990\nAnd this is such a high-impact thing,\nthat first off,\n\n43\n00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,430\ncompanies recognize how important that is,\nand secondly, there's a lot of risk here.\n\n44\n00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,660\nYou could actually really negatively\naffect your organization if you don't take\n\n45\n00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,060\nproper precautions.\n\n46\n00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,880\nAnd the service transition book\nis all about those precautions.\n\n47\n00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,250\nThe steps we can take to ensure our\ntransitions are nice and smooth as we move\n\n48\n00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,830\nthings into production and we get\nthe results that we originally sought.\n\n49\n00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,290\nAnd if we don't, that we have a way to get\nback out and put ourselves back to normal.\n\n50\n00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,680\nIf we don't take time, if we don't follow\nprocedures, you can put yourself in\n\n51\n00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,460\na really bad situation really quick and\nhave no recourse, no plan B.\n\n52\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,770\n>> Not only are we moving from design\nservices into our production area,\n\n53\n00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,020\nbut we may also be taking services away.\n\n54\n00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,140\nRetiring services that we now\nbelieve we no longer need, so\n\n55\n00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,880\nit gives us a little bit of time to go\nahead and say, how do we remove this and\n\n56\n00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,990\nnot affect what we're\ncurrently doing right now, and\n\n57\n00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,970\nstill ensure that we provide\nthe proper services that we need for\n\n58\n00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,950\npeople that may still\nbe depending on that.\n\n59\n00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,520\nHow do we get them over to\nanother service possibly?\n\n60\n00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,540\n>> Now, I'm glad you mentioned that,\n\n61\n00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,960\nbecause a lot of times we don't\nthink about that transition.\n\n62\n00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,870\nThere's actually three main\ntransitions that iTool calls out, and\n\n63\n00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,240\nthere's a new service\ncoming into production,\n\n64\n00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,580\nthere's a change to an existing service\nthat's already in production, and\n\n65\n00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,600\nthen there's the retiring of\na service that's in production.\n\n66\n00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,400\nAnd some people like to tack on a fourth\none which you won't see on the exam, but\n\n67\n00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,500\nyou might see mentioned in\na few books every here and\n\n68\n00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,060\nthere, which is transitioning\na service from one that you control\n\n69\n00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,140\nto one that a third party controls.\n\n70\n00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,970\nYou might actually be moving that service\nto a different business unit internally or\n\n71\n00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,280\njust an entirely different organization.\n\n72\n00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,470\nThere are times when you look at\nsomething like email And you say,\n\n73\n00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,590\nwe've been running our own e-mail\nserver for years, but you know what?\n\n74\n00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,320\nIt's time that we went ahead and\noutsourced that.\n\n75\n00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,550\nAnd, so we push it off and we use\nGoogle Apps for Work, or Outlook.com.\n\n76\n00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,180\nWhat?\n\n77\n00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:36,950\nThat's not it.\n\n78\n00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,370\nOh, Office 365, there we go.\n\n79\n00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,090\nAs we use one of those other services\nwhere another company hosts our e-mail for\n\n80\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,630\nus Email is still our service,\nit's still in production.\n\n81\n00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,720\nIn a lot of ways it may not have changed,\nif we ran internal exchange servers and\n\n82\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,770\nnow we move them up to Office 365,\nit's still exchange servers there, so\n\n83\n00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,090\nthe end users don't really\nsee a difference, but\n\n84\n00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,960\non the back end there's a lot of change\nthere as far as who's managing things.\n\n85\n00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,880\nSo service transitioning can apply to two.\n\n86\n00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,780\nFortunately the steps are really\nthe same regardless of which of those\n\n87\n00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,290\nscenarios you find yourselves in.\n\n88\n00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,380\nBut just remember\nthe three main scenarios.\n\n89\n00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,880\nA new service going into production,\na change to an existing service already in\n\n90\n00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,190\nproduction, or the retiring of\na service taking it out of production.\n\n91\n00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:23,320\nAll right now when we do our service\ntransition, while it is one of\n\n92\n00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,880\nthe most risky and where most of the\ndamage in a project can come into play,\n\n93\n00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,320\nit should also be one of the safest\nif we've done proper planning.\n\n94\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,812\nIn the design phase you created\na service design package, an SDP.\n\n95\n00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:43,500\nAnd so, a perfect world where\neverything worked the way we wanted.\n\n96\n00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,130\nService transition is really just\na matter of grabbing that SDP and\n\n97\n00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,630\ndoing what it tells us.\n\n98\n00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,946\nFollowing the steps and\nmove through as we move through and\n\n99\n00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:55,000\nimplement that service and production and\nhopefully everything goes nice and smooth.\n\n100\n00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,260\nAnd you're done, and that's it, right?\n\n101\n00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,550\nSo this should be the shortest\nof all five books.\n\n102\n00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,450\nThis should be easy.\n\n103\n00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,430\nFollow the STP.\nDone, right?\n\n104\n00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,740\nOne sentence,\nI just summarized the whole book, but\n\n105\n00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,400\nthat's in a perfect world and\nthat doesn't always happen.\n\n106\n00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800\nIn fact, I'd argue that most\nof the time it doesn't happen.\n\n107\n00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,650\nSo we have to have certain checks and\nbalances in place to ensure safety,\n\n108\n00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,370\nto ensure that even if things don't go\nas planned that we can correct for, or\n\n109\n00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,470\neven better if we can be proactive and\nspot potential areas where things might\n\n110\n00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,350\nnot go as planned and\nresolve them before they happen.\n\n111\n00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n112\n00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,710\nA lot of times what were also doing here\nis verifying that everything in that\n\n113\n00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,350\npackage is going to work,\neven before we begin transitioning over.\n\n114\n00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,900\nSo it gives us a little bit of time at\nthe very beginning of the planning of\n\n115\n00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,880\nthe transitioning to take a look\nat the service packages and\n\n116\n00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,020\nsay, here's what we need to cover,\n\n117\n00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,580\nhere's how we back out of it, here's also\nwhat we need to do if things go wrong.\n\n118\n00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,030\nSo it gives us time to do that.\n\n119\n00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,900\nSo during the transition,\nit may include several different tasks for\n\n120\n00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,060\nus as we get started.\n\n121\n00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,320\nSo when we talk about the idea\nof different tasks that\n\n122\n00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,010\nthe transition may include it includes\n\n123\n00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,250\nreally five different tasks that we may\nwant to make sure that we can cover.\n\n124\n00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,060\nWe'll talk about release planning,\nbuilding,\n\n125\n00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,970\ntesting, evaluation and deployment.\n\n126\n00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,608\nSo Don what's release planning?\n\n127\n00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:20,860\n>> Well with iTail, when they created\nall this, they're really thinking about\n\n128\n00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,200\nsoftware development environments right,\nand in software development you've got\n\n129\n00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,270\nterms like releases, but\nthis applies to IT departments in general.\n\n130\n00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,920\nSo if you are a CIS admin or\na network engineer and\n\n131\n00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,760\nyou are deploying equipment some of\nthis terminology doesn't match up.\n\n132\n00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,140\nSo, let me just address this from\nthe software development cycle and\n\n133\n00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,570\nthen we'll kind of see how\nthat applies elsewhere.\n\n134\n00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,630\nBut with release planning what we do is,\nyou know,\n\n135\n00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,375\nno software program is worth paying for.\n\n136\n00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It comes out and is done, right?\n\n137\n00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,250\nMost software programs\nwill be released and\n\n138\n00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,917\nthen over time new features are added,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:59,616\nAnd you'll see new features,\nyou'll see bug fixes, and\n\n140\n00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,667\nyou'll see security patches.\n\n141\n00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,550\nThose are the three types of updates\nthat most software will receive.\n\n142\n00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,270\nAnd as an end user we're\nnormally excited and waiting for\n\n143\n00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,130\nthose feature releases, right?\n\n144\n00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,081\nThe new release that's gonna come\nout that's gonna give us these new\n\n145\n00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:12,660\nfunctionalities.\n\n146\n00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,710\nThat's what we want, right?\n\n147\n00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,050\nBut there might be bug fixes.\n\n148\n00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,880\nOld functionality that just didn't\nquite work right that we repair and\n\n149\n00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,010\nget it working smoothly.\n\n150\n00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,033\nAnd end users might be waiting for\nthat or they might not.\n\n151\n00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:23,980\nThey might not be excited about it.\n\n152\n00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,190\nAnd then there's security patches which\nthe end users don't care about, but\n\n153\n00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,718\nthe IT department, we really do.\n\n154\n00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,890\nWe want those security patches.\n\n155\n00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,600\nThose are some of the most\nimportant updates that we push.\n\n156\n00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:40,160\nSo when we plan for a release, if it's\nthe initial release of a software program,\n\n157\n00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,790\nwe're saying at what point, at what level\nof features, and at what level of security\n\n158\n00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,860\nauditing and bug testing, do we determine\nthat this is ready to go into production?\n\n159\n00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,660\nIf the application is\nalready in production,\n\n160\n00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,820\nthen release planning is centering\naround what features and functions,\n\n161\n00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,612\nwhat stuff do we want to\nintroduce in this update?\n\n162\n00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:03,010\nYou've gotta draw a line somewhere or\nthe update will never be ready.\n\n163\n00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,030\nSo you hear about a lot of software\napplications that will go into\n\n164\n00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,440\na feature freeze.\n\n165\n00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,340\nAnd that's where they say okay,\nwe've added enough features now.\n\n166\n00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,250\nLet's freeze, no new features, and\nwe'll push this release out and\n\n167\n00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,340\nthen any new features you want\nwill go in the next release.\n\n168\n00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,630\nSo it's incremental updates from there.\n\n169\n00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,690\nSo release planning is\nall about figuring out\n\n170\n00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,250\nwhat is going to be\na part of this release.\n\n171\n00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,866\nWhat's going to be wrapped up in it and\npushed out as part of this update?\n\n172\n00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,855\nAll right,\nnow the next part is building, and\n\n173\n00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,080\nbuilding is actually creating the release.\n\n174\n00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000\nSoftware developers are gonna\nwrite this in source code,\n\n175\n00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,850\nand the source code gets compiled into\nan application that can then be run.\n\n176\n00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,380\nWell, when you compile it,\nthe source code you\n\n177\n00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,210\nchoose is gonna determine\nthe features that are being baked in.\n\n178\n00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,440\nSo you have to have some kind of\nversioning control system in place.\n\n179\n00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,960\nAnd we'll talk about how we can deal with\nthis later with like a DML and stuff.\n\n180\n00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,750\nBut basically we'll grab the data and\n\n181\n00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,100\nbuild it into the actual product\nthat we're going to be releasing.\n\n182\n00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,870\nAnd you never just trust\nthat it works right,\n\n183\n00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,260\nbecause developers will test very heavily\non the features that they developed.\n\n184\n00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,020\nBut when it comes to interaction between\nfeatures, they're not end users.\n\n185\n00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,290\nThey don't recreate some of the same\nscenarios that our end users will.\n\n186\n00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,110\nSo that's where we have to have testing.\n\n187\n00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,200\nEven though testing has probably already\nbeen done, we have an additional round of\n\n188\n00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,050\ntesting that's done on the official\nrelease that's going to come out.\n\n189\n00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,420\nAnd that might be private or\nit might be very public.\n\n190\n00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,140\nLook at Microsoft, right?\n\n191\n00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,030\nSo Windows 10 is coming out.\n\n192\n00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,350\nThey've announced that it's gonna be\ncoming out sometime early in 2015.\n\n193\n00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,430\nWell, they're releasing\ndeveloper builds right now.\n\n194\n00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,710\nSo they compile it, they get it all built,\nthey get it ready and\n\n195\n00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,750\nthey're releasing it to\ndevelopers to test it out.\n\n196\n00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,280\nThey're letting the public, anybody,\n\n197\n00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,060\nyou guys can go in and download it\nright now if you want, and try it out.\n\n198\n00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,280\nThat's part of their testing.\n\n199\n00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,910\nBecause you might find things\nthat they haven't detected and\n\n200\n00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,040\nreport them back, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,200\nAny critical flaws may need to be\naddressed before this can release and\n\n202\n00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,190\nthat may stop our transition right there,\nright,\n\n203\n00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,719\nwhich is nice because we've stopped\nbefore it went into production.\n\n204\n00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,360\nBut if everything tests out okay and\nwe have no critical flaws to deal with,\n\n205\n00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,460\nmaybe we find some other things and\n\n206\n00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,420\nwe say we'll fix that in the next release,\nbut we don't find anything too critical.\n\n207\n00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,090\nWell, we evaluate those results to\nmake sure we're all in agreement.\n\n208\n00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,960\nAnd then we're ready to\nactually do the deployment.\n\n209\n00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,290\nAnd that's where we take this and\ndeploy it into production.\n\n210\n00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,030\nThat's kind of the steps that\nwe go through from a software\n\n211\n00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,760\ndevelopment perspective.\n\n212\n00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,490\n>> If we take a look at\nit from the other side,\n\n213\n00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,330\nsuch as pushing out some\nhardware into our environment.\n\n214\n00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,180\nI know what I've dealt with\nis trying to figure out\n\n215\n00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,140\nwhat particular hardware\nwe need to implement.\n\n216\n00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,020\nSo getting to that point of release\nplanning, we may have to go through and\n\n217\n00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,470\nchoose what particular\nhardware we need and\n\n218\n00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,640\nalso what software we're gonna be\ndeploying into our environment first.\n\n219\n00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,570\nAnd we don't just go ahead buy and just go\nokay, we'll just try it as we go along.\n\n220\n00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,700\nBut what we do is we go ahead and\nwe spec out what we need to do, what we\n\n221\n00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,130\nneed to have on hand for the number of\nusers and everything that we have here.\n\n222\n00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,540\nAnd then we begin building that\nenvironment with the operating system that\n\n223\n00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,620\nwe need, the applications as well.\n\n224\n00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,717\nAnd then we begin a simple\ntesting environment,\n\n225\n00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:12,950\njust to verify that it's gonna give us\nall the functionality that we want.\n\n226\n00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,157\nAt that point,\nwe may then pull the trigger and\n\n227\n00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:20,037\nget everything that we need and\nget it ready to push out.\n\n228\n00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,900\n>> All right,\nnow this process can be pretty complex.\n\n229\n00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,848\nAnd if you are a small development team,\nif you're one of those tech startups where\n\n230\n00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:31,180\nyou've got all of your programmers\nsitting around one big table and\n\n231\n00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,990\nyou can do open communications,\nthis can be a very smooth process.\n\n232\n00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,960\nBut if you work for a large organization,\n\n233\n00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,470\nif you're subdividing parts of your\ndevelopment into different teams,\n\n234\n00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,870\nif the teams are in different cities,\nthis can become really challenging.\n\n235\n00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,430\nSo service transition will\noften incorporate an SKMS.\n\n236\n00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,950\nAnd I know I've alluded to\nthis in other episodes, but\n\n237\n00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,000\nI don't think we've\nspecifically talked about it.\n\n238\n00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,850\nAnd what it is is a service\nknowledge management system.\n\n239\n00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,100\nAnd the name kind of boils down to,\nservice knowledge.\n\n240\n00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,459\nAll the information we have about\nthat service, its origination,\n\n241\n00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,670\nits construction, its features,\nits development cycle, the whole thing,\n\n242\n00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,290\nall the knowledge we have about that\nservice in a management system.\n\n243\n00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,658\nSo some kind of software package\nthat we use to manage that.\n\n244\n00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:20,610\nAnd there are a ton of different\nsystems that are out there.\n\n245\n00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,710\nYou can see big examples.\n\n246\n00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,730\nSome are free and easy to implement,\nlike GitHub, which is just a website\n\n247\n00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,160\nwhere you post your code and you track all\nthe revisions and you reach agreements\n\n248\n00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,760\nbased on versioning and, you know,\nvery easy centralized management there.\n\n249\n00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,410\nThere's others that are far more\ncomplex that you can choose to use but\n\n250\n00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,260\nhave their own little power.\n\n251\n00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,050\nSo there's all sorts of neat\nstuff that's out there based on\n\n252\n00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,340\nwhat it is that your team\nis trying to achieve.\n\n253\n00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:53,430\nBut that's your SKMS and having a properly\ndeployed SKMS is pivotal to transition.\n\n254\n00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,080\nBecause that's how we're going to make\nsure everyone is on the same page, and\n\n255\n00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,645\nif a mistake is made that\nthe information is logged so\n\n256\n00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:03,030\nthat other people can learn from it.\n\n257\n00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,070\nIn project management we have\na term called lessons learned, and\n\n258\n00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,810\nyou'll even see it mentioned\nin some of the ITIL books too.\n\n259\n00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,170\nWhich is when there's a mistake,\n\n260\n00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,630\nyou've got to get as much benefit\nout of that mistake as you can.\n\n261\n00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,170\nAnd the best way to do that is to\ndocument how it came about, how it\n\n262\n00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:22,060\ncould have been prevented and what the\neffects were on the project at that time.\n\n263\n00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,860\nAnd you report that in your SKMS so\nother people can find and\n\n264\n00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,650\nlearn from that mistake.\n\n265\n00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,480\nThat's how you get a benefit\nfrom a negative situation.\n\n266\n00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,060\n>> Yeah, the nice thing about these\nknowledge management systems, of course,\n\n267\n00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,890\nalso is if we follow it through, if we\nuse it, we're less likely to miss steps.\n\n268\n00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,700\nSo even as we're going\nalong in the process, and\n\n269\n00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,980\nwe think that we're covering everything,\nif we don't have the system in place,\n\n270\n00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,950\nit's likely to go, okay, I know that\nthis is the natural thing to do,\n\n271\n00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,420\nand then at the end realize,\noh, I forgot that step.\n\n272\n00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420\nBy using this knowledge system as\nyou go along in the transition,\n\n273\n00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,390\nyou're hitting one thing after the other,\nand you're going, did I miss anything?\n\n274\n00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,780\nAnd you can look, and go, here it is.\n\n275\n00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,250\nSo that way you don't have to go back and\nrebuild part of it or to actually do it.\n\n276\n00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,800\nYou can learn from other people\nsaying here's a critical\n\n277\n00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,990\npart that you may have missed.\n\n278\n00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,070\nMake you sure you take the note.\n\n279\n00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,030\nSo it does help fill in those gaps\nin knowledge that we may have.\n\n280\n00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,570\n>> Now we're gonna throw around\nsome other terms later on,\n\n281\n00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,140\nlike a configuration management database\nand a configuration management system.\n\n282\n00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,140\nAn SKMS, it's big.\n\n283\n00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,430\nIt is managing all these different aspects\nof information about a service and\n\n284\n00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,390\nif you don't have one right now,\nif you're just starting out,\n\n285\n00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,360\nyou don't want to try and\nbite that off in one big chunk.\n\n286\n00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,340\nIt's really challenging to\nget a good solution in place.\n\n287\n00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,247\nAnd if you make a mistake and\nyou do a bad choice,\n\n288\n00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:45,449\nonce you have that SKMS\nfully deployed it's tough to\n\n289\n00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,917\nswitch to a different system without\nimpacting a team's performance.\n\n290\n00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:53,840\nSo most companies don't\njump straight into an SKMS.\n\n291\n00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,482\nThey normally start with what's called\na configuration management system, and\n\n292\n00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:01,778\nWe'll address that specifically\nin a process later, but\n\n293\n00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:06,690\nit's really just tracking the requirements\nfor the service how we're meeting them,\n\n294\n00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,530\nwhat happened if we didn't meet them,\nand so on.\n\n295\n00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,250\nBut it's all based on just\nthe configuration that the requirements\n\n296\n00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,150\nof that service and\nnot all the other aspects.\n\n297\n00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,100\nAnd then we add on more as\nour organization evolves and\n\n298\n00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,910\ngrows and develop into a full SKMS, so\n\n299\n00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,542\nthat's where you get kind\nof as your destination.\n\n300\n00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,640\nAll right now service transition\nit's a big thing, and\n\n301\n00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,630\nwe divide it up into a number of different\nprocesses that are available and\n\n302\n00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,070\nnot all of them are on the exam, but\nkind of like we did with service design,\n\n303\n00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,620\nI want to cover even the extra two\nthat aren't on the exam just for\n\n304\n00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,680\ncompleteness so\nyou guys know what's out there.\n\n305\n00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920\nBut it basically boils down like this.\n\n306\n00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,090\nWe've got seven processes and it starts\nwith transition planning and support.\n\n307\n00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,610\nThis is our first process because\nit's what sets the ground rules for\n\n308\n00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,040\nhow we do transitions.\n\n309\n00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,350\nTransition planning is not\nabout a particular SDP,\n\n310\n00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,160\nit's about SDPs in general.\n\n311\n00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,300\nWhat's our transition plan when a new SDP\ncomes in and we need to deploy a service?\n\n312\n00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,250\nWhat is it that we're gonna do as\nour standard operating procedure?\n\n313\n00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680\n>> We also have change management, too.\n\n314\n00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,810\nChange management allows us to be\nable to take what's in place and\n\n315\n00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,930\nto make sure that everybody is on board,\nthat when we make changes\n\n316\n00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,860\neverybody knows about it, that we agree\nto it, and it's authorized to be done.\n\n317\n00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,620\nA lot of times we're gonna talk about\nthings like change advisory boards and\n\n318\n00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,780\nemergency change advisory boards.\n\n319\n00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,910\nSo we'll see all that in place as we\nintroduce changes because what we don't\n\n320\n00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,980\nwant is somebody just saying, oh yeah,\nI made that change last week.\n\n321\n00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,700\nWhy didn't you tell us?\n\n322\n00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,900\nWell, because I didn't\nthink it was important, and\n\n323\n00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,710\nit affects multiple systems.\n\n324\n00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,650\nSo we're gonna talk about\nchange management in detail.\n\n325\n00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,840\n>> Yeah, and of all the features\nthat ITIL offers an organization,\n\n326\n00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,060\nITIL's a framework, you pick and choose\nthe pieces that you want to implement or\n\n327\n00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,730\nimplement the whole thing if\nyou want to go crazy with it.\n\n328\n00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,730\nIf you go to an executive out there,\nyou go to a CIO,\n\n329\n00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,910\nand you say what's the most\nattractive thing about ITIL?\n\n330\n00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,110\nA lot of them will answer,\nchange management,\n\n331\n00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,970\nit's that safety net for organization.\n\n332\n00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,180\nSo it is probably the most important\nof all the processes here in service\n\n333\n00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,362\ntransition and it's normally the one\nthat we start with when we deploy ITIL.\n\n334\n00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:19,360\nAll right, the next one we got is service\nasset and configuration management.\n\n335\n00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,670\nWe got change management and\nconfiguration management.\n\n336\n00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,040\nThey sound very similar, but\nwe'll see there's actually a difference.\n\n337\n00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,530\nService asset, we're really talking about\nany of the assets that are apart of\n\n338\n00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,930\nachieving our service.\n\n339\n00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,065\nAnd so these will, these will be people\nin some cases, but we're going to learn\n\n340\n00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,555\nabout something called configuration\nitems, which are special.\n\n341\n00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:40,045\nSo we'll get a chance to see that\nas part of this service asset\n\n342\n00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,985\nin configuration management process.\n\n343\n00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:44,555\n>> And also release and\ndeployment management too.\n\n344\n00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,635\nThis is when we feel like we're ready to\n\n345\n00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:50,955\nreally push everything out into\nthe production environment.\n\n346\n00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:55,075\nWe wanna make sure that all of our ducks\nin a row, so using the release and\n\n347\n00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,690\ndeployment management we're going\nthrough and just saying, all right.\n\n348\n00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,480\nEverything's going to be done,\nwhat's going to be the minimal impact that\n\n349\n00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,050\nwe're going to have on our\nproduction environment so\n\n350\n00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,270\nthat things can still carry on\nas we're pushing things out?\n\n351\n00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,890\n>> That's where the real work gets done,\nright?\n\n352\n00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,500\nYou're actually doing the release\ndeployment right there, so\n\n353\n00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,300\nthat's where the metal hits the road,\nor the rubber hits the road.\n\n354\n00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,315\nI guess you don't have metal tires.\n\n355\n00:19:15,315 --> 00:19:16,958\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe a train, the metal hits the rail?\n\n356\n00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,336\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright,\n\n357\n00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:22,780\nso the next one after that is\nservice validation and testing.\n\n358\n00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,290\nWe've already talked about\nhow important testing is.\n\n359\n00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,120\nYou don't just do testing\nbefore the deployment,\n\n360\n00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,210\nyou've gotta do testing afterwards too.\n\n361\n00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,390\nSo we'll see validation in testing to make\nsure things went the way that we expected\n\n362\n00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,880\nthem to go, because if they\ndidn't we need to evaluate them.\n\n363\n00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,690\nWe need to jump in and\nget that corrected as quickly as possible.\n\n364\n00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,010\nSo, that's the next thing in line there.\n\n365\n00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,730\n>> Yeah.\n\n366\n00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,950\nWe also have change evaluation.\n\n367\n00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,700\nIt's not enough just to say that\nwe put it into the environment.\n\n368\n00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,960\nWe want to make sure, of course,\nas it's in real production environment,\n\n369\n00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,030\nthat it is functioning up to the level\nthat our customers want it to be.\n\n370\n00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,330\nAnd if it's not, what do we need\nto do to get it at that level, or\n\n371\n00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,710\nmaybe when we have to implement a new\nchange and say look this isn't working\n\n372\n00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,950\nthat we needed it to, even though we\nthought everything would go fine and\n\n373\n00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,020\neven though testing showed\nthat it would happen but\n\n374\n00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,770\nnow we have to actually take a look and\njust validate or evaluate what's going on.\n\n375\n00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,970\nA change is kind of like a promise.\n\n376\n00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,760\nWe promise if you do these things,\n\n377\n00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,510\nthe efficiency in your\nsystem will be 10% greater.\n\n378\n00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,800\nThat's a promise that change is making.\n\n379\n00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,530\nOr, there is a critical bug in\nour system we are at risk, and\n\n380\n00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,680\nif you make this change we'll be safe,\nright?\n\n381\n00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,260\nThat's a promise,\nthat change is making and\n\n382\n00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,560\nchange evaluation is all about\nmaking sure that the promise is met.\n\n383\n00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,050\nAre we actually that much more efficient?\n\n384\n00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,640\nAre we now safe?\n\n385\n00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,850\nHas this exploit been patched,\nwhatever it is.\n\n386\n00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,980\nSo we're just double checking.\n\n387\n00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,130\nAnd then our last one is\nknowledge management, and\n\n388\n00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,550\nknowledge management is saying we\nneed to log all this into our SKMS.\n\n389\n00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,630\nWe need to get it all recorded so that\nwe can benefit from this in the future.\n\n390\n00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,420\nNow on the exam, those last two,\nchange evaluation and acknowledgement.\n\n391\n00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,450\nThey don't really hit on those two but\nI do want to cover them.\n\n392\n00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,570\nThe reason they don't hit on them on\nthe exam is, they're kind of common sense.\n\n393\n00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,655\nIf you make a change you need to make\nsure you did it right and it worked.\n\n394\n00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,860\nAnd you need to record your knowledge,\nand we already talked about SKMS so\n\n395\n00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,050\nthere's not much to add there.\n\n396\n00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,170\nSo you'll see those are two really\nsmall processes, bhey are important.\n\n397\n00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,310\nI just want to make sure that we\nhighlight those so we can remember them.\n\n398\n00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,408\nAll right, so those are the basic\naspects of service transition, and\n\n399\n00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:24,964\nwhat we're going to do next, we're going\nto take each of those processes and\n\n400\n00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,865\nbreak them down into their components.\n\n401\n00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:31,650\nWhat's actually happening inside of them,\nhow they function, and what they do.\n\n402\n00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,350\nNow our introduction took\na little bit longer than\n\n403\n00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,960\nnormal because it's a lot of stuff.\n\n404\n00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,590\nI mean there's a lot of things\ninvolved in service transition,\n\n405\n00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,440\nso normally at this point in the show\nwe jump into our first process but\n\n406\n00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,520\nthere's not really all that\nmuch time on this segment.\n\n407\n00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,339\nSo let's stop here and take a break and\nwhen we get back we'll jump into\n\n408\n00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,732\nour first process which is\ntransition planning and support.\n\n409\n00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:52,637\nSo stay tuned.\n\n410\n00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:53,938\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n411\n00:21:53,938 --> 00:22:01,580\n[MUSIC]\n\n412\n00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,927\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n413\n00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:07,647\nSo the first process that we're\ngonna tackle is one that it's\n\n414\n00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:09,290\nan ongoing process.\n\n415\n00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,570\nIt's something that you'll use routinely\nthroughout your organization, but\n\n416\n00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,410\nit doesn't pertain to\na particular service.\n\n417\n00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,830\nIt's our overall service transition plan.\n\n418\n00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,770\nThe method that we handle transitions and\nso\n\n419\n00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,350\nit's called, Transition,\nplanning, and support.\n\n420\n00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,030\nAnd in this process what we're doing is\nwe're basically creating that procedure,\n\n421\n00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,470\nhow we're going to handle things.\n\n422\n00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,580\nIt's important to have a standard plan so\nthat everybody knows what to follow.\n\n423\n00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,880\nIf they want to push a new\nservice into production\n\n424\n00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,600\nwhat do they have to have put together?\n\n425\n00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,880\nAnd at a minimum, it's gonna be that SDP,\nthat service design package.\n\n426\n00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,890\nBut, what all is in the SDP?\n\n427\n00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,830\nWhat do they need to do\nto get the service ready,\n\n428\n00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,130\nbefore they even approach the transition\nteam to move that into production?\n\n429\n00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,130\nAlright, and\nwe've got to have that documented in,\n\n430\n00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,770\njust a set of procedures everyone\nfollows to create consistency.\n\n431\n00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,360\n>> With the support side\nwe also need to make\n\n432\n00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,905\nsure that we have the appropriate\nresources available and ready to go so\n\n433\n00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:08,495\nwe need to coordinate our resources\nto ensure that we're not overlapping,\n\n434\n00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:12,955\nand we have enough people on hand to make\nthis transition happen successfully.\n\n435\n00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:15,525\nSometimes you get a little bit starved for\nthe resources and\n\n436\n00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,940\nso even though the entire\ntransition was going well\n\n437\n00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,020\nthere's that one point where all of\na sudden you don't have enough and\n\n438\n00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,590\nthat's where it actually\nstarts to kind of fall apart.\n\n439\n00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,700\n>> Also keep in mind that in the design\nphase, a lot of what they're doing when\n\n440\n00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,830\nthey do service design is kind of\ncreating a best case scenario.\n\n441\n00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,020\nAnd so they say all right,\nwe're going to deploy this.\n\n442\n00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,650\nAnd during the deployment, we're going\nto need two database administrators.\n\n443\n00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,150\nWe'll need two DBAs to manage the creation\nof some of this stuff and we'll need at\n\n444\n00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,495\nleast one web developer to be on hand\nbecause there's some code that'll have\n\n445\n00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:50,542\nto be changed during the deployment,\nit can't be done ahead of time.\n\n446\n00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,342\nThings like that happen, and so\n\n447\n00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:56,350\nthey'll list out the resources that\nthey need during the deployment.\n\n448\n00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,752\nWell, when we reach transition We've\ngot to secure those resources and\n\n449\n00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:05,050\nthey might not be available the way\nit was originally designed.\n\n450\n00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,490\nYeah, you need two DVAs, and\nour company employs two DVAs but\n\n451\n00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,980\nwhere you scheduled that transition,\none of the DVAs is already out.\n\n452\n00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,010\nSo we only got one available so\nwe either need to move the transition to\n\n453\n00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,210\nanother date, or secure a third party DVA,\ncontract somebody into coming and\n\n454\n00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,940\npick up the slack,\nif we want to maintain our schedule.\n\n455\n00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,670\nSo, during service transition is\nwhere we start to juggle those\n\n456\n00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,720\ntriple constraints, right?\n\n457\n00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,200\nThe cost, quality, schedule.\n\n458\n00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,010\nCost, how much money we're spending.\n\n459\n00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,970\nSchedule, when we're going to\ntry to get this thing done.\n\n460\n00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,850\nAnd the quality is meeting\nall the requirements\n\n461\n00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,590\nset out in this particular release.\n\n462\n00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,600\nSo to make sure we meet all those.\n\n463\n00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,350\nYou might say alright\nwe've got only one DBA, so\n\n464\n00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,060\nwhat if we split this into two releases\nand we just do a smaller one first and\n\n465\n00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,280\none DBA can handle the work, then we\nschedule the second one for later, or we\n\n466\n00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,620\nlengthen the schedule so that instead of\ntransitioning over one day in needing to\n\n467\n00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:10,080\nDBAs maybe we can make it happen over two\ndays so that one DBA can do all the work.\n\n468\n00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,840\nHere we are doing a juggling act.\n\n469\n00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,540\nRight?\nWe're\n\n470\n00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,180\njuggling those triple\nconstraints to get the balance.\n\n471\n00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,690\nSo, we need to establish\nhow that's handled.\n\n472\n00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,460\nAnd we need to give the team\nthat's responsible for\n\n473\n00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,240\ntransition the authority to do that.\n\n474\n00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,050\nWhat you don't want is to\nhave a project manager or\n\n475\n00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:29,260\nsomebody who tries to brute force their\nway through the transition team and push\n\n476\n00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,170\na service into production that isn't ready\nor isn't able to be deployed correctly.\n\n477\n00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,060\nMaybe it's perfectly ready, but\n\n478\n00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,846\nwithout the right resources\nwe can't do it correctly.\n\n479\n00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,170\nSo we've got to have\nthe authority in there, and\n\n480\n00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,620\nthat's all something that comes from\ntransition, planning and support.\n\n481\n00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,630\n>> Also in transition support,\nwe have to manage risks.\n\n482\n00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,230\nThe whole idea is not just\nto throw it in and go,\n\n483\n00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,510\nokay we'll deal with\nthings as they come along.\n\n484\n00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,210\nBut is to take a look at\nthe transition and go all right,\n\n485\n00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,730\nhow do we minimize as much risk as\npossible so that the business can\n\n486\n00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,050\nstill continue to function, we're still\ndoing the things that we need to, and\n\n487\n00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,080\nthat we actually are causing the least\ndisruption that we possibly can so\n\n488\n00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,800\nthat we're not having to try and\ncreate more or do more.\n\n489\n00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,800\nOr get one of those triple constraints\nout of balance, so we try and\n\n490\n00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,010\nminimize as much risk as possible\nby using the planning and\n\n491\n00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,030\nthe transition during the transition phase\n>> Yeah, and in the design phase,\n\n492\n00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,230\nif they've done their job,\nthey've already identified the risks.\n\n493\n00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,270\nThey've already come up\nwith the mitigation plans.\n\n494\n00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,200\nThat's right,\nhow are they going to handle the risk?\n\n495\n00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,870\nSo for us, we are just setting\nup policy here that says,\n\n496\n00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,000\nwhen we start to do this service\ntransition we need to enact all of\n\n497\n00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,650\nthe risk minimization efforts that they\ncreated in the service design package.\n\n498\n00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,530\nWe are going to enact those.\n\n499\n00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,910\nSo what is the process for that.\n\n500\n00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,560\nIf in design they said, we are going to\nbuy insurance to cover potential outage\n\n501\n00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,360\nduring the update, well during transition\nwe need to secure that insurance and\n\n502\n00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,190\nwe may need to apply a claim\nif something happens.\n\n503\n00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,470\nAnd so we need to know the process for\n\n504\n00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,080\nthat, which means we need to get\nthe information from the SDP.\n\n505\n00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,350\nSo we just need to define\nwhat that process is, right.\n\n506\n00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,680\nThis is all fairly generic.\n\n507\n00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,600\nThese are things that we want to be able\nto apply to every transition that we\n\n508\n00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600\nperform throughout.\n\n509\n00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,620\nThis is just the steps we follow as\na part of managing the risk as identified\n\n510\n00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,140\nin the SDP.\n\n511\n00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,580\nNow, conflicts can arise\nduring a transition.\n\n512\n00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,650\nWhen you're doing the transition,\nnow if you're on the transition team,\n\n513\n00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,110\nyou're pretty much following\nthe SDP to the letter.\n\n514\n00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,810\nThere are times where there might\nbe ambiguous instructions in there.\n\n515\n00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,500\nThere might be a last minute\nchange that comes along.\n\n516\n00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,120\nAnd we need a process for\nresolving conflict to handle that, right?\n\n517\n00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,700\nIf there's a last minute change,\n\n518\n00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,850\ncan the transition team just say no,\nit's too late?\n\n519\n00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,390\nYou've already started transition, and\nyou're past that point of no return?\n\n520\n00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,670\nMaybe there's a certain point that we\ndictate is the point of no return.\n\n521\n00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,150\nThat needs to be defined early on.\n\n522\n00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,360\nAnd that can resolve conflict\nbefore it even starts.\n\n523\n00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,010\nYou can say, all right when you submit\nthe SDP to the transition team,\n\n524\n00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,510\nthey are going to start their\nplanning you've got ten days.\n\n525\n00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,070\nAfter ten days,\nthe transition team is moving forward and\n\n526\n00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,170\nthe SDP cannot be changed until\nthe transition is complete.\n\n527\n00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,540\nWhich means we would need\nanother transition for\n\n528\n00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,050\nany other changes that came in afterwards.\n\n529\n00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,720\nYou know, just the next release.\n\n530\n00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,350\nThis is where we see things\nlike feature freezes come in.\n\n531\n00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,000\nIf we have that documented in our\nprocess then people know that.\n\n532\n00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,690\nThey'll be like well, I want to make this\nchange, but it's day 11, it's too late.\n\n533\n00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,250\nThere's no point in me trying to force\nthis in, it's too late, all right?\n\n534\n00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,000\nAnd they'll know when I submit a new SDP,\nI need to submit it at least\n\n535\n00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,720\nten days prior to when I want it\nimplemented, unless it's an emergency.\n\n536\n00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,300\nSo we have to have emergency\ncontingencies in here too.\n\n537\n00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,660\nFor critical changes that move through.\n\n538\n00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,790\nWe'll talk about those later.\n\n539\n00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,130\n>> Remember that transitions can\nactually be a part of a small project.\n\n540\n00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,040\nSo in every project you may have certain\ntransitions that you're actually bringing\n\n541\n00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,350\nyour new software to.\n\n542\n00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,580\nOr it may be a new server\nthat we're implementing.\n\n543\n00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,500\nBut that can actually have been\na part of a larger project in.\n\n544\n00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,810\nAnd what we have so we will want to make\nsure that the transition coordinates with\n\n545\n00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,920\nthe overall plan of the project and\nit also ends up coordinating\n\n546\n00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,130\nwith the entire program of what\nthe company actually wanted to do overall.\n\n547\n00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,700\nSometimes we may figure out as we go\nthrough this it's not coordinated and\n\n548\n00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,850\nnow, we're actually thinking that we're\ngoing to have the available space we need\n\n549\n00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,280\ninside of inside that server process right\nthen, and there's another team working.\n\n550\n00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,990\nWell, without the coordination that needs\ngone, we're not going to actually be able\n\n551\n00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,740\nto do what we need to, and\neverything else is going to fall behind.\n\n552\n00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,310\nOur transition is not\ngoing to be successful.\n\n553\n00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,680\n>> Yeah, and\na big part of this coordination is,\n\n554\n00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,200\nremember the ITIL is service management.\n\n555\n00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200\nIt's your day to day operations.\n\n556\n00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,670\nYou're company may also\nhave project management.\n\n557\n00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,490\nOr, if you have a lot of projects,you\nmight even have program management.\n\n558\n00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,100\nAnd so, those guys are really\noperating within the same realm as\n\n559\n00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,840\nwhat we're doing as part of our\nregular service management.\n\n560\n00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,050\nIn fact, a lot of companies\nthey look it as every project\n\n561\n00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,650\nis kind of under the helm\nof service management.\n\n562\n00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,710\nBut not every service management\nactivity is a project.\n\n563\n00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,020\nAnd so,\nthere's this kind of variation there.\n\n564\n00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,150\nBut, we need to make sure that\nit's all coordinated, and\n\n565\n00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,530\nyou'll find that these\nthings line up pretty well.\n\n566\n00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,770\nI know I've talked about the PMIs PMBOK,,\nthe product management body of knowledge,\n\n567\n00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,960\nand it lines up pretty closely\nwith the stuff that we see\n\n568\n00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,920\nin the service design book, and\nthe service transition book.\n\n569\n00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,470\nThose two really lay\nout to the PMBOK stuff.\n\n570\n00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,620\nOn the strategy side they don't\nreally line up very much.\n\n571\n00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,940\nAnd then we'll see on some of the other\nbooks where it doesn't quite line up, but\n\n572\n00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,720\non these two it really does so\ncoordinating that's not so difficult.\n\n573\n00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,710\nMost of this should have been looked\nat in design, but this is our chance to\n\n574\n00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,790\ndouble check and make sure that all of\nthis is being taken into consideration.\n\n575\n00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,970\nAnd then just remember that\ndeviation can occur, right?\n\n576\n00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,190\nWe can have it where the plan just\ndoesn't go off as we expected.\n\n577\n00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:55,350\nSo we may need to output a few things\nout of transition planning, and\n\n578\n00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,750\nthat is our typical offer\nmight be increased budget,\n\n579\n00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,670\nif we increase cost for some reason,\nor changing requirements,\n\n580\n00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:08,670\nchanging schedule as a result of\nwhat is going on in production.\n\n581\n00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,650\nThe design might not\nhave taken into account.\n\n582\n00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,950\nSo, if that's a possibility,\nwe need to have templates,\n\n583\n00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,890\nforms, different methodologies\nput in place to communicate that.\n\n584\n00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,980\nSo, when you submit an SDP to the\ntransition team, and the transition team\n\n585\n00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,850\ncomes back and says, all right, we know\nyou want to deploy this on January 14th,\n\n586\n00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,620\nbut, that's not a great day in\nthe production environment,\n\n587\n00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,990\nwe're not going to be able to roll there,\nhow 'bout January 16th?\n\n588\n00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,920\nRight.\nThey are recommending\n\n589\n00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,980\na different schedule.\n\n590\n00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,180\nWell, how do we do that?\n\n591\n00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,250\nWhat's the procedure somebody follows\nbecause the design team might\n\n592\n00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,770\nhave picked January 14th rave very\nspecific reason, and while January 16th\n\n593\n00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,560\nmight work better for the transition team,\nno we've got to make a decision,\n\n594\n00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,460\nand what is it that's on January 14th\nthat's making this not possible?\n\n595\n00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,780\nWe need prioritization, right?\n\n596\n00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,833\nAnd that's where these teams won't be\nable to act independently on that.\n\n597\n00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,352\nWe're going to have to have\na process in place to resolve it and\n\n598\n00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,810\ndetermine the way to move forward.\n\n599\n00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,917\nSo being prepared For those eventualities.\n\n600\n00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:09,786\nFor the times on the schedule or\nthe cost of resources as the change and\n\n601\n00:32:09,786 --> 00:32:12,270\nunderstanding how to handle that, right?\n\n602\n00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,790\nSo, think transition planning and support.\n\n603\n00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:20,120\nThis whole process as a framework for\nhow your transition phase is going to run.\n\n604\n00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,960\nNow, all of the other processes\nthat we are going to talk about is,\n\n605\n00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,500\nthe other six are the actual\nactivities that they get performed.\n\n606\n00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,790\nSo this one is not really doing\nthe work is that general frame work.\n\n607\n00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,100\nLet's move into the next one.\n\n608\n00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,690\nThe next one is the biggest one that\nis Change management, all right?\n\n609\n00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,350\nAny time you do something to your\nproduction environment, it's a change.\n\n610\n00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,030\nWhether it be introducing a new service,\nmodifying an existing service,\n\n611\n00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,070\nretiring a service,\nall of these things are changes.\n\n612\n00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,330\nAnd if you have people jumping in and\n\n613\n00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,740\nmaking unauthorized changes,\nyou can really end up in quite a mess.\n\n614\n00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,630\nAnd Ronnie, you and I,\n\n615\n00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,860\nwe could probably film\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n616\n00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,810\n>> Several shows of just horror stories\n\n617\n00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,590\nabout this, but one of the examples\nI always go back to is,\n\n618\n00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,470\nI worked in an insurance\ncompany years ago.\n\n619\n00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,400\nAnd one of my peers that I work\nwith was just this brilliant guy,\n\n620\n00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,190\nand an amazing work ethic very,\nvery intelligent.\n\n621\n00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,900\nAnd he did a lot of stuff.\n\n622\n00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,850\nBut he would take these\nvacations throughout the year.\n\n623\n00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:32,820\nAnd you always knew he was about to take a\nvacation because he'd start working extra\n\n624\n00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,480\nhard, he'd try and make up for the work\nhe was going to miss while on vacation.\n\n625\n00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,340\nWhich is commendable, right?\n\n626\n00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,870\nAnd he would just be\nputting in extra hours and\n\n627\n00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,170\ndoing tons of configuration changes in the\nenvironment and then he'd go on vacation.\n\n628\n00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:51,300\nAnd we'd all come back on Monday and\nhe'd be out on vacation and\n\n629\n00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,190\ntrouble tickets, which start coming in,\nand the helpdesk couldn't resolve them,\n\n630\n00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,920\nand they start escalating up, and\nthey'd get to my team eventually.\n\n631\n00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,330\nAnd we'd look at them and\ngo well crap, what happened here?\n\n632\n00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,690\nWhat's different today from what was going\non last week when everybody was happy?\n\n633\n00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,880\nWhat happened?\n\n634\n00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,170\nWell, I don't know.\n\n635\n00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,206\nNow I got to go and find out.\n\n636\n00:34:09,206 --> 00:34:10,510\nSo we got to start doing research and\n\n637\n00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,210\nanalysis and isolating the problem and\nfinding it out.\n\n638\n00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,410\nAnd after an hour, or two hours,\nyou finally isolate it and\n\n639\n00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,360\nyou see, oh look at this,\nhe changed this on Friday.\n\n640\n00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,380\nWhy did he do that?\n\n641\n00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,410\nWhy did he change this?\n\n642\n00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,540\nWhat was he trying to accomplish?\n\n643\n00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,640\nAnd now I got to fix it.\n\n644\n00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,040\nBut if we had change management in place,\nit would have been documented.\n\n645\n00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,430\nI would've known the changes\nhe made on Friday.\n\n646\n00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,670\nNot only that, but\n\n647\n00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,360\nI would've known how to undo them in\nthe event that something crazy happened.\n\n648\n00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,190\nInstead of spending hours isolating and\ntargeting that issues and\n\n649\n00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,400\nmy end users being impacted I\ncould've saved a lot of time and\n\n650\n00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,460\nhad that resolved very very quickly.\n\n651\n00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,460\nAnd proper testing would've turned\nup the problem even when he didn't.\n\n652\n00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,840\nSo that was a problem.\n\n653\n00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,250\nThat's what happened.\n\n654\n00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,900\nWith companies that weren't\nmanaged via things like ITEL and\n\n655\n00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,210\nthat particular company was not.\n\n656\n00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,030\nIt was pretty much the wild west where\npeople making changes in production and\n\n657\n00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,340\nthat is bad.\n\n658\n00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,190\nChange management seeks to correct that\n>> Unauthorized changes are bad because it\n\n659\n00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,810\ncan affect things like time and\n\n660\n00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:13,200\nschedule .Things that we would have\nactually been able to get done, we now\n\n661\n00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,480\nhave to take time to resolve issues that\npop up due to these unauthorized changes.\n\n662\n00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,550\nBecause of that,\nwe may have to assign extra resources\n\n663\n00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,490\nto be able to figure out what the problem\nis and the scope of the problem too,\n\n664\n00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,850\nand so that now ends up\ncosting more money as well\n\n665\n00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,340\nas now degradation of services that we\nnow have to bring back up to specs.\n\n666\n00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,330\nI mean there's a lot of different\nthings that have to come together when\n\n667\n00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,840\nan unauthorized change happens so that we\ncan get everything at least back on par.\n\n668\n00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,870\nSo change management is\nincredibly important to us.\n\n669\n00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,810\nAnd make sure, for\nour entire organization,\n\n670\n00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,250\nthat we have it managed well.\n\n671\n00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,680\nDocumented and that we can refer\nto it easily is a key tip.\n\n672\n00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,640\n>> Do not fall into the habit\nof thinking that change is bad.\n\n673\n00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,370\nChange is usually good we talked\nabout reasons we make changes before.\n\n674\n00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,370\nMaybe we are introduction new features,\nwhich creates value for our customers.\n\n675\n00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,620\nThat is our ultimate goal all of this, the\nwhole ITIL thing, is to create value for\n\n676\n00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,424\nour customers, right?\n\n677\n00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,845\n[LAUGH] An ITIL thing.\n\n678\n00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:09,770\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n679\n00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,609\n>> I got to come up with\n\n680\n00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:12,110\nbetter terminology than that.\n\n681\n00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,710\nBut so change can create value for\n\n682\n00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,860\nthe customer by introducing new features,\nall right?\n\n683\n00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,920\nIt can fix bugs.\n\n684\n00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,460\nThings that were supposed\nto work that didn't.\n\n685\n00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,580\nAnd now we fix them so they do work\nagain bringing value to our customers.\n\n686\n00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,450\nAnd then, it could be a security patch.\n\n687\n00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,460\nThat could be fixing an exploit to\nmake sure we don't get hacked and\n\n688\n00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,000\nour data gets compromised.\n\n689\n00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,850\nWe're protecting our users and while that\ndoesn't directly bring value to them.\n\n690\n00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:38,310\nIt prevents you from losing value, cause\nif you do get hacked and you send them\n\n691\n00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,960\nthat letter saying, we're sorry but\non this date your data was compromised,\n\n692\n00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,260\nand you might want to\nchange your password and\n\n693\n00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,560\nhere is a free year of\ncredit monitoring service.\n\n694\n00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,885\nI personally have credit\nmonitoring service for\n\n695\n00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:52,605\nthe rest of my life thanks to companies.\n\n696\n00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:56,325\nI went to college at university of\nFlorida and they got hacked and\n\n697\n00:36:56,325 --> 00:37:00,690\nall my data got leaked out including my\nsocial security number, that was awesome.\n\n698\n00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,130\nThen you've got the Target hack, and\nall these other ones, where companies keep\n\n699\n00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,580\nsending me this letter saying, here's\nyour free year of credit monitoring.\n\n700\n00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,350\nThat's supposed to make me feel better,\nbut it really doesn't.\n\n701\n00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,280\nThat takes away value for the customer.\n\n702\n00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,680\nChange is not a bad thing.\n\n703\n00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,890\nIt's always Improving, or\nshould always be improving.\n\n704\n00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,070\nBut change will usually result in\ncertain things getting modified.\n\n705\n00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,240\nAnd there's our triple constraints.\n\n706\n00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,360\nOur budget, our schedule, and our quality.\n\n707\n00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,500\nNow quality that really match\nup with requirements, right.\n\n708\n00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,010\nSo the requirements that a customer\nmight have when they ask for\n\n709\n00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,950\na product to be designed.\n\n710\n00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,480\nOr a software program.\n\n711\n00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,040\nThose requirements might change.\n\n712\n00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,930\nAnd so\nnow I've got to start modifying that.\n\n713\n00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,910\nAnd that's usually where\nwe see new features,\n\n714\n00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,550\nor reduced features to increase speed,\ndifferent things like that.\n\n715\n00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,330\nBut I always like to add a fourth one,\nwhich is resources.\n\n716\n00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,590\nAnd here I'm talking about people and\nnow in ITIL our resource could be people,\n\n717\n00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,440\ncould be money, could be technology,\ncould be a lot of things.\n\n718\n00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,940\nMoney is kind of covered by budget though,\n\n719\n00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,860\nso I'm really talking about people and\nthere are times where\n\n720\n00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,610\na change in a project might actually\ncenter around rotating Is the aff out.\n\n721\n00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,160\nAnd some people don't push that\nthrough change management but\n\n722\n00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,060\nyou really should because there is times\nwhen you are changing out people from\n\n723\n00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,320\nthe wrong reason and you need to be able\nto have checks and balances on that.\n\n724\n00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,000\nSo, it's an extra thing, but\n\n725\n00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,810\nregardless of which thing it is that we\nare modifying no matter which one, and\n\n726\n00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,730\nno matter how safe it seems,\nevery change introduces risk.\n\n727\n00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:35,640\nYour system, if it's running 100%\nflawlessly and moving along just great.\n\n728\n00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,880\nWhen you make a change to it,\nno matter how well\n\n729\n00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,990\nplanned there's always that risk that\nunforeseen circumstances can happen.\n\n730\n00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,930\nAnd so, regardless of the amount of\nplanning that goes on we just need to make\n\n731\n00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,390\nsure we've got planning for what ifs.\n\n732\n00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,460\nWhat if things don't go quite right?\n\n733\n00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,780\nSo that management of risk\nis really important, and\n\n734\n00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,640\nthat's part of what change\nmanagement helps with.\n\n735\n00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,880\n>> Yeah.\n\n736\n00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,830\nWe always try to implement the changes,\n\n737\n00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,760\nlike we've just said,\nreally to help us to make things better.\n\n738\n00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,020\nWe always want to try and\nminimize as much of the risk as possible,\n\n739\n00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,820\nwe always want to make the changes\nthat really do help to improve\n\n740\n00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,670\nour users' ability to do\nthe things that they want to.\n\n741\n00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:18,500\nSometimes though, the changes, again,\ndone just to correct problems that have\n\n742\n00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,390\nexisted, so that we're bringing\neverything back into alignment.\n\n743\n00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,740\nBut, even if we do all this, right,\nwith the risks that are actually on hand,\n\n744\n00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,750\nwhat we need to do is to be able to\nevaluate whether those changes are really\n\n745\n00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:35,630\nnecessary right then, or whether we\nactually can let them ride a little\n\n746\n00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,300\nbit until we can actually control them and\nbring them on in a better fashion.\n\n747\n00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,852\nSo just going let's do it right now and\njust worry about the consequences later,\n\n748\n00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:48,185\nit's .always about\ncontrolling the changes,\n\n749\n00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:51,445\nthat's where change\nmanagement really is correct.\n\n750\n00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:55,165\n>> Yeah so change management really is\nlike a traffic cop or a gatekeeper.\n\n751\n00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:59,231\nIf somebody wants to make a modification\nyou're production environment they're not\n\n752\n00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,251\nallowed to just go and\ndo it they've got to go through a process.\n\n753\n00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:04,417\nSo that's what this process is all about.\n\n754\n00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:07,334\nWhat are the steps involved in\nactually making that change.\n\n755\n00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:10,535\nAnd so we need to dictate\nthe forms they've got to fill out,\n\n756\n00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:15,375\nthe information they've got to provide,\nand then, who's allowed to authorize that.\n\n757\n00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,300\nWho's allowed to say yes,\nyou can make that change,\n\n758\n00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,280\nor no you can't make that change.\n\n759\n00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,960\nSomebody has got to be the gate keeper.\n\n760\n00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,980\nAnd then, after the change has been made,\nsomebody's got to be responsible for\n\n761\n00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,390\nchecking the change and documenting\nthe change and having a record of it, so\n\n762\n00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,896\nwe can refer back and see what did change.\n\n763\n00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:36,770\nAnd if you've ever worked\nin IT tech support and\n\n764\n00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,730\nuser support, they call up and they say,\nhey, I can't print to my printer.\n\n765\n00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,060\nOne of the first questions we ask is,\nwell, all right,\n\n766\n00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,030\nhave you changed anything on your\ncomputer since the last time you printed?\n\n767\n00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,940\nAnd the answer's always no.\n\n768\n00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,040\nThey always say, no,\nI didn't change anything.\n\n769\n00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,900\nThen, you find out later on that they did.\n\n770\n00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,980\nThey moved the printer to\ndifferent place on their desk, and\n\n771\n00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,180\nthe cable's now unplugged,\nor something like that.\n\n772\n00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,760\nAnd so, they just don't take\nthat into consideration.\n\n773\n00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,420\nWell, in IT with our production services,\nwe know better.\n\n774\n00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,000\nWe know when we're making\nsome kind of a modification.\n\n775\n00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,710\nSo, change is that gatekeeper.\n\n776\n00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,410\nAnd if we're gonna implement that\nkind of restrictive control,\n\n777\n00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,890\nwe need to figure out where to start.\n\n778\n00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,840\nNow, you might not have to\ncreate this from scratch.\n\n779\n00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,320\nMany companies have change management as\npart of their organizational structure.\n\n780\n00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,950\nRemember that ITIL focus\nis on the IT department\n\n781\n00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,810\nwhere you've got other\nbusiness units in your company\n\n782\n00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,308\nthat very well may already have change\nmanagement of some sort in place.\n\n783\n00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:33,180\nWell, you really see this as in\nfinance and accounting departments,\n\n784\n00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,770\nwhere they got auditing structure and\nall of that put in place.\n\n785\n00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,900\nYou can actually mirror what they've got,\nso that you've got a consistent\n\n786\n00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,690\nchange management across\nyour entire organization.\n\n787\n00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,790\nNow, I have never worked in\nan environment that was able to do that.\n\n788\n00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,230\nBut I've read about it and\nit sounds great.\n\n789\n00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,130\nSo, in the ITIL manual they always\nmention that one and for the exam,\n\n790\n00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,645\nI wanna make sure you recognize it.\n\n791\n00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:55,820\nBut more often than not,\nyou are creating it from scratch or\n\n792\n00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,470\nmodifying a poorly implemented\nsystem in the first place.\n\n793\n00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,580\nSo, for the IT department, regardless of\nwhether the rest of the company is doing\n\n794\n00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,240\nit or not,\nwe need to have that change management.\n\n795\n00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,710\nSo, we come up with this\nconsistent manner for\n\n796\n00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,345\nhow we're gonna implement that and\nensure that people follow it.\n\n797\n00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:18,850\nThat's really the big trick is if someone\nmakes a change without going through\n\n798\n00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,260\nthe change management system, there needs\nto be a penalty associated with that.\n\n799\n00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,020\nThere needs to be some kind of\ndiscipline because you can't have that.\n\n800\n00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,380\nYou can't have people deviating from\nthe norm cuz it will effect other things.\n\n801\n00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,112\nNow, change management is what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n802\n00:42:35,112 --> 00:42:38,760\nWe're gonna talk about configuration\nmanagement a little bit later.\n\n803\n00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,290\nThey are different.\n\n804\n00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,870\nBut just to kind of summarize\nit really quick to make\n\n805\n00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,760\nsure that we have a basic understanding.\n\n806\n00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,720\nChange management is where we're\nactually changing any aspect of an SDP,\n\n807\n00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,000\nany part of it from schedule and cost,\nto requirements that are inside of it.\n\n808\n00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,580\nBut configuration management is different.\n\n809\n00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:08,430\nConfiguration management is when we're\nmodifying an asset of that service.\n\n810\n00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,690\nSo, that might be a software program.\n\n811\n00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,780\nAnd we're changing some of\nthe features that are on it.\n\n812\n00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,470\nThat would be considered\na configuration change.\n\n813\n00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,260\nThere's some things that\ncan't be configured.\n\n814\n00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,020\nCan you configure money?\n\n815\n00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,060\nNo.\nCan you configure people?\n\n816\n00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,680\nNo.\n\n817\n00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,290\nSo, when you do configuration management,\nyou're\n\n818\n00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,997\nreally talking about software requirements\nin a software development environment.\n\n819\n00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:30,820\nBut it might be different if\nyou have servers in place, and\n\n820\n00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,960\nyou're a system admin,\nit might be the server configuration.\n\n821\n00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,000\nEnabling IPv6 or disabling\nthe software firewall or whatever.\n\n822\n00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,050\nThat might be configuration\nmanagement there.\n\n823\n00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,900\nSo, configuration management pertains\nto specific types of changes.\n\n824\n00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,420\nIt's much more focused.\n\n825\n00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,060\nNow, every configuration change\nis a change, is a regular.\n\n826\n00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,349\nIt can fall under change management.\n\n827\n00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,060\nBut not every change management change\nfalls under configuration management.\n\n828\n00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,310\nSo, some companies do away\nwith the separation and\n\n829\n00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,060\nthey just have change management.\n\n830\n00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,230\nThe bank that I worked for, we just\nhad change management and that was it.\n\n831\n00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,270\nBut other organizations will split it,\nso that they're separate.\n\n832\n00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,080\nAnd what you'll have is the developers,\nthe people that are working on\n\n833\n00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,120\nthe software,\nthey're using configuration management.\n\n834\n00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,544\nAnd then, the rest of the IT department\nthat's doing day to day operations,\n\n835\n00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,860\nthey're using change management.\n\n836\n00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,311\nAnd so, it's two separate systems,\nbut they're really closely related and\n\n837\n00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,355\neasy to confuse.\n\n838\n00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:32,660\nWe're in the change\nmanagement process here.\n\n839\n00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,445\nWe'll see the configuration management\nprocess a little bit later.\n\n840\n00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:42,023\nRonnie, I think at this point, we kind of\ntalked about all the different aspects of\n\n841\n00:44:42,023 --> 00:44:44,940\nchange management,\njust from a conceptual point.\n\n842\n00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,270\nNow, we need to get into\nhow it actually works.\n\n843\n00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,400\nBut it is a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n844\n00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,770\nSo, why don't we pause here for\na breather, and when we get back,\n\n845\n00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,690\nwe'll tackle how we actually use change\nand a change management environment.\n\n846\n00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,593\nSo, stay tuned, we'll be back, after this.\n\n847\n00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:05,316\n[MUSIC]\n\n848\n00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:08,090\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n849\n00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,580\nSo, we left off talking\nabout change management and\n\n850\n00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,870\nwe were really kinda hanging around\nthe conceptual idea of change management.\n\n851\n00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,060\nWell, let's get into the practical\nside of things, how it works.\n\n852\n00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:22,830\nI said that change management is like\na gatekeeper that is sitting in between\n\n853\n00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,070\npeople and the production environment.\n\n854\n00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,980\nKeeping changes out unless\nthey've been authorized.\n\n855\n00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,840\nSo, how does that work?\n\n856\n00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,050\nWell, it works on a pretty\nsimple principle.\n\n857\n00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,100\nIf you wanna make a change to\nsomething that's in production,\n\n858\n00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:39,010\nyou need to put in a request for\nchange, or an RFC.\n\n859\n00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,700\nNow, don't confuse that with a request for\n\n860\n00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,510\ncomment, RFC is used in\na bidding process also.\n\n861\n00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,050\nBut here, it's request for change, or RFC.\n\n862\n00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,880\nSome people just call\nthese change tickets.\n\n863\n00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,180\nThere's any number of terms you can use.\n\n864\n00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,150\nBut on the exam, you'll see RFC.\n\n865\n00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,970\nAnd an RFC is basically,\n\n866\n00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,900\nyou outlining that change, and\ntrying to get approval to do it.\n\n867\n00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,150\nNow, there's a couple of elements that\nare kind of required in an RFC, and\n\n868\n00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,940\nyour organization may choose to add\nin as many other things as you want.\n\n869\n00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,040\nBut they specifically call out a handful\nof components, and these are the ones that\n\n870\n00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,750\nwe'll see on the exam, so we need to kind\nof run through each of those elements.\n\n871\n00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n872\n00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,230\nSome of the elements\nincluded in this request for\n\n873\n00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,740\nchange include what we call risk and\nbusiness continuity.\n\n874\n00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,360\nWe wanna make sure that as we\nsubmit the change request,\n\n875\n00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,830\nthat we know what the risk is.\n\n876\n00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,540\nThat if this change does happen and\n\n877\n00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,100\nhappens badly, what is it\nactually gonna end up costing us?\n\n878\n00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,800\nIs it gonna bring down the entire network?\n\n879\n00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,720\nIs it only gonna bring\ndown this one server?\n\n880\n00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,500\nWhat is gonna end up happening?\n\n881\n00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,550\nAnd then, of course,\n\n882\n00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,590\nwe'll wanna also make sure that it's not\ngonna bring down the entire business too.\n\n883\n00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:47,790\nSo, it may be that the very fact\nthat we know the limitation or\n\n884\n00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,140\nthe scope of what this change is gonna do.\n\n885\n00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,220\n>> And it's really a two-part thing,\nrisk and business continuity.\n\n886\n00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,190\nRisk is what could happen.\n\n887\n00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,330\nAnd business continuity is how we continue\ndoing business if that does happen.\n\n888\n00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,150\nSo, really think of it as risk, response.\n\n889\n00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,030\nSo, our possible issues, and\nthen what we can do to resolve them.\n\n890\n00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,400\nThat resolution,\nit might be a proactive measure,\n\n891\n00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,060\nsomething we can do to ensure\nthe problem doesn't happen.\n\n892\n00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,050\nSo, now, we're managing that risk,\nmitigating it.\n\n893\n00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,980\nOr it's a reaction, it's something\nwe do after the fact that says,\n\n894\n00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,230\nthe problem has happened,\nhere is how we get back.\n\n895\n00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,360\nSo, that's an important piece and\n\n896\n00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,980\nwe'll see a few different terms\nthat might be labeled as.\n\n897\n00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,360\nBut you need to do a risk\nassessment of that change.\n\n898\n00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,790\nA lot of people come up with a change.\n\n899\n00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:38,200\nThey know what needs to be done to fix it,\nbut they don't know the risks involved.\n\n900\n00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,800\nSo, you'll typically have a request for\nchange involving\n\n901\n00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,430\nmore than one person in the draft of it,\njust in creating that request.\n\n902\n00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,120\nThe next part is the change impact.\n\n903\n00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,018\nA change, by its nature,\nis going to change something.\n\n904\n00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:54,970\nSo, something that's going\non in production right now\n\n905\n00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,340\nis going to be different\nafter this is approved.\n\n906\n00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,375\nSo, what's the impact?\n\n907\n00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:03,126\nAnd don't think of impact in a bad way.\n\n908\n00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:06,780\nI mean it can be in a bad way,\nbut normally it's in a good way.\n\n909\n00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,917\nSo we just added a new feature.\n\n910\n00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,325\nAnd when we add that new feature,\n\n911\n00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:14,720\nnow our end user can actually do more than\nit did before, we just increased value.\n\n912\n00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,970\nBut now we might get some tech\nsupport calls on that new feature.\n\n913\n00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,940\nSo one of the impacts we're\ngoing to have is that the help\n\n914\n00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,590\ndesk is going to have to be trained\non these new features also.\n\n915\n00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:28,280\nSo that they're prepared to handle\nthose support calls when they get them.\n\n916\n00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,480\nYou don't want to roll out a new feature.\n\n917\n00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,620\nAnd not tell your support team.\n\n918\n00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,352\nWhich.\n\n919\n00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:34,600\n>> [LAUGH].\nI kinda laugh as I'm saying that,\n\n920\n00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,180\nbecause I can't tell you how many times\nI've called support teams about something,\n\n921\n00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,330\nand they didn't know about a feature\nthat was in their own product.\n\n922\n00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,870\nSo that's something you want to avoid.\n\n923\n00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,780\nThat's an example of\nan impact that we might have.\n\n924\n00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,140\nOr maybe we're putting in\nsome kind of efficiency\n\n925\n00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,140\nthat makes our system operate\nmore quickly than before and\n\n926\n00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,630\nnow we've got a greater volume of\ndata moving through our system.\n\n927\n00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,650\nOur personnel needs to be\ngeared up to handle that.\n\n928\n00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,420\nSo there's always\nan impact with the change.\n\n929\n00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,490\nThere's always something that happens.\n\n930\n00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:04,810\nWe identify what that something is.\n\n931\n00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,670\n>> Also involved in this request for\n\n932\n00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:12,290\na change, may include what resources\nthat we need to have on hand.\n\n933\n00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,300\nSo that way we go ahead and we request it.\n\n934\n00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,250\nWe insure that that resource is\ngoing to be available if we need it.\n\n935\n00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,990\nAnd that could include, of course,\n\n936\n00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,000\njust regular tools or could we include\nan actual person that may need to\n\n937\n00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,600\nhelp out with whatever change that\nwe're actually requesting to make.\n\n938\n00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,760\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we do request that.\n\n939\n00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,680\n>> And the terms of those resources.\n\n940\n00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,880\nIt is a requirement.\n\n941\n00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,470\nIt's something you have\nto have to get it done.\n\n942\n00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:39,710\nBut you want to keep the requirements\nas flexible as possible.\n\n943\n00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:44,520\nSo If you need a web developer and\nyou need an employee, Tom,\n\n944\n00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,918\nwho's a web developer in your company,\nyou could say, \"I require Tom\".\n\n945\n00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,590\nBut that's gonna to make it more difficult\nto approve the change because now it's\n\n946\n00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,830\ngoing to have to rotate around Tom's\nschedule, versus if you said I need a web\n\n947\n00:49:54,830 --> 00:50:00,740\ndeveloper with these skills,\nnow your team can maybe identify different\n\n948\n00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,610\nweb developers that can fit that same mode\nand fit it into the schedule differently.\n\n949\n00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,090\nSo, we just have to identify\nthose pieces and it could be,\n\n950\n00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,450\ncould just be money right?\n\n951\n00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,750\nThis is the amount of money were\ngonna need to make this change.\n\n952\n00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,850\nThat would need to be detailed there too.\n\n953\n00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,800\nWe've got change authorization.\n\n954\n00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,990\nNow when we fill out the RFC,\nthe change is not approved,\n\n955\n00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,030\nbut authorization and\napproval are two different things.\n\n956\n00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,780\nAuthorization is saying,\n\n957\n00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,230\nif you want to make a change, what gives\nyou the authority to do that change.\n\n958\n00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:36,230\nSo maybe this building right here,\nI decide that I want\n\n959\n00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,660\nto change this building,\nI want to put a basement right here,\n\n960\n00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,996\nI want to dig a hole in the ground and\nput a basement under there.\n\n961\n00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:45,450\nWell, I don't own this building, right?\n\n962\n00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:49,130\nWe lease this building, or\nI think we do, don't we?\n\n963\n00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,800\nSomehow we're allowed\nto come here everyday.\n\n964\n00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,280\nSo I don't have the authority\nto make that change.\n\n965\n00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,830\nI can't go and dig a hole here.\n\n966\n00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,330\nI've got to go to the company that\nactually manages this property, and\n\n967\n00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,580\nthey're the ones that have\nthe authority to do that.\n\n968\n00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,910\nSo, I can't submit that change,\nand make the company do it.\n\n969\n00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,970\nI don't have that approval, right?\n\n970\n00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,320\nSo, someone else might have to\nteam up with me on this change.\n\n971\n00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,840\nI came up with the idea, but then I pitch\nit to the management company, the property\n\n972\n00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,080\nmanagement company and they say that's\na great idea let's put a basement in,\n\n973\n00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,200\nwhich in Florida is a terrible idea,\nbut maybe it's a great idea and so\n\n974\n00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,380\nthey sign on to it and\nnow I submit it to the company.\n\n975\n00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,900\nThe change is still not approved, right?\n\n976\n00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,740\nBecause if we start putting\nin this basement down here,\n\n977\n00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,170\nthat's gonna disrupt taping, right?\n\n978\n00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,140\nWe won't be able to film a show\nwhile they're digging right here\n\n979\n00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,470\nbeneath the set.\n\n980\n00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,760\nAnd so we might decline that change just\nbecause the impact it would create on our\n\n981\n00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,220\nproduct, our sole product that we create.\n\n982\n00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,120\nSo authorization and\napproval are two different things.\n\n983\n00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,500\nSo here's just where you're getting\nthe authority to recommend this change be\n\n984\n00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,180\nmade, and you might, personally,\nhave that authority, so you just put that\n\n985\n00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,540\nI am the network manager, and so I'm\nallowed to make changes to the network,\n\n986\n00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,860\nand this is what I've approved,\nor what kind of led to that.\n\n987\n00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,390\n>> Lastly,\nwhen we also include the business benefit.\n\n988\n00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:06,070\nThe reason why we believe\nthis change is necessary and\n\n989\n00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:11,320\nthat gives whoever is going to be trying\nto advise us on the change or to make\n\n990\n00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,020\nthe ultimate decision on a change whether\nor not something that will be approved.\n\n991\n00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,200\nWithout an actual business impact or\n\n992\n00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,850\nbenefit the change may\nnot be needed at all.\n\n993\n00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,520\nIt may just be I don't like\nthe way it's configured.\n\n994\n00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,430\nI'd rather do it this way.\n\n995\n00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:29,960\nBut is it really going to increase\nthe benefit to my company.\n\n996\n00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,380\nEven if it take me 15 to 20 minutes,\nwhat if it takes me two hours to do it and\n\n997\n00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,530\nthat would bring down other things.\n\n998\n00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:38,340\nWell I may actually want to go,\nokay, let me go ahead and\n\n999\n00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,410\nforgo that change instead, but\nif there's a reason why I want it and\n\n1000\n00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,790\nthat it actually provides\na benefit to the company,\n\n1001\n00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,130\nI want to make sure I submit this change\nand make sure there's a reason behind it.\n\n1002\n00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,252\n>> Yeah there's always a cost associated\nwith a change, even if it's declined.\n\n1003\n00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:55,180\nAll right, the cost might simply be the\namount of time you spent drafting that RFC\n\n1004\n00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,230\nthat then just got declined.\n\n1005\n00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:01,660\nSo there is always a cost, so\nthere has to be a benefit to doing it.\n\n1006\n00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,020\nAnd even if it seems like there's\nnot a benefit you can normally\n\n1007\n00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,760\nfind one in there.\n\n1008\n00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,770\nSo the government passes a new regulation\nthat states that you have to take these\n\n1009\n00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:10,530\nextra measures to secure your network.\n\n1010\n00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:13,070\nIt's going to cost you money, it's not\ngoing to offer you any new features to\n\n1011\n00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,630\nyour end user so it looks negative, right?\n\n1012\n00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:19,690\nI've got to do this change because I have\nto, it doesn't really gain us anything.\n\n1013\n00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,380\nWell, it does gain you something.\n\n1014\n00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:27,500\nIt gains you compliance with the laws,\nand so you're not going to get penalized\n\n1015\n00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,930\nby the government, or fined, or sued,\nor whatever because you adhere to it.\n\n1016\n00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:33,810\nThat's the benefit you get,\nso there's always a benefit.\n\n1017\n00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,790\nOr if there isn't, it should just\nbe declined, right, not approved.\n\n1018\n00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,800\nAll right, now some of the other\nthings that we may choose\n\n1019\n00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,580\nto include inside of our change tickets.\n\n1020\n00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,210\nAgain, it's up to you if\nyou wanna add other things.\n\n1021\n00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:45,650\nBut a budget.\n\n1022\n00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,460\nIf it's a significant change,\nif it's a change that's gonna take time,\n\n1023\n00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,830\nyou may need to budget funds over time, or\n\n1024\n00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,490\njust a straight up budget\nof what it's gonna cost.\n\n1025\n00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,880\nA schedule, right?\n\n1026\n00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,120\nIt's basically a project, right?\n\n1027\n00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,530\nSo we've got a schedule of when\nthese events are going to happen.\n\n1028\n00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,110\nIf it's a simple change,\nwe may not care when they happen, and\n\n1029\n00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,210\nwe can leave it up to the change team to\ndetermine when that's going to occur.\n\n1030\n00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,090\nBut, otherwise,\nwe specify the range of time or\n\n1031\n00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,140\nthe date when we want\nthat change to occur.\n\n1032\n00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:15,670\n>> A lot of times, we also include in,\nsometimes the detailed steps of a say,\n\n1033\n00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:19,370\na configuration change that we're making,\nexactly what those changes are, but\n\n1034\n00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,670\nwe also want to include then\nthe roll back to those changes.\n\n1035\n00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,840\nHow do I get rid of this\nchange if I implement it and\n\n1036\n00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,570\nnow ti doesn't work we need to have a plan\nand we need to have detailed steps so\n\n1037\n00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,350\nthat we can actually\nback those things out.\n\n1038\n00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,180\nThat way somebody can take look and\ngo yeah that's a good way to do it or\n\n1039\n00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,300\nnah that's not a good way to do it because\nI don't like your back out plan, so\n\n1040\n00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,490\nthey can actually take\na look at both of them.\n\n1041\n00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,530\n>> I know, even more detailed some\ncompanies will break out two elements\n\n1042\n00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,280\nwhich will kind of sound the same which\nare remediation and rollback all right?\n\n1043\n00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,390\nRollback is one that I always include in\nany change ticket I've ever filled out.\n\n1044\n00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:56,510\nWhich says, here's the change I wanna make\nand I've planned for a lot of this stuff.\n\n1045\n00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,420\nI've done a lot of testing and evaluating.\n\n1046\n00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,140\nI've done all of this to make sure\nthat this change is gonna go as\n\n1047\n00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,999\nsmooth as possible.\n\n1048\n00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,600\nBut if for any reason it doesn't,\n\n1049\n00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,500\nif anything happens where\nthis doesn't work out.\n\n1050\n00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,780\nHere are the step by step, this is\nexactly how you undo the change and\n\n1051\n00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,760\nthe idea is if I'm on vacation,\nif i get hit by a bus tomorrow and\n\n1052\n00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,900\nI'm just not available, right?\n\n1053\n00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,870\nSomebody, anybody in the company should\nbe able to read that change ticket and\n\n1054\n00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:24,910\nundo what we did to fix that problem.\n\n1055\n00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:28,500\nIf i go on vacation the guys came in\non Monday and something is broken,\n\n1056\n00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,955\nthey get my change ticket and\nfollow the steps problem solved, right?\n\n1057\n00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:33,585\nMuch more efficient.\n\n1058\n00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:38,265\nBut, we kind of lose all the work\nwe put in on that change.\n\n1059\n00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:40,635\nSo remediation's a little bit different.\n\n1060\n00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:44,160\nWith remediation, we try and\nfix the problem, right?\n\n1061\n00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:50,030\nHow much time are we allowed\nto spend to try and fix it?\n\n1062\n00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,580\nAnd so we may put in there steps\nlike troubleshooting steps.\n\n1063\n00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,470\nHere's how you can troubleshoot.\n\n1064\n00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:58,129\nIf the change didn't work, these are some\nof the reasons why that might have\n\n1065\n00:55:58,129 --> 00:56:00,833\nhappened, and\nwhat you can do to correct them, right?\n\n1066\n00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:05,468\nOr, how's the amount of time we recommend\nyou spent troubleshooting before\n\n1067\n00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:06,833\nyou went to roll back.\n\n1068\n00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:11,330\nSo, if you can't get it fixed\nwithin one hour Just roll back.\n\n1069\n00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,640\nSo now we're defining remediation and\nrollback.\n\n1070\n00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,320\nThe problem with remediation though,\nis it really does need to be\n\n1071\n00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,120\nplanned out in detail because if you're\ntroubleshooting and you find a problem,\n\n1072\n00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,310\nwhat do you have to do to fix it?\n\n1073\n00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,670\nYou have to make a change.\n\n1074\n00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,470\nAnd, is that change authorized and\napproved?\n\n1075\n00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,690\nNo.\nSo you gotta go through\n\n1076\n00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,140\nthe change management process to fix\nthe problem your initial change created.\n\n1077\n00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,250\nAnd it takes time.\n\n1078\n00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,300\nAnd if you've broken your\nproduction environment,\n\n1079\n00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,990\nyou don't have that kinda time.\n\n1080\n00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,560\nSo a rollback is required in my opinion,\nbut not according to ITIL, but\n\n1081\n00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,500\nin my personal option,\nyou really need a rollback.\n\n1082\n00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,230\nBut a remediation may or\nmay not be necessary.\n\n1083\n00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,030\nIf you have a remediation\nwith troubleshooting steps,\n\n1084\n00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,960\nbasically each recommended fix for\n\n1085\n00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,830\nthat problem needs to be approved\nas a part of the overall ticket.\n\n1086\n00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:05,080\nAnd so, if the detailed change\nis included in the ticket,\n\n1087\n00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,080\nwhen the ticket's approved those changes\nare approved and now the team that's\n\n1088\n00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,230\ndeploying this will have the authority\nto apply those other ones.\n\n1089\n00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:16,240\nThey can't just come and create fixes on\ntheir own and start modifying production.\n\n1090\n00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,420\nThat's not gonna be ideal.\n\n1091\n00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:22,670\nSo the RFC, that request for change,\nit can be a very short form,\n\n1092\n00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:25,390\nit can fit on just one side\nof a piece of paper, or\n\n1093\n00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:28,880\nit can be extremely detailed\ndepending on the level of change.\n\n1094\n00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,580\nAnd the more information that you have,\nthe more effective it can be.\n\n1095\n00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:34,490\nBut it's up to your company to kinda\npick the components that you're\n\n1096\n00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:35,100\ngoing to include in it.\n\n1097\n00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:43,180\nAll right, now once we fill out our RFC,\nwhat exactly is the process we go through?\n\n1098\n00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:49,400\nAnd, they don't actually have in the ITIL\nbooks, in the service transition book they\n\n1099\n00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,880\ndon't really have like a full workflow,\nbut they do give a few examples and\n\n1100\n00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,980\nI kind of pieced it a lot of them\ntogether into nine possible steps.\n\n1101\n00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,845\nNow, you don't have to have all of these\nagain, you create your own workflow.\n\n1102\n00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:06,380\nITIL is suggesting a method that might\nwork for some organizations, but\n\n1103\n00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,380\nmight be overkill for small or\nmedium organizations definitely, but\n\n1104\n00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,530\neven some large organizations\nit might be a little overkill.\n\n1105\n00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,400\nSo you might want to shrink this down.\n\n1106\n00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,720\nBut basically we run\nthrough a couple of phases.\n\n1107\n00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,305\nThe first one is we record the change.\n\n1108\n00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:23,545\nWhich, recording the change,\nthat really means filling out the RFC so\n\n1109\n00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:25,285\nall that stuff we just talked about?\n\n1110\n00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:28,385\nWe fill out the paperwork\nwe create the RFC.\n\n1111\n00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:30,895\nNow we've got a record of\nthe change that we want to make.\n\n1112\n00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,475\nFrom there we move into evaluate.\n\n1113\n00:58:35,475 --> 00:58:39,185\nSomebody's got to take a look at\nthat change and determine whether or\n\n1114\n00:58:39,185 --> 00:58:42,710\nnot it achieves what it\nsets out to achieve.\n\n1115\n00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,530\nIf I put a business case, and\n\n1116\n00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,550\nI say I want to make this change because\nit will make our system 10% faster.\n\n1117\n00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,900\nSomebody needs to evaluate it and\nsay do these changes make sense?\n\n1118\n00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,370\nDoes this actually look like it might\ncreate a performance boost of 10%.\n\n1119\n00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,200\nOr does this seem like it doesn't\nhave enough research done behind it?\n\n1120\n00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,120\nWas there adequate testing done?\n\n1121\n00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,260\nHave they actually tried this out?\n\n1122\n00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,090\nThat's stuff that happens\nin this evaluation.\n\n1123\n00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:10,030\nWe do it early on, because there's no\npoint in worrying about all the other\n\n1124\n00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,010\nthings if this ticket is not\neven ready in the first place.\n\n1125\n00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,940\nSo someone needs to evaluate it.\n\n1126\n00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,120\n>> Because we take these tickets and\n\n1127\n00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,095\nwe normally submit them to something\nlike a change advisory board.\n\n1128\n00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:24,595\nIt's the advisory board that will\nactually give us the authorization or\n\n1129\n00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:26,567\ntell us why the change was declined.\n\n1130\n00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,625\nThey don't always has to be\ndeclined because it's a bad change.\n\n1131\n00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:33,775\nIt could just be simply that the change\nis occurring at the same day that another\n\n1132\n00:59:33,775 --> 00:59:35,180\nchange is going on.\n\n1133\n00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,420\nSo they may simply say look, go ahead and\n\n1134\n00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,490\nlet's say we're not gonna do it now,\nwe're gonna do it later.\n\n1135\n00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:45,680\nOr please resubmit with a new date in mind\nso it doesn't conflict with anything else.\n\n1136\n00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,780\nIf they authorize it, it gives you now,\n\n1137\n00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,860\nthe authorization to continue to move\nforward with what you need to do.\n\n1138\n00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,390\nBut usually that's not gonna be done by\nme just because I wanna make the change.\n\n1139\n00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,760\nIt's also gonna be done by other people\nthat have some stake in what we're doing.\n\n1140\n00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,840\n>> Yeah, so we're only at the third step\nhere and that's authorize or decline.\n\n1141\n01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,270\nIf you're authorized,\nyou move forward, right?\n\n1142\n01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,370\nBut if you're declined,\nthis is the end of your journey.\n\n1143\n01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,450\nStep three you don't even\ngo to the other steps.\n\n1144\n01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,410\nThat's it, it's over.\n\n1145\n01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,160\nSo many organizations implement\nanother option, which is deferred.\n\n1146\n01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,300\nAnd what you want to call it is up to you.\n\n1147\n01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,340\nBut deferred just simply means.\n\n1148\n01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:24,420\nWe either need more information, that\na pretty common one, or we need to adjust\n\n1149\n01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,720\nthat schedule, or whatever component it is\nthat we need to make some modifications.\n\n1150\n01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,250\nAnd so\ntypically it would be like a notes column.\n\n1151\n01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,750\nIf it's deferred, here's why.\n\n1152\n01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,340\nOr if it's declined, here's why.\n\n1153\n01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,910\nBut authorized,\nthat's what we care about, right?\n\n1154\n01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,320\nThat's where we're saying all right,\nthis change is going to be approved and\n\n1155\n01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,990\nready to move forward.\n\n1156\n01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:45,390\nAnd once it's ready, Now we go into\nthe fourth step which is prioritize,\n\n1157\n01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:48,970\nthere is likely other changes\nthat are pending in the system.\n\n1158\n01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:52,502\nAnd so we need to prioritize\nthis change against the other.\n\n1159\n01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:58,050\nIf there's resource conflicts, which\nchanges get access to the resources first,\n\n1160\n01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,362\nand usually this is handdled through\nsome kind of classification system.\n\n1161\n01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:03,950\nSo you'll have a high priority changes and\n\n1162\n01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,800\nlow priority changes and\ncritical and so on.\n\n1163\n01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,600\nAnd so when you fill out\nthe RFC you might suggest that.\n\n1164\n01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,810\nThis is a high-priority change.\n\n1165\n01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,100\nWe need to get this done because we're\npatching, maybe it's a critical,\n\n1166\n01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,280\nthis is a security flaw, it's critical\nwe fix this as soon as possible.\n\n1167\n01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,610\nWell, The people that review\nthis back in evaluation,\n\n1168\n01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:26,470\nthey may choose to change that priority.\n\n1169\n01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:28,020\nAnd that's their discretion,\n\n1170\n01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,770\nthey can do that because the change\nitself isn't being modified.\n\n1171\n01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,100\nJust the priority.\n\n1172\n01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:37,040\nAnd so now we're prioritizing that, and\nmaking sure that the really critical stuff\n\n1173\n01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,260\ngets the resources first, and then the\nless critical changes can be moved off.\n\n1174\n01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,888\n>> Because changes are always\nhappening within our organization,\n\n1175\n01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:48,690\nwe may also need to do what we\ncall planning the change out.\n\n1176\n01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:52,420\nThat normally requires us to be\nable to coordinate the resources\n\n1177\n01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,410\nthat are available, to actually know\nwhat we're actually working on.\n\n1178\n01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,810\nBut then to make sure that we\nalso schedule everything so\n\n1179\n01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,610\nthat we know when it's happening and\nwhat's going on and everything.\n\n1180\n01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,294\nSo that our organization is not\noverburdened on one particular day as\n\n1181\n01:02:06,294 --> 01:02:07,227\nthe change is going on.\n\n1182\n01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:11,378\n>> It's basically like a miniature\nproject at that point.\n\n1183\n01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:13,700\nSo you kind of engage with\nyour products management team.\n\n1184\n01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,090\nSay here's this change that we're\ngoing to go ahead and implement.\n\n1185\n01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,560\nPeople don't normally designate it.\n\n1186\n01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,510\nIt's like a full project.\n\n1187\n01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:20,340\nBut that's kind of like how it's treated.\n\n1188\n01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,110\nOnce that's done we're ready to test,\nright.\n\n1189\n01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:27,510\nI know that whoever submitted\nthis RFC did some basic testing.\n\n1190\n01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,400\nBut now we really need to test it again.\n\n1191\n01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,110\nAll right, we need to take this change and\ntest it out,\n\n1192\n01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:36,200\nand you can't do that in production,\nand so most environments, or\n\n1193\n01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,950\nmost organizations,\nwill have several environments.\n\n1194\n01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:42,890\nAnd it depends, right,\nyou can have many, many different ones,\n\n1195\n01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:48,380\na lot of people will at a minimum have\na production and a test environment.\n\n1196\n01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,360\nAnd that test environment may\nbe a mirror of production.\n\n1197\n01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,970\nSo they are basically the same\nenvironments, but your customers are on\n\n1198\n01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:58,940\nthe production environment, and\nno one is on the testing environment.\n\n1199\n01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,890\nSo you can make the change in tests and\nsee how it goes.\n\n1200\n01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,010\nMaybe it works great and\nwe're ready to roll it in production.\n\n1201\n01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,350\nMaybe it doesn't work great,\nand now we stop.\n\n1202\n01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,740\nNow, You may just have two environments,\nyou may have many, many,\n\n1203\n01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,730\nmany environments.\n\n1204\n01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,060\nIt is not uncommon to have\nfive separate environments.\n\n1205\n01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:21,750\nAs an example,\nI'll use the last company I worked in.\n\n1206\n01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:26,090\nWe had five different environments\nthere where we had a sandbox.\n\n1207\n01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,090\nAnd a sandbox environment\nit contained our software.\n\n1208\n01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,840\nThe main line of business applications for\nour company.\n\n1209\n01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,920\nAnd the developers were allowed\nto use it to experiment with.\n\n1210\n01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:35,700\nThey could connect in.\n\n1211\n01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,580\nThey could do whatever\nthey wanted in sandbox.\n\n1212\n01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,520\nWe didn't care.\n\n1213\n01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,640\nAnd every night at midnight the sandbox\nenvironment was destroyed and rebuilt.\n\n1214\n01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,130\nAnd so it always went to back to\nnew each day, as we went forward.\n\n1215\n01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:47,230\nAnd they did experimentation there.\n\n1216\n01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,610\nThat was Sandbox.\n\n1217\n01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:53,520\nThen there was the development\nenvironment, or the dev environment.\n\n1218\n01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,470\nAnd once they had experimented, and\ncome up with some kind of idea they liked,\n\n1219\n01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:00,800\nthe actual development for\nit happened in the dev environment.\n\n1220\n01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,445\nAnd the dev environment had\na lot of our software, but\n\n1221\n01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:07,043\nnot necessarily live customer data.\n\n1222\n01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:08,238\nYou're in development, so\n\n1223\n01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:11,042\nyou don't necessarily have all\nthe security protocols in place.\n\n1224\n01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:15,924\nSo you don't want copies of your live data\nin there, you could accidentally leak it\n\n1225\n01:04:15,924 --> 01:04:19,969\nSo the dev environment was our\nsoftware but packed full of fake data,\n\n1226\n01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:24,600\nfake accounts and users and just fake\ninformation for the development cycle.\n\n1227\n01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,350\nAfter development, when a developer had\ncompleted what they were working on,\n\n1228\n01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:35,430\nthe next environment was the QA\nenvironment, the quality assurance.\n\n1229\n01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:37,130\nSome people call it quality control.\n\n1230\n01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:38,800\nThere's different names for it.\n\n1231\n01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,783\nBut it would then go in to the QA\nenvironment where people would review it.\n\n1232\n01:04:42,783 --> 01:04:46,114\nThey would take what the developer did,\nthrow it on the QA environment and\n\n1233\n01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:46,770\nevaluate it.\n\n1234\n01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,500\nAnd if they found bugs, flaws,\n\n1235\n01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,120\nanything that didn't meet our policies,\nit would go back to dev.\n\n1236\n01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,280\nBut if it passed there,\nthe next environment was staging.\n\n1237\n01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,410\nNow our staging environment\nwas an exact mirror\n\n1238\n01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:04,900\nof the last environment,\nwhich was our production environment.\n\n1239\n01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,360\nEvery night at midnight,\n\n1240\n01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,970\nour production environment was\ncloned to the staging environment.\n\n1241\n01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:13,860\nAnd that way, when we had a change\nthat was ready to roll out,\n\n1242\n01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,250\nwe could deploy it in staging and\njust do a final check.\n\n1243\n01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,590\nAnd here's where it was a mirror.\n\n1244\n01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:22,680\nIt had our actual customer data,\nour actual environment.\n\n1245\n01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,090\nIt was server for server, the exact\nsame hardware, the exact same version.\n\n1246\n01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,270\nEverything was exact as production.\n\n1247\n01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:30,350\nSo we could deploy the change,\n\n1248\n01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:33,580\nand if something went wrong,\nit didn't affect production.\n\n1249\n01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,540\nSo a lot of what we talked about earlier,\nas far as validating the change,\n\n1250\n01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,280\ncould actually happen before\nwe've even touched production.\n\n1251\n01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,950\nAnd then once everything was green there,\n\n1252\n01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:47,610\nonce we tested out okay, then we\nrepeated the deployment in production.\n\n1253\n01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,610\nFive separate environments.\n\n1254\n01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,874\nThat's a lot of equipment and a lot to\nmaintain, but if you want a secure and\n\n1255\n01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:55,533\nstable environment, then you do it, right?\n\n1256\n01:05:55,533 --> 01:05:58,330\nI mean, there's no argument against it.\n\n1257\n01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:02,950\nThe sandbox, the dev, the QA environments,\nthey were all virtual machines.\n\n1258\n01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,120\nThat wasn't a big deal.\n\n1259\n01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,530\nIt wasn't until you got to staging and\n\n1260\n01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,480\nproduction that it became\nphysical machines.\n\n1261\n01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,030\nBut even then, a lot of them are VMs on\ntop of those, so it really wasn't that\n\n1262\n01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:14,180\nbad to set up this kind of environment,\nand that's very common.\n\n1263\n01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,580\nSo when we talk about that test here,\n\n1264\n01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,470\nafter the ROC has already been deployed,\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n1265\n01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:23,150\nRunning it through that staging\ntype environment to make sure\n\n1266\n01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,310\nthat it's not gonna affect production.\n\n1267\n01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:29,150\n>> Our seventh process here\nis gonna be implementation.\n\n1268\n01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:33,310\nThis is us really just doing\nthe work that we say we're gonna do.\n\n1269\n01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,550\nMaking sure that the change happens\naccording to all the process and\n\n1270\n01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,910\nthe steps that we actually said\nwe're going to make sure that we do.\n\n1271\n01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:43,950\nAnd once we get it in, then we're\nbeginning to monitor it to make sure that\n\n1272\n01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,700\nwe carried out all the steps,\nbut it's working.\n\n1273\n01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:52,230\n>> And now implement is just\nactually putting it in production.\n\n1274\n01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:56,350\nSo any events that you had planned to\naffect production, if you were gonna take\n\n1275\n01:06:56,350 --> 01:07:00,540\nyour system down for maintenance while you\ndid this change, that's what happens here.\n\n1276\n01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:03,990\nAnd once it's done,\nyour next step is to document.\n\n1277\n01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,690\nYou document how it went,\ndocument the change.\n\n1278\n01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,190\nNow document also goes a step further.\n\n1279\n01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:12,510\nYou have business continuity plans,\nbusiness resumption plans,\n\n1280\n01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:15,560\nall this other documentation that\ncenters around your product.\n\n1281\n01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,970\nIt all needs to be updated,\n\n1282\n01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:20,630\nupdated to reflect this change\nas part of your new baseline.\n\n1283\n01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:24,932\nA baseline is really just kind of\na captured configuration that says here's\n\n1284\n01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:27,158\nhow my system is configured right now.\n\n1285\n01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:29,440\nNow that I've put the change in,\nthat baseline changes.\n\n1286\n01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,940\nSo we take this new baseline,\nthis new set of documentation.\n\n1287\n01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,780\nIt's normally just a couple\nlittle modifications we have to\n\n1288\n01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,540\nmake to tweak that.\n\n1289\n01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,120\nBut that's a part of that eighth step,\nwhich leads us to the end.\n\n1290\n01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,300\n>> Yeah, last step is review.\n\n1291\n01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:44,770\nThis is when, if we've submitted this\nchange to someone and they've authorized\n\n1292\n01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:49,270\nit, they now take the entire process\nof the change that we've submitted.\n\n1293\n01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,419\nThey go through and\nlook at everything that we've done, and\n\n1294\n01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:56,428\nthey review it, to be able to learn from\nit, to be able to actually go, okay,\n\n1295\n01:07:56,428 --> 01:07:57,809\nit didn't go all smooth.\n\n1296\n01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:59,548\nWhat can we do to make it better?\n\n1297\n01:07:59,548 --> 01:08:01,956\nAnd then just to make\nsure it's documented and\n\n1298\n01:08:01,956 --> 01:08:04,681\nthat everything is actually\nthe way we need it to be.\n\n1299\n01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:07,636\n>> Now I think you can start to see\nwhere if you're a small company,\n\n1300\n01:08:07,636 --> 01:08:09,410\nthis looks like a lot of bureaucracy.\n\n1301\n01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:12,785\nThis looks like a lot\nof steps to go through.\n\n1302\n01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:16,460\nAnd so a lot of companies that are small,\nsmall development teams or\n\n1303\n01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,570\nwhatever, will just forgo this process,\nand say, you know what?\n\n1304\n01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:22,271\nScrew it, I'm just gonna make changes in\nproduction, and if something goes wrong I\n\n1305\n01:08:22,271 --> 01:08:24,533\ncan just tell the other guys,\nthey're right here in the room with me.\n\n1306\n01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,595\nYou can do that if you've got\na small customer base and\n\n1307\n01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:32,010\nyou're not too terribly worried\nabout your user experience, right?\n\n1308\n01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,760\nSo companies that brand a product as\nbeta and release it to the public?\n\n1309\n01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,630\nThose are companies that are probably\nnot enforcing good change management.\n\n1310\n01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:43,150\nThey're letting their customers\ndo the testing for them.\n\n1311\n01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,700\nBut that's not what most companies want.\n\n1312\n01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,696\nIf you want to scale, if you want to\ngrow to be a large organization or\n\n1313\n01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:50,799\nif you already are,\nif you're an enterprise or\n\n1314\n01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:54,130\na multinational organization,\nyou can't afford to do things like that.\n\n1315\n01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:59,117\nOutages that your customers experience,\nthat's high-visibility stuff.\n\n1316\n01:08:59,117 --> 01:09:03,010\nIt affects your public image,\nand so we can't have that.\n\n1317\n01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:07,200\nSo when we come up with a methodology\nlike this, the steps that we go through,\n\n1318\n01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,720\nwhatever your company decides is the right\namount of steps for your change system,\n\n1319\n01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:17,080\nit's super important that it be enforced,\nthat no one be allowed to\n\n1320\n01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,200\nbypass the change system because\nreally it negates the whole thing.\n\n1321\n01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,970\nIf you have one person that's allowed\nto make changes in the production\n\n1322\n01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:28,870\nenvironment, then you might as well not\neven have the change system at all, right?\n\n1323\n01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,100\nBecause you're over here evaluating and\n\n1324\n01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,900\napproving changes, but you don't even know\nwhat the actual production environment\n\n1325\n01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,200\nlooks like anymore because this other\nperson's able to make direct changes.\n\n1326\n01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,366\nSo you can't have that.\n\n1327\n01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:42,176\nYou've gotta maintain those separate\nsystems and you've gotta control it, and\n\n1328\n01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:44,090\nthat requires a lot of monitoring.\n\n1329\n01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:48,740\nNow the way we control is typically\nthrough the use of something Ronnie\n\n1330\n01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,450\nmentioned earlier which is\na change advisory board.\n\n1331\n01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:53,770\nAnd there's a lot we need\nto talk about with that and\n\n1332\n01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,360\nI know we're short on time on this\nsegment, so let's stop at that thought.\n\n1333\n01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,220\nWe'll kind of put a pin in it or\nwhatever and take a break.\n\n1334\n01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,840\nAnd when we get back, we'll talk about\nthat change advisory board, what it is,\n\n1335\n01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,990\nhow it works and\n\n1336\n01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,340\nways that you can implement it in\nyour environment to control change.\n\n1337\n01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,065\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1338\n01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:11,491\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n1339\n01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:18,991\n[MUSIC]\n\n1340\n01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:20,830\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1341\n01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:26,050\nSo we left off talking about change\nmanagement and how it has to be enforced.\n\n1342\n01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:31,000\nAnd the way we do that is through\nhaving a person or a group of people\n\n1343\n01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,380\nwho are the gatekeeper, who are actually\napproving or declining the changes.\n\n1344\n01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:39,244\nAnd that most commonly takes\nthe form of what's called a change\n\n1345\n01:10:39,244 --> 01:10:41,366\nadvisory board, or a CAB.\n\n1346\n01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:44,580\nNow on the ITool exam,\nyou'll see it referred to as a CAB,\n\n1347\n01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:49,190\nchange advisory board, but there's other\nnames that you may see this fall under.\n\n1348\n01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,240\nSo some people don't call\nit a change advisory board.\n\n1349\n01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:56,210\nThey might call it a change advisory\ncommittee or a change control board, CCB.\n\n1350\n01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,020\nI know I've worked in\nenvironments like that.\n\n1351\n01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,350\nThe name doesn't really matter.\n\n1352\n01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:01,580\nIt's what they do that's important, right?\n\n1353\n01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:06,370\nWhat it is is a group of people who\nhave the authority to approve or\n\n1354\n01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:07,810\ndecline the changes.\n\n1355\n01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:12,500\nNow that act of approving a change,\nthat requires a good bit of knowledge.\n\n1356\n01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,460\nAnd it's likely that the only\nperson who has that level of\n\n1357\n01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,480\nknowledge is the person recommending\nthe change in the first place, and\n\n1358\n01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,180\nthey shouldn't get a vote cause they're\nthe ones recommending the change.\n\n1359\n01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:25,930\nSo the change advisory board is normally\nmade up of a cross-section of your\n\n1360\n01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,910\ncompany, people from different\nparts of the organization that\n\n1361\n01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:34,890\nindividually might not have all the\nknowledge needed to approve or decline.\n\n1362\n01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:40,440\nBut combined, they come together\nlike Voltron and then they've\n\n1363\n01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,260\ngot that power to be able to make the\napproval or decline and move from there.\n\n1364\n01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:49,840\nSo the change advisory board is\nnot normally just one person.\n\n1365\n01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,251\nIt can be, in a small company.\n\n1366\n01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:55,671\nBut normally you're gonna have several\npeople, even people that are outside of\n\n1367\n01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:59,246\nthe IT department, because you\nneed people from outside of the IT\n\n1368\n01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:03,536\ndepartment because they'll understand\nthe impact that's not technical but\n\n1369\n01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:07,458\nmaybe the impact on the regular users or\nemployees within the company.\n\n1370\n01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,570\n>> Yeah.\n\n1371\n01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:12,125\nIn the ITIL guide that\nyou take a look at here.\n\n1372\n01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:17,984\nThey talk about it being a cross\nrepresentation of users and\n\n1373\n01:12:17,984 --> 01:12:20,400\ncustomers at times.\n\n1374\n01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,550\nSo that you do see where the change\nis going to impact not only them, but\n\n1375\n01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:27,850\nalso the other side of it, people\nthat are going to be implementing and\n\n1376\n01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,490\npeople that have technical\nknowledge behind it.\n\n1377\n01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,150\nSo it is a nice cross section,\nthat is what i was trying to get to.\n\n1378\n01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,591\n>> And these are your stake holders, and\nstake holder we use it in ITIL the term\n\n1379\n01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:41,610\nbut it is really from project management\n>> If the people have a vested\n\n1380\n01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:44,680\ninterest in the success of the company,\nright?\n\n1381\n01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,150\nThe people who are moving our company\nforward, and know that strategy,\n\n1382\n01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:51,650\nso that they can evaluate these changes,\nand determine whether they're in line\n\n1383\n01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,990\nwith the strategy,\nwhether they align with our company goals.\n\n1384\n01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:58,970\nSo, that is going to require\na good group of people.\n\n1385\n01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:02,686\nAnd it might be five or six people,\nyou don't want it to be too large,\n\n1386\n01:13:02,686 --> 01:13:04,910\nbecause that's going to slow\ndown the change process.\n\n1387\n01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,550\nBut you don't want to be too\nsmall that you exclude certain\n\n1388\n01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,450\nparts of your organization that\nmight have valuable feedback.\n\n1389\n01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:14,890\nSo, we have this committee, and what a lot\nof organizations will do is say it is\n\n1390\n01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,850\nhard to get that group of people together.\n\n1391\n01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,400\nSo, maybe once a week we\nhave a change meeting.\n\n1392\n01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,010\nAnd so every Thursday,\nwe have a change advisory meeting and\n\n1393\n01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:27,240\nit will be Thursday mornings,\nbuild up whatever changes you have and\n\n1394\n01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,160\nsubmit them on Thursdays, all right.\n\n1395\n01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,300\nSo if I come up with some new change,\nI have got to wait until Thursday.\n\n1396\n01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,730\nI can fill out the form today.\n\n1397\n01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:37,540\nThat’s fine and submit it, but\nthey won't meet until Thursday and\n\n1398\n01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,830\nthey'll make the decision and\ndepending on how your structure is,\n\n1399\n01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:43,890\nyou may or\nmay not want the submitter to be there.\n\n1400\n01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,020\nI worked at one company where when\nyou filled out a change ticket,\n\n1401\n01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:51,040\nyou had to be there at the change\nadvisory meeting so you could provide and\n\n1402\n01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,060\nadditional answers to\nquestions that they had.\n\n1403\n01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,440\nI've worked at other companies, though,\nwhere they were far more strict.\n\n1404\n01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,940\nAnd your RFC needed to be complete.\n\n1405\n01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,150\nIt needed to contain all the information.\n\n1406\n01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:05,070\nAnd so when it went to the cab,\nyou weren't there.\n\n1407\n01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:07,910\nAnd they approved or declined it\nbased on the information they had.\n\n1408\n01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,850\nAnd if it didn't have enough information,\nthey would just defer it, send it right\n\n1409\n01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,580\nback to you, and say resubmit next\nweek with this additional information.\n\n1410\n01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:19,090\nNow that was a little disheartening,\nbecause if there was something missing,\n\n1411\n01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,230\nyou had to wait another week to submit it.\n\n1412\n01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:26,080\nAnd this is where people start to get\na little fidgety, and they say well, this\n\n1413\n01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,300\nsounds like bureaucracy, this sounds like\nit's going to slow my company down, right?\n\n1414\n01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,620\nWe want to be Agile, that's the big\nbuzz word everybody's excited about now.\n\n1415\n01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,460\nAgile is different people have\ndifferent opinions on how Agile works,\n\n1416\n01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,440\nwhen it's implemented right,\nit allows you to make\n\n1417\n01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,510\nminor changes without going\nthrough a change approval process.\n\n1418\n01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,880\nBut they're minor changes,\nthey're not significant and\n\n1419\n01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,320\nyou agree to that in a stand up meeting\nfrom what you can kind of expedite.\n\n1420\n01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,500\nBut critical changes still go\nthrough the CAD, even under Agile.\n\n1421\n01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,270\nWhat happens is a lot of\npeople implement Agile wrong.\n\n1422\n01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,970\nAnd they say,\nwe can get rid of the CAD, and\n\n1423\n01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:04,450\njust move all of our\nchanges through Agile.\n\n1424\n01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,300\nSo we have a quick standup\nmeeting every morning.\n\n1425\n01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,070\nWe say, here's the changes\nI'm going to make today.\n\n1426\n01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:10,650\nAnd everybody says well,\nI guess that sounds okay, you know?\n\n1427\n01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:11,970\nAnd you move forward.\n\n1428\n01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,160\nAnd so Agile becomes a substitute for\nproper planning.\n\n1429\n01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,310\nWhen it's improperly deployed,\nAgile can be really, really bad.\n\n1430\n01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:21,600\nWhen it's deployed right,\nit can actually be really useful.\n\n1431\n01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,940\nIt can take pressure off of your cab, and\n\n1432\n01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,110\nit can make it where your company's able\nto support itself much more quickly.\n\n1433\n01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,470\nSo If you're combining agile methodologies\nwith ITIL just be aware of that,\n\n1434\n01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:37,500\nyou've got to make sure that you set a\nline between what has to go to the cab and\n\n1435\n01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,830\nwhat doesn't.\n\n1436\n01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,220\nBut all the things that go to the cab,\nthese need to be reviewed.\n\n1437\n01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,990\nThese are changes to our product,\nour production environment and\n\n1438\n01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:46,580\nso we need to ensure that they're safe and\nthat\n\n1439\n01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:50,790\nall of the proper planning went into it\nbefore we approve it and roll it forward.\n\n1440\n01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:56,700\n>> Sometimes changes happen or they need\nto occur more immediately but the cab only\n\n1441\n01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,950\nmeets on every Thursday, or every other\nThursday if the company's really small.\n\n1442\n01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:06,530\nSo in the meantime, if we still want\nto be able to still submit our changes,\n\n1443\n01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:09,840\nwe may actually end up be doing\nit in an even smaller group.\n\n1444\n01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,370\nWhich IT calls that as being an emergency\nchange advisory board instead.\n\n1445\n01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,500\nYeah, the eCab, the emergency.\n\n1446\n01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,220\nThey're there because\nsometimes you can't wait.\n\n1447\n01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,890\nAnd the number one example of this\nis going to be a security patch.\n\n1448\n01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:24,410\nRight?\n\n1449\n01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,830\nA new exploit is released in the wild,\n\n1450\n01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,790\nor hopefully one of your testers\nfinds a potential exploit.\n\n1451\n01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,630\nAnd so, they work up a patch for it, and\n\n1452\n01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:36,000\nyou need to patch that\nas quickly as possible.\n\n1453\n01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,240\nWell, if your CAB is made up of people\nfrom all throughout the company,\n\n1454\n01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:43,020\nif it's eight people and\nthey meet every Thursday,\n\n1455\n01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,190\nyou may not be able to get all eight of\nthem together for an emergency meeting.\n\n1456\n01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:52,310\nSo you create an emergency CAB so\nwhen there is a security exploit or\n\n1457\n01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,880\nsome kind of high critical update\nthat needs to be pushed through,\n\n1458\n01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:01,800\nyou can convene this smaller advisory\nboard that may be really small.\n\n1459\n01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:05,050\nIt may just be the CIO,\nthe Chief Information Officer, right.\n\n1460\n01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:08,790\nBut, it'll be a smaller group, that you\ncan pull together at a moment's notice,\n\n1461\n01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,670\nthat may not meet formally in\na meeting room or whatever.\n\n1462\n01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,250\nThey might be by phone,\nyou do a three way conference call, or\n\n1463\n01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,700\nsomething to get these people together.\n\n1464\n01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,850\nRemotely and approve that change so\nyou can make a rapid response.\n\n1465\n01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:25,280\nBut notice even though it's an emergency,\nwe still go through the cab.\n\n1466\n01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,058\nThere's still an approval process.\n\n1467\n01:17:27,058 --> 01:17:31,343\nThe e-cab, what they're going to do,\nis they're going to determine,\n\n1468\n01:17:31,343 --> 01:17:34,495\nis this actually an emergency,\nor can it wait?\n\n1469\n01:17:34,495 --> 01:17:37,840\nBecause sometimes IT guys and\nsecurity professionals,\n\n1470\n01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,890\nwe get a little ahead of ourselves,\na little extra excitement.\n\n1471\n01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,730\nAnd so,\nit might be something that can wait.\n\n1472\n01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:47,412\nAnd so, we make that determination\ninside of the ECAB and\n\n1473\n01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:53,580\nthen if it is an emergency, if it truly is\ncritical then they're going to approve it.\n\n1474\n01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,500\nIt's critical, right?\n\n1475\n01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,100\nIt is rare that you decline it.\n\n1476\n01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,150\nSo they're going to approve it but\n\n1477\n01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,830\nthey'll double check to make sure\nthat the information is correct.\n\n1478\n01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,400\nRight?\n\n1479\n01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,230\nHave we done any testing yet?\n\n1480\n01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:04,040\nWe know this is critical.\n\n1481\n01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,530\nWe know we need to roll it out but\nwe still need to test it because\n\n1482\n01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:11,670\neven though it's critical if it breaks out\nproduct or changes the user experience.\n\n1483\n01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:12,840\nWe need to be able communicate that.\n\n1484\n01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,580\nWe need to have contingency\nplans that it plays to.\n\n1485\n01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:18,280\nSo you still have to do planning.\n\n1486\n01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,580\nMicrosoft rolls out security updates.\n\n1487\n01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:25,330\nCritical security updates on the first\nThursday or second Tuesday of the month?\n\n1488\n01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,270\n>> Shoot.\n>> I always mix that one up.\n\n1489\n01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,700\nIt's either the first Tuesday or\nthe second Tuesday of every month.\n\n1490\n01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,830\nSo they roll these out monthly.\n\n1491\n01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,740\nWell if there's a critical one\nthey'll rush out right away,\n\n1492\n01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,660\nso you might get it in\nthe middle of the month, but\n\n1493\n01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,970\neven Microsoft says don't deploy\nthis right into production,\n\n1494\n01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:42,545\nyou need to deploy it as soon as you can,\nbut test it on your systems.\n\n1495\n01:18:42,545 --> 01:18:44,805\nMake sure it doesn't break your software.\n\n1496\n01:18:44,805 --> 01:18:47,925\nIf it breaks your software you've got to\nreach out to the software development\n\n1497\n01:18:47,925 --> 01:18:49,475\nteam, and find out what you\nneed to do to patch that.\n\n1498\n01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:53,375\nSo just because it's critical\ndoesn't mean rush head long into it.\n\n1499\n01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,915\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've still got to do\n\n1500\n01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:57,515\nyour due diligence to get that approved.\n\n1501\n01:18:57,515 --> 01:19:00,215\n>> James says it's the second Tuesday\nof every month from our system.\n\n1502\n01:19:00,215 --> 01:19:01,345\n>> Thank you chat room.\n\n1503\n01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:02,070\nAwesome.\n\n1504\n01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,560\nNow, in most of the environments\nI've worked in,\n\n1505\n01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,660\nthe ECAB really wasn't a separate\nadvisory board, it was just\n\n1506\n01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:14,690\na selection of the people in the main CAB,\nso everybody in the ECAB was in the CAB,\n\n1507\n01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:19,250\nin the full change advisory board and\nyou just had particular people.\n\n1508\n01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,540\nOne company I worked for,\nwe actually had designated members.\n\n1509\n01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,260\nThere were eight people in the cab, and\nthere were three of them that were on\n\n1510\n01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,180\nthe emergency cab, and so if there was\never an emergency, those were the three\n\n1511\n01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,970\npeople that we contacted to get approval\nfor the change to move it through.\n\n1512\n01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:35,130\nThere was another company I worked for\n\n1513\n01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:38,950\nthough that didn't nail down\nto a particular person.\n\n1514\n01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,770\nThey said the CAB has eight people.\n\n1515\n01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:47,280\nIf there's an emergency, you can just get\napproval from five of them, a majority.\n\n1516\n01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,050\nIf you can get approval from five\nof them go ahead and roll forward.\n\n1517\n01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:52,970\nAnd that left us where if there were\nthree people that we just couldn't reach\n\n1518\n01:19:52,970 --> 01:19:53,550\nby phone.\n\n1519\n01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,418\nThat it was okay,\nwe could move without their approval.\n\n1520\n01:19:56,418 --> 01:20:00,226\nSo your e-cab may not be a separate\nentity all together, but\n\n1521\n01:20:00,226 --> 01:20:03,150\nsimply a division of the existing cab.\n\n1522\n01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,360\nIt's up to the amount of risk that\nyour company is willing to tolerate.\n\n1523\n01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,977\nWhat you don't wanna end up with\nis having an emergency change and\n\n1524\n01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:13,260\nnot being able to reach out\nto the necessary people.\n\n1525\n01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,670\nSo the people that are on the e-cab\nneed to have cell phones.\n\n1526\n01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:21,652\nThey need to be prepared to\nanswer that phone at any time.\n\n1527\n01:20:21,652 --> 01:20:25,160\nEspecially if you've got service\nlevel agreements that you gotta meet.\n\n1528\n01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:31,310\nNow if you don't have SLA's, if you're\na company like, I work for a bank, where\n\n1529\n01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:35,120\nthere really wasn't any business that we\nconducted overnight or on the weekends.\n\n1530\n01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,900\nAnd so in those cases the e-cab\nmight not be available at night,\n\n1531\n01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,130\nthey might not be available on the weekend\ncuz we're not really doing business then.\n\n1532\n01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:45,290\nSo this may be a 24/7 type requirement or\n\n1533\n01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,949\nit might be something much less,\nit does boil down to your organization.\n\n1534\n01:20:50,592 --> 01:20:56,150\nAll right, now that kind of leads\nus into the three types of RFC's.\n\n1535\n01:20:56,150 --> 01:21:00,060\nWhen you submit a request for change,\nwe'll normally categorize them.\n\n1536\n01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,820\nAnd there's are all sorts of categories\nthat you can create that are unique to\n\n1537\n01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:03,800\nyour business.\n\n1538\n01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,810\nBut there are three main categories\nthat ITIL recommends for everyone.\n\n1539\n01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,610\nAnd these are the categories\nthat are gonna determine\n\n1540\n01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:14,730\nwhere this RFC needs to go or if the RFC\neven needs to happen in the first place.\n\n1541\n01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,680\nSo these are three categories of changes.\n\n1542\n01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:22,770\n>> The first category of change that we\nhave is just the regular standard change.\n\n1543\n01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:26,060\nThis type of change is\na preauthorized change\n\n1544\n01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,900\nthat really happens just about every day,\nor weekly.\n\n1545\n01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,890\nIn other words, it's routine work\nthat's being done for organizations.\n\n1546\n01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:41,080\nSo we think about maybe just a change in\nbackups, or maybe something like that?\n\n1547\n01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,475\n>> Well, backups are sensitive, right?\n\n1548\n01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:44,990\n>> Yeah. Right. >> That's kinda like\nholy ground, you don't mess with that.\n\n1549\n01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:49,920\nThis would be just an ongoing activity, so\nsomething like you hire a new employee.\n\n1550\n01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,590\nSo we just hired a new employee.\n\n1551\n01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:53,360\nThey need a user account, don't they?\n\n1552\n01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,920\nSo I've gotta go into our, let's say we\nhave the Windows active directory, and\n\n1553\n01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,470\ncreate a user account.\n\n1554\n01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:00,500\nWell that's a change.\n\n1555\n01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,260\nI just changed the directory.\n\n1556\n01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,030\nBut it's such a minor change.\n\n1557\n01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,540\nIt's adding a user.\n\n1558\n01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,560\nWhat damage could I do adding a user?\n\n1559\n01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,150\nWell I could accidentally give them\nmore permissions than they should have.\n\n1560\n01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:13,090\nThere are mistakes that can be made.\n\n1561\n01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:17,805\nBut it's not gonna bring my system down\nand so those are preauthorized changes.\n\n1562\n01:22:17,805 --> 01:22:23,420\nWhere as we create our service\ntransition model we say,\n\n1563\n01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:27,500\nall right creating a user account,\nresetting your account's password.\n\n1564\n01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:32,030\nIf somebody's last name changes,\nmodifying that, those are minor changes,\n\n1565\n01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:36,550\nthey're preauthorized, you don't need to\nsubmit a request for a change, right?\n\n1566\n01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,120\nYou don't even have to\nfill out the paperwork.\n\n1567\n01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,450\nYou're allowed to just go in and\nmake that change.\n\n1568\n01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:44,190\nDon't involve the cab,\ndon't even fill out the RFC.\n\n1569\n01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:48,110\nYou might have other paperwork that you\nfill out, but it's just minor, right?\n\n1570\n01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:54,580\nSo ongoing regular operations like that,\nadding a new computer to the network.\n\n1571\n01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,720\nThat's a change to the network,\nbut you got lots of computers,\n\n1572\n01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,620\nthat's just a routine thing.\n\n1573\n01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,720\nAdding a new server on the other hand.\n\n1574\n01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,250\nThat's a different story, right?\n\n1575\n01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,880\nSo, we have to draw that line, and that\nline is different for different companies,\n\n1576\n01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,880\nso you've got to figure\nout where the line is for\n\n1577\n01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,030\nyou of what get categorized\nbest as a standard change.\n\n1578\n01:23:16,065 --> 01:23:17,885\nThe next one we have is\nan emergency change.\n\n1579\n01:23:18,885 --> 01:23:23,385\nAn emergency change is special because\nit doesn't involve the cab either.\n\n1580\n01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:25,945\nIt involves the e-cab, the emergency cab.\n\n1581\n01:23:25,945 --> 01:23:29,952\nSo what are changes that\nare critical enough\n\n1582\n01:23:29,952 --> 01:23:34,422\nthat we can't wait until\nthe cab is convening?\n\n1583\n01:23:34,422 --> 01:23:39,132\nSo we need to draw that line as part\nof our service transition model.\n\n1584\n01:23:39,132 --> 01:23:41,060\nOur service policy.\n\n1585\n01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,780\nTo tell employees so that they can\ntell the difference themselves, and\n\n1586\n01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,730\nthey can say, this counts as critical,\nI need to go to the e-cab,\n\n1587\n01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:50,060\nI need to get this moving fast,\nI can't wait until Thursday.\n\n1588\n01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,070\nSo it's just defining what that is.\n\n1589\n01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:55,900\nAnd when it is critical like this,\nit'll be the e-cab that receives it, and\n\n1590\n01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:00,290\nauthorizes it, or\nchanges the category to something else.\n\n1591\n01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,600\n>> Last one is a normal change.\n\n1592\n01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,158\nThis is when we do submit\nour changes to the cab and\n\n1593\n01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,570\nthey will either authorize it or\nthey will decline it.\n\n1594\n01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:11,930\nSo anything else that's not\ncategorized by that standard change or\n\n1595\n01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:12,950\nthe emergency change,\n\n1596\n01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:17,870\nis just gonna be a regular submission, cab\nwill meet every Thursday, every Tuesday,\n\n1597\n01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:21,610\nwhatever day it may be to decide whether\nor not that change is gonna be done.\n\n1598\n01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,800\n>> Yeah.\nSo, these are easy to confuse.\n\n1599\n01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,390\nI know for me, on the exam,\nI had a hard time with this.\n\n1600\n01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:30,070\nBecause standard and normal, to me\n>> Sound the same.\n\n1601\n01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,120\n>> It means the same thing, right?\n\n1602\n01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,270\nBut, when we talk about our tickets,\njust standard changes,\n\n1603\n01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:37,060\nthat's routine stuff,\ndoesn't go through the CAB.\n\n1604\n01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,630\nNormal, that's a change, right?\n\n1605\n01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,280\nNormal goes through the CAB.\n\n1606\n01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,980\nSo, standard changes don't\ngot to the cab and e-cab.\n\n1607\n01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,200\nI mean emergency.\n\n1608\n01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,410\nThose go to the e-cab.\n\n1609\n01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,560\nSo, those two are special.\n\n1610\n01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:54,550\nEverything else is just a normal change,\nor some people just call that a change.\n\n1611\n01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,373\nSo a normal change that runs\nthrough the change advisory board.\n\n1612\n01:24:57,373 --> 01:24:59,901\nBut the key take away here is,\nwell first the categories,\n\n1613\n01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:01,930\nyou need to know those for the exam.\n\n1614\n01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:07,230\nBut the other thing is making\nsure you define ahead of time\n\n1615\n01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,730\nwhat these boundaries are,\nso that your employees know.\n\n1616\n01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,610\nEveryone in your IT department,\nevery single person that could\n\n1617\n01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:18,190\npotentially change your production\nenvironment needs to know the differences.\n\n1618\n01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:20,820\nIf they're able to make changes in\nyour dev environment, or staging, or\n\n1619\n01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,130\nwhatever, that's not a big deal, right?\n\n1620\n01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:25,470\nBut anybody who can make a change\nin the production environment,\n\n1621\n01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,794\nanybody who has the permissions,\nthe user account access,\n\n1622\n01:25:28,794 --> 01:25:32,460\nthe physical building access to\nget to your production servers.\n\n1623\n01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,715\nAny employee who has that type of access,\nneeds to know by heart,\n\n1624\n01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,160\nmemorized in their mind, the difference\nbetween those three categories.\n\n1625\n01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:40,850\nRight.\n\n1626\n01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:43,720\nWhen they're allowed to make\na change without approval,\n\n1627\n01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,275\nwhen they have to seek approval and when\nthat approval can come from the emergency\n\n1628\n01:25:48,275 --> 01:25:51,000\ncab instead of the regular cab, right?\n\n1629\n01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,990\nThat way they know when they're about to\nmake a change who they need to go to, and\n\n1630\n01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:57,460\nif they violate that, right?\n\n1631\n01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,160\nIf they decide that they're gonna apply\nsome updates to a server and they say,\n\n1632\n01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,560\nwell that's just standard stuff,\nI'm just applying an update, right?\n\n1633\n01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,190\nThey need to know they've broken the rules\nand that you can then take action on that.\n\n1634\n01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:11,480\nBut if you haven't set that forth in\na written policy then they don't know.\n\n1635\n01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:14,308\nAnd that's where you really have\na challenge bringing on new employees.\n\n1636\n01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:18,890\nWhen you on-board a new IT worker\nthey need to understand that\n\n1637\n01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:21,900\nit might be different here than\nit was at their last company.\n\n1638\n01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,520\nAt their last company maybe they did\njust blanket push out updates to their\n\n1639\n01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,920\nworkstations, and\nnot worry about it, right?\n\n1640\n01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,400\nMaybe all of their applications\nwere web based applications, so\n\n1641\n01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,420\nthey didn't really care about\nupdates to the operating system.\n\n1642\n01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:38,590\nBut in your environment, your applications\nmight be dedicated apps that run right on\n\n1643\n01:26:38,590 --> 01:26:42,860\nthe workstation, and when that operating\nsystem update goes out, it breaks the app.\n\n1644\n01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,341\nSo they need to know that your\ncompany is structured differently, and\n\n1645\n01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:47,703\nwhere do you draw the line.\n\n1646\n01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,472\nNow the exam's not gonna\nask you to draw that line,\n\n1647\n01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:50,720\ncuz they don't know your company.\n\n1648\n01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:54,540\nBut they are gonna ask you to\nunderstand those categories.\n\n1649\n01:26:54,540 --> 01:26:57,910\nSo we spent a lot of time\non change management,\n\n1650\n01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,670\nbut that's because it is so critical.\n\n1651\n01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:05,130\nAnd you guys start to see where it helps\nto create a more stable IT environment.\n\n1652\n01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,330\nBecause unauthorized\nchanges aren't going in and\n\n1653\n01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:11,230\nthe changes that do go in have\nbeen thoroughly tested, right?\n\n1654\n01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:13,710\nThat's gonna result in stability.\n\n1655\n01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:18,490\nSo if you're a CIO, if you're a Chief\nInformation Officer or an IT manager.\n\n1656\n01:27:18,490 --> 01:27:20,440\nYou love this, this is great.\n\n1657\n01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:25,420\nYou hate it when at 10:00 PM you get\na phone call cuz something's wrong at\n\n1658\n01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:29,370\nthe office, and you find one of your guys\nwas messing around on the servers, right?\n\n1659\n01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,170\nNot messing around, but\n\n1660\n01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,910\njust making changes without testing them\nthoroughly and now you've got a problem.\n\n1661\n01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:38,870\nSo for management this is great and\nfor your customer\n\n1662\n01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:43,110\nit's great cuz it makes sure that these\nchanges don't affect their experience too.\n\n1663\n01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:47,000\nSo any medium,\nlarge enterprise organization\n\n1664\n01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,900\nis going to have an established change\nmanagement plan, and if they don't,\n\n1665\n01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,760\nthey're doing themselves a disservice.\n\n1666\n01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,550\nSmall companies might\nchoose to forego this.\n\n1667\n01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:58,140\nAnd they can do that cuz\ncommunication is a lot easier.\n\n1668\n01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,890\nBut eventually, they'll need it.\n\n1669\n01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,420\nSo when companies start looking at ITIL,\n\n1670\n01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:06,860\nthe change management piece is usually\none of the first things they deploy.\n\n1671\n01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:12,940\nSo there are many people out there that if\nyou poll them and ask them what is ITIL.\n\n1672\n01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,530\nSome of them will even answer, oh yeah\nit's change management, we love it.\n\n1673\n01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:20,230\nNot realizing there's a whole heck a lot\nmore to service management than this.\n\n1674\n01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:23,790\nThis is probably one of\nthe most critical pieces.\n\n1675\n01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:28,380\nAll right well Ronnie, I think we've\ncovered change pretty exhaustively.\n\n1676\n01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:32,530\nWe didn't dive very deep into\nconfiguration though, which very similar.\n\n1677\n01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:34,810\nSo, we'll see that in an upcoming episode,\nbut\n\n1678\n01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,730\nwe're pretty much out of time for\nthis one.\n\n1679\n01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:38,615\nSo we'll wrap it up here.\n\n1680\n01:28:38,615 --> 01:28:40,395\nDefinitely stay tuned,\nwe're gonna do a part two,\n\n1681\n01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:43,455\nwhere we'll jump into configuration and\na few of the other things, right?\n\n1682\n01:28:43,455 --> 01:28:45,775\nWe've got all sorts of stuff left over,\nright?\n\n1683\n01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:47,105\nLet's quick review that.\n\n1684\n01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:50,605\nWe've got configuration management,\nservice validation and testing,\n\n1685\n01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:54,300\nchange evaluation, and\nknowledge management.\n\n1686\n01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,450\nHandful of other processes to tackle,\nthose will all be in part two so\n\n1687\n01:28:57,450 --> 01:28:58,270\nmake sure you check that out.\n\n1688\n01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,020\nIn the mean time,\n\n1689\n01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,210\nif you have questions on

01:29:34,788\nIt is a lot of data and some of it's new.\n\n1701\n01:29:34,788 --> 01:29:38,490\nSo, we wanna make sure you have an easy\nway of moving in and understanding it.\n\n1702\n01:29:38,490

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:39,051\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,310\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nonce again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,030\nHow's it going, Ronnie?\n\n8\n00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,950\n>> It is going well, today is Friday.\n\n9\n00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,660\nI have listened to my fill of the dulcet\ntones of Alannis Morrisette, and\n\n10\n00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,520\nI'm ready for a change.\n\n11\n00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,735\n>> All right.\n\n12\n00:00:51,735 --> 00:00:53,174\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n13\n00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:54,515\nI'm joking on the Alannis Morrisette.\n\n14\n00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:57,305\n>> I don't know if that's good or bad.\n\n15\n00:00:57,305 --> 00:00:58,885\nWell, speaking of change, right?\n\n16\n00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:02,175\nSo we are jumping right back\ninto ITIL foundations and\n\n17\n00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:05,455\nparticularly back into\nservice integration.\n\n18\n00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:07,335\nAnd if you've been following along,\n\n19\n00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:10,945\nwe've already done one episode on\nservice integration but it's such a big\n\n20\n00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,685\ntopic because of change management,\nthat we only got through half of it.\n\n21\n00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:18,564\nSo we're picking up with the second\npart today and we've got a handful of\n\n22\n00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:22,138\nprocesses to cover that we just\ndidn't get to in the original one.\n\n23\n00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:27,800\nNow the first episode covered what service\nintegration was, that overall process.\n\n24\n00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,850\nAnd we talked a little bit about\ndrafting our service policy.\n\n25\n00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,480\nAnd we talk about changed management,\n\n26\n00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,020\nbig amount of content there\non changed management.\n\n27\n00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,155\n>> Now Don you've kind of\nswitched up terms on us so\n\n28\n00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:41,270\nremember in ITIL we call\nit service transition.\n\n29\n00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,170\n>> Oh shoot.\n\n30\n00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,600\n>> You're calling it service integration,\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,440\n>> Sorry yeah, terminology is important\n\n32\n00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,230\n>> Service transition.\n\n33\n00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,550\n>> So service transition and\nwe're really talking about\n\n34\n00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,530\nintroducing some kind of functionality\ninto our production environment and\n\n35\n00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,470\nintegration is part of that.\n\n36\n00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,140\n>> It is.\n\n37\n00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,740\n>> But it's not the right term.\n\n38\n00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,310\nSo service transition, that's what\nwe're diving back into and we're gonna\n\n39\n00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,410\npick back up with some of the other\nprocesses that are equally important.\n\n40\n00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,580\nThe change management piece, that\napplies to every company out there, but\n\n41\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,530\nsome of these other ones may or may not,\nyou may move in these directions,\n\n42\n00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,440\nyou may not, and so\nwe'll just kind of tackle them.\n\n43\n00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,220\nThere's a few extras that aren't on\nthe exam, but I want to cover anyway\n\n44\n00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,800\nto make sure we have good\ncompleteness of the covered material.\n\n45\n00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,370\nSo let's go ahead and dive into that.\n\n46\n00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,830\nThe first process that we're going\nto tackle today is service asset and\n\n47\n00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,170\nconfiguration management.\n\n48\n00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,941\nNow what are we talking about here?\n\n49\n00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,538\nBefore we dive into it too deeply I wanna\nmake sure that we understand exactly\n\n50\n00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:40,390\nwhat an asset is.\n\n51\n00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,200\nSo this is asset management as\nwell as configuration management.\n\n52\n00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,890\nSo how we handle these\ntwo different things.\n\n53\n00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,490\nAnd on the asset side, an asset is really\n\n54\n00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,450\nanything we need to deliver the service,\nto get this service put in place.\n\n55\n00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,960\nAnd these are things that\nare really non negotiable.\n\n56\n00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,240\nWe need these assets if we\nwant to get something done.\n\n57\n00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,050\nAnd for the most part,\nasset management is easy.\n\n58\n00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,350\nYou list in the design, in service\ndesign what you need, and then by\n\n59\n00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,990\nthe time you get to service transition\nyou just get the resources you need.\n\n60\n00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,060\nSo that part is really,\nreally straightforward.\n\n61\n00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,150\n>> Yeah, the acquisition side of things,\nit really is just about buying them or\n\n62\n00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,830\nmaking sure that you can get\na hold of them to be able\n\n63\n00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,680\nto put into the production.\n\n64\n00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,610\nWhen we start to take a look here\nat managing those assets, we're\n\n65\n00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,360\nactually trying to make sure that we have\nthe right number of the items on hand.\n\n66\n00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,280\nWe're trying to make sure\nthat if we buy software\n\n67\n00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,630\nwe're getting the right software that\nwill give us the service that we need.\n\n68\n00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,900\nAnd if it's something like servers,\n\n69\n00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,220\nwe wanna make sure that there's powerful\nenough to do everything that we want.\n\n70\n00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,220\nSo just even simple things like that\nare some of the things that we're\n\n71\n00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,610\ntrying to make sure that we do\nas we move into production.\n\n72\n00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,910\nIt can even include somebody's\nexpert advice if we need,\n\n73\n00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,980\nto bring them on hand as a contractor.\n\n74\n00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,900\n>> Yeah, it might not be a tangible asset,\n\n75\n00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,290\nlike a server, it might be something\nsomebody's got in their brain.\n\n76\n00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,718\nAnd in that scenario it's not so\nmuch that any web developer would do,\n\n77\n00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:10,760\nit's that there's this particular\nweb developer has something in\n\n78\n00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,240\ntheir head that you need as part of this\nservice, so it can be very specific.\n\n79\n00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,685\nNow with assets like that a lot of times\nyou either have them or you don't.\n\n80\n00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:25,625\nThere's no real configuration involved,\nbut there are some assets where\n\n81\n00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,967\nthere is a configuration and\nsoftware is a great example of that.\n\n82\n00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,957\nWhen you deploy software, that software\nhas a certain set of features,\n\n83\n00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:38,607\na certain set of functionality, and\nwe might change that as a part of\n\n84\n00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:42,700\nlocating bugs, security patches,\nadding new features, or whatever.\n\n85\n00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,900\nThat is considered a configuration change.\n\n86\n00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,530\nAnd if you have a server,\nlike a physical server,\n\n87\n00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,970\nwe might want to add memory to it or\nchange the hard drive configuration.\n\n88\n00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,710\nThat's a configuration change.\n\n89\n00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,060\nThese are assets that we don't just have,\nbut we're also able to modify and\n\n90\n00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,480\nmodifying one of those\nassets can positively or\n\n91\n00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,770\nnegatively impact the actual\nservice delivery.\n\n92\n00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,320\nSo, we've gotta be careful about that and\n\n93\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,190\nwe've gotta implement something\nvery similar to change management.\n\n94\n00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,000\nChange management is\nwhen we change any aspect\n\n95\n00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,590\nof what we are doing usually focused\naround our triple constraints.\n\n96\n00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,960\nOur costs, our schedule,\nand our requirements.\n\n97\n00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,730\nConfiguration management almost\nalways centers around requirements.\n\n98\n00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,875\nWhen we move this service into production\nit's supposed to be matching up,\n\n99\n00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:33,540\naligning with our business strategy, and\nmeeting the requirements that were set for\n\n100\n00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,047\nit back in service design.\n\n101\n00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:39,980\nThat's defined in our SDP, but\nif we need to make some kind of a change,\n\n102\n00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,125\nif we can do that without impacting\nthe actual requirements, great.\n\n103\n00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,270\nAnd we can improve that and\nmove it through.\n\n104\n00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,760\nIf we have to impact\nthe requirements though\n\n105\n00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,590\nthen we're going to need\nto go into a change ticket.\n\n106\n00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,750\nSo configuration management really\noperates inside of change management.\n\n107\n00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,180\nSometimes it doesn’t involve the change\nmanagement system if it's one that doesn’t\n\n108\n00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,770\nimpact the requirements, but other times\nIt leads to a change ticket anyway so\n\n109\n00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,320\nit's kind of nested inside of it.\n\n110\n00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,330\nAnd this is one of those where not\nevery organization needs that.\n\n111\n00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,190\nIf you do software development, it's\nalmost a guarantee you're going to have\n\n112\n00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,620\nconfiguration management,\nthe actual configuration of the software.\n\n113\n00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,760\nBut if you have a like a hosting\nenvironment where you don't write any\n\n114\n00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,700\ncustom software you just have equipment,\nracks, and employees.\n\n115\n00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,190\nYou'll probably just do\nchange management and\n\n116\n00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,920\nnot worry about trying to split things\noff in configuration management.\n\n117\n00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,620\nSo that's where it gets a little\nconfusing that a lot of companies do\n\n118\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,420\nmerge them together.\n\n119\n00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,440\n>> ITIL also calls out not\nonly the concept of an asset\n\n120\n00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840\nwhich are the things we just talked about.\n\n121\n00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,390\nFor example, the server or\nsoftware, even expert personnel.\n\n122\n00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,940\nBut then it moves beyond that and\n\n123\n00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,460\ncalls up something we call a configurable\nitem, or a configuration item.\n\n124\n00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,460\nThe configuration item is when we take\nthat asset and now we build it up and\n\n125\n00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,720\nwe get it ready for transition into\nthe production environment as well.\n\n126\n00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,390\n>> Well, no, so, they're actually\nreally specific about what a CI is,\n\n127\n00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,830\nso, what you said is exactly how most\norganizations are going to perceive that,\n\n128\n00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,450\nbut, really a CI is just an asset.\n\n129\n00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:17,580\nOkay, a CI is an asset, but\nit's an asset that can be configured.\n\n130\n00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,960\nSo remember how I said there's some\nthings that you can't configure.\n\n131\n00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,670\nSo let's say, Ronnie, that you have\nintimate knowledge of our web server,\n\n132\n00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:30,090\nright, and something that you're an expert\non, that you know, and I want to have you\n\n133\n00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,610\ninvolved in this service transition\nbecause I know you are the expert.\n\n134\n00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,620\nCan I configure you?\n\n135\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,900\n>> No.\n>> Not really right?\n\n136\n00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,938\nSo you are a true asset.\n\n137\n00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:45,510\nBut if you're working on a server and\nthe server can be configured,\n\n138\n00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,600\nwe identify that way by calling it a CI,\na configuration item.\n\n139\n00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,458\nSo it's easy to mix these up because\na configuration item is always an asset.\n\n140\n00:07:54,458 --> 00:08:00,417\nCI's are assets, but\nan asset is not always a CI.\n\n141\n00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:04,494\nSo my laptop might be a CI,\nI can configure that, but\n\n142\n00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,860\nyou would just be an asset.\n\n143\n00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,490\nBoth of you are assets the laptop and\nyou, so that's really it.\n\n144\n00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,590\nIt's not centered around how we use it,\n\n145\n00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,070\njust what that CI actually is,\nit's just anything we can configure.\n\n146\n00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,980\nSo that terminology can be a little odd,\nbut it is what helps us to determine\n\n147\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,960\nwhat goes through configuration management\nand what goes through change management.\n\n148\n00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,408\nAnytime we do something that\ninvolves a regular asset,\n\n149\n00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,780\nwe're typically gonna have\nto go to change management.\n\n150\n00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,330\nBut anything involving a CI if we\n\n151\n00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,880\nhave configuration management\nwe'll go that route.\n\n152\n00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,120\nSo it's just a vocabulary word,\na label that we use to identify\n\n153\n00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,980\nwhere we need to go when we're\nimplementing some kind of change.\n\n154\n00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,690\nAnd if you don't have configuration\nmanagement it just all goes to the same\n\n155\n00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,820\nplace anyways so\nyou don't even bother to limiting it.\n\n156\n00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,470\nBut in development projects, areas like\nthat, it will be very specific and\n\n157\n00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,230\nsay, These are C.I.'s and these\nare assets so that you know where to go.\n\n158\n00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,340\nAlright when we talk\nabout service asset and\n\n159\n00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,230\nconfiguration management,\nwe are really just focusing on those TI's.\n\n160\n00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,533\nIf you have something that's an asset,\nconfiguration management doesn't help.\n\n161\n00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,140\nGo to change management.\n\n162\n00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,480\nBut for C.I.'s that's where we\ncome in with this process and\n\n163\n00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,610\nthis process has a long name, service\nasset and configuration management, and\n\n164\n00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,430\nso most of the time you'll\nsee it abbreviated.\n\n165\n00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,640\nEven on the exam, you'll see it\nabbreviated most of the time,\n\n166\n00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,410\nit'll be SACM.\n\n167\n00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,510\nSo when we're dealing with\nSACM we're focused on CIs.\n\n168\n00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,250\nWe're gonna go acronym\ncrazy in this episode.\n\n169\n00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,400\n>> So when we focus in on\nthe configuration items themselves,\n\n170\n00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,020\nwe're really taking a look at six\ndifferent ways that we're going to\n\n171\n00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,260\nfocus in on those configuration items.\n\n172\n00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,150\nWe're going to first of all be\nable to identify the items that\n\n173\n00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,000\nwe actually need to configure.\n\n174\n00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,060\nWe're going to talk about control and\neven protecting those assets that we have.\n\n175\n00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,150\nWe are going to be recording making sure\nthat everything is actually there and\n\n176\n00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,965\nworking like we want to.\n\n177\n00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:02,040\nReporting on it and\nthen auditing as well as verifying that\n\n178\n00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,440\nthings are the way that we want\nthem to be able to do that.\n\n179\n00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,085\nWith those configuration items,\n\n180\n00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:12,390\nthat first one we want to focus\nin on is of course identity.\n\n181\n00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,210\nWe want to make sure, of course, that we\ncan distinguish between the asset and\n\n182\n00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,620\nwhat the configuration item is, and we\nknow where we're actually going to use it.\n\n183\n00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,550\n>> Yeah, so\nthat step one is identify, right?\n\n184\n00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:29,160\nWe find out what our CIs are,\nonce we know that, we control, all right?\n\n185\n00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,150\nControl says, this is a CI if you wanna\nchange it you are not allowed to change\n\n186\n00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,670\nit unless you go through\nconfiguration management right.\n\n187\n00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,220\nSo configuration management is\nthe control that we've put in place.\n\n188\n00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,590\nAfter that we've got record.\n\n189\n00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,640\nAny configuration change that there is we\nhave to record that it happened, right?\n\n190\n00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,540\nThat we did it, that it was put\nin place or that it was declined.\n\n191\n00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,490\nWe didn't allow the change.\n\n192\n00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,400\nBut this is very similar\nto change management.\n\n193\n00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400\nJust focus on the CIs.\n\n194\n00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,830\n>> We also have the reporting and\nauditing.\n\n195\n00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,020\nA lot of times those things\ncan go together, right?\n\n196\n00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,100\nAnd just like we saw the other day,\nit is a lot of overlap.\n\n198\n00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,930\nBut with reporting,\nwe gather information together about\n\n199\n00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,810\nthe configuration change that was just put\ninto place and we audit to ensure that\n\n200\n00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,510\nany change that was actually made is\nlimited to the change that was approved.\n\n201\n00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,010\nYou've always got to audit to ensure\nsomebody doesn't change beyond what\n\n202\n00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,540\nwas approved.\n\n203\n00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,797\nAnd these two, the audit and the report,\n\n204\n00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:30,660\nare the data that feeds into\nthe very last one, which is verify.\n\n205\n00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,730\nWe verify that the configuration changes\nachieved the result that it wanted.\n\n206\n00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,202\nSo the last three steps there,\nreport, audit,\n\n207\n00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:40,630\nverify they really kind\nof all merge together.\n\n208\n00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,150\nMost people do those as one, but\nITEL calls them out separately in case\n\n209\n00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,290\nyou want to create processes or\npolicies for how each one is handled.\n\n210\n00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,560\nYou can do that, it is all divided.\n\n211\n00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,403\nBut that is the basic principle of SACM.\n\n212\n00:11:55,403 --> 00:12:02,202\nWe identify, control, record,\nreport, audit, and verify.\n\n213\n00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:05,110\nAll right,\nnow this is all an integral piece\n\n214\n00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,430\nif you're doing software development.\n\n215\n00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,890\nSo if you are working for\n\n216\n00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,570\nan organization that creates internal\nsoftware or creates software for sale.\n\n217\n00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,930\nYou know maybe that is the core\nservice of your company.\n\n218\n00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:16,270\nYou sell some kind of software product.\n\n219\n00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,210\nYou are going to implement\nconfiguration management there.\n\n220\n00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,880\nThis is perfect.\n\n221\n00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,485\nThis is really what this is designed for\nand there's many other methodologies that\n\n222\n00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:28,451\nare out there you might hear about,\nlike XP and water fall development, agile.\n\n223\n00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:33,792\nThose are not designed to, or\nITEL is not designed to replace those,\n\n224\n00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:39,226\nso if you are using those in your\nenvironment you can still use those and\n\n225\n00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,390\nintegrate them into ITEL.\n\n226\n00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,120\nSo this is a framework, we pick and\nwe choose the pieces that we want.\n\n227\n00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,760\nSo we might to straight up\nITIL change management but\n\n228\n00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,955\nstick with the configuration\nmanagement from waterfall or\n\n229\n00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:54,310\nwherever it is that we\nare pulling that from.\n\n230\n00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,950\nBut if we want, we can basically build it\non our own right off the ITIL framework.\n\n231\n00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,020\nSo, that's where we're\ngoing to be pulling this.\n\n232\n00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,680\nAnd when we talk about configuration\nchanges in software development,\n\n233\n00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,160\nwe are normally talking about\nour builds and releases.\n\n234\n00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,980\nWhen you deal with software, a build\nis anytime you put some changes in and\n\n235\n00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,720\nyou compile the software to be\nable to do testing and Q and A.\n\n236\n00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,765\nA build is not typically something\nsomething that you release to the public,\n\n237\n00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:24,325\nit's for internal testing and evaluation\nas you continue to refine your product.\n\n238\n00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:30,275\nEvery so often you'll designate\na build as stable or gold,\n\n239\n00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,110\nthere's different terms for it.\n\n240\n00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,150\nAnd you'll say that this is a good build,\ntt has all the stuff that we wanted,\n\n241\n00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,480\nand it's ready to be\nreleased to the customer.\n\n242\n00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,760\nNow we make the release\navailable to the customer.\n\n243\n00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,770\nSo you'll have a lot of builds and\na handful of releases.\n\n244\n00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,890\nWell, how do you know\nwhen to do a release?\n\n245\n00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,630\nThis design cycle is really important for\n\n246\n00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,640\nsoftware development because technically\na software program is never done.\n\n247\n00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,050\nIf you leave it up to the developers and\nif you say okay, I need you create for\n\n248\n00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,870\nme a word processor.\n\n249\n00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,280\nAnd I want it to be the best word\nprocessor anybody's ever seen and\n\n250\n00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,830\nyou turn the developers loose on it.\n\n251\n00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,420\nYou could check in with them every\nmonth for the rest of your life and\n\n252\n00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,230\nsay, is it done?\n\n253\n00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,240\nAnd they'll always say no because they'll\nalways think of something new to add,\n\n254\n00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,250\nsome way to make it better, right?\n\n255\n00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,820\nA software application is never done.\n\n256\n00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,600\nSo that's why it's so\nimportant important that we implement\n\n257\n00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,560\na service design package where we specify\nhere's the initial requirements and\n\n258\n00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,180\nwhen we meet those, let's do a release and\nthen here's additional things that we hope\n\n259\n00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,275\nto achieve and when we achieve some\nof these we do another release.\n\n260\n00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:41,148\nAnd so you have to set these milestones\nwhere we want the releases to occur, and\n\n261\n00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,230\nthat's pretty important.\n\n262\n00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,655\nSo if we've slated a release\nto come a month from now and\n\n263\n00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:48,040\nhere's some of the different\nthings that we are going to offer.\n\n264\n00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,950\nIf we need to change the way\nthat we offer those features,\n\n265\n00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,310\nwe're dealing with configuration changes.\n\n266\n00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,360\nWe got to go in and\nmake those modifications.\n\n267\n00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,020\nIt's not necessarily a whole project.\n\n268\n00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,860\nWe don't want to go into project\nmanagement on something simple for\n\n269\n00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,930\na simple modification and so\n\n270\n00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,110\nconfiguration management helps that and\nwe push it through.\n\n271\n00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,050\nBecause it has no end,\nit counts as a day-to-day operation.\n\n272\n00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,330\nProjects always have a start and a finish.\n\n273\n00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,400\nProjects always had an end, and\nin a software development cycle but\n\n274\n00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,110\nwe just don't have that end and so\nproject management doesn't work so well.\n\n275\n00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,200\nThat's why we have XP and\nwaterfall and all those other guys.\n\n276\n00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,310\n>> Now because this entire process\nis called the service asset and\n\n277\n00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,680\nconfiguration management, there's\na lot of things that we can have in\n\n278\n00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,280\nplace to help us to do the managing side.\n\n279\n00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,140\nSo a lot of times when we start\ntalking that, we tend to look for\n\n280\n00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,630\nsome type of software,\nsomething that will help us manage it and\n\n281\n00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,610\nthere's really three different systems\nthat we're really gonna focus in on.\n\n282\n00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,260\nWe're gonna take a look at the service\nknowledge management system,\n\n283\n00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,880\nthe configuration management system, and\n\n284\n00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,180\nlastly the one that I'm least familiar\nwith is the definitive media library.\n\n285\n00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,710\nNow Don,\nwhat's the logical order to tackle this?\n\n286\n00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,250\n>> All right let's start with SKMS.\n\n287\n00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,130\nWe've kind of already talked about\nthat one in the last episode.\n\n288\n00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,024\nThe Service Knowledge Management System,\nthe SKMS That's that database and\n\n289\n00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,042\nrepository of all the information\nregarding your service.\n\n290\n00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,793\nSo, when you created your\nservice design package,\n\n291\n00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:16,250\nit's probably logged into your\nSKMS it's kinda what it's for.\n\n292\n00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,870\nAny change tickets,\nall the other supporting documentation,\n\n293\n00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,220\nany information like that you might have,\ngets put into the SKMS.\n\n294\n00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,770\nAnd if you remember me talking\nabout it in the last episode,\n\n295\n00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,016\nI mentioned how SKMS is a big deal,\nthis how you're going to run your company.\n\n296\n00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:36,837\nAnd so, most companies don't start\nout with an SKMS, it's just too much.\n\n297\n00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:41,139\nSo, they might start out with\nsomething smaller, a single piece and\n\n298\n00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,378\nthen grow to make up that full SKMS.\n\n299\n00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,949\nSo, that single piece that we start\nwith is that second part the CMS,\n\n300\n00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:49,550\nthat configuration management system.\n\n301\n00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,720\nThat's technically a part of the SKMS.\n\n302\n00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,380\nYou might start there.\n\n303\n00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,070\nNow, in the SKMS,\nwe wanna store a lot of different stuff.\n\n304\n00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,820\nBut at a minimum, we need to store\nwhat our configuration items are and\n\n305\n00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,725\nwhat the relationship is between\nthe different configuration items.\n\n306\n00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:10,388\nSo, I might have a table in the database\nthat's considered a CI, and so\n\n307\n00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:15,206\nanytime I add a new column to that table\nor modify a data type on that table,\n\n308\n00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:18,045\nthat's gonna be a configuration change.\n\n309\n00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,883\nBut that table,\nif this is a relational database,\n\n310\n00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:25,437\nthere might be views that are built off of\nthat table, there might be other queries\n\n311\n00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:29,001\nthat are pulling it that might be\nset to pull all the columns, and\n\n312\n00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:33,066\nas I start to add more columns,\nthat's affecting those queries.\n\n313\n00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,050\nIf the queries are going in for\njust specific columns,\n\n314\n00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,000\nthe might not see the ones that we added,\nand so it doesn't affect them.\n\n315\n00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,470\nBut we need to understand\nthat relationship.\n\n316\n00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,880\nHow do you know the relationship\nbetween one CI and another?\n\n317\n00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,668\nYou might have a laser beam\nfocus on one particular CI, and\n\n318\n00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:50,545\nyou make that change,\nyou make it exactly the way you want.\n\n319\n00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:51,793\nBut then, it cascades, and\n\n320\n00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:55,730\nyou've made accidental changes elsewhere\nbecause you didn't know the relationship.\n\n321\n00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,030\nSo, that's kind of what we store,\nour CI attributes,\n\n322\n00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,900\nwhich are the things that we can change,\nand then the CI relationships.\n\n323\n00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,400\nNow, when that's stored in the SKMS,\n\n324\n00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,730\nit's sort of alongside all\nthe other information.\n\n325\n00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,540\nIt's really cool.\n\n326\n00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,320\nYou get this nice, big,\nhigh level view of everything.\n\n327\n00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,470\nBut that's really challenging for\npeople to create.\n\n328\n00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,120\nIt takes years to get\na company to adopt that and\n\n329\n00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,720\nstart to use it for their routine.\n\n330\n00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,935\nSo, we normally start smaller with that\nCMS, that configuration management system,\n\n331\n00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:28,317\nand this is gonna be something\nlike GitHub or Bitbucket,\n\n332\n00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:32,840\nany kind of source code repository and\nthere's a million of them out there.\n\n333\n00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,450\nYou pick which one makes you happy.\n\n334\n00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,920\nIf that's the kinda thing\nthat makes you happy.\n\n335\n00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,750\nAnd you have your source code for\nyour applications all stored right there.\n\n336\n00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,930\nAny of the team can review it,\n\n337\n00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,830\nand if they wanna make a change,\nthey check out a file.\n\n338\n00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,940\nSo, they check it out.\n\n339\n00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,880\nThey make their change.\n\n340\n00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,444\nThey then resubmit it and now it has to\nget approved, and if it gets approved,\n\n341\n00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:55,727\nit gets merged into the main application,\nif it doesn't it is a fork, so\n\n342\n00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,202\nit's kinda split off and\n\n343\n00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:01,586\nthey can continue developing it until\nthey do get approved and pushed in.\n\n344\n00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:05,603\nSo, they're changing that software,\ndoing their development cycle, and\n\n345\n00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,790\nit's all right there in the CMS.\n\n346\n00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,660\nThese are actually pretty easy to get\npeople to adopt because if you have\n\n347\n00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,610\na programming team with more than just one\nperson, they're gonna be asking for this.\n\n348\n00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,090\nThey're gonna say, man, there has gotta\nbe a way where I can coordinate what I'm\n\n349\n00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,420\ndoing with the other developers so\nwe're not stepping on each other's toes.\n\n350\n00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,300\nIf I'm editing one particular\ndependent library,\n\n351\n00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,610\nI don't want somebody else to\nbe editing that library too.\n\n352\n00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,070\nOr if I'm including\nthese files in my code,\n\n353\n00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,070\nI don't want somebody modifying my\nincludes when I don't know about it.\n\n354\n00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,470\nI need to be kept aware.\n\n355\n00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,300\nAnd that's what a CMS does,\na Configuration Management System.\n\n356\n00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,111\nDon't mix that up with\na Content Management System,\n\n357\n00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:48,240\nwhich is just like the ITProTV website.\n\n358\n00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,450\nWe make content available to you.\n\n359\n00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,030\nThat's a content management system.\n\n360\n00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,460\nBut a configuration management system\nis where we're tracking edits,\n\n361\n00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,980\ntracking revisions,\ndoing approvals and declines.\n\n362\n00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,120\nWe're controlling our configuration and\nwe set up whatever process we want.\n\n363\n00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,961\nSo, the main features you'll see will be\nthings like revision logs, error logs.\n\n364\n00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:10,010\nYou can do bug reports and\nticketing systems in a lot of them.\n\n365\n00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,740\nJust check out GitHub or\nBitbucket, both of those sites.\n\n366\n00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,840\nThey've got full systems in place for\nbeing able to do bug reports and\n\n367\n00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,920\nhandling knowledge basis where you can\nset up where people can search for help.\n\n368\n00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,340\nAll of that kinda built-in.\n\n369\n00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,319\nThat's a great example of\na configuration management system.\n\n370\n00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,903\nAll right, now, you might start there and\nthen as you evolve,\n\n371\n00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:33,683\nyou build it out into a full SKMS,\npulling different pieces from different\n\n372\n00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:37,520\nsoftware vendors to build that\ntotal knowledge management system.\n\n373\n00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,110\nBut this is kinda the easy\npart to start with.\n\n374\n00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,950\nNow Ronnie,\nyou mentioned the DML was the other thing.\n\n375\n00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,810\nAnd a DML stands for\na definitive media library.\n\n376\n00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,830\nAnd in software development houses,\nthis is a must.\n\n377\n00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,490\nYou gotta have it.\n\n378\n00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,320\nBut even in non-software development\nhouses, like if you're just system admin,\n\n379\n00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,400\nyou're running a server farm,\nyou don't write your own software but\n\n380\n00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,810\nyou're running a server farm.\n\n381\n00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,740\nIt's still a good idea to have a DML,\nand what it is,\n\n382\n00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,490\nis any software you have,\nany licences you have,\n\n383\n00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,920\nany media, any content that you use,\nyou store in the DML.\n\n384\n00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,390\nAnd whenever somebody needs access to it,\nthey go to the DML to get it.\n\n385\n00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,920\nAnd that ensures that we're all\nworking with the same data.\n\n386\n00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,160\nIf you're developing an application,\nyou want everybody to be able\n\n387\n00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,710\nto see the current stable source code,\ncuz that's what your product is.\n\n388\n00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,410\nYour product is whatever the current\nstable code is that's been compiled and\n\n389\n00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,710\nreleased to the customer.\n\n390\n00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,160\nSo, all of your developers\nneed to be able to see that.\n\n391\n00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,940\nBut if I copy it down in my laptop and\nthen a new release gets approved and\n\n392\n00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,960\ngets out, and I don't update my laptop.\n\n393\n00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,010\nNow, I've got old code and\nI might be building software\n\n394\n00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,460\non an old code base that's not\ncompatible to my current release build.\n\n395\n00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,160\nSo, we need a way to guarantee everybody's\nlooking at the newest, latest and\n\n396\n00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,450\ngreatest information and it's commonly\naccepted amongst all the employees and\n\n397\n00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,630\nthat's what a DML does.\n\n398\n00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,880\nAnd again, GitHub, those guys,\nthat's what they do.\n\n399\n00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,091\nBut even internally, this can be something\nas simple as a shared folder on a server\n\n400\n00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:11,484\nsomewhere, that we store our source code,\nour licenses, on the system admin side,\n\n401\n00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,086\nthings like ISO images of CDs.\n\n402\n00:22:13,086 --> 00:22:16,670\nAnd I told Ronnie a story before\nthe show and I'll tell you guys.\n\n403\n00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,000\nI worked for several companies that\nwere Microsoft shops or Linux shops or\n\n404\n00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,760\nwhatever, and with Microsoft, it was\nalways tricky because there's more than\n\n405\n00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,950\none version of Windows Server 2012 R2\nenterprise standard edition or whatever.\n\n406\n00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,836\nSo, when they release a disk, some of them\nare OEM, original equipment manufacturers.\n\n407\n00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,458\nThose are the ones that Dell and\nHP use, and then,\n\n408\n00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,462\nthere's other ones that are retail.\n\n409\n00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,104\nThose are the ones that we\ngo to the store and buy,\n\n410\n00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,600\nif you can find a store\nthat sells software.\n\n411\n00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,360\nAnd then there's volume license copies,\n\n412\n00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,144\nVLE, which they use for\ntheir enterprise customers.\n\n413\n00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:55,538\nThen there's MSDN copies for people who\nare on the Microsoft Developer Network.\n\n414\n00:22:55,538 --> 00:22:58,781\nAnd then there's TechNet copies which\nare for admins that have purchased TechNet\n\n415\n00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:01,086\naccounts, which I think,\nhave they killed off TechNet?\n\n416\n00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:02,340\n>> Yeah.\n\n417\n00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,722\n>> TechNet still exists but\nnot the ISOs anymore, so\n\n418\n00:23:04,722 --> 00:23:06,490\nthey just killed that off last year.\n\n419\n00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,047\nBut what it meant was just\nbecause I had a disc that said,\n\n420\n00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:12,860\nWindows Server 2012 R2 Data Edition.\n\n421\n00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,200\nJust because it said that, and that's what\nI needed, didn't necessarily mean that\n\n422\n00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,360\nmy license was gonna work on it, or that I\nwas even allowed to run it on my server.\n\n423\n00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,820\nRunning on my server might be\na violation of my license,\n\n424\n00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,970\ndepending on which copy it was.\n\n425\n00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,400\nSo, we would have a DML,\na definitive media library,\n\n426\n00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,810\nwhere we put the ISOs that our\nemployees were allowed to use.\n\n427\n00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,422\nSo, if I needed Windows Server\n2012 R2 data center edition,\n\n428\n00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:43,280\nI went to the DML and I used the ISO from\nthere because I knew it was the right one.\n\n429\n00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,394\nAnd the license that was there,\n\n430\n00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:46,300\nI used that license because\nI knew it was the right one.\n\n431\n00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,170\nAnd there was no mix-ups.\n\n432\n00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,370\nNo mix-ups that happen when you\nget software from various places.\n\n433\n00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,251\nSo, that's really important.\n\n434\n00:23:54,251 --> 00:24:00,480\nThe DML is typically only gonna\ncontain the current version.\n\n435\n00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,014\nWe don't normally use it to store\nhistorical stuff cuz that creates\n\n436\n00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:08,044\nconfusion, you want Just the one, so\nif you store your source code in there,\n\n437\n00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,360\nit's just going to be the stable\ncurrent release, right?\n\n438\n00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,320\nNo previous releases, no developed forks,\nno branches, the current stable release.\n\n439\n00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680\nThis is what our customers have,\n\n440\n00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,140\nthese are the ISOs that we\nare using on our servers right now.\n\n441\n00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,510\nThis is what you can expect in\nour production environment.\n\n442\n00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,790\nThat is really what a DML is all about.\n\n443\n00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,570\nSo real important thing.\n\n444\n00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,630\nA lot of people don't set it up and\nyou end up in a mess.\n\n445\n00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,260\nAnd actually we're guilty of that right\nhere at IT Pro TV and all those different\n\n446\n00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,300\nMicrosoft type accounts that I just\nmentioned, I think we've got all of them.\n\n447\n00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,160\nDon't we?\n>> We do.\n\n448\n00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,660\n>> Maybe not.\n\n449\n00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,180\nDo we have any retail stuff?\n\n450\n00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,320\n>> Got a couple, yeah.\n\n451\n00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,900\n>> Oh we do.\nShoot.\n\n452\n00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,120\nThat's right.\nSo yeah,\n\n453\n00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,120\nI mean we've got all those right here and\nwe're a small company.\n\n454\n00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,190\nJust a handful of employees and\neven we have issues with that.\n\n455\n00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,850\nSo as your organization starts to grow,\nit becomes a bigger and bigger problem.\n\n456\n00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,770\nSo you will want that in place.\n\n457\n00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,880\nThat's a key part of\nconfiguration management.\n\n458\n00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,440\nAll right, so, that's basically\nwhat configuration management is.\n\n459\n00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,930\nThe hardest thing I find for most people,\nis knowing the difference between\n\n460\n00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,390\nconfiguration management and\nchange management.\n\n461\n00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,200\nRemember that not everything\ncan be configured, so\n\n462\n00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,260\nit is really just applying to\nconfiguration items, CIs, and\n\n463\n00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,600\nit is applying the things that don't\naffect our overall requirements.\n\n464\n00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,490\nIf something affects\nthe overall requirement,\n\n465\n00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,400\nthen we got to jump over to\nthe change management and\n\n466\n00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,450\nknock it out there or\nif it is something you cannot configure.\n\n467\n00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:28,550\nThe only thing you can do is change,\nit is what is left.\n\n468\n00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,980\nSo kind of separation\nbetween the two systems.\n\n469\n00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,280\nWell Ronnie that was quite a mouthful.\n\n470\n00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,180\nThe rest of the processes,\nwe got what four more processes I think.\n\n471\n00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,270\nSo the rest of the processes are a lot\nmore straight forward and simple.\n\n472\n00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,410\nWhy don't we do this.\n\n473\n00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,180\nWhy don't we stop and take a break.\n\n474\n00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,324\nAnd when we get back we'll dive through\nsome of the remainder of those processes.\n\n475\n00:25:50,324 --> 00:25:51,184\nStay tuned.\n\n476\n00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,229\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n477\n00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:58,148\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:00,069\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n479\n00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:01,370\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n480\n00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,760\nSo our next process group that were\ngoing to tackle is release and\n\n481\n00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,060\ndeployment management.\n\n482\n00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,795\nNow I know I talked a little bit about\nreleases in the last segment but\n\n483\n00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,265\nthis is more important.\n\n484\n00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,105\nBecause we're not just talking\nabout the release itself.\n\n485\n00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,915\nBut we're talking about\ndeployment management.\n\n486\n00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:18,445\nThis is where the work gets done.\n\n487\n00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:20,965\nSo we're talking about the actual\ndeployment occurring here.\n\n488\n00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:23,815\nThe real feet on the ground.\n\n489\n00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,375\nPeople putting in software.\n\n490\n00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,390\nYour customer potentially being effected.\n\n491\n00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,890\nThat is happening right here.\n\n492\n00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,120\n>> It is here during the release and\nthe deployment management that\n\n493\n00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,860\npeople are going to see the new logo\nthat comes up on their screen or\n\n494\n00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,320\nthey are going to see a new\nproduct when they walk in.\n\n495\n00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,720\nAnd they're actually experiencing that for\nthe time.\n\n496\n00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,622\nSo this is the most noticeable step in our\nservice transition that we're going to\n\n497\n00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:46,150\nbe doing.\n\n498\n00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,830\n>> Now one of the key lessons that ITIL\nwants to stress is that you might have\n\n499\n00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,910\none team that's actually\ndoing the development work.\n\n500\n00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,980\nAnd building up this software as\npart of the service design and\n\n501\n00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,240\nnow service transition.\n\n502\n00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,020\nAnd you might have a separate team\nthat actually does the deployment.\n\n503\n00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,170\nAnd that is not an uncommon thing.\n\n504\n00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,120\nI've worked in many environments\nthat were like that where we had\n\n505\n00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,030\ndevelopers that created software together\nand made these packages and then turned it\n\n506\n00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,460\nover to the sysadmins who were running\nthe servers to actually go and roll out.\n\n507\n00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,120\nAnd the key lesson that ITIL wants\nto train everyone on here is\n\n508\n00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,440\nthat whoever is doing the release and\ndeployment management should not trust for\n\n509\n00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,350\neven one second, that the the teams\ndoing the design did their work.\n\n510\n00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:39,410\nSo even though the design team has gone\nthrough the software design or whatever.\n\n511\n00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,900\nThe software has been coded and queued and\nchecked and it's reached this process.\n\n512\n00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,390\nWe're ready for deployment.\n\n513\n00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,000\nWhoever's on the deployment team is\nthe one actually responsible for\n\n514\n00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,550\nmaking the build.\n\n515\n00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,580\nAnd so just because the software\nwas compiled by the dev team,\n\n516\n00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,600\ndoesn't mean that it was\ncompiled without errors.\n\n517\n00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,960\nAnd we can assume that it was,\nand we can point fingers at them.\n\n518\n00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,510\nBut if you want to have a nice, stable\nenvironment, you find out for yourself.\n\n519\n00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,430\nAnd so as part of release and deployment\nmanagement, if you're doing the release\n\n520\n00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,230\nmanagement, you're actually building\nthat release version to then turn out.\n\n521\n00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,340\nAnd so the team that's responsible\nhere is going to ensure that yes,\n\n522\n00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,240\nthis compiles without errors.\n\n523\n00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,890\nWe do our own testing.\n\n524\n00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,820\nI know you guys have already tested it but\n\n525\n00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,440\nlet's just do more\ntesting here on our side.\n\n526\n00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,060\nIt is a second look.\n\n527\n00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,120\nYour company may choose to leave\nthis part out as part of the policy,\n\n528\n00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,460\nand that is fine, it is all framework.\n\n529\n00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,190\nBut if we want the most stability,\n\n530\n00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,330\nthis is a mission critical application,\nyou don't trust anybody.\n\n531\n00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,570\nYou do the build, you retest,\nand then you deploy.\n\n532\n00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,500\nSo releasing deploy management\nactually starts out\n\n533\n00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,560\nwith repeating some of the work\nthat was already done.\n\n534\n00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,980\nJust kind of re doing that and\nensuring that we have flawless deployment.\n\n535\n00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,685\nAll right now this is where,\nsome of the most visible work occurs.\n\n536\n00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:59,585\nA lot of what we talked about\nmight be happening one or\n\n537\n00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:04,255\ntwo developers on their laptops,\nend user never sees it but\n\n538\n00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:08,145\nwe start doing the deployment, this is\nwhere the end users get visibility.\n\n539\n00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:12,355\nThis is the most sensitive area\nof rolling out of service.\n\n540\n00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:16,485\nOnce the service is already in place,\nthen you might have issues,\n\n541\n00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:18,345\nlittle things you might have to fix and\nmove along,\n\n542\n00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:21,510\nbut the real danger zone is\nright here on deployment.\n\n543\n00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,770\n>> When we're actually now ready\nnow that we've got everything done,\n\n544\n00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,510\nthis is when we transition and\neverything is actually in production,\n\n545\n00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,030\nwe're now going to hand off towards\nthat service operation side.\n\n546\n00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,050\nSo now we'll actually see it in action.\n\n547\n00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,280\nAnd we'll still be there to monitor to\nmake sure everything goes right but\n\n548\n00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,050\nnow we're really handing off our things.\n\n549\n00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,750\nSo we're completing really the work\nof all the design that we've done.\n\n550\n00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,240\nMaking sure it's ready to go and\nthen transitioning it over.\n\n551\n00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,500\n>> ITIL breaks this up into four phases.\n\n552\n00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,320\nSo when we do release into planning\nmanagement we're actually getting ready to\n\n553\n00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,340\npush out that build or that relieves.\n\n554\n00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,850\nWe divide it into four phases, and\neach one is kind of responsible for\n\n555\n00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,330\na different part, and\n\n556\n00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,860\nthe interesting thing here is that there's\ncontrols at each leg along the journey.\n\n557\n00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,870\nThey give you several spots where\nyou can stop the release, right?\n\n558\n00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,550\nBefore it's too late, so\nthere's some kind of issue, we stop it,\n\n559\n00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,430\nwe're not past the point of no return.\n\n560\n00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,310\nBut, at some point there is always a point\nof no return where it's out there, and\n\n561\n00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,870\nthe customers are going\nto be involved in it.\n\n562\n00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:25,350\nSo, the first of those phases is what's\ncalled release and deployment planning.\n\n563\n00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,270\nWe got the service design package,\nthe SDP, and\n\n564\n00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,700\nit's got a lot of plan information in\nthere for how it should be deployed,\n\n565\n00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,770\nbut we need to come up with the actual\nway it's going be deployed,\n\n566\n00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,400\nbecause we might need to differ\nfrom that original plan.\n\n567\n00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,730\nThat original plan might not have taken\ninto consideration things like our back-up\n\n568\n00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,760\nWindows and other ideas.\n\n569\n00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,310\nSo we start the fact that is we\ncreate the actual deployment plan.\n\n570\n00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,760\nIt's normally just far more detailed.\n\n571\n00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,850\nThe step by step.\n\n572\n00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,680\nHere's the commands we run.\n\n573\n00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,640\nWhoever made the service design\npackage probably didn't know those and\n\n574\n00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,450\nyou kind of created a high level so\nwe get more focus.\n\n575\n00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,320\nNow when we create that new plan,\nif it deviates in anyway\n\n576\n00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,140\nfrom the plan of the SDP, it's a change,\nwe've got to get that change authorized.\n\n577\n00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,670\nSo, as we do our release and appointment\nplanning we will create a request for\n\n578\n00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,565\nchange in RFC that posts our plan.\n\n579\n00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:19,975\nHere's how we're going to deploy it,\nlet's get authorization.\n\n580\n00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:24,655\nIf we can't get authorization on our\naltered plan, then the deployment stops.\n\n581\n00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:25,945\nRight there we pull the plug.\n\n582\n00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:30,695\nEven though we've got a plan from the STP,\nwe don't like it.\n\n583\n00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:34,405\nWe've got a different way we want to go,\nhere's the change, either approve it or\n\n584\n00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:35,135\nit doesn't roll forward.\n\n585\n00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:38,435\nAnd then we've got to do negotiation and\ntry to figure out where to go from there.\n\n586\n00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:41,040\nSo there will be a change date.\n\n587\n00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,530\nNow if the plan doesn't deviate much\n\n588\n00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:49,910\nthen we're ready to move forward,\nand you still do a change ticket.\n\n589\n00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,230\nYou do a change ticket that says\nwe're going to create the release.\n\n590\n00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,850\nYou've defined that this is\ngoing to be a release and\n\n591\n00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,420\nyou're going to build it yourself.\n\n592\n00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,292\nSo you do a change that says\nhey we're about to create this.\n\n593\n00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,640\nNow that's not technically a change,\nright?\n\n594\n00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,580\nWe're not modifying it.\n\n595\n00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,542\nWe're just building it to get it deployed.\n\n596\n00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:11,050\nBut you still do a change ticket,\nbecause it serves as a gatekeeper.\n\n597\n00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,746\nAs a documented point to say,\nhere's the information that we're\n\n598\n00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:19,037\ngathering together to and create this\nrelease, is everybody in agreement?\n\n599\n00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,134\nSo it's one of the few times that\nwe use change management for\n\n600\n00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:26,205\nsomething that's not truly a change,\nit's really a pre authorized change but\n\n601\n00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:28,840\nwe still go through the official process.\n\n602\n00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n603\n00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,430\nThe next step is to do what we call\nof course the release build and\n\n604\n00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,510\nthe testing that we are going to do\nput in place to handle everything.\n\n605\n00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,720\nThis is where we have to go\nthrough another change ticket\n\n606\n00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,940\nto get authorized to now actually build\nthe release that we're going to be doing.\n\n607\n00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,370\nSo even though we now gotten authorized\nthat we're about to start and\n\n608\n00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,380\nwe're ready to create it, we now are\nactually having to get authorization to\n\n609\n00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,530\nbuild out whatever we're actually going to\npush out in our production environment.\n\n610\n00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:04,130\nSo that way we're ready then once\nwe get that to begin testing, and\n\n611\n00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,580\nthen once we're actually ready to\ntesting we're still going to get\n\n612\n00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,770\nanother authorization after that too.\n\n613\n00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,970\nSure that everything's correct.\n\n614\n00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,840\n>> Yeah, if it passes our test,\nwe deploy it.\n\n615\n00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,330\nAnd when you deploy it,\nwhatever it is that you're modifying,\n\n616\n00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:23,753\nit's either a new service that's going in,\nif it's a new release, or if it's\n\n617\n00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:28,500\na release that's adding functionality to\na an existing release, you're replacing.\n\n618\n00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,608\nSo you might have version 5.1 out right\nnow and right here we're deploying 5.2.\n\n619\n00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:39,810\nSo when that happens,\nwe have a baseline for our service.\n\n620\n00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,310\nAnd the baseline has now changed.\n\n621\n00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,500\nThe baseline now needs to include\nall the new functionality of 5.2 or\n\n622\n00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,832\nbug fixes or whatever.\n\n623\n00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:50,760\nSo we're going to need to do a new\nbaseline and we are going to need to\n\n624\n00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,160\nupdate the DML, the definitive medial\nlibrary to reflect this additional data.\n\n625\n00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,740\nWe will also need to update other things\nlike our service knowledge management\n\n626\n00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,040\nsystem, SKMS to reflect the new service\nchanges, any new steps or whatever.\n\n627\n00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,690\nSo there's a lot of updates that happen.\n\n628\n00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,300\nAnd so we need to get a change management\nauthorization for both of them.\n\n629\n00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,550\nSo, the CMA to actually build them and\ndeploy the release.\n\n630\n00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,130\nI say CMA,\nthat's change management authorization.\n\n631\n00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:21,448\nThe CMA for that, and then the CMA to\nupdate all the baselines and the releases.\n\n632\n00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:28,450\nNow, that CMA is not normally going to be\ndeclined because the release has happened.\n\n633\n00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,920\nOr it's basically a button\naway from happening.\n\n634\n00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,770\nSo it's just updating the documentation.\n\n635\n00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,699\nAnd the CMA in this case is really just\nmaking sure that the documentation\n\n636\n00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,110\nis complete.\n\n637\n00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,020\nHave you created all the documentation\nnecessary, and updated the DML?\n\n638\n00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,690\nAnd once we have those options done,\nnow the actual deployment occurs.\n\n639\n00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,380\nSo we've staged all of our stuff.\n\n640\n00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,870\nWe've got our change management\nauthorization, we've updated our DML,\n\n641\n00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,880\nwe've updated our other documentation,\nand we do the deployment.\n\n642\n00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,540\nNow you need change\nmanagement authorization for\n\n643\n00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,230\nthat final deployment to\nactually get it out there.\n\n644\n00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,610\nThis is the point of no return.\n\n645\n00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,440\nIf this gets declined the release doesn't\ngo out and we've gotta go back and\n\n646\n00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,720\nundo the changes to the DML and\nto our other documentation.\n\n647\n00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,896\nBut our customers don't see the DML, our\ncustomers don't see that documentation, so\n\n648\n00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:22,630\nit's kinda that last moment where you\nstill haven't affected the customer.\n\n649\n00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,382\nBut if the CMA is approved, or\nwe get the CMA, the deployment happens.\n\n650\n00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:30,550\nNow it's in the customer's hands and we\nturn it over to the operations department.\n\n651\n00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,990\nThis is where they jump in.\n\n652\n00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,660\n>> Once this is in operational hands\nwe're still not completely done.\n\n653\n00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,610\nAs the initial release is out there,\nin operations and\n\n654\n00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:45,360\nfull production, we're going to be seeing\nif what we've put out there in software\n\n655\n00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,460\nis hitting the targets that\nwe've actually set for\n\n656\n00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,470\nit, is performing the way that we want\nit to, with little or no problems.\n\n657\n00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,410\nBut, even if there are problems,\neven if doesn't produce that,\n\n658\n00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,630\nwe're also now going to actually learn\nfrom whatever release that we did and\n\n659\n00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,590\nwe're gonna actually end up putting\ntogether what we call lessons learned\n\n660\n00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,020\nthat way we can actually\ndo it better next time.\n\n661\n00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,100\n>> Yeah.\nYou know you always learn new things, and\n\n662\n00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,160\nthis is one of the nice\nthings about an SKMS is that\n\n663\n00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,190\nthey always say that a good leader\nlearns from their mistakes, but\n\n664\n00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:17,170\na better leader learns from\nother people's mistakes.\n\n665\n00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,810\nBut how can you learn from somebody else's\nmistakes if you don't know what they are?\n\n666\n00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,470\nSo it gives us that chance\nto pull that together.\n\n667\n00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,640\nIt's a really useful thing.\n\n668\n00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,020\n>> A lot of companies neglect to do that,\n\n669\n00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,800\nand I find it is really valuable, but\nthose are our four steps that we're going\n\n670\n00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,290\nto go through when the actual\ndeployment occurs.\n\n671\n00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,300\nSo release and deployment planning,\nwe create a plan,\n\n672\n00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,340\nrelease the build and test so\nwe actually build it up and\n\n673\n00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,470\ntest it and make sure that we're ready\nto go, then the actual deployment.\n\n674\n00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,770\nAnd then lastly, review and close.\n\n675\n00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,590\nThose are the four phases\nof the deployment cycle.\n\n676\n00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,690\nSo this one sounds\npretty straight forward,\n\n677\n00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,920\nit's one of the shorter processes,\nbut boy is that important.\n\n678\n00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,580\nI mean, that's some heavy stuff that's\ngoing on there, and it is that moment\n\n679\n00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,330\nwhere we can actually do damage to\nthe company if a mistake happens,\n\n680\n00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,030\nif something unforeseen comes up,\nand that's where our\n\n681\n00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,520\nrisk management comes into play as\nwe jump in to address all that.\n\n682\n00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,100\nAll right,\nthat leads us to our next process which\n\n683\n00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,090\nis a pretty straightforward one.\n\n684\n00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,160\nWe actually, let's see,\nwe just have oh, we have three left.\n\n685\n00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,870\nOkay.\nSo our next one which is kind of\n\n686\n00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,810\nan extension of what we just talked about.\n\n687\n00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,780\nThat fourth phase that we mentioned\nwas the review and close.\n\n688\n00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,090\nAll right,\nwell we actually have a process for\n\n689\n00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,490\nthat called service,\nvalidation, and testing.\n\n690\n00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,840\nAll right, service, validation, and\n\n691\n00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,260\ntesting just like the name\nimplies is where we go and\n\n692\n00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,830\nwe evaluate that service that is newly,\nwell either newly created or\n\n693\n00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:43,000\nnewly updated, either one, and we start\nto evaluate what's going on there.\n\n694\n00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,470\nIs it valid?\n\n695\n00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,100\nDoes it meet the requirements that\nthe company set out in the very beginning?\n\n696\n00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,770\nAnd is it aligned with\nthe company's strategy.\n\n697\n00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,860\nWe know that it should be.\n\n698\n00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,850\nWe had the SDP that showed all that stuff.\n\n699\n00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,320\nIt was all in the plan, all in the design.\n\n700\n00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,630\nBut now that it's actually out there,\nis it?\n\n701\n00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,440\nIs it in line?\n\n702\n00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,040\nAnd so this is another point to check.\n\n703\n00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,140\nIt doesn't matter how amazing\nyour planning was beforehand,\n\n704\n00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,540\nthere's always a chance that once it hits\ninto the wild that things go a little bit\n\n705\n00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,140\ndifferently than planned, and so we\njust need to get our real world picture,\n\n706\n00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,900\nwhat is it actually like\nwhen it's out there?\n\n707\n00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,990\n>> Yeah, a lot of times,\n\n708\n00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,570\nif we remember going back to another\nepisode where we began with service\n\n709\n00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,620\nstrategy, we talked about how the strategy\nreally influences everything that we do\n\n710\n00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,320\nfrom the design build to everything that\nwe're actually transitioning into that\n\n711\n00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,480\nanything that we're actually\ngonna push out into production.\n\n712\n00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,190\nAt the same time,\nonce everything is out in production\n\n713\n00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,480\nit will either validate that our\nentire strategy was correct or\n\n714\n00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,490\nit may invalidate it when we\nactually push out and go oh my gosh,\n\n715\n00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,390\nthis didn't even come close to\nwhat we had originally envisioned.\n\n716\n00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,430\nSo this is why it's very important that we\ncan take a look at all this information\n\n717\n00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,842\nagain and verify that everything that we\nsaid in the strategy going all the way\n\n718\n00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:04,760\nthough the design is now being pushed out\nthere is working or everything then work.\n\n719\n00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,320\nWhere did the break down began?\n\n720\n00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,741\n>> Unfortunately this is one\nof the easier one to pull off.\n\n721\n00:39:09,741 --> 00:39:11,210\nI know it sounds of difficult,\n\n722\n00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,630\nbut back in service design we\ntalked about two concepts.\n\n723\n00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,390\nWe talked about utility and warranty.\n\n724\n00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:22,712\nJust to recap those, utility was\nwhether the device or service or\n\n725\n00:39:22,712 --> 00:39:27,900\nwhatever it is that we've\ncreated is fit for purpose.\n\n726\n00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,940\nDoes it actually do what\nthe customer is expecting it to do?\n\n727\n00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,350\nSo is it fit for\nthe purpose it was originally intended?\n\n728\n00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,630\nThat's utility.\n\n729\n00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,420\nAnd then warranty is fit for use.\n\n730\n00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,230\nSure it might be able to do\nwhat they wanted one time,\n\n731\n00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,200\nbut will it repeatedly and consistently\nperform the activity they asked for\n\n732\n00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,260\nto a level that's generally acceptable.\n\n733\n00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,170\nWhen you buy a new computer, you don't\nexpect it to just work for one day,\n\n734\n00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,970\nyou expect it to work for years.\n\n735\n00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,740\nBut how many years do you\nexpect it to run for?\n\n736\n00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,900\nThere does comes a point where you have\nto just expect your computer to fail.\n\n737\n00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,833\nSo that's warranty right?\n\n738\n00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:06,211\nSo back in service design, we said as\nfar as our service was going to go,\n\n739\n00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:09,630\nwhat is the utility and\nwhat is the warranty?\n\n740\n00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,000\nWe define metrics to be\nable to measure that.\n\n741\n00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,932\nSo when we get to\nthe service validation and\n\n742\n00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:19,435\ntesting process here in\nthis service transition,\n\n743\n00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:24,566\nall we have to do is go to our SDP and\nfind where we define utility warranty and\n\n744\n00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:29,170\nwhat metrics we define and\nnow we just go and measure those.\n\n745\n00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,320\nWe go and\ncollect that from what's actually in use.\n\n746\n00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,080\nNow that it's in production\nwe can get a true known for\n\n747\n00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,270\na fact series of data, based on the actual\ndeployed product versus back in design,\n\n748\n00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,750\nwhere your saying, this is what it should\nbe like when it's out there in production.\n\n749\n00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,500\nWhat's it actually like?\n\n750\n00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,070\nNow we'll know, cuz it's out there and\nthose metrics that we're monitoring,\n\n751\n00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:55,510\nwe usually call those, it's a KPI or\nkey performance indicator.\n\n752\n00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,980\nYou will see some people say\nkey performance index but\n\n753\n00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,920\nin ITIL land it's key\nperformance indicator and\n\n754\n00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,180\nit's just the measurement,\nthings get measured different ways.\n\n755\n00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,160\nIt might be something very,\nvery tangible like\n\n756\n00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,700\nour web servers should be able to\nhandle 1,000 simultaneous customers.\n\n757\n00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,030\nHave we hit a thousand customers?\n\n758\n00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,520\nDid it stay online?\n\n759\n00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,510\nDid it work fine?\n\n760\n00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,500\nVery easy to measure that one but\nwhat if one of our requirements was\n\n761\n00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,000\nthe users must find\nthe website easy to navigate?\n\n762\n00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,360\nIn our testing, maybe we brought in\na focus group, and we had them try it out.\n\n763\n00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,860\nSo we brought in 30 people and we say,\nlet's browse through this website,\n\n764\n00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,840\nand I want you to sign up for\nan insurance policy.\n\n765\n00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,430\nSo go through this and\nsign up for an insurance policy.\n\n766\n00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,780\nThen we do a survey, we create a result,\nand we say that on a scale of 1 to 10,\n\n767\n00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,390\nif they rate a 7 or higher,\nthen they've found it easy to navigate.\n\n768\n00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,150\nSo we average the 30 people and\nwe come up with that.\n\n769\n00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,800\nThat was just 30 people.\n\n770\n00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,010\nWhat about our real customers?\n\n771\n00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,630\nNow we roll it into production, and after\nthey sign up for that insurance policy,\n\n772\n00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,420\nwe ask them,\nwould you mind taking the survey?\n\n773\n00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,450\nWe let them take the survey.\n\n774\n00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,050\nNow we get those results back and\n\n775\n00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:06,920\nwe see while the focus group gave\nus all an average of 8, which means\n\n776\n00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,140\nthey found it easy to navigate,\nour real life people were giving us a 6.5.\n\n777\n00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,420\nThat's actually a little\nbit below that threshold,\n\n778\n00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,390\nnot too far off but a little bit, where\nour site might not as easy as we thought.\n\n779\n00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,580\nNow we need to make a determination, and\n\n780\n00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,690\nthe determination is simply,\ndo we roll back, do we undo this release,\n\n781\n00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,980\nwhich if it is a whole new website,\nmight not be an option.\n\n782\n00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,690\nOr do we roll forward and\nsay, let's plan for\n\n783\n00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,040\nthe next release and let's retool this,\nlet's improve it more, let's try and\n\n784\n00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,070\nmake it better because it might be\nthat your old website was even worse.\n\n785\n00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,280\nMaybe your old website got a 4, and\nnow you get a 6.5 which is better but\n\n786\n00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,310\nit's still not the 7 that we wanted, and\nso we start planning for the next release.\n\n787\n00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:47,850\nThat's what's kind of going to\ncome out of this but the point is,\n\n788\n00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,750\nwe're not having\nthe reinvent the wheel here.\n\n789\n00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,600\nThe metrics that we need to measure, the\nKPIs, they're already defined in the SPP.\n\n790\n00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,820\nWe just need to go and\ngather the data and get it.\n\n791\n00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,380\n>> A lot of times the validation testing,\n\n792\n00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,260\nof course, doesn't happen with\njust people that we know.\n\n793\n00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,640\nWe wanna make sure that there's people\nthat's not involved in the design.\n\n794\n00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,140\nThey don't have any real internal\nknowledge of what's going on there so\n\n795\n00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,840\nthat we get a real world feel for\nhow our things are actually gonna work.\n\n796\n00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,659\n>> Yeah, the way ITIL specifies it\nis it should be somebody who wasn't\n\n797\n00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:18,280\ninvolved in STP.\n\n798\n00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,610\nSo, the service design package, anybody\nwho was involved in the creation of that\n\n799\n00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,720\nshould not be the one doing\nthe validation and testing.\n\n800\n00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,600\nSo, if you use your customers,\nif you do a survey of your\n\n801\n00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,730\ncustomers to gather the data, it's\nactually your customers doing the testing.\n\n802\n00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,670\nNow, a lot of companies don't like that.\n\n803\n00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,350\nHere at ITProTV, we love it.\n\n804\n00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,910\nWe like to hear from the customers.\n\n805\n00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,340\nThat who tells us when we're doing things\nright or when we're doing things wrong, so\n\n806\n00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,790\nwe like that but\nother companies don't like that.\n\n807\n00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,540\nThey don't want their customer to\nhave to be bothered with that.\n\n808\n00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,700\nLook at Apple.\n\n809\n00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,920\nApple, [LAUGH] this is\ngonna sound really bad.\n\n810\n00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,990\nApple doesn't care what\ntheir customer wants and\n\n811\n00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,010\nthey don't wanna hear about it either and\nif you try and\n\n812\n00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,150\ntell Apple what you think is right,\nthey're not going to listen to you.\n\n813\n00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,850\nThat's the kind of company they are.\n\n814\n00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,940\nInstead, they wanna create\ntheir own solutions,\n\n815\n00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,760\nand so what they'll do is they won't bring\nin their customer into the decision.\n\n816\n00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,550\nThey'll just bring in an outside party.\n\n817\n00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,140\nSo, they'll bring in an auditor or they\nactually have a separate division inside\n\n818\n00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,220\nthe company that\nspecifically does this and\n\n819\n00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,350\nis able to do the evaluations internally.\n\n820\n00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,240\nSo different companies have\ndifferent perspectives on that and\n\n821\n00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,930\nyou get different results.\n\n822\n00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,787\nWhen I say it that way, Apple doesn't care\nwhat the customer thinks, it's absolutely\n\n823\n00:44:28,787 --> 00:44:33,980\n100% true but people still love them\nversus other companies out there.\n\n824\n00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,240\nWho is a great example?\n\n825\n00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,140\nGoogle.\n\n826\n00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,210\nGoogle doesn't care about\ntheir customer either and\n\n827\n00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,000\npeople kinda hate them for that.\n\n828\n00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,990\nIt's a very negative approach.\n\n829\n00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:48,450\nSo it does come off differently but\nyou can involve your customer.\n\n830\n00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,590\nThat can be your outsider or\nit can be a professional group.\n\n831\n00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,030\nSo Ronnie, that's the deployment and then\nwe talk about the validation and testing.\n\n832\n00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,870\nLet's stop and take a break.\n\n833\n00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,940\nWe've got two more processes\nI wanna talk about.\n\n834\n00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,320\nThe processes that we've talked about so\n\n835\n00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,530\nfar, those are the ones that\nare gonna be on the exam.\n\n836\n00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,400\nThose are the ones that we need to\nknow about but in real life land,\n\n837\n00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,890\nthere's two more processes\nthat I wanna tackle and\n\n838\n00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,820\nthat's change evaluation and\nknowledge management.\n\n839\n00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,680\nThe reason they are not on the test\nis they are pretty common sense but\n\n840\n00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,440\nwe still need to see them.\n\n841\n00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,490\nLet's stop and take a break and\n\n842\n00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,800\nwhen we get back,\nwe'll see those final two processes.\n\n843\n00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,995\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n844\n00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:33,898\n[NOISE] Welcome back, everybody.\n\n845\n00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:38,315\nSo we're ready to jump into the final\ntwo processes of service transition.\n\n846\n00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:42,424\nWe've covered a lot of important stuff so\nfar but the last couple ones are pretty\n\n847\n00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:45,550\ncommon sense but\nthey're things that need to get done.\n\n848\n00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,770\nYou're probably already doing them but\nlet's go ahead and\n\n849\n00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,120\nhit on them to make sure we understand\nthem and what's kind of expected by ITIL.\n\n850\n00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,333\nSo the first we're going to tackle\nis service validation and testing.\n\n851\n00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,942\n>> And change evaluation.\n\n852\n00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:02,520\n>> Let's

first few segments and\nreally the previous episode too,\n\n872\n00:46:56,293 --> 00:46:59,025\nwe've kind of driven through\nservice transmission and\n\n873\n00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,236\nthe bulk of the material that people\nneed to know to implement it.\n\n874\n00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:06,220\nBut there's a few extra processes right\nhere at the end that I want to cover,\n\n875\n00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,332\neven though they're not on the exam\nbecause they're common sense things that\n\n876\n00:47:10,332 --> 00:47:11,232\nneed to happen.\n\n877\n00:47:11,232 --> 00:47:14,680\nProbably they're already\nhappening in your organization but\n\n878\n00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,390\nby putting them on paper, that's the way\nthat we say, that needs to get done.\n\n879\n00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,490\nSo, let's go ahead and cover these just to\nmake sure we've got our firm grasp on it,\n\n880\n00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,290\nand the first process that we're\ngonna hit is change evaluation.\n\n881\n00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,660\nNow we've talked about this,\nwhen you implement a change you've got to\n\n882\n00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,560\nverify that things went the way\nthat we're supposed to and\n\n883\n00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,030\nthat's what change\nevaluation is all about.\n\n884\n00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,895\nAll the deployment stuff we talked about\njust a moment ago, that was a change.\n\n885\n00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:41,980\nIt's a pretty big change\nwhen you do a deployment but\n\n886\n00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,290\nyou might not be doing\na full service deployment.\n\n887\n00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,860\nYou might be doing a minor change.\n\n888\n00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,850\nThis goes with change management and\n\n889\n00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:52,090\ndoesn't actually get the full service\ntransition processes applied to it.\n\n890\n00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,930\nSo in any event, whichever way you\npass through change management,\n\n891\n00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,840\nonce that change goes in,\nwe need to validate.\n\n892\n00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,154\nWe need to make sure that it actually\noccurred the way that we planned and\n\n893\n00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:04,208\nthat's where change evaluation comes in.\n\n894\n00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,612\nA lot of times,\nthe changes that we implement,\n\n895\n00:48:06,612 --> 00:48:10,758\neven though we know that here's the change\nthat's coming on, and we believe that\n\n896\n00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:14,844\nhere's what the outcome's going to be- We\nmight find out that the change that we\n\n897\n00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:18,631\nactually just implemented either gives\nus more of a change than we needed or\n\n898\n00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:22,920\nless of a change, so the change evaluation\nallows us to be able to measure.\n\n899\n00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,890\nDid this do exactly what needed,\nor does it give us too much or\n\n900\n00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,080\ndoes it not give us\nenough of what we needed?\n\n901\n00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,950\nSo we have to be able to evaluate so\nwe can either adjust or do something else.\n\n902\n00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,100\n>> Now hopefully, we make our change,\n\n903\n00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,820\neverything goes as planned we get\nthe exact outcome that we anticipated.\n\n904\n00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,260\nAnd that's it,\nthat's the end of the change.\n\n905\n00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,620\nWe documented, updated our baselines and\nit's over, right?\n\n906\n00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,380\nBut there are a few other\nscenarios that might come out.\n\n907\n00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,830\nWhen you make that change, things might\nnot go exactly the way you wanted.\n\n908\n00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,410\nAnd don't always think of it as negative\nbecause sometimes there's good things that\n\n909\n00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,470\ncan come out of unforeseen events.\n\n910\n00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,190\nSo the first thing we need to\ndo is when we do this evaluation\n\n911\n00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,050\nwe're going to be looking for\n\n912\n00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:04,590\nany instance where the change didn't quite\nmatch up with exactly what we planned.\n\n913\n00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,670\nAnd then we can make a decision\non what to do about it.\n\n914\n00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:13,470\nSo that decision is our rollback\nslash remediation decision and\n\n915\n00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,610\nwe talked about that in the first\npart of service transition.\n\n916\n00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:20,550\nYou have to decide, is what's\ngoing on bad enough that I need to\n\n917\n00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,100\nroll back the change and just go\nback to the way that we were before?\n\n918\n00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,890\nOr do I go ahead and\nleave it in there and we re-mediate?\n\n919\n00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:30,250\nWe try and fix it, we try and\ncorrect our mistake.\n\n920\n00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,280\nNow that is going to be a judgement\ncall based on a number of criteria and\n\n921\n00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,440\nit's going to depend on your organization.\n\n922\n00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,340\nIf the change caused\na cascading failure and\n\n923\n00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,800\nyour customers are no longer able to use\nthe service that they're paying for,\n\n924\n00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,010\nyou might to choose to roll back\nimmediately so that your customers\n\n925\n00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,770\nare able to resume doing business with\nyou and to preserve your public image.\n\n926\n00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,710\nBut if it's created a failure and\nit's kind of a minor failure,\n\n927\n00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,220\nsure one piece of your service is not\nworking right, but the rest of it is and\n\n928\n00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,710\nthe users are minorly inconvenienced.\n\n929\n00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:06,290\nYou might choose to go ahead and leave\nthe change in and find a way to fix it.\n\n930\n00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:09,420\nCome up with an emergency change\nto be able to push through and\n\n931\n00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,650\nget it corrected in going forward.\n\n932\n00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,280\nThat way you don’t waste the work\nthat you did because it's work\n\n933\n00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,430\nto push that change in place and\ngo through all the procedures.\n\n934\n00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,060\nWe don't want to repeat that\nagain if we don’t have to right?\n\n935\n00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,730\nBut sometimes it's the right decision to\nsay you know what we're just going to back\n\n936\n00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,370\nup and we'll go ahead and\nrepeat that work.\n\n937\n00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,100\nIt’s worth it to give our\ncustomers a better experience so\n\n938\n00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,730\nthat's a rollback slash remediation\ndecision that we have to make.\n\n939\n00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:36,210\n>> Sometimes changes that we added\nin really don't go far enough.\n\n940\n00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:41,123\nAnd when they don't we map that discover\nanother solution that will provide for\n\n941\n00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:42,367\nus that kind of gap,\n\n942\n00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:48,060\nthat measure we that need to make sure we\ndo fulfill the service that we promised.\n\n943\n00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,190\n>> Yeah, and I gave a great example\nof that in the last segment,\n\n944\n00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,110\ntalking about ease of\nnavigation of the website.\n\n945\n00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,920\nMaybe our current website scores\na 4 on customer evaluations and\n\n946\n00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,900\nwe're trying to get to a 7.\n\n947\n00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,790\nWe push the new version out,\nand now we get a 6.5.\n\n948\n00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,470\nIt's not that we need to roll it back,\nit's better than what we had, but\n\n949\n00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,260\nstill not exactly where we want it.\n\n950\n00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,430\nWe were shooting for that seven and\n\n951\n00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,690\nwe didn't make it so\nadditional change is necessary.\n\n952\n00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,480\nWe're gonna have to start coming up\nwith the next solution that kinda\n\n953\n00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,670\nbuilds upon this.\n\n954\n00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,460\nOr maybe you were trying plan A out and\nthere was a plan B so\n\n955\n00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,100\nwe do have to roll plan\nA back to go onto plan B.\n\n956\n00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,880\nBut typically it's just finding\nthat next enhancement to make it\n\n957\n00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,250\nactually give us the results that we want.\n\n958\n00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,170\nAnd then the last thing is we've\nalways got to evaluate our changes\n\n959\n00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,760\nbecause you never know when\nsomething unforeseen might happen.\n\n960\n00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,600\nAnd those unforeseen things they could\nbe symptoms, you start seeing problems.\n\n961\n00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,350\nSo we rolled out this change and it seems\nto be working the way that we want it, but\n\n962\n00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,640\nall of sudden we're starting to get some\nsupport tickets from customers saying,\n\n963\n00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,630\nhey, I didn't get a receipt for\nmy purchase, what happened?\n\n964\n00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,540\nWell, those symptoms are how\nwe start to say well\n\n965\n00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,680\nthis is something we just changed.\n\n966\n00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,360\nIs their something in our change that\ncould have affected our receipt?\n\n967\n00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,110\nOur invoice system, right?\n\n968\n00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,260\nAnd then you start troubleshooting and\nisolating and so on.\n\n969\n00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,890\nBut you've gotta keep an eye out for\nthose symptoms.\n\n970\n00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:08,520\nSo typically when we deploy a change\nwe start watching our support ticketing\n\n971\n00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,200\nsystem for the next few days just to\nsee if any related incidents pop up.\n\n972\n00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,840\nBut there may be benefits,\nunforeseen benefits that happen.\n\n973\n00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,840\nMaybe you were rolling out this\nease of navigation project.\n\n974\n00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,640\nSo you're rolling out this new\niteration of your website and\n\n975\n00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,920\nyou find out after it's deployed that\nyour servers start using less CPU.\n\n976\n00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,560\nMaybe your new navigation menus just\ncreate less of a burden on the servers.\n\n977\n00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,570\nSo, now your servers have\nmore resources available.\n\n978\n00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:35,830\nIt was unforeseen.\n\n979\n00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:36,640\nWe didn't plan for that.\n\n980\n00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,730\nWe're like, well, we were just\nshooting for better navigation.\n\n981\n00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,170\nWe didn't think it would\nmake our servers run faster.\n\n982\n00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:45,700\nBut now that your service can run faster,\nyou will need to do another change because\n\n983\n00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,390\nyour documentation more than likely\nstates, here is the amount of load my\n\n984\n00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,620\nservers can handle with this new UI, maybe\nyour servers can handle a greater load.\n\n985\n00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,550\nYou might have an auto scale environment\nwhere the server gets busy and\n\n986\n00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,860\nstarts to spawn more servers.\n\n987\n00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,975\nNow that we have less load on the server\nwe might need to tweak those number and\n\n988\n00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:05,820\nmake adjustments to take\nadvantage of the new resources.\n\n989\n00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,010\nWe could ignore it, you could just ignore\nit and say well we got a benefit and\n\n990\n00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:14,030\ngreat whatever, but if you do that you're\nnot taking advantage of that benefit.\n\n991\n00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,980\nSo the follow up change is to do\nwhat's called exploiting the risk.\n\n992\n00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,418\nYou don't normally exploit a risk.\n\n993\n00:53:19,418 --> 00:53:22,510\nRisks are normally bad,\nyou wanna get away from them, but\n\n994\n00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,950\nthe outcome of a risk can\nsometimes be a good thing and\n\n995\n00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:28,650\nwhen it's a good thing we want to exploit\nit we want to make it as good as possible.\n\n996\n00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,430\nOh we just made that a little\nbetter by changing our navigation?\n\n997\n00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,580\nWhat else could we change on\nthe site to make it even better?\n\n998\n00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,880\nLet's make this risk even bigger.\n\n999\n00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,400\nAnd that's a great thing when it happens,\nit’s not a common thing unfortunately but\n\n1000\n00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,560\nit is a great thing when it does happen\nand that's all a part of our evaluation.\n\n1001\n00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,090\nWe find that as we gather\ninformation on our change.\n\n1002\n00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:53,260\n>> Our next little process in the change\nevaluation is to do something\n\n1003\n00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,155\na little bit more unusual, that,\nI don't want to say unusual,\n\n1004\n00:53:56,155 --> 00:54:00,300\nit's something that sounds natural to, but\nit's hard for me to actually think about.\n\n1005\n00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,670\nWhen we start doing the idea of change\nwe want everything to be planned out,\n\n1006\n00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,100\nI know that sounds weird, that we want to\nmake sure that we can do it, we check that\n\n1007\n00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,790\nit's actually working and then finally\nwe implement everything that we can.\n\n1008\n00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,880\nSo what was this process called?\n\n1009\n00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,820\n>> ITEL calls this the PDCA model and\nit's just how you implement everything.\n\n1010\n00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,360\nPlan, do, check, act.\n\n1011\n00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,970\nEvery time you do something\nin your environment,\n\n1012\n00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,630\nevery time you handle a change, you plan,\n\n1013\n00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,500\nmake sure you understand\nwhat you are doing.\n\n1014\n00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,860\nYou do, you make the change.\n\n1015\n00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,047\nCheck, you verify\nthe change went as planned.\n\n1016\n00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:35,847\nAnd then you act, and your act,\n\n1017\n00:54:35,847 --> 00:54:40,053\nthat action is either going to be\ncorrected if the change didn't work out,\n\n1018\n00:54:40,053 --> 00:54:43,823\nor it's just going to be a fading\ndocumentation if it did work out.\n\n1019\n00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:46,871\nPlan, do, check, act.\n\n1020\n00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:48,755\nThose are the four steps.\n\n1021\n00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:52,815\nThat's something that needs to be\ningrained in your operations team.\n\n1022\n00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:56,865\nEverybody in the operations team needs to\nunderstand those steps because sometimes\n\n1023\n00:54:56,865 --> 00:55:00,795\nthey'll just jump right into a do\ncheck and they skip that plan and\n\n1024\n00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:02,185\nthey skip that act part.\n\n1025\n00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:05,980\nYou know, they just kind of do things and\njust start putting it in and\n\n1026\n00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,140\nyou see this with people troubleshooting.\n\n1027\n00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,290\nSo there's a problem.\n\n1028\n00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,390\nSo they go in and\nthey make five changes to try and fix it.\n\n1029\n00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,620\nAnd they fix it.\n\n1030\n00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,600\nGreat, Which of the five changes fixed it?\n\n1031\n00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,772\nWe don't know because they\ndidn't go through and\n\n1032\n00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,190\nthey didn't make one change, and check.\n\n1033\n00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,000\nThey made five changes and checked, and so\n\n1034\n00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,950\nnow we don't know which one was the one\nthat actually solved the problem.\n\n1035\n00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,790\nSo we gotta be really careful with that,\nand it's plan, do, check, act.\n\n1036\n00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,680\nIt's right in the ITIL guides.\n\n1037\n00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,670\nThat's their recommended amount.\n\n1038\n00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,610\nAll right, so with change evaluation.\n\n1039\n00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:37,650\nI doubt we taught anything\nnew right there, right?\n\n1040\n00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,220\nIt's pretty common sense,\n\n1041\n00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,800\nbut it's documented anyway because that\nmeans it can be part of our policy.\n\n1042\n00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,660\nAnd as you on board employees,\nif it isn't common to somebody,\n\n1043\n00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,250\nif you've just hired somebody\nright out of college,\n\n1044\n00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,020\nthey might not have that experience yet,\nthey might not know.\n\n1045\n00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,540\nIf they're coming from a small company,\nwhere they can just jump in and\n\n1046\n00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:56,610\nmake changes well,\nthey need to know that in your company,\n\n1047\n00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:00,320\nin this larger organization,\nthat's not safe and will not be tolerated.\n\n1048\n00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,870\nIt's right here in our policy,\nthis is what we do.\n\n1049\n00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,250\nDo not deviate from this at all.\n\n1050\n00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:10,530\nOur last process goes right in line with\nthat, which is knowledge management.\n\n1051\n00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:15,030\nKnowledge management is how we process\nall of the information that we get.\n\n1052\n00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,090\nAnd what it really centers around is,\nstoring that information.\n\n1053\n00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:22,160\nWe keep talking about changes,\nand request for change.\n\n1054\n00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,030\nThose tickets that we fill out.\n\n1055\n00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,610\nWhat do we do when those tickets,\nwhen the change is done?\n\n1056\n00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,670\nDo we throw it away?\n\n1057\n00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:27,820\nNo, we keep those.\n\n1058\n00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,170\nYou keep the change ticket, so\nyou can see what happened in the past.\n\n1059\n00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,880\nAnd you can use that for\nall sorts of things in the future.\n\n1060\n00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,150\nYou can use it to avoid mistakes\non other activities, or\n\n1061\n00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,530\nother service roll outs\nbefore they happen.\n\n1062\n00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,480\nIf a problem occurs,\n\n1063\n00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,070\nyou can use the change tickets to be\nable to trouble shoot it, and find it.\n\n1064\n00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,270\nBut not just the change ticket.\n\n1065\n00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,470\nThe SDP, our service design package,\nand all of that.\n\n1066\n00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,980\nAny other metric data\nthat we've collected.\n\n1067\n00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,150\nAll of this information,\nthey needs to go somewhere.\n\n1068\n00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,415\nAnd that's what the knowledge\nmanagement process is all about.\n\n1069\n00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:58,260\n>> Yeah.\nWhen a small company.\n\n1070\n00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,330\nYou may just put everything\ninto a single folder.\n\n1071\n00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,787\n[INAUDIBLE] When there's a problem,\n\n1072\n00:57:01,787 --> 00:57:04,720\nlet's just look in that folder\nto find all the information.\n\n1073\n00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,520\nBut as your company, and\nyour organization grows, very easy for\n\n1074\n00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,200\na piece of data to become missing.\n\n1075\n00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,160\nDon, I can't tell you how many times I've\njust wrote something down on a corner of\n\n1076\n00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,416\na piece of paper, and\nthen I stack all those papers up.\n\n1077\n00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:19,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I go, I know I wrote it down.\n\n1078\n00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,030\nBut as your company grows bigger,\nand more, and\n\n1079\n00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,990\nmore people start making changes,\nand start doing thing.\n\n1080\n00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:29,780\nIt becomes much more essential, that\nwe can keep it somewhere that we could\n\n1081\n00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,150\naccess the information easily, and\nthat the information really helps us.\n\n1082\n00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:37,485\nSo that, we're not having to reinvent the\nwheel every time a new change comes along.\n\n1083\n00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:38,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n1084\n00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,590\nNow, hopefully we have an SKMS.\n\n1085\n00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,340\nThat service knowledge management system,\nand that's where we put our data.\n\n1086\n00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,980\nSo that, anybody can go in, and search the\ndata, and find the information they want.\n\n1087\n00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,410\nAnd so,\nit facilitates good decision making.\n\n1088\n00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:52,720\nWhen you need to make a decision,\nyou've got hard data.\n\n1089\n00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,470\nYou can go on reference.\n\n1090\n00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,610\nYou're not just trying to guess,\nor estimate, or whatever.\n\n1091\n00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,940\nYou've got actual hard data,\nyou can go and get.\n\n1092\n00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,810\nSo, we need to have that.\n\n1093\n00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:05,150\nNow, the problem is when we collect this\ndata it's not always useable in it's\n\n1094\n00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,572\noriginal form.\n\n1095\n00:58:06,572 --> 00:58:10,965\nSo ITIL, basically specify four\ndifferent forms the data can be in.\n\n1096\n00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:14,409\nAnd there is data itself,\nthere's information,\n\n1097\n00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:18,140\nthere's knowledge, and there's wisdom.\n\n1098\n00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,490\nNow, to a lot of people\nthose sound the same.\n\n1099\n00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:22,000\nData, information, knowledge, wisdom.\n\n1100\n00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,010\nIt’s like four words that\nall mean the same thing.\n\n1101\n00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,650\nBut it is actually different state,\nthat your information is in.\n\n1102\n00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:33,230\nThat first state, it is just data, that\nis the raw data, what we've collected.\n\n1103\n00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,050\nSo, we mentioned our matrix,\nor utility, and warranty.\n\n1104\n00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,870\nWe collect that raw data,\nthat is the survey data from our users,\n\n1105\n00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,890\nhow happy were they with\nthe navigation experience.\n\n1106\n00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:46,990\nWe get that raw information back,\nand that's all it is, just raw.\n\n1107\n00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:50,620\nIt's there, and it's up to us to\nfigure out what to do with it.\n\n1108\n00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,175\nThe data's not necessarily\nusable in its current format.\n\n1109\n00:58:53,175 --> 00:58:55,373\nNow, when we're dealing with data,\n\n1110\n00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:58,685\nthe only concern that we\nreally have is accuracy.\n\n1111\n00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:02,375\nMaking sure that data truly reflects,\nwhatever its supposed to reflect.\n\n1112\n00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:05,915\nBecause if its a flaw in the data,\nwhenever we work with it,\n\n1113\n00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:08,185\nour decisions will be flawed.\n\n1114\n00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:12,515\nSo, this is raw data only processed for\n\n1115\n00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:13,146\naccuracy\n>> Yep.\n\n1116\n00:59:13,146 --> 00:59:15,255\nThe next step is information.\n\n1117\n00:59:16,285 --> 00:59:19,050\nThink about information\nas taking that raw data.\n\n1118\n00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:22,620\nAnd put it into the context\nof what we need it to be in.\n\n1119\n00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,460\nThe reason why we need the context\nis because not all that data\n\n1120\n00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,750\napplies to every single situation.\n\n1121\n00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,630\nSo that way, if we're taking a look at it,\nand trying to figure out what we're\n\n1122\n00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:34,380\nsupposed to do next on some type of\nprocess that we're having to correct.\n\n1123\n00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,060\nIt helps us to have that context that we\nneed, so that we make the proper decision.\n\n1124\n00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,630\nAnd go wait a minute, even though\nthat looks like it applies to me.\n\n1125\n00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,100\nIt doesn't really apply in this situation.\n\n1126\n00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,247\nAnd that way I don't actually consider it.\n\n1127\n00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:47,903\nAnd then I don't make wrong\ndecision based off of that either.\n\n1128\n00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:50,386\n>> And what it really boils down to,\n\n1129\n00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:54,743\nis the raw data is usually too\nmuch data for us to deal with.\n\n1130\n00:59:54,743 --> 00:59:57,746\nIt's got a lot of stuff in there that\ndoesn't apply to the decision that we\n\n1131\n00:59:57,746 --> 00:59:58,980\nare trying to make.\n\n1132\n00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,095\nSo, when we convert that\ndata into information,\n\n1133\n01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:06,110\nwhere we're parsing it down to\njust the pieces that we need.\n\n1134\n01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,060\nAnd that can be a very complex process,\nthat we do.\n\n1135\n01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,860\nAs we convert it into information.\n\n1136\n01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,640\nWe apply a structure,\nwe aggregate data from different sources,\n\n1137\n01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,950\nwe do all that crazy stuff.\n\n1138\n01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,040\nOr it can be very simple.\n\n1139\n01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,410\nLet's use my navigation example.\n\n1140\n01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:23,785\nWe set a metric that said we wanna\nscore an average evaluation number of\n\n1141\n01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:28,480\nseven on a scale of one to ten, from our\nusers if they were happy with navigation.\n\n1142\n01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,280\nWell, the data are the raw surveys.\n\n1143\n01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,850\nSo let's say, I get 5,000 surveys back.\n\n1144\n01:00:33,850 --> 01:00:38,100\nWell, if I take all 5,000 of them,\nhow useful is that information to me?\n\n1145\n01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,620\nIt's not terribly useful.\n\n1146\n01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,680\nBut if I average their\nnavigation rating together.\n\n1147\n01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,450\nI average all those numbers,\nnow I can get one number, the average.\n\n1148\n01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,420\nThat's what I really wanted.\n\n1149\n01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,570\nNow, I just took data, and\nconverted it into information.\n\n1150\n01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:56,470\nMy metric was I needed to score a seven,\nthe average of my surveys was a 6.5.\n\n1151\n01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:58,640\nNow, I can work with that.\n\n1152\n01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,210\nSo, that's the difference between data,\nand information.\n\n1153\n01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:02,530\nWe get it as data.\n\n1154\n01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,800\nWe convert it into information.\n\n1155\n01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,720\n>> Yeah.\n\n1156\n01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,560\nAs hard as it is sometimes to distinguish\nbetween the data, and the information.\n\n1157\n01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,860\nDon, I think the next step\nwas actually even harder.\n\n1158\n01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:20,680\nIt's to take the information, and then to\nconvert it into what ITIL calls knowledge.\n\n1159\n01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,603\nSo, Don, you're gonna have to help me here\ncuz apparently, I don't have enough of it.\n\n1160\n01:01:23,603 --> 01:01:24,320\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1161\n01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,331\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1162\n01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,736\nknowledge is simply what you\ndo with the information.\n\n1163\n01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:29,555\n>> Yeah.\n>> So now,\n\n1164\n01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:33,212\nI know that my customers\naveraged a 6.5 on navigation.\n\n1165\n01:01:33,212 --> 01:01:36,940\nGreat, I've got that,\nwhat does that mean to me?\n\n1166\n01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,870\nWell, we turn it into knowledge.\n\n1167\n01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,440\nAnd knowledge is just gonna be things\nthat like ideas, insight, values,\n\n1168\n01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,780\nwhatever, these kind of conceptual things.\n\n1169\n01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:49,510\nSo, I look at that, and I see 6.5,\nwhen I compare that to my metric,\n\n1170\n01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:54,840\nmy PKI,or my KPI, sorry,\nkey performance indicator.\n\n1171\n01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,150\nWhen I compare those,\nI can say I missed mark.\n\n1172\n01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:00,790\nThe 6.5, that was the information.\n\n1173\n01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:05,090\nComparing it to that indicator,\nthat becomes my knowledge.\n\n1174\n01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,790\nI now know, that I didn't meet my mark.\n\n1175\n01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,950\nAnd I know, that I need to get my\nscore up at least half a point, so\n\n1176\n01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:12,690\nI can get to seven.\n\n1177\n01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,910\nI'd like to get beyond that, but\nI need to come up at least half a point.\n\n1178\n01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:19,672\nSo, we didn't achieve what we set out to\nachieve, so we're gonna need to do more.\n\n1179\n01:02:19,672 --> 01:02:22,090\nWe're gonna need to come\nup with some more ideas.\n\n1180\n01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:22,890\nHow can we improve this?\n\n1181\n01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:27,230\nHow can we get up more than that seven,\nthat we're shooting for?\n\n1182\n01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:30,960\nThat's when we take our information,\nand we turn it into knowledge.\n\n1183\n01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,310\nNow, we know information,\nwe know data about our system, and\n\n1184\n01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,140\nwe need to take action on it.\n\n1185\n01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,440\nSo, that's a key piece.\n\n1186\n01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,630\nData, and information by themselves\nare nice, but they don't benefit us yet.\n\n1187\n01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,480\nWe've got them, it's what we do with that,\nthat makes the difference.\n\n1188\n01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,180\nAnd that's when it becomes knowledge.\n\n1189\n01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,805\nWe're taking action, and\nhopefully, going at it.\n\n1190\n01:02:52,805 --> 01:02:56,160\nNow, we do have to be careful because\nwhen we get into this knowledge part,\n\n1191\n01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,060\nwe're really interpreting\nthe information we get.\n\n1192\n01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:03,475\nAnd it can be manipulated if\nthe,data is incorrect, or\n\n1193\n01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:06,025\nwhoever converted it into information.\n\n1194\n01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:10,745\nIf they made mistakes in doing the\naveraging, or maybe they didn't exclude\n\n1195\n01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,620\noutliers, or they did include outliers, or\nthey didn't go to enough decimal points.\n\n1196\n01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,650\nThe information that we get may not\nbe accurate even though the data\n\n1197\n01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,970\nunderneath it was.\n\n1198\n01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,500\nAnd so, when we go to create knowledge,\n\n1199\n01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,780\nit's possible that we're basing our\ninformation on something that's incorrect.\n\n1200\n01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,030\nAnd you see this,\nin the medical industry all the time.\n\n1201\n01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:35,119\nWhere they'll come out one year, and\nthey'll say, [INAUDIBLE] spinach.\n\n1202\n01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is a great example.\n\n1203\n01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:42,470\nIn the 1970s, in the United States there\nwere huge advertising campaigns about how\n\n1204\n01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,430\nawesome spinach was for your health.\n\n1205\n01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,910\nAnd they were saying boy,\nspinach is great.\n\n1206\n01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:47,650\nEverybody should do this.\n\n1207\n01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,520\nAnd it had all of these\nscientific studies,\n\n1208\n01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,480\nthat showed that spinach\nwas a great source of iron.\n\n1209\n01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,280\nAnd it really just helped your body.\n\n1210\n01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,500\nWell, then in the late 80s\nthey came out and they said,\n\n1211\n01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,165\nwell actually let's back\noff that a little bit.\n\n1212\n01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:03,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Spinach is good, but it's so high in\n\n1213\n01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,630\niron that if you have any bone damage-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1214\n01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,160\n>> It actually slows your bones\n\n1215\n01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,915\ndown healing.\n\n1216\n01:04:08,915 --> 01:04:10,516\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, if have like a broken bone,\n\n1217\n01:04:10,516 --> 01:04:11,833\nspinach is a terrible thing to eat.\n\n1218\n01:04:11,833 --> 01:04:13,416\nSo, they just didn't know.\n\n1219\n01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,792\nThey didn't have the information.\n\n1220\n01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:19,534\nSo, they had collected some data that\ndidn't include things like monitoring bone\n\n1221\n01:04:19,534 --> 01:04:20,084\nhealth.\n\n1222\n01:04:20,084 --> 01:04:23,030\nIt just monitored other metrics.\n\n1223\n01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:26,760\nAnd then the information they gleaned from\nit was based on that limited data and\n\n1224\n01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,616\nthen they made knowledge that\ndidn't include certain things.\n\n1225\n01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:34,080\nNow that does that mean they're bad people\nand the scientist should be punished and\n\n1226\n01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,350\nexiled or whatever?\n\n1227\n01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:38,840\nNo, it just means that we always need to\nunderstand the limitation of our data.\n\n1228\n01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,800\nThere could be other sources of data\nthat we didn't take into account.\n\n1229\n01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:48,340\nAnd when we convert information into\nknowledge, it just has to be done with as\n\n1230\n01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:53,680\nmuch information as we can get ahold of,\nwithout paralyzing our decision-making.\n\n1231\n01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,790\nThere are some people who will\ncontinually wait and wait and wait for\n\n1232\n01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:58,220\nmore information to roll in.\n\n1233\n01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,450\nThere comes a time where you have to make\na decision and you say, you know what,\n\n1234\n01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:06,090\nthis is the best decision I can make\ntoday with the information that I have.\n\n1235\n01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,100\nAnd so we document that.\n\n1236\n01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:12,060\nThat becomes part of our records\nhow we reached that decision.\n\n1237\n01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:16,580\nAnd then that leads us to the last one,\nwhich is wisdom.\n\n1238\n01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,060\nNow wisdom really is like knowledge.\n\n1239\n01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,200\nThe difference is wisdom is right.\n\n1240\n01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,800\nWhen you make a correct,\nwell-informed decision, that's wisdom.\n\n1241\n01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,710\nWhen you make an incorrect decision,\nthat's still just knowledge.\n\n1242\n01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,670\nWe had knowledge, and\nto the best of our knowledge,\n\n1243\n01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:39,960\nwhat we were doing was right and\nit turned out not to be right.\n\n1244\n01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:43,240\n>> Don, I remembered this phrase that just\npopped in my head as you were saying that.\n\n1245\n01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,620\nA little bit of knowledge.\n\n1246\n01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,720\nPeople actually say I have\njust enough to be dangerous.\n\n1247\n01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,350\nAnd that's what can happen.\n\n1248\n01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:53,070\nWisdom gives us enough\nknowledge to know that\n\n1249\n01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:56,310\nwe can take the information that we're\ngiven and make a bad decision, or we\n\n1250\n01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,760\ncan take the information that we're given\nand make the correct decision as well.\n\n1251\n01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,650\nSo being able to distinguish\nthat is pretty much a part of\n\n1252\n01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:05,070\nwhat we need to be able to have on hand.\n\n1253\n01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:10,890\nIn ITIL, they do call it an acronym here,\nthat DI, if I can do it,\n\n1254\n01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:16,390\nDIKW as well as part of\nthis process that we have.\n\n1255\n01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:20,740\n>> Yeah, so DIKW, that's just our data,\ninformation, knowledge, wisdom.\n\n1256\n01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:24,510\nSo when we have an SKMS,\nthis is kind of the purpose of the SKMS.\n\n1257\n01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,960\nWe get our raw data,\nwe throw it in the SKMS.\n\n1258\n01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,170\nThen we create reports, which\nare converting our data into information.\n\n1259\n01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:34,550\nAnd then based on those reports,\nwe evaluate our services.\n\n1260\n01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,670\nAnd we make decisions as\nfar as where to go on that.\n\n1261\n01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:37,850\nNow it's knowledge.\n\n1262\n01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:41,880\nAnd if we have the right data, and it's\npresented in the right information, and we\n\n1263\n01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,850\nmake the right knowledge decisions, we've\nnow created wisdom and we move forward.\n\n1264\n01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,060\nNow that's pretty common sense.\n\n1265\n01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,640\nA lot of us don't even think\nabout these four phases.\n\n1266\n01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,750\nIt's not like you're going\nto tag your data this way.\n\n1267\n01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:53,820\nBut just be aware that that's there.\n\n1268\n01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,020\nIt is a concept inside of ITIL, and\nwe're going to see it more when we get to\n\n1269\n01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:01,240\nthe CSI section,\nthe continual service improvement,\n\n1270\n01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,570\nbecause you're collecting a lot of data\nthere about your service and you're trying\n\n1271\n01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,420\nto find ways to make it better, and you're\ngoing to move through all four stages.\n\n1272\n01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,390\nSo it's definitely heavier over there, but\n\n1273\n01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:13,480\nthis is one that really spans\nall of the service groups.\n\n1274\n01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,300\nSo it's not just limited right\nhere to service transition, but\n\n1275\n01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,980\nthey put it in service transition\nbecause that's where we see it the most.\n\n1276\n01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:25,235\nWhen you're deploying a new service or\nupdating the existing service,\n\n1277\n01:07:25,235 --> 01:07:28,445\nyou're going to be harvesting\na lot of information.\n\n1278\n01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,735\nYou're going to be working with that\nquite a bit to make the right decisions.\n\n1279\n01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:33,125\nSo that's why it gets thrown in here.\n\n1280\n01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,702\nBut again, common sense, so\nit's not really on the exam, but\n\n1281\n01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:38,165\nit's something we need to be aware of.\n\n1282\n01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:42,665\nAll right, so with that process,\nthat wraps it up.\n\n1283\n01:07:42,665 --> 01:07:44,425\nThat is it for service transition.\n\n1284\n01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:47,970\nI know we went into two episodes on this\none cuz it was quite a bit of material.\n\n1285\n01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:53,270\nBut at this stage in the game,\nnow our information is in production.\n\n1286\n01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:56,470\nOur new service has launched,\nour modified service has launched.\n\n1287\n01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:57,030\nWhat do we do?\n\n1288\n01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,330\nWe kick back and take a break.\n\n1289\n01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,470\nGo on vacation.\n\n1290\n01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:01,370\nWell, we still have two\nmore groups to get to.\n\n1291\n01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,100\nWe've got service operations.\n\n1292\n01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:06,120\nSo somebody's gotta make this service\ncontinue to run now that it's been\n\n1293\n01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,090\ndeployed.\n\n1294\n01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,650\nAnd then we'll talk about continual\nservice improvement towards the end of\n\n1295\n01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:10,560\nthis series.\n\n1296\n01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,120\nSo definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n1297\n01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,380\nWe've got more episodes coming as we\nround off the rest of the ITIL books.\n\n1298\n01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,070\nBut for now, this is a pretty\ngood spot to wrap up the show.\n\n1299\n01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,920\nSo let me remind you guys,\n\n1300\n01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,360\nif you have questions on any of the things\nthat we've talked

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,731\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:40,161\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:41,741\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,670\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,620\n>> It is going well.\n\n10\n00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,950\nIt's a beautiful morning\nhere in sunny Florida.\n\n11\n00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,250\nAnd we do welcome everybody to our\nshow as we go into ITIL Foundations.\n\n12\n00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,620\nAnother exciting episode.\n\n13\n00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,460\n>> That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,546\nWe're starting to approach the end of our\nservice life cycle as we move into these\n\n15\n00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:58,460\nlast few topics.\n\n16\n00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,580\nAnd the topic we're gonna be\nhitting today is service operation.\n\n17\n00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,110\nNow all the other areas that we've hit,\nthings like service strategy,\n\n18\n00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,030\nservice design, service-\n>> Transition.\n\n19\n00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,869\n>> Transition [LAUGH].\n\n20\n00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,328\nI just always want to say integration.\n\n21\n00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Service transition.\n\n22\n00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,960\nAll of those were kind of the lead up,\nand process of,\n\n23\n00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,030\ngetting a new service or a changed\nservice pushed and into our organization.\n\n24\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,660\nHere we switch gears, and\n\n25\n00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,810\nnow we're taking a look at actually\nusing that new service, right?\n\n26\n00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,330\nSo you've created this service,\nyou're providing it to your customer or\n\n27\n00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,170\nyou're providing it to your end users,\nwhoever it is that you're providing it to.\n\n28\n00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,560\nHow do we keep it running?\n\n29\n00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,268\nAnd that's what service\noperation is all about.\n\n30\n00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:44,180\nRemember that ITIL itself is really\nbased around this concept of IT service\n\n31\n00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,220\nmanagement, and the biggest part of\nthat is typically operations, right?\n\n32\n00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,690\nJust running with the service.\n\n33\n00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,310\nHopefully you don't spend\nten years designing and\n\n34\n00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,930\ncoming up with a deployment strategy for\na service that you then only use for\n\n35\n00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,960\na few days, but\nthat's not impossible, right?\n\n36\n00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,760\nJust look at NASA.\n\n37\n00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,800\nEvery time they launch a rocket into\nspace, there are years and years and\n\n38\n00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,350\nyears of effort that go into that, but\nthen all, as far as operation's concerned,\n\n39\n00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,350\nexecute within a small period of time.\n\n40\n00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,110\nBut most companies aren't\nstructured that way, right?\n\n41\n00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,800\nMost of us, we come up with an idea for\na service, like ITProTV.\n\n42\n00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,440\nWe wanted to provide video based training,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,700\nSo coming up with that idea,\nour initial designs,\n\n44\n00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,690\nthat initial push,\nit took some time, right.\n\n45\n00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,430\nBut it didn't take a ton of time.\n\n46\n00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,980\nAnd now we've spent well over two\nyears creating the actual content,\n\n47\n00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,040\nthe actual operations of this company.\n\n48\n00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,310\nSo that's a little more common for\nmost organizations.\n\n49\n00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,980\n>> In service operations,\nwhat we're really trying to do\n\n50\n00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,870\nis not just get the product developed and\njust delivered.\n\n51\n00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,590\nBut we want it delivered with stability.\n\n52\n00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,420\nIn other words, the ability for\nyou to have that stability that you want,\n\n53\n00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,160\nwhich is to be able to go to it day after\nday and know that it's gonna be there.\n\n54\n00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,100\nBut also with consistency.\n\n55\n00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,550\nWe want not only our shows to be\nconsistently better quality and\n\n56\n00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,860\nhigher performance here, but\n\n57\n00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,650\nto make sure that we deliver the same\nexperience each and every time too.\n\n58\n00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,990\nAnd service operation is really\nfocused in around that idea.\n\n59\n00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,210\nI'm not just going okay, I got you\nthe service, you want it to perform now?\n\n60\n00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,770\nIt's actually about making it\ndo it over and over again.\n\n61\n00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,390\nAnd that's what we want to provide\nhere in service operations.\n\n62\n00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,561\n>> Yeah, and what we'll find is there's\na real challenge here because service\n\n63\n00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,630\noperations is all about a balancing act,\nright.\n\n64\n00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,532\nWhere balancing that stability that we\nneed, right, our customers are paying for\n\n65\n00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,100\na product.\n\n66\n00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,060\nWe want to make sure that we can\ndeliver that product at all times.\n\n67\n00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,220\nBut, we have to offer that stability\nwhile still allowing for change, right?\n\n68\n00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,170\nYou could say, all right,\nwe created a perfect,\n\n69\n00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,580\nstable product just like it is right now.\n\n70\n00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,570\nDon't mess with it, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,160\nWhat's the saying?\n\n72\n00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,240\nIf it's not broke, don't fix it, right?\n\n73\n00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,140\nSo that kind of mentality is easy\nto fall into, to say we've got it.\n\n74\n00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140\nThis is perfect.\n\n75\n00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,900\nDon't touch it.\n\n76\n00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,640\nBut if you do that, the marketplace\ncontinues to evolve, your customers\n\n77\n00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,540\ncontinue to evolve, and your perfect,\nstable product may now be outdated.\n\n78\n00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,820\nSo you've got to allow for change,\nfor modifications to occur.\n\n79\n00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,184\nAnd if you remember back in the change\nmanagement episodes, I said,\n\n80\n00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:06,580\nevery change brings risks.\n\n81\n00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,220\nThere's no way around that.\n\n82\n00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,370\nSo, with service operation,\nwe have to be able to decide\n\n83\n00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,800\nwhen that risk is appropriate or\nwhen we need to be able to move forward.\n\n84\n00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,690\nWe should not be change averse.\n\n85\n00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,820\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n86\n00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,640\nBut we do need to be controlled\nabout the changes that we allow.\n\n87\n00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,520\nAnd service operations is that point where\nwe decide, oh you want to change that?\n\n88\n00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,510\nYou need to go through change management,\nright?\n\n89\n00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,460\nShift people over there.\n\n90\n00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,390\nOtherwise we're just gonna keep this\nrunning the way that it is, but\n\n91\n00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,730\nwe've got that input or interface to\nbe able to jump into change management.\n\n92\n00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,420\n>> Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,150\nIt is through the service operation that\nour customer will really begin to see\n\n94\n00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,640\nthe value of the product that we've\ndelivered, so that they know that\n\n95\n00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,940\nthe product's solid, it's stable, it's\ngonna do exactly what the customer wants.\n\n96\n00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,130\nAnd that's where they're gonna actually\nstart having a better attachment to your\n\n97\n00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,570\nservice, and wanting to actually\nintegrate a little bit more, or\n\n98\n00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,490\nto actually get you to\ndeliver more services.\n\n99\n00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,890\nAnd that's what we hope we can do.\n\n100\n00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,044\nSo, when we're doing service operations,\n\n102\n00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:06,160\na big part of what we deal\nwith is management, right?\n\n103\n00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,050\nActually managing the operation,\nmanaging our resources, our people,\n\n104\n00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,550\nthe services themselves.\n\n105\n00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,090\nThere's a lot of stuff\nthat gets dealt with.\n\n106\n00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,933\nAnd the service operations service book,\nit covers recommended best practices for\n\n107\n00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,660\ndoing that, right?\n\n108\n00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,180\nNow, ITIL does have a few\ndifferent definitions of\n\n109\n00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,770\nthe types of management that happen, and\nI want to call out just a couple of them.\n\n110\n00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,730\nActually, if you grab the service\noperations book, there's a good six or\n\n111\n00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,540\nseven different management types in there.\n\n112\n00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,620\nBut there's just a few I want\nto make sure that we understand,\n\n113\n00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,998\nthese are the ones that have\na tendency to show up the exam.\n\n114\n00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:39,470\nThe main one we have is\nIT operations management.\n\n115\n00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,522\nAnd that's that overall vision of\nmanaging the delivery of a service,\n\n116\n00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:46,150\nour IT operations.\n\n117\n00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,970\nThe day to day activities of your IT\ndepartment are delivering a service or\n\n118\n00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,530\nmaking that service possible.\n\n119\n00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,360\nAnd that's what we call\nIT operations management.\n\n120\n00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,578\nSo that's the big guy that's\nover the whole thing.\n\n121\n00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:58,287\n>> We also have technical management.\n\n122\n00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,206\nAny time we deliver a service or\na skill over to a customer,\n\n123\n00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:05,197\nwe want to make sure that we stand behind\nit with the expertise that we have either\n\n124\n00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:08,840\nin an application or\nwhatever service that we're delivering.\n\n125\n00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,788\nSo we need to make sure that we\nmanage either human resources or\n\n126\n00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,670\nthat we have the technical expertise.\n\n127\n00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,086\nAnd when the customer does ask us to\ndo something that we're not just gonna,\n\n128\n00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,130\nwell, maybe?\n\n129\n00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,270\nMaybe it can be done?\n\n130\n00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,470\nThat we know what's really going on.\n\n131\n00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,350\nSo being able to manage that technical\naspect of whatever we provide,\n\n132\n00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,020\nis also an important part of it.\n\n133\n00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,010\n>> And a key concept to remember on the\nexam is that technical management is what\n\n134\n00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,610\ncovers managing your IT infrastructure.\n\n135\n00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,270\nAll right?\nWhen we say infrastructure,\n\n136\n00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,740\nwere talking about servers,\nInternet connections,\n\n137\n00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,450\nnetwork, networking in general, right?\n\n138\n00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,920\nAll your network systems,\nyour security monitoring.\n\n139\n00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,100\nAll the different components\nthat a systems administrator or\n\n140\n00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,280\na network administrator\nwould be working with.\n\n141\n00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,390\nThat all falls under technical management.\n\n142\n00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,850\nAnd it's easy to confuse that with the\nnext one which is application management.\n\n143\n00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,720\nBecause when we think of a particular\nserver we don't normally think of it\n\n144\n00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,950\nas just a generic piece of hardware.\n\n145\n00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,690\nWe think, oh that's my web server.\n\n146\n00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,460\nOr that's my email server.\n\n147\n00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,680\nWell, the web server piece or\nthe email server piece, that's actually\n\n148\n00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,490\nan application running on top of some\ninfrastructure, the physical server.\n\n149\n00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,070\nSo technical management is focused\non that IT infrastructure.\n\n150\n00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,170\nApplication management is managing\nan application life cycle.\n\n151\n00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,798\nAnd we're not gonna go crazy\ndevelopment in here, but\n\n152\n00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:26,512\nif you do waterfall or XP or any of\nthose various development methodologies,\n\n153\n00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,420\nthey've got a whole life cycle they\nfollow, similar to our service life cycle.\n\n154\n00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,290\nBut with an application it's\neither development or procurement.\n\n155\n00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,380\nEither you make the application yourself,\nor you buy it from somebody else.\n\n156\n00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,230\nThen there's design and\ndeployment as you get it in place.\n\n157\n00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,370\nThen there's operation.\n\n158\n00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,920\nWe run that application\nas long as we need it.\n\n159\n00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,633\nAnd then we retire the application by\neither upgrading it to a new version, or\n\n160\n00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:52,250\nreplacing it with some other software,\nor just canceling it altogether.\n\n161\n00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,328\nThat's the application life cycle, and\n\n162\n00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:56,710\napplication management\nfocuses around that.\n\n163\n00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,287\nAnd you'd have to be\na pretty big company to\n\n164\n00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:04,020\nwarrant having employees that were\nspecifically assigned to applications.\n\n165\n00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,840\nNow I've worked at some companies that\nlarge, most companies aren't though.\n\n166\n00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,280\nBut you might have specific network admins\nthat just support the email servers.\n\n167\n00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,010\nRight?\nOr\n\n168\n00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,130\nDBAs are a better example of this as\nwe have database administrators, so\n\n169\n00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,050\nthey're managing this database, and the\ndatabase software that it's running on,\n\n170\n00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,520\nand they might not have a clue\nabout the hardware underneath it.\n\n171\n00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,900\nThey let the sysadmins deal with it, so\nyou might have divisions inside of it.\n\n172\n00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,980\nAnd that's what I wanted to highlight here\nis that operations management is that\n\n173\n00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,680\noverall but then we divide it up.\n\n174\n00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,926\nAnd, technical management,\napplication management,\n\n175\n00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:38,710\nthose are the two kind of common ones.\n\n176\n00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,780\nThere are others that focus around things\nlike IT finance management and others,\n\n177\n00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,130\nbut they're kind of less common.\n\n178\n00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,011\nSo it's not something they\nreally drive on the exam.\n\n179\n00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:52,830\nAll right, so with service operation,\nwe know that it centers\n\n180\n00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,220\naround keeping our services running,\nkeeping them optimal, allowing for change.\n\n181\n00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,110\nThese are the things that\nservice operation is all about.\n\n182\n00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,740\nWell, we achieve that through\nseveral different processes.\n\n183\n00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,770\nAnd at first glance it looks like\nservice operations has less processes\n\n184\n00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,080\nthan the other areas, and so\nthis might be a shorter one.\n\n185\n00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,860\nBut it's actually a pretty\ngood amount of data.\n\n186\n00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,960\nWe start with event management.\n\n187\n00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,570\nSo event management, we'll see a little\nbit more later, is when things\n\n188\n00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,990\naren't quite going right, when something\nhappens and we have to take action, right?\n\n189\n00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,630\nSo event management,\n\n190\n00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,750\nhow we respond to when something differs\nfrom the way that we want it, right?\n\n191\n00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,689\nOur standard norm is not being maintained.\n\n192\n00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,260\n>> We also have incident management.\n\n193\n00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,110\nIncident management is when we have\nan unexpected interruption to the services\n\n194\n00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,030\nthat we are trying to provide, and we have\nto have a way to deal with those too.\n\n195\n00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,910\nSo as incident management\nis really about that\n\n196\n00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,900\nunexpected interruption than what we have.\n\n197\n00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,830\n>> So incidents are unexpected.\n\n198\n00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,130\nThe converse to that is\na request fulfillment.\n\n199\n00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,700\nRequest fulfillment is our next process,\n\n200\n00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,240\nwhich is expected things,\nright or regular routine things.\n\n201\n00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,830\nThese aren't emergencies,\nwe don't need to light up the sirens and\n\n202\n00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,270\nget everybody out of bed.\n\n203\n00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,170\nIt's just something in routine\nthat needs to be done.\n\n204\n00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,510\nAnd so we need to have mechanisms\nin place for those regular,\n\n205\n00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,170\nroutine, pre-authorized changes.\n\n206\n00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,500\nAnd that's request fulfillment.\n\n207\n00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,520\n>> Yeah and we also have problems.\n\n208\n00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,390\nAnd lot of times,\n\n209\n00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:21,590\nthis is where it gets easy to confuse\nthe term problems and instances.\n\n210\n00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,880\nSo when we talk about instance,\nthe unexpected interruption.\n\n211\n00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,270\nProblems are things that really arise or\nhave been there for a long time and\n\n212\n00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,350\nwe now have to deal with\nthem as they do arise.\n\n213\n00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,347\n>> Yeah, it's probably a good idea\nright here to differentiate those\n\n214\n00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:37,250\nbecause it does get confusing.\n\n215\n00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,610\nThe way I think of it, here's the way that\nI remember that makes this kind of easy,\n\n216\n00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,440\nis that the incident is typically\na symptom, and the problem is the cause.\n\n217\n00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,820\nAnd like Ronnie said that the problem\nmay have been there a long time,\n\n218\n00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,910\nit may have been there forever.\n\n219\n00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,540\nRight?\n\n220\n00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,170\nBut we're just now seeing\nsymptoms based on it.\n\n221\n00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,170\nSo think about when a person gets sick.\n\n222\n00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,290\nSo if I get sick and\nI have a runny nose or a fever, right?\n\n223\n00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,730\nThe fever, the runny nose,\nthose are symptoms.\n\n224\n00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,250\nWhat's the actual cause?\n\n225\n00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,920\nWell, maybe I've got the flu virus, right?\n\n226\n00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,560\nSo the flu virus itself is the actual\nproblem, but the fever, the runny nose,\n\n227\n00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,080\nthose are the incidents, right and that's\nhow your service operations will run.\n\n228\n00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,450\nYou'll get calls from your end users\ncalling in saying, this isn't working.\n\n229\n00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,690\nWell that's the incident, right.\n\n230\n00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,128\nThe incident is,\nthis person is having this issue, right.\n\n231\n00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,070\nBut what's causing that?\n\n232\n00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,670\nAnd we might able to fix the incident\nwithout fixing the problem, and\n\n233\n00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,960\nthat's why ITIL divides\nthose up separately.\n\n234\n00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,750\nSometimes they can't\nbe addressed together.\n\n235\n00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,380\nSometimes you just don't\nhave enough information,\n\n236\n00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,740\nbut we need to get our users back up and\nrunning first.\n\n237\n00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,500\nSo incident management is all\nabout getting people up and\n\n238\n00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,430\nrunning again as quickly as possible.\n\n239\n00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,430\nProblem management is our long term\nsolution to getting this thing solved.\n\n240\n00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,240\nEasy to mix up, right, that\nterminology is really easy to confuse.\n\n241\n00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,880\nAnd let's do an event, too,\nbecause event's kind of easy to mix up.\n\n242\n00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,280\nWhat's the difference between an event and\nan incident?\n\n243\n00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,680\nWell, an event is the actual occurrence of\nsomething that deviates from our baseline.\n\n244\n00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,860\nNow, when a user calls in with an incident\n\n245\n00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,290\nthat might not actually\nbe tied to an event.\n\n246\n00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,190\nThis might just be something that's\nexposing them to an issue that nobody\n\n247\n00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,200\nelse is.\n\n248\n00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,160\nBut also,\nevents might not require an action.\n\n249\n00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,670\nIt might just be some performance\nmonitor that we're tracking, just for\n\n250\n00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,790\nhistorical data.\n\n251\n00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,809\nAnd so it's not really tied\nto a incident or problem,\n\n252\n00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,100\nit's just data that we're gathering.\n\n253\n00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,580\nSo that makes a little bit of a gray\narea there, and it does get confusing.\n\n254\n00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,220\nWe'll see more as we break\neach of those processes apart.\n\n255\n00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,550\nNow the last process that we have inside\nof service operation is access management.\n\n256\n00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,410\nAnd this is a nice short one,\ncuz this one's pretty easy.\n\n257\n00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,660\nIt's just controlling people's\naccess to the service.\n\n258\n00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,980\nWhen you offer a service you\nprobably don't offer it to\n\n259\n00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,680\neveryone in the world for free.\n\n260\n00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,070\nSome people do, right?\n\n261\n00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,360\nBut usually you don't.\n\n262\n00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,855\nNormally you offer it to select customers\nor select internal employees or\n\n263\n00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,215\nyou do offer it to the public but\n\n264\n00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,075\nyou don't allow everybody to\naccess each other's information.\n\n265\n00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:03,395\nYou create isolation,\nthat's all access management.\n\n266\n00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:06,015\nAnd so we need a process in place\nto be able to control that.\n\n267\n00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:07,695\nWho gets access to what and when.\n\n268\n00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,880\nSo those are the primary processes that\nwe'll see inside of service operations.\n\n269\n00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,450\nNow, the key thing to remember,\naside from those, is that\n\n270\n00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,620\nthese processes are pretty generic, and\nmost organizations are gonna use them,\n\n271\n00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,800\nbut you will likely have additional\nprocesses in your company that\n\n272\n00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,460\nare tailored specifically to\nwhatever it is you do, right.\n\n273\n00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,050\nEvery organization is unique.\n\n274\n00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,190\nThey offer a different product and so, you\nmay have to have additional processes to\n\n275\n00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,950\nmanage the product that\nyou're involved in.\n\n276\n00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,730\nSo just keep that, bear that in mind.\n\n277\n00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,040\nDoesn't apply to everybody though so\nITIL doesn't cover it.\n\n278\n00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,770\nIt's supposed to be a general\nbest practices framework.\n\n279\n00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,660\nYou can't really get into\nthe specific nitty-gritty.\n\n280\n00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,480\nThey tried that, right?\n\n281\n00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,290\nBack when we had the massive volumes of\ndata, but to get everything concise and\n\n282\n00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,002\nusable, that's kind of been trimmed out.\n\n283\n00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:56,860\nAll right, so that's a pretty good\noverview of service operation.\n\n284\n00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,990\nWhat we're gonna do now is we're just\ngonna dive into each of those different\n\n285\n00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,770\nprocesses, and kinda,\nsee what they do, right.\n\n286\n00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,090\nSo, let's get started\nwith event management.\n\n287\n00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,790\nAnd event management is well tracking for\nthose events and\n\n288\n00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,690\nreally the act of tracking itself.\n\n289\n00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,180\nAnd looking for\nwhere we have deviations, right?\n\n290\n00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,420\nNow, here's where we start to see\na little bit of confusion in terminology\n\n291\n00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,880\ntoo if we're not careful,\n\n292\n00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,170\nbecause you don't necessarily monitor\nevery single thing that there is.\n\n293\n00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,130\nThere are some things that you're just not\nable to monitor and generate events on.\n\n294\n00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,890\nBut at a minimum you monitor your\nconfiguration items, your CIs.\n\n295\n00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,390\nRemember back in change\nmanagement we said that a CI,\n\n296\n00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,970\nconfiguration item, was any asset that\nwe could alter the properties of, right.\n\n297\n00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,990\nAnything that we could change.\n\n298\n00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,540\nSo if you have a server and\n\n299\n00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,340\nyou apply a software update to it\nthat's a change to that item, right.\n\n300\n00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,780\nYou may not change its base behavior but\n\n301\n00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,150\nyou're modifying the software which\ncould lead to incidence, right?\n\n302\n00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,870\nSo, we need to be able to track that.\n\n303\n00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,930\nIt could be performance counters.\n\n304\n00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,230\nWe could say all of my servers should be\noperating at below 80% CPU utilization.\n\n305\n00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,090\nAnd then one day I have a server at 82%,\nright.\n\n306\n00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,870\nThat's an event,\nwe've crossed that threshold, and\n\n307\n00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,830\nthat's what event management is all about.\n\n308\n00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,530\nWe define a baseline, what we expect\nthings to be and then we monitor for\n\n309\n00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,680\nwhen we cross it, right?\n\n310\n00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,050\nAnd you'll see where they refer\nto it in ITIL as a baseline, or\n\n311\n00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,590\nthey refer to it as normal operations,\nNO, or standard normal operations,\n\n312\n00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,850\nyou'll see a few variations of it.\n\n313\n00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,300\nBut that's just what we expect\nour servers to be doing.\n\n314\n00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960\n>> We also can measure this against\nour service level agreements\n\n315\n00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,950\nthat we have with the customer, too.\n\n316\n00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,990\nThat way, they can actually go ahead and\nbe able to say,\n\n317\n00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,400\nlook, here's what we're expecting to see,\nand this is not what's happening.\n\n318\n00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,690\nSo, it gives us that basis to\nbe able to now go ahead and\n\n319\n00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,710\ndo the things that we need to do to be\nable to manage the events that come along.\n\n320\n00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,743\nSo you might have where you go well\nsomebody else made this change that\n\n321\n00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:51,750\nwasn't supposed to.\n\n322\n00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,093\nIt's unauthorized, and\n\n323\n00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,210\nthat gives us now an event that\nwe can now do something about.\n\n324\n00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,705\n>> Yeah, SLAs are important to remember\nbecause It's not necessarily that we have\n\n325\n00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:02,170\na problem on our network.\n\n326\n00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:08,550\nSo let's say that I ordered a fiber\noptic line for our building.\n\n327\n00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,560\nAnd they promised me a 99% uptime on it.\n\n328\n00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,027\nThat was the SLA on that fiber\nline running to the building.\n\n329\n00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,200\nOkay?\n\n330\n00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,230\nAnd throughout the year during\nbusiness hours I had 100% uptime.\n\n331\n00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,730\nEverything was fine.\n\n332\n00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,370\nBut every now and then, in the middle\nof the night, that line would drop out.\n\n333\n00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,220\nIt didn't impact my business, but the line\ndropped out, and by the end of the year,\n\n334\n00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,030\nI only had 95% uptime.\n\n335\n00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,300\nWell, technically, the SLA was violated.\n\n336\n00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,140\nAnd while it didn't occur during business\nhours, well it didn't impact my business.\n\n337\n00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,860\nThere was no like incident or\nwhatever as a result of it.\n\n338\n00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,350\nThere was still this problem.\n\n339\n00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,490\nThis thing that occurred throughout\nthe year and the SLA was violated.\n\n340\n00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,530\nSo, we have to be able to track that so\nwe can deal with it.\n\n341\n00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,555\nJust because it didn't happen\nduring business hours this year,\n\n342\n00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:54,428\ndoesn't mean that it won't next year.\n\n343\n00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,905\nWe just got lucky this time,\nand next year maybe it will, so\n\n344\n00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:02,310\nthey need to be addressed, and so\nSLAs will change your baseline.\n\n345\n00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,710\nYou have a baseline of what's\nconsidered acceptable, but\n\n346\n00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:08,170\nif you've entered into some kind of SLA,\nsome service-level agreement,\n\n347\n00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,380\njust because you maintain the baseline\ndoesn't mean you met the SLA, so you might\n\n348\n00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,350\nas well turn the SLA into your baseline\nand that's what a lot of organizations do.\n\n349\n00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,790\nAll right, so what can lead to this?\n\n350\n00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,040\nWhat could cause an event, right?\n\n351\n00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,450\nWell it's really anything that we choose.\n\n352\n00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,330\nYou can create your own scripts and\n\n353\n00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,230\nmonitoring systems to generate\nevents based on anything.\n\n354\n00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,804\nBut some common examples\nunauthorized changes.\n\n355\n00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,150\nI see where somebody's gone and\nmodified a setting on a server.\n\n356\n00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,440\nA change in the Windows registry.\n\n357\n00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,080\nAn edited configuration file on Linux.\n\n358\n00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,790\nA new kernel extension in Mac OS.\n\n359\n00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,580\nSomething has been modified\nin the source code.\n\n360\n00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,130\nWe can just monitor for changes.\n\n361\n00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,520\nAnd whenever a change happens, good or\nbad, we don't care about that.\n\n362\n00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,886\nWe need to be able to match\nthat change to a change ticket.\n\n363\n00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,456\nAnd if there wasn't a change ticket,\nthat's an unauthorized change,\n\n364\n00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,110\nthat's an event, all right.\n\n365\n00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,820\nHasn't necessarily caused an incident,\nhasn't necessarily caused a problem.\n\n366\n00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,710\nBut it's an event, right?\n\n367\n00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,560\nThat's that differentiator\nthat we have that says\n\n368\n00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,040\nwhy an event is separate from an instance.\n\n369\n00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,390\n>> We all know, we also,\n\n370\n00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,970\nmight want to take into account what\nwe call server performance too.\n\n371\n00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,550\nAnd we have a lot of customers that are\ntrying to use a particular service that\n\n372\n00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,140\nwe're offering on a server.\n\n373\n00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,500\nWe may go ahead and tell the server\nthat we need to monitor and\n\n374\n00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,480\nbe able to track once\nthe processor hits over 50% or\n\n375\n00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,460\nwe're actually using too much RAM or\nthis GIO is actually getting too high.\n\n376\n00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,290\nAnd we can trigger those that will\nactually give us the alert to let us know\n\n377\n00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,890\nthat here's something that\nactually has happened now.\n\n378\n00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,310\n>> Network intrusion, right, if a hacker\nor an unauthorized external user or\n\n379\n00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,060\neven an unauthorized internal user gets\ninto a system that they shouldn't have.\n\n380\n00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,540\nWe'll see that in our audit logs and\n\n381\n00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,160\nwe may have alerting kind\nof built off of that.\n\n382\n00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,830\nAnd I kind of mentioned the word alert and\nthat's actually a special word in ITIL.\n\n383\n00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,790\nThe event is what actually happened.\n\n384\n00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,870\nThe alert is us being\ncontacted about the event.\n\n385\n00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,420\nA lot of us, and I'm guilty of this.\n\n386\n00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,650\nI'll use the term event and\nalert interchangeably sometimes.\n\n387\n00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,680\nBut in ITIL's official definitions\nthey are different, right?\n\n388\n00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,790\nSo an event can be manually monitored.\n\n389\n00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,950\nWe can just go and check it ourselves,\nor it can be automated.\n\n390\n00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,810\nAnd if it's automated, when that event\nhappens and it sends us a message,\n\n391\n00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,960\nthat's the alert, right.\n\n392\n00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,170\nThat's what lets us know.\n\n393\n00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,820\nSo a network intrusion would be\na great example of where we would want\n\n394\n00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,300\nto automate that so\nwe got as quick a response as possible.\n\n395\n00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,510\nCuz if I'm just coming in and\n\n396\n00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,080\nmanually checking, the intrusion could've\nbeen the day before, I just now see it.\n\n397\n00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,960\n>> We also can take into\nthings like climate-control,\n\n398\n00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,770\ninside of our data center,\nour server-closets to make sure that our\n\n399\n00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,780\nservers are given the proper airflow that\nthey need and they're not getting too hot.\n\n400\n00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,800\nA lot of times,\nit's just as simple as a thermometer, but\n\n401\n00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,110\nthere's even more detailed\nsystems than that,\n\n402\n00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,580\nthat can actually just tell us that once\nit hits 80 degrees, we're in trouble.\n\n403\n00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,160\nWe need to do something about it.\n\n404\n00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,870\n>> We've been hitting on all IT examples.\n\n405\n00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,430\nLet's go a little bit crazier.\n\n406\n00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,885\nLet's go to force majeure.\n\n407\n00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So inclement weather or\n\n408\n00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,720\na natural disaster, right?\n\n409\n00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,740\nHurricane, blizzard, earthquake,\nvolcano, alien invasion, right?\n\n410\n00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,780\nAll of these crazy other things that are\nkind of outside of the scope of what we\n\n411\n00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,690\ncontrol.\n\n412\n00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,183\nThese happen and they're events.\n\n413\n00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,269\nDo they affect us?\n\n414\n00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,620\nUsually they affect us one way or\nanother, right?\n\n415\n00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,300\nSo it is an event that we need to be\naware of and we need to deal with.\n\n416\n00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,900\nSo event management is all\nabout spotting these things.\n\n417\n00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,846\nHow do we know that these things happen so\n\n418\n00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:31,088\nthat we can then take\nthe appropriate action.\n\n419\n00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:32,737\nRight.\nAnd that is what leads us to our next\n\n420\n00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:35,238\npart, which is the event management\nresponsibilities, right.\n\n421\n00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:37,880\nWhat are we responsible for\nperforming as a part of event management.\n\n422\n00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,110\nWell that first piece is detecting\nsignificant events, right?\n\n423\n00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,880\nWe need to know when these events happen.\n\n424\n00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,890\nNow, ITIL specifically calls out\nthat term significant, right?\n\n425\n00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,170\nNot every event has significance.\n\n426\n00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,600\nYou might have an event of when new\nequipment shows up at the door, right?\n\n427\n00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,847\nWe know that it's going to kick off\na series of other events, right?\n\n428\n00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:01,825\nThat we need to take these computers,\nget them set up, get them deployed,\n\n429\n00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,080\nget them pushed out.\n\n430\n00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,870\nBut it's not crazy significant, right?\n\n431\n00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,330\nIt's not like it's going to derail our\ncompany's operations that we just got this\n\n432\n00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,360\nnew computer in.\n\n433\n00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,840\nSo those are just non-significant,\n\n434\n00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,050\nregular, routine things that\nwe expect to have happen.\n\n435\n00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,620\nSo, we need to know when things\nare going against our wishes.\n\n436\n00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,350\nSo here's where we start\ndividing up the events.\n\n437\n00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,450\nIf it's an event that doesn't\nreally lead to an incident\n\n438\n00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,520\nit may not be something that we\nreally need to worry about at all.\n\n439\n00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,510\nBut if it is an event that\nis leading to incidents.\n\n440\n00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,740\nWe definitely need to be aware of it.\n\n441\n00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,490\nAnd ideally aware of it\nbefore our end user is.\n\n442\n00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,500\nRight.\nIf we can be proactive of about any of\n\n443\n00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,790\nthis, fix the problem before the users\nsee it all the better, right.\n\n444\n00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,930\nSo that's where we've got to\nfind out what is going on and\n\n445\n00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,880\ndo it as quickly as possible.\n\n446\n00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,800\n>> Once we figure out what the event is,\nthe whole goal of event management is that\n\n447\n00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,700\nmanagement side, which is really to\ntake control of the event itself.\n\n448\n00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,670\nWe want to make sure of course,\nthat when we take control of the event,\n\n449\n00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,610\nthat we're seeing what it is, so that we\ncan determine what the appropriate action\n\n450\n00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,370\nis, and then set that into place so that\nthat actually works toward the benefit\n\n451\n00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,730\nof us being a better service provider.\n\n452\n00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,930\n>> And one thing I forgot to mention there\nwhich I probably should is non-significant\n\n453\n00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,460\nevents, it's not like we just\nwant to ignore those, right?\n\n454\n00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,310\nBecause they can be important,\nwe need them for historical data and\n\n455\n00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,020\nother information, like trend analysis,\nand stuff, we need that data,\n\n456\n00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,330\nso in ITIL they kind of divide this up a\nlittle bit more, and they say, monitoring,\n\n457\n00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,410\nright, so that keyword, monitoring,\nthat's the action of tracking all events,\n\n458\n00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,860\nsignificant and non-significant.\n\n459\n00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,860\nIt’s when we actually dive into doing\nthe event piece, like Ronnie you mentioned\n\n460\n00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,068\ncontrolling the event, that’s when we're\njust focused on the significant ones.\n\n461\n00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:49,910\nSo all events are covered by monitoring.\n\n462\n00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,810\nBut monitoring covers other things\ntoo that would be non-significant,\n\n463\n00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,070\nthat would be considered a part of that.\n\n464\n00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,076\nSo monitoring is more\nof an umbrella term and\n\n465\n00:22:56,076 --> 00:23:00,147\njust because you're monitoring something\nthat's happened doesn't necessarily mean\n\n466\n00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,515\nthat it's an event, right.\n\n467\n00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:04,075\nBecause part of that monitoring might\njust be reflecting that everything is\n\n468\n00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:05,110\nrunning great.\n\n469\n00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,770\nEverything is running as you expected,\nno changes are necessary, right.\n\n470\n00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,880\nSo the terminology does get a little\nbit kind of intermingled there.\n\n471\n00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,830\nAnother big responsibility of ours\nwhen it comes to event management\n\n472\n00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,290\nis communication.\n\n473\n00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,700\nAnd really, I don't know if I put\nit in my notes for the show or not,\n\n474\n00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,260\nbut really every one of these processes,\ncommunication is very key, right?\n\n475\n00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,890\nProbably one of our primary goals\nin service operations is to\n\n476\n00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,730\nkeep the service running, but\n\n477\n00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,550\nif I had to pick a second place, it would\nbe communicating the status of a service.\n\n478\n00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,650\nAnd that's communicating it to\nthe customer, to our end user,\n\n479\n00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,600\nto our own IT personnel.\n\n480\n00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,990\nKeeping everybody on the same page, right?\n\n481\n00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,130\nStrong communications is required\nat every leg of this journey,\n\n482\n00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,100\njust all the way through.\n\n483\n00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,570\nSo with each process just in the back of\nyour mind tack on that unofficial entry\n\n484\n00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,070\ncommunication.\n\n485\n00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,120\nAnd we increase the value of our\nservice when we do good communication.\n\n486\n00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,818\nI can't tell you how many times I've\nused a web hosted service where\n\n487\n00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,548\nthey went offline and didn't tell us.\n\n488\n00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:09,773\nDidn't notify us as end users,\nand hours went by and\n\n489\n00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:12,040\nwe didn't know what was going on.\n\n490\n00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,000\nDid they go out of business, did they\nget hacked, did they just lose power?\n\n491\n00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,852\nWe don't know, and\n\n492\n00:24:16,852 --> 00:24:21,025\nyour customers they start to create\na perception of the problem.\n\n493\n00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:24,135\nAnd they may view it as gross\nnegligence on your part.\n\n494\n00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:27,675\nWhere, if you had just communicated\nthat out, then people would know.\n\n495\n00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,875\nAnd a lot of companies like Google.\n\n496\n00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,750\nThey have their Google service\nstatus page and you can go there and\n\n497\n00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,150\nyou can see the status of all the stuff\nrunning on their system at any given time.\n\n498\n00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,010\nAnd that's really useful because if\nthey ever have a problem you can see it.\n\n499\n00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,700\nYes, they're aware of it and\nthey're acting on it.\n\n500\n00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,560\nBut if people don't know,\nwhat are they going to do?\n\n501\n00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,582\nThey're going to start calling in tickets\nand you're going to start getting many,\n\n502\n00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:48,150\nmany calls on the same problem.\n\n503\n00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,740\nAnd it's going to make your job harder.\n\n504\n00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,690\nSo good communication is key.\n\n505\n00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,070\n>> Lastly, event management also provides\nfor us that basis and that knowledge for\n\n506\n00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,260\ndoing our continual service improvements.\n\n507\n00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,310\nAnd we're going to see it\na little bit later on.\n\n508\n00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,820\nWith having historical data.\n\n509\n00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,490\nWe don't have to go back and\nrecreate the wheel every time.\n\n510\n00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,630\nWe can learn from our mistakes in\nthe past and that way, provide for\n\n511\n00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,190\nbetter service in the future.\n\n512\n00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,300\n>> With CSI or\nContinual Service Improvement,\n\n513\n00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,840\nyou're trying to make things better.\n\n514\n00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,320\nWell you need something\nto measure against, so\n\n515\n00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,670\nyou need to know how things\nare going on a normal day.\n\n516\n00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,940\nAnd that means not necessarily\nwhen things are going bad or\n\n517\n00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,950\neven when things are going good.\n\n518\n00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,510\nYou need to look at that data and\nevaluate.\n\n519\n00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,610\nSo we've got an entire separate\nshow focused just on CSI.\n\n520\n00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,460\nWe'll see that.\n\n521\n00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:27,990\nA little bit later.\n\n522\n00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,080\nIt will be our episode of CSI.\n\n523\n00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,690\nWe're going to get some sunglasses and\nstart that episode.\n\n524\n00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,380\nDo the whole.\n\n525\n00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,290\n>> And then, look down at a weird angle.\n\n526\n00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,550\n>> We'll have to come out with some\nwitty pun to throw out at the beginning.\n\n527\n00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,840\nAnd you can dye your hair red, Ronnie.\n\n528\n00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,150\nThis is all falling together.\n\n529\n00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,400\nThis is going to be perfect.\n\n530\n00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,860\nAll right, that's basically,\nwhat's involved with event management.\n\n531\n00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,140\nEvent management, you guys might have\nnoticed, didn't actually do anything.\n\n532\n00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,630\nEvent management is all about recognizing,\nright?\n\n533\n00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,770\nRecognizing that an event has occurred and\ncommunicating it to people.\n\n534\n00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,780\nI guess communicating,\nthat's the action we take, right.\n\n535\n00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,490\nBut communicating it\nto the powers that be.\n\n536\n00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,570\nWhat do they do?\n\n537\n00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,690\nWell that's where the other\nprocesses come in.\n\n538\n00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,520\nSo we're going to jump\nthrough each of those.\n\n539\n00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,570\nAs we do incident management,\nproblem management,\n\n540\n00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,890\nrequest fulfillment,\nyou know all of those as we handle\n\n541\n00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,210\nwhat actually comes out of this\nevent that we've detected.\n\n542\n00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,000\nBut for right now that's actually a pretty\ngood spot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n543\n00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,300\nSo let's pause for\na breather and when we get back,\n\n544\n00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,970\nwe're going to jump into\nincident management.\n\n545\n00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,715\nStay tuned.\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n546\n00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:33,215\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n547\n00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:33,912\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n548\n00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:39,090\nNow it's time to dive into the largest\nprocess inside of service operations.\n\n549\n00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,520\nWhich is incident management.\n\n550\n00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,270\nIncident management, like we said earlier,\nis when something's not quite going\n\n551\n00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,750\nthe way that we want it to and\nwe've got to deal with it.\n\n552\n00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,470\n[LAUGH] So that's kind of,\nwhere we fall in here.\n\n553\n00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,700\nAnd remember that, with an incident, we're\ntalking about when things have deviated\n\n554\n00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,070\nfrom the baseline or the normal service\noperation that we expect to have happen.\n\n555\n00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,360\nAnd, we're just not quite\nin-line with where we are now.\n\n556\n00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,190\nThere's many, many things that can\ncause an incident, but with iTill,\n\n557\n00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,070\nthey give a couple examples of that.\n\n558\n00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,410\nAnd the first example of an incident\nis a unscheduled service interruption.\n\n559\n00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,660\nAll right, now when you offer a service.\n\n560\n00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,818\nIt's very difficult to offer\na service that has 100% uptime.\n\n561\n00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,960\nYou'll normally have\nmaintenance windows and\n\n562\n00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,580\nother things where you might\ntake the service offline but\n\n563\n00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,240\nyou've informed your customers,\nyou've informed your end-users.\n\n564\n00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240\nThey know that it's not going to\nbe available during that time.\n\n565\n00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,980\nThat's a planned service interruption.\n\n566\n00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,860\nThat's not an incident, but an unplanned\none, when anything happens that causes my\n\n567\n00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,380\nservice to not be available,\nthat's an incident, right?\n\n568\n00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,350\nWe need to deal with that.\n\n569\n00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,230\nWe don't know why it's not available, we\njust know that something has happened to\n\n570\n00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,520\nmake it unavailable, we generate\nan incident, and we start to work with it.\n\n571\n00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,760\n>> ITIL also calls out a degraded\nperformance report for functionality of\n\n572\n00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,330\nwhatever service that we are offering\n>> Sometimes this can actually happen\n\n573\n00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,960\nbecause of, well, things that we talked\nabout a little bit earlier in another\n\n574\n00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,340\nsegment of our show,\nit could be bad inclement weather,\n\n575\n00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,060\nit could be that that service center\nwhich you had your cloud backup,\n\n576\n00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,690\nis not functional, and now they're\nswitching you over to another one.\n\n577\n00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,210\nWhatever it might be,\nit degrades the performance, and\n\n578\n00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,420\nnow your customers are not getting\nthe level that they're expecting to see.\n\n579\n00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,470\n>> It could be as simple as your\n\n580\n00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,150\nproduct is now in higher\ndemand than it used to be.\n\n581\n00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,540\nYou got more people in your system and\n\n582\n00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,350\nthat's causing a greater\nload on the server.\n\n583\n00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,110\nAnd now,\nsome of your users aren't able to get in.\n\n584\n00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,670\nThose are all things that can lead\nto that degraded performance.\n\n585\n00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,070\nIn a way, that's kind of, a good thing.\n\n586\n00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,090\nWe hope we get so many customers.\n\n587\n00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,490\nBut it does generate an incident, right?\n\n588\n00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,350\nWe need to deal with that.\n\n589\n00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,610\nThe last one that ITIL specifically\ncalls out is the failure\n\n590\n00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,970\nof a configuration item.\n\n591\n00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,370\nSo one of your CIs, right?\n\n592\n00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,660\nSomething we can configure, a server,\nswitch, software application, whatever.\n\n593\n00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,950\nIt fails, has a problem, right?\n\n594\n00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,860\nMaybe failed hard drive,\nfailed power supply.\n\n595\n00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,940\nSome kind of memory corruption or\na memory leak in an application.\n\n596\n00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,160\nThese are things that can just\ncause it to outright fail.\n\n597\n00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,570\nAnd now we've got to address that.\n\n598\n00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,420\nBut don't limit yourself to these three,\nright.\n\n599\n00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,110\nThese are the three specific\nexamples that iTool gives, but\n\n600\n00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,910\nit could be any number of other things.\n\n601\n00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:10,585\nReally, anything that impacts the delivery\nof your service is an incident, right?\n\n602\n00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:14,105\nAnything that, it doesn't even have\nto affect your end user particularly,\n\n603\n00:29:14,105 --> 00:29:17,225\nit's just anything that affects\nthe delivery of that service.\n\n604\n00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:20,925\nThat's going to be our incident,\nand we need to handle it.\n\n605\n00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,465\n>> Remember that we still have this\ndistinction that we have to be able to\n\n606\n00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:29,070\nmake which is, we have to make sure that\nwe clearly identify what an incident is\n\n607\n00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,660\nversus what a problem is going to be.\n\n608\n00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,360\nSo in another segment we talked about, the\nway that we can easily be able to describe\n\n609\n00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,330\nit as the problem being from hell, like\na cold, a virus that's actually in your\n\n610\n00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,160\nsystem and then the symptoms,\nwhich that should be the incidences there.\n\n611\n00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,640\nRunny nose, watery eyes,\net cetera, that we have.\n\n612\n00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,700\nWe want to make sure that we\nclearly distinguish that.\n\n613\n00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,470\nSo Don, let's go over that again and\nmake sure that we have it clear.\n\n614\n00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,430\n>> Yeah, so we mentioned how\nan incident is caused by a problem,\n\n615\n00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,380\nthen a problem causes an incident, right.\n\n616\n00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,180\nThe only thing we didn't mention, and\nI guess I sort of did in that analogy of\n\n617\n00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:09,380\nthe fever and runny nose is that one\nproblem may cause more than one incident.\n\n618\n00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,700\nSo when you have a problem,\n\n619\n00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,050\nwhen there's a root cause to an issue\nthat's occurring in your environment.\n\n620\n00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,090\nThere could be well, you kind of expect\nto have several duplicate incidents.\n\n621\n00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,740\nMaybe, your email server is offline.\n\n622\n00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,350\nYou get a report from 15 different users\nall saying they can't access their email.\n\n623\n00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,110\nThat's really just one incident,\n\n624\n00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,810\neven though there's 15 reports of it,\nit's because the same, it's identical.\n\n625\n00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,390\nThey just can't log into their email.\n\n626\n00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,150\nRight.\n\n627\n00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,200\nBut while the email server is offline,\nthere might be other\n\n628\n00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,430\nthings that are affected too like maybe\nyour corporate directory stops working.\n\n629\n00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,690\nSo now you get some users reporting\nthey can't access their emails.\n\n630\n00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,420\nThere's incident one.\n\n631\n00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,080\nYou get other users reporting hey I\ncan't access the corporate directory.\n\n632\n00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,290\nThat's incident two.\n\n633\n00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,950\nOr, hey, the calendar on our company's\nwebpage is no longer rendering.\n\n634\n00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,100\nWell, maybe the calendar is hosted\nby whatever our email system is.\n\n635\n00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,540\nA lot of people do integrated\ncollaboration service.\n\n636\n00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,930\nThat's another incident.\n\n637\n00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,630\nThey're all linked back\nto the same problem.\n\n638\n00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,230\nNow the tricky thing to\nremember here is that\n\n639\n00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,900\nwe might not be able to\nidentify that right away.\n\n640\n00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,450\nThese might appear to be three\ncompletely independent incidents.\n\n641\n00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,770\nAnd under analyses we find out that\nthey're tied to the same problem.\n\n642\n00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,980\nBut just remember that an incident is\ntypically tied to just one problem,\n\n643\n00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,660\nversus a problem, that might be tied\nto many different incidents based on\n\n644\n00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,250\nwhat that problem is, right?\n\n645\n00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,820\nThe terminology's easy to\nconfuse we need to make sure,\n\n646\n00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,210\nwe've got that straight\nbefore sitting the exam.\n\n647\n00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,058\n>> We take a look then,\nat incident management.\n\n648\n00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,350\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nwhat the goal of incident management\n\n649\n00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,510\nreally is going to be about.\n\n650\n00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,150\nThere's several goals, but\nthe primary one is simple.\n\n651\n00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,020\nIs to make sure that we are back, up and\n\n652\n00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,740\nfunctioning according to the baselines\nthat we've set for our service.\n\n653\n00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,600\nSo that is really a primary goal.\n\n654\n00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200\n>> Yeah, and we just call that\nnormal service operation.\n\n655\n00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,410\nNormal service operation is how we\nexpect our system to be day to day.\n\n656\n00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,090\nOur service is running at this performance\nlevel according to this baseline meeting\n\n657\n00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,340\nthis SLA.\n\n658\n00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,500\nAnd if we're there, great.\n\n659\n00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,415\nBut if we deviate, well, incident\nmanagement is putting us back on track,\n\n660\n00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:09,200\ngetting us put back to that level.\n\n661\n00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,025\nAnd the tricky part is while\nthe incident is ongoing,\n\n662\n00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:17,070\nwe need to try to minimize\nthe impact if possible.\n\n663\n00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,020\nSo, we are really doing two things.\n\n664\n00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,400\nWe're, one is trying to\nget us back to normal.\n\n665\n00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,210\nBut if that's going to take awhile,\n\n666\n00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,720\nthen we're also trying to just keep\npeople working, while the problem exists.\n\n667\n00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,770\nSo you get split attentions, and\nthat can really be difficult because, when\n\n668\n00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,376\nyou first get reports of an incident, you\nkind of have to do like a time judgement.\n\n669\n00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:43,330\nAnd say okay well, if I had 2 hours I\ncould come up with a work around and\n\n670\n00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,550\nmy end users could then continue to\nwork even though this problem was there.\n\n671\n00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,650\nBut, I could also spend those two\nhours and just fix the problem and\n\n672\n00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,520\nnow everything's back to normal, right?\n\n673\n00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,650\nSo, you got to do a benefit analysis.\n\n674\n00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,360\nYou have to say, if I can do\na workaround in just 30 minutes, but\n\n675\n00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,260\nit's going to take me six\nhours to fix the problem.\n\n676\n00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,860\nI need to go ahead and do the workaround.\n\n677\n00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,420\nI need to get people operational again.\n\n678\n00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,000\nPart of incident management\nis making that decision.\n\n679\n00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,950\nThere's two primary activities\nthat come out of this.\n\n680\n00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,030\nResolving the problem and\nworking around or\n\n681\n00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,310\ncoming up with some mitigating the system\nto minimize the impact of that problem.\n\n682\n00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,980\n>> Whenever incidents begin to\nhappen within our own company,\n\n683\n00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,200\nwe always want to make sure we\nhave a clear communication for\n\n684\n00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,635\nthe customer to be able to tell\nus when an incident happens.\n\n685\n00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:32,525\n>> And we also want to make sure that,\nthat channel gives us the information\n\n686\n00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:35,685\nthat we need so that we can deal\nwith the instances as they come up.\n\n687\n00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:38,385\n>> Typically,\nthe first point of instant management\n\n688\n00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,591\ncomes under a concept that\nITIL calls a service desk.\n\n689\n00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:45,122\nAnd now service desk,\nthat's terminology that ITIL loves and\n\n690\n00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,422\noutside of ITIL you don't\nreally see that much.\n\n691\n00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:49,292\nMost people refer to it ask a help desk.\n\n692\n00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:54,386\nThe help desk is usually a group\nof IT trained personnel that will\n\n693\n00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:57,696\nanswer phones and emails for\nyour end users, be it your customers or\n\n694\n00:33:57,696 --> 00:34:00,526\nyour internal users,\nthat are reporting incidents back to you.\n\n695\n00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:03,286\nSo this is kind of that\nfirst line of defense.\n\n696\n00:34:03,286 --> 00:34:06,538\nWell, ITIL is all about\nservice management.\n\n697\n00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:08,868\nNot necessarily providing\nhelp to the end users.\n\n698\n00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:09,868\nAlthough, that's what we do.\n\n699\n00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:11,778\nWe don't want to say,\nwe don't help people.\n\n700\n00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:15,348\nBut we're really supporting the service,\nnot so much the end user.\n\n701\n00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:17,508\nThat's why they call it a service desk.\n\n702\n00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:21,764\nWhen an end user has any kind of issue,\nand this might be an incident or\n\n703\n00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,504\nit might be a request, right?\n\n704\n00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:27,424\nWe'll talk about request fulfillment\nlater where it's not an incident,\n\n705\n00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:29,704\nit's just something that needs to be done.\n\n706\n00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:33,320\nThey need a channel, a specific,\nsingle point of contact that they go to.\n\n707\n00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,680\nAnd that's what that service desk is.\n\n708\n00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,680\nNow, we'll find that inside of\nthe service desk, there can be all\n\n709\n00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,920\nkinds of complexities, multiple tiers and\nso on, we'll see that a little bit later.\n\n710\n00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,980\nBut as far as basic communication, that\nservice desk is starting point, right?\n\n711\n00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,650\nSo you've probably dealt with this before.\n\n712\n00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,280\nIf you ever had a problem with something,\nwhat did you do?\n\n713\n00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,840\nYou say well,\nlet me go find a phone number or\n\n714\n00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,390\nan email address that I can reach out to.\n\n715\n00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,430\nAnd you get the service desk.\n\n716\n00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,510\nThat's the person on the other line,\nor the email account that you email.\n\n717\n00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,280\nAnd it kicks off that process.\n\n718\n00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,120\nWhen you open up that request with them,\nwell,\n\n719\n00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,895\nyou just created an incident or\na request, right?\n\n720\n00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:10,940\nIt'll be one or the other, and sometimes\nit's up to the service desk to make\n\n721\n00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,300\nthat determination, to say,\nis this actually an incident?\n\n722\n00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,500\nWe need to deal with it right away, or\nis this just a request for something else,\n\n723\n00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,130\nand we can deal with it in time?\n\n724\n00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,990\nUsing ITProTV as an example, right,\n\n725\n00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,110\nyou can contact our service\ndesk several different ways.\n\n726\n00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:29,330\nWe've got a web form you can use,\nthere's an email address that you can use,\n\n727\n00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,520\nthere's a phone number, right, so\nthere's always different ways to contact.\n\n728\n00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,810\nRegardless of which method you use,\nyou get the same people.\n\n729\n00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:38,830\nIt goes into our support system and\nour people handle it.\n\n730\n00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,880\nIf it's an incident, if it's hey, your\nsite seems to be down, I can't get in.\n\n731\n00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,200\nThat's something urgent,\nwe need to get on that.\n\n732\n00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,680\nOr if its a request to\nupdate a credit card.\n\n733\n00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,800\nWell, that doesn't necessarily\nhave to be done today.\n\n734\n00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,340\nWhenever the next billing interval is,\nthat's when that would need to be handled.\n\n735\n00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,440\nSo the service desk is\nmaking that decision.\n\n736\n00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,732\nAnd figuring out where the routing of\nthis ticket, whose going to handle it,\n\n737\n00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,620\nthat all kind of gets\ngrouped inside there.\n\n738\n00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,910\n>> There are multiple\ndifferent ways that we can\n\n739\n00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,080\noffer the concept of a service desk too.\n\n740\n00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,400\nIn ITIL they specifically call out four.\n\n741\n00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,700\nOne's called a local service desk, and\n\n742\n00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,955\nanother one is centralized, virtual and\nthem my favorite terminology,\n\n743\n00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:22,880\nfollow-the-sun is the one\nthat we have here.\n\n744\n00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,870\nA local service desk is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n745\n00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,890\nIt's right there on premise where you are.\n\n746\n00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,705\n>> And you see local service desks\nwhen you have large organizations with\n\n747\n00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:33,080\nbranch offices all over.\n\n748\n00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,515\nAnd the service desk\nhas a representative or\n\n749\n00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:41,095\nan entire service desk physically\npresent at that location.\n\n750\n00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:43,082\nSo big organizations may need this.\n\n751\n00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:44,802\nMost organizations aren't\nof that size though.\n\n752\n00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,472\nOr at least aren't multi-national or\nwhatever.\n\n753\n00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:52,222\nAnd so in that scenario a centralized\nservice desk is a lot more efficient.\n\n754\n00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:52,912\nWith centralized,\n\n755\n00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:55,530\nyou say all right, I've got all of\nthese branch offices, that's great.\n\n756\n00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,960\nBut I'm just going to have one service\nthat's right here at headquarters.\n\n757\n00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,580\nI'm going to have all\nthe employees right here.\n\n758\n00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,440\nAnd when anybody has a problem at\na branch they can just call in\n\n759\n00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,910\nto the central office.\n\n760\n00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,840\nIt's easier to train employees.\n\n761\n00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,440\nIt's easier to monitor progress and handle\nthat with a centralized call center.\n\n762\n00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,690\nThan it is to have them all divided\nup amongst the various branches.\n\n763\n00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,770\nSo local service desks aren't\nthe most common in IT.\n\n764\n00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,140\nIn other industries, they are, right?\n\n765\n00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,470\nLook at any department store.\n\n766\n00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,160\nSo, when you walk into a department store,\nlike Target or Walmart or\n\n767\n00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,000\nKmart, when you walk in that front door,\nthere's a service desk.\n\n768\n00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,750\nAnd they normally call it a service desk,\nright?\n\n769\n00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,360\nOr customer service, or whatever.\n\n770\n00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,870\nAnd if you're returning something,\nyou walk right up to that desk and\n\n771\n00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,660\nthey help you.\n\n772\n00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,670\nThat's a local service desk.\n\n773\n00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,470\nBut if you wanted to complain about that\nstore, you'd call the headquarters, right?\n\n774\n00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,310\nAnd you'd get their centralized, well,\n\n775\n00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,570\nit's not necessarily centralized at that\npoint cause there are all the other ones.\n\n776\n00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,200\nBut you get this central service\ndesk that you're reaching out to.\n\n777\n00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,580\nSo, companies don't mix and match these,\nand it is pretty common outside of IT.\n\n778\n00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,970\nInside of IT though, we normally go\ncentralized, our outsourced, right?\n\n779\n00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> You always gotta remember that one.\n\n780\n00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,434\nSometimes you're just\noutsourcing someone else.\n\n781\n00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:02,272\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n782\n00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:04,680\n>> All right, so a virtual support or\n\n783\n00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,970\nservice desk is another option\n>> And\n\n784\n00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,630\nthis is kind of what we do with ITProTV,\nis each of the people who are manning\n\n785\n00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,290\nthe support desk, some of them\nare right here in the office with us.\n\n786\n00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,080\nI can see Nate over there,\nhe handles a lot of our support tickets.\n\n787\n00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,210\nBut Vivian, she does a ton of them and\n\n788\n00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:26,080\nshe comes into the office maybe,\nonce a week for just an hour or two.\n\n789\n00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,160\nMost of the time she's working from home.\n\n790\n00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,540\nSo that's a virtual service\nthat she's at home,\n\n791\n00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,670\nshe's got a VoIP phone that's\nsitting there on her desk,\n\n792\n00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,000\nand when somebody calls in with an issue\nshe can answer that phone and help them.\n\n793\n00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,500\nThe customer doesn't necessarily know\nwhere you are so it doesn't matter.\n\n794\n00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,430\nBut managing that virtual\nsupport service desk\n\n795\n00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,430\nis a little bit more challenging because\nyou don't have everybody together.\n\n796\n00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,610\nIf one person on that service desk\nlearns something new, it's harder for\n\n797\n00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,600\nthem to share it with\nthe rest of the team.\n\n798\n00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,120\nAnd that's when we get back to our\nknowledge management systems, right?\n\n799\n00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,993\nThat we need to have some kind of way of\nsharing information between the users.\n\n800\n00:38:58,993 --> 00:39:04,001\n>> The follow-the-sun service desk\nconcept is, it's not really about\n\n801\n00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:09,940\nwhere the services are located, as much as\nabout how often we can get access to them.\n\n802\n00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,565\nSo when you hear about things\nlike 24-hour-a-day service,\n\n803\n00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:16,049\nwhere they're following the sun across the\nglobe, being able to offer support then,\n\n804\n00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,470\nthat's what they're really referring to.\n\n805\n00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,900\nYeah, I mean,\nwe'll keep running with us as an example.\n\n806\n00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,540\nSo we have customers all over the world.\n\n807\n00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,830\nI think 75 percent of our customers\nare right here in the United States.\n\n808\n00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,370\nThe other, actually I think it's 26% now,\nso I, oh well whatever.\n\n809\n00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,560\nBut about a quarter of our users\nare spread across the world.\n\n810\n00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,990\nWe have people as far away\nas Australia and China.\n\n811\n00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,050\nWe have much closer like Canada and\nMexico.\n\n812\n00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,300\nBut we have people all over the globe.\n\n813\n00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,990\nSo we're open.\n\n814\n00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,840\nOur official business hours\nare from 8 am to 5 pm.\n\n815\n00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,820\nMonday through Friday U.S. Eastern.\n\n816\n00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,130\nWell, for us that's a business day.\n\n817\n00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,100\nThat's when the sun is up and\nbusinesses are open.\n\n818\n00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,627\nBut if you're in Australia that means\nwe're open in the middle of the night for\n\n819\n00:39:57,627 --> 00:40:00,630\nyou guys and we're closed in\nthe middle of the day when you're up.\n\n820\n00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,443\nSo it doesn't make sense to have a service\ndesk that's just bound to our hours\n\n821\n00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:09,380\nwhen you're in a multinational or\nglobal type organization.\n\n822\n00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:14,220\nSo you need staff people and it could\nbe that we staff people in that area.\n\n823\n00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,430\nMaybe I create a Service Desk in Australia\nto service the Australians during their\n\n824\n00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,440\nappropriate time, or more likely I just\nhire people here for different shifts.\n\n825\n00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,460\nSo I might have a morning shift,\nan afternoon evening shift, and\n\n826\n00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,520\nan overnight shift.\n\n827\n00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,280\nAnd some people work from, what was it\nnormally, it was like four to midnight.\n\n828\n00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,930\nMidnight to eight and then eight to four.\n\n829\n00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,140\nI think those are the three\nshifts you see really common.\n\n830\n00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,070\nBut basically where you have\npeople covering just the whole\n\n831\n00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:46,250\nschedule throughout the whole day,\nso that someone is always available.\n\n832\n00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,560\nAgain, that can be just as challenging as\na virtual team or virtual service desk\n\n833\n00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,310\nbecause it's not like everybody's\nthere together at the same time.\n\n834\n00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,700\nPeople are into different shifts.\n\n835\n00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,240\nYou'll have employees that\nhave never met each other, but\n\n836\n00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,810\nthey're all doing the same job.\n\n837\n00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,416\nSo they could benefit by\nexchanging information.\n\n838\n00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:06,630\nAll right, so those are some of the things\nthat we need to be aware of on the instant\n\n839\n00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,445\nmanagement side.\n\n840\n00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:12,344\nSo what an incident is, how we handle it,\nwhat that Service Desk is.\n\n841\n00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:17,553\nNow, after that, we need to make sure\nwe understand how a service ticket or\n\n842\n00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:20,560\nan incident is handled, right?\n\n843\n00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,880\nWhen you receive an incident,\n\n844\n00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,370\nwhen you get that first call in\nfrom a user, what do you do?\n\n845\n00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,920\nWhat's the process that we go through?\n\n846\n00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,600\nAt the end of the day,\n\n847\n00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,380\nit's entirely up to your organization\nhow you want to handle it.\n\n848\n00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,700\nBut ITIL has a series of recommended\nsteps that you go through.\n\n849\n00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,490\nAnd what you'll find is that in real life\nland, you'll take some of these steps and\n\n850\n00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,510\ncombine them, but for clarity I took and\nsplit them all out, so\n\n851\n00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,820\nthis is going to seem like a lot of steps.\n\n852\n00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,560\nAnd in fact I don't\nremember how many it is.\n\n853\n00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,952\nSix, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n854\n00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:53,900\nSo ten steps to resolving an incident and\nthat's probably overkill for most\n\n855\n00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,980\norganizations, so you may want to adjust\nthis a bit, but kinda laying it out.\n\n856\n00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,020\nWe're gonna walk through\nall of the different steps.\n\n857\n00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,390\nAnd the first part begins,\ntypically, at the Service Desk.\n\n858\n00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,510\nNot always, but\nusually at the Service Desk.\n\n859\n00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,380\nAnd that's incident identification.\n\n860\n00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,040\nWhen it comes to incident management,\n\n861\n00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,970\nstep one is recognizing\nthat an incident occurred.\n\n862\n00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,900\nHow do we even know that happened?\n\n863\n00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,570\nWe need to be aware that\nthe incident is there.\n\n864\n00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,265\nNow, it can happen\nthrough the Service Desk.\n\n865\n00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:29,180\nAnd user detects the issue, calls it in,\nand that kicks off the instance, right.\n\n866\n00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,450\nNow that's fine.\n\n867\n00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,620\nIt's perfectly acceptable for\nmost organizations, but wouldn't it be\n\n868\n00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,980\nbetter if you could spot that stuff\nbefore your users were impacted?\n\n869\n00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,600\nThat's where we're going to\nget our best level of service.\n\n870\n00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,940\nThat's where we bring\nin not just monitoring,\n\n871\n00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,650\nbut actually tracking of events,\ntracking our system so\n\n872\n00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,890\nthat we can locate the problem and get it\nresolved before an end user reports it.\n\n873\n00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,400\nOr get it at least to where when\nthe end user calls in you can say,\n\n874\n00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,340\nyep we're aware of it.\n\n875\n00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,050\nOur guys are working on it right now.\n\n876\n00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,530\nWe've got an ETA of 30 minutes on a fix.\n\n877\n00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,940\nSo that way you've got something\nto communicate to the customer.\n\n878\n00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,910\nSo that's really important.\n\n879\n00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:06,310\nWe just need to be aware\nthe incident occurred.\n\n880\n00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,300\n>> We also need to do one\ncall incident logging.\n\n881\n00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,810\nIncident logging is recording when\nthe incident is first reported.\n\n882\n00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,380\nIn that way we know if we\nget multiple instances.\n\n883\n00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,570\nWhen and how often they're occurring.\n\n884\n00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:22,420\nThat way, we can actually assign\nthe appropriate resources when necessary.\n\n885\n00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,550\n>> That is a key piece of\nlogging this information.\n\n886\n00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:28,330\nIt doesn't really help us here.\n\n887\n00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,470\nI guess it sort of does.\n\n888\n00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,780\nIf you're using software.\n\n889\n00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,490\nIf you have service management software,\nthen this is a support ticket, right?\n\n890\n00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,110\nAnd you need to be able to track\nwhat support tickets are open and\n\n891\n00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,340\nwhich ones are closed, you need some\nkind of software to manage that.\n\n892\n00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,657\nSo we're normally going to do this.\n\n893\n00:43:41,657 --> 00:43:46,824\nBut it's got a second benefit, which is\nin CSI, in continual service improvement,\n\n894\n00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:51,773\nwhen we revisit this, one of the things,\nI've done this at a lot of companies that\n\n895\n00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:56,217\nI've worked for, is at the end of\nthe year, you take a look at the last 12\n\n896\n00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:00,581\nmonths, and you say, okay,\nwhat was the most common support ticket?\n\n897\n00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:02,020\nWhat was the most common incident?\n\n898\n00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,420\nWhat happened to the most?\n\n899\n00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,450\nWhat can we do to fix that?\n\n900\n00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,290\nWhat came in second place?\n\n901\n00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,940\nAnd then you take steps to correct that,\nto minimize it.\n\n902\n00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,260\nThis was a service ticket\nthat came in a lot.\n\n903\n00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,964\nNow we eliminate.\n\n904\n00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:20,410\nSo for example I worked in an insurance\ncompany and we found that one of the main\n\n905\n00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,150\nservice tickets that we were getting, was\npeople would call into the Help Desk and\n\n906\n00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,250\nsay I'm getting pop ups in my web browser\nand my computer's running really slow and\n\n907\n00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,960\nthe technician would then spend 30, 45\nminutes, even an hour troubleshooting and\n\n908\n00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,160\ncleaning Malware off of people's machines,\nor we had this time limit.\n\n909\n00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,080\nWe said basically if you can\nfix it in 30 minutes great,\n\n910\n00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,880\nif not we send them a new computer.\n\n911\n00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,070\nAnd so we would send them\na replacement computer and\n\n912\n00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,420\nthey'd send the old one back to us.\n\n913\n00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,640\nWe'd just swap it out, it was faster\nthan dealing with troubleshooting.\n\n914\n00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,200\nSo that's what would happen and\nthat was happening a lot.\n\n915\n00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,220\nAnd so we said, you know what?\n\n916\n00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,050\nThis has happened enough, that it would\nbe worthwhile for us to invest in\n\n917\n00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,960\nsome web filtering software, and\nwe brought in a software package called\n\n918\n00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,330\nWebsense that would filter people's\naccess to block access to the Malware.\n\n919\n00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,830\nNot like antivirus software,\nwe already had that and\n\n920\n00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:11,370\nit obviously wasn't working that great,\nbut this\n\n921\n00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:15,770\nwould just start people from even getting\nto the sites that offer that software.\n\n922\n00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,400\nThe software wasn't inexpensive,\n\n923\n00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,810\nI think Websense ended up costing\nus somewhere around 30 grand.\n\n924\n00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:23,550\nBut if you total up all the service\ntickets we got in the time spent,\n\n925\n00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,700\nit was more than that.\n\n926\n00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,190\nSo it made sense to fix it.\n\n927\n00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,900\nAnd then the next year we had a different\none that was the number one problem,\n\n928\n00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,010\nit was forgotten passwords.\n\n929\n00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,040\nBut for that first year it was Malware,\n\n930\n00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,560\nso that's a real benefit if\nwe've been logging our instance.\n\n931\n00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,150\nKeeping track of what has happened.\n\n932\n00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,880\nYou're going to need to do it anyways, so\n\n933\n00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,320\nyou need to make sure\nyou don't forget people.\n\n934\n00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,280\nYou might have started helping somebody\non an incident and then got distracted,\n\n935\n00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,340\nmoved off and then you never visit back to\nthat person, and that person is sitting\n\n936\n00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,570\nthere waiting on a response, they're\ngoing to be unhappy, well probably.\n\n937\n00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,280\n>> We can also take a look at\ninstant categorization too.\n\n938\n00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,220\nInstant categorization allows\nus to be able to apply a label\n\n939\n00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,200\nto whatever instances that\nwe're actually dealing with.\n\n940\n00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,090\nAnd maybe make sure that we can\nassign those to the appropriate\n\n941\n00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,480\nteam that we need to so that they can\ndeal with it more specifically that has\n\n942\n00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,390\nmore expertise than we might have.\n\n943\n00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,450\nSo applying the labels is\na really good part of what we do.\n\n944\n00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,640\n>> This is another one that helps out\nwhen it comes time for CSI to kick in.\n\n945\n00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,970\nSo we're really supporting\nanother service area here.\n\n946\n00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,660\nBut by labeling them, categorizing them,\nbreaking them up into little compartments,\n\n947\n00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,860\nthat makes it easy to identify\nthose primary sources.\n\n948\n00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,620\nAnd so you might notice a trend that\n\n949\n00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,050\nyou're getting more incidents on\nthis particular category of ticket.\n\n950\n00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,450\nSo you might have tickets\nrelated to your website,\n\n951\n00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,430\ntickets related to your file servers,\nand so on.\n\n952\n00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,070\nAnd you use labels to track that,\nor other things,\n\n953\n00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,940\nwe'll see that there's prioritization\nalso, which is what people think of\n\n954\n00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,750\na lot of times when they think of labels,\nbut your labels can be whatever you want.\n\n955\n00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,580\nThey can be the source of the incident.\n\n956\n00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,130\nNot the actual cause of the incident but\nwho reported it.\n\n957\n00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,420\nSo maybe you see an elevated\nlevel of incidents coming from\n\n958\n00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,210\nthe sales department and\nless coming from the marketing department.\n\n959\n00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,220\nNow, why is that?\n\n960\n00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,480\nIs the marketing software more stable?\n\n961\n00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,870\nOr are the salespeople not doing basic\ntroubleshooting on there own and\n\n962\n00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,580\njust jumping in and\ncalling the Help Desk right away.\n\n963\n00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,180\nMaybe we need to do a little more training\nwith the employees to make them aware of\n\n964\n00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,880\nbasic troubleshooting steps so that they\ndon't have to call up the service desk\n\n965\n00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,170\nevery time they have an issue.\n\n966\n00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,720\nThese are things we can address\nif we have some basic data apply.\n\n967\n00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,210\nNow if you've done good logging\nyou can always come back and\n\n968\n00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,810\napply these labels later.\n\n969\n00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,690\nIt can be really hard\nto categorize a ticket\n\n970\n00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,230\nif you don't know what the problem is yet.\n\n971\n00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,030\nIf you don't know the systems\nthat are affected.\n\n972\n00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,360\nIf you don't know what's going on.\n\n973\n00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,310\nSo when you first get that incident,\nyou can definitely log it.\n\n974\n00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,340\nBut the categorization may be really hard.\n\n975\n00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,420\nThis might be one of those\nsteps you come back to later.\n\n976\n00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,260\nWe'll see in my show notes that\nwe'll post with the episode.\n\n977\n00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,760\nWhen I listed these steps,\nI didn't put a number on each step.\n\n978\n00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,380\nI didn't say instant\ncategorization is step three.\n\n979\n00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,358\nAnd the reason I did is because you don't\nknow necessarily when it's going to occur,\n\n980\n00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,130\nand you'll come back to some of these\nsteps over and over and over again, right?\n\n981\n00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,460\nLike the logging we're going to come back\nand update that when we have a resolution\n\n982\n00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,220\nthat's going to go in the log too,\nso we'll revisit some of these.\n\n983\n00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:17,620\nSo it's not necessarily chronological,\nnot necessarily happening in order.\n\n984\n00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,620\nAll right, what's next?\n\n985\n00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,360\nOh, prioritization.\n\n986\n00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,950\n>> When we talk about prioritization,\nit's exactly like it sounds,\n\n987\n00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:25,880\nbeing able to assign\na priority to an incident so\n\n988\n00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,900\nthat way it can be addressed for\nthe handling that we need.\n\n989\n00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,830\nA lot of times when we hear about\nthe initial help that we get, they may not\n\n990\n00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,510\nhave all the knowledge that we need so we\nmight actually have to assign it a higher\n\n991\n00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,922\npriority or another one so that way\nit can be escalated when necessary.\n\n992\n00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:43,470\nUsually the prioritization\nis based on two factors.\n\n993\n00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,320\nOne is what we call urgency and\nthe other one is what we call impact.\n\n994\n00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:53,640\n>> So impact, that's what's gonna\nbe dictating how much of our\n\n995\n00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,185\nregular business processes are basically\nbeing interrupted or affected.\n\n996\n00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,435\nBecause they might not be interrupted,\nthey might just be slow.\n\n997\n00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:01,705\nSo how big of a deal is this?\n\n998\n00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:06,405\nIs this incident just affecting one user,\nor is it affecting all of our users?\n\n999\n00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:09,870\nAre they still able to work, or are they\njust sitting there twiddling their thumbs\n\n1000\n00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,180\nuntil this problem is resolved?\n\n1001\n00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,290\nWe need to know how this is impacting\nour company, who it's affecting.\n\n1002\n00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,882\nAnd then urgency, that's how long\nthis is going to be impacting.\n\n1003\n00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:24,870\nSo, sorry,\nit's the time until the impact occurs.\n\n1004\n00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:30,250\nIf we're doing proactive event detection,\nif we're looking for these alerts\n\n1005\n00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,390\nwe might be able to see the problem\nbefore the impact has actually happened.\n\n1006\n00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,890\nAnd so we know what timer is ticking.\n\n1007\n00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,430\nAnd we're saying, all right this is\nthe amount of time we've got to fix this\n\n1008\n00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:43,270\nbefore our end users get affected,\nor before we violate our SLA.\n\n1009\n00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,710\nYou might have an SLA that says\nyou could be down for 2 hours.\n\n1010\n00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,540\nWell you just went down.\n\n1011\n00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,170\nOkay you've got two hours\nto fix the problem.\n\n1012\n00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,750\nVersus something else that you might\nhave 24 hours to fix the problem.\n\n1013\n00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,860\nSo if you've only got 2 hours,\nthat's pretty high priority, but\n\n1014\n00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,820\nif you've got 24 hours it might\nbe a little bit lower priority.\n\n1015\n00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,188\nYou can work on some other stuff and\ncome back to this later.\n\n1016\n00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:05,345\nWe need to know how much time we have\nto get a solution in place and in ITIL,\n\n1017\n00:50:05,345 --> 00:50:10,099\nthey always define it as the time\nyou have until the impact occurs.\n\n1018\n00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:11,043\nBut a lot of us, and\n\n1019\n00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:15,055\nit's the mistake I made right there at\nthe beginning of my sentence a minute ago,\n\n1020\n00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:18,596\nwas a lot of us measure it the time\nuntil the impact becomes unbearable.\n\n1021\n00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:22,839\nBecause impact doesn't normally kick in\njust all at once, it kind of phases up and\n\n1022\n00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:24,770\ngets worse and worse and worse.\n\n1023\n00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,040\nAnd so the urgency that time frame might\nactually span a little bit past where\n\n1024\n00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,470\nthe impact has started in real life,\nbut in ITIL's definition,\n\n1025\n00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,650\nthey always start at right\nwhen the impact starts.\n\n1026\n00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,750\nSo how much time do we have to get on it?\n\n1027\n00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,820\nSo impact and urgency, those are what's\ngoing to determine our prioritization,\n\n1028\n00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,660\nand for the priority,\nyou make it up yourself.\n\n1029\n00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:44,770\nYou can pick whatever you wanna call it.\n\n1030\n00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:47,420\nYou might say I've got high,\nnormal, and low.\n\n1031\n00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,054\nHigh priority, normal priority,\nlower priority, but\n\n1032\n00:50:50,054 --> 00:50:53,930\nthere's plenty of other naming\nconventions that are out there.\n\n1033\n00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:58,500\nOne of the ones that I always see,\nsome people don't like high, normal,\n\n1034\n00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,030\nlow because how do you feel\nif you submit an incident and\n\n1035\n00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,350\nthen you see that they\nlabeled it as low priority.\n\n1036\n00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,770\nAnd you're looking at and you're like,\nthis is my problem, it's affecting me,\n\n1037\n00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,580\nI'm really passionate about this and\nyou're calling it low priority?\n\n1038\n00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,150\nPeople get frustrated.\n\n1039\n00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,780\nSo many companies have moved\naway from that terminology and\n\n1040\n00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,450\nso like the last organization\nthat I worked for did.\n\n1041\n00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,030\nSev one, sev two, sev three.\n\n1042\n00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:22,840\nSo it's severity one,\nseverity two, severity three.\n\n1043\n00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,990\nAnd if anybody asked and they said,\nwhy is my ticket flagged as sev3?\n\n1044\n00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,500\nWhat does that mean?\n\n1045\n00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,360\nAnd we would say,\nwell that's severity three.\n\n1046\n00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,460\nSo in their minds they would say,\nwell all right, it's severe.\n\n1047\n00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,120\nThey know this is a problem.\n\n1048\n00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,400\nSevere.\n\n1049\n00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,840\nThey wouldn't know that 3 was\nour lowest priority, right?\n\n1050\n00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,300\nBut we could say, if they inquire more,\nwell, SEV 1, that's a big deal, that's\n\n1051\n00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,360\nlike building on fire, or the entire\nsystem is down and that's a big deal.\n\n1052\n00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:54,140\nYours is sev 3, it's pretty close to\nsev 1 but it's on a smaller scale and\n\n1053\n00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,820\npeople would understand.\n\n1054\n00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,270\nIt gave people a more warm, fuzzy feeling.\n\n1055\n00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,560\nIt's entirely up to you what\nterminology you wanna use there, but\n\n1056\n00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,970\nthe way we assign\nthe priority is the same.\n\n1057\n00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,670\nHow big that impact is, and\nhow much time that urgency\n\n1058\n00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,930\nthat we've gotta exercise to\nget that system back online.\n\n1059\n00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,940\nIf we're losing money right now\nour urgency is already zero.\n\n1060\n00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,360\nWe need to get going right now.\n\n1061\n00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,830\nWe can't wait, right?\n\n1062\n00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,760\nBut if the impact hasn't kicked in yet,\n\n1063\n00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,490\nwe might be able to wait a bit\nbefore we address this problem.\n\n1064\n00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,540\nSo, it comes down to that one.\n\n1065\n00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,260\nThe expiring credit card\nexample I gave earlier.\n\n1066\n00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,260\nIf a customer of ITProTV\nreaches out to us and says,\n\n1067\n00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,280\nhey, my credit card's gonna expire\nin 30 days, can I change it?\n\n1068\n00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,310\nWell we got thirty days to deal with that,\non day 30 it'll try and recharge\n\n1069\n00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:42,030\nthat card or whatever and the card'll be\nexpired, now we got a problem, right?\n\n1070\n00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,860\nSo the impact is way off, this is not\nvery urgent, we can get to it whenever.\n\n1071\n00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,560\nNow, we do try and\n\n1072\n00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,810\naddress stuff like that very quickly, but\nbecause we want to not because we have to.\n\n1073\n00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,405\nAnd that's really what prioritization\ncomes down to is what you have to do.\n\n1074\n00:52:56,165 --> 00:52:58,215\nAll right, well Ronnie, let's stop here.\n\n1075\n00:52:58,215 --> 00:53:00,745\nWe've got a lot more steps to get through,\nwe've only gone through, what,\n\n1076\n00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,125\nthat's like the first three or four.\n\n1077\n00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:02,995\n>> First four.\n\n1078\n00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:05,905\n>> So we've only made it, well,\nnot even halfway through our steps.\n\n1079\n00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:08,295\nWe've got a lot more to get through,\nso stay tuned.\n\n1080\n00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:11,895\nWe'll be back after this with the\nremainder of our incident reporting steps.\n\n1081\n00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:15,638\n[MUSIC]\n\n1082\n00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:20,875\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1083\n00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:26,170\nSo we have kicked off our incident process\nand we've learned about our incident.\n\n1084\n00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,770\nWe detected it or\nreceived information about it.\n\n1085\n00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:33,160\nWe've logged it, We've categorized it.\n\n1086\n00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,610\nWe probably need to take some\nactual action at this point.\n\n1087\n00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,990\nAll of the stuff that we have done so far\nIt has really just been kind of paperwork,\n\n1088\n00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,960\nkind of getting it into the system.\n\n1089\n00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,170\nNow we need to really\ndo something about it.\n\n1090\n00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:44,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n1091\n00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,820\nWith the information that we now have,\nit now bears on responsibility to\n\n1092\n00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,760\nthat service desk to really do what we\ncall initial diagnostic, or diagnosis.\n\n1093\n00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,460\nI said it wrong again,\nsee I told you I was gonna say that.\n\n1094\n00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,990\nInitial diagnosis.\n\n1095\n00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:03,370\nThe initial diagnosis may go ahead and\nresolve the issue right then so\n\n1096\n00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,170\nwe don't have to move it on any further,\nbut it may not and\n\n1097\n00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:11,560\nif it doesn't, what we're trying to do\nis get as much information as we can.\n\n1098\n00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,550\nSo that we now have a nice detailed report\nabout what the incident actually is,\n\n1099\n00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:19,445\nthat we may end up escalating\na little bit later.\n\n1100\n00:54:19,445 --> 00:54:23,010\n>> Yeah now sometimes\nthe initial diagnosis,\n\n1101\n00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,640\nit may or\nmay not actually work towards a solution.\n\n1102\n00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,920\nI don't know if you guys have ever had\none of those environments where you call.\n\n1103\n00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,510\nI get this with our\npediatrician all the time.\n\n1104\n00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:37,040\nIf I call them and ask them questions\nabout you know, my son might be sick.\n\n1105\n00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,990\nAnd they say all right,\nwell can you give me the symptoms and\n\n1106\n00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:39,750\ndescribe all this stuff.\n\n1107\n00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,410\nAnd I describe everything and they say,\n\n1108\n00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,160\nokay we'll have a nurse call\nyou back here in a few minutes.\n\n1109\n00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,350\nSo that initial diagnosis wasn't\nactually working towards a solution.\n\n1110\n00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,270\nThey were gathering the data to\nthen hand off to somebody else.\n\n1111\n00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,480\nThat happens and\n\n1112\n00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,880\nin that scenario your service desk is not\nactually working to resolve the incidents.\n\n1113\n00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,990\nBut in IT it's common practice\nto at least give some\n\n1114\n00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:01,840\nbasic training to the people that\nare working that call center or\n\n1115\n00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,670\nanswering that e-mail,\nto be able to do not just a confirmation.\n\n1116\n00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,950\nYes we've got your report,\nwe're working on it, but\n\n1117\n00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:13,470\nto also do some basic troubleshooting and\nexercise certain steps that\n\n1118\n00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,560\nmay resolve the incident without\ngetting anybody else involved.\n\n1119\n00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,230\nSo this potentially could be the last\nstep in our troubleshooting if it's\n\n1120\n00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,310\na simple one.\n\n1121\n00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:25,040\nThis is where we start to see\nthings like service scripts appear.\n\n1122\n00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,180\nAnd a script is really just a flow chart,\nor\n\n1123\n00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,920\na documented piece of paper that says\nwhat we do for our basic troubleshooting.\n\n1124\n00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,650\nAnd I'm sure we've all experienced this,\n\n1125\n00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,620\nwhere you can tell the person on the other\nphone is just reading out of a book.\n\n1126\n00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,720\nAnd you're saying well, Ronnie,\nyou mentioned it, with your screen.\n\n1127\n00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> When the screen was cracked, and\n\n1128\n00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,990\nthe guy was telling to send a screenshot,\nright?\n\n1129\n00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,580\n>> Yeah.\n\n1130\n00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,580\n>> And to us, it's ridiculous.\n\n1131\n00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,800\nWe're like the physical screen is cracked,\nwhat do you want me to do?\n\n1132\n00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,380\nBut they're just looking\nat this flowchart, and\n\n1133\n00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,050\nthe flowchart says,\nrequest a screenshot from the customer.\n\n1134\n00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,950\nAnd so they're just doing\nwhat they've been told, but\n\n1135\n00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,207\nthey may not actually have any training or\neven understand what the steps are, but\n\n1136\n00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:05,214\nthey're hoping that at least thins out\na few calls before moving up to someone\n\n1137\n00:56:05,214 --> 00:56:06,960\nelse who can actually interact.\n\n1138\n00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,710\n>> Moving up to that next level is\nwhat we call the term escalation.\n\n1139\n00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,858\nEscalation is when that initial\ndiagnosis doesn't really help and\n\n1140\n00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:17,057\nwe now have to actually move it up to\nsomebody that has a little bit more\n\n1141\n00:56:17,057 --> 00:56:19,310\ntechnical expertise in\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n1142\n00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,490\nAnd that way they can help\nresolve the issue as well.\n\n1143\n00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,520\n>> Yeah most organizations will typically\nmaintain what's called a support hierarchy\n\n1144\n00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,420\nand that means you got different levels of\ntechnicians throughout your organization.\n\n1145\n00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,530\nAnd as that incident is reported into\nthe service desk if they can't resolve it,\n\n1146\n00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,940\nit then follows a certain\nchain of command, or\n\n1147\n00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,670\na flow chart is normally what we have\nthat kind of documents that process.\n\n1148\n00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,810\nThe larger your organization is,\nthe more levels you might have, but\n\n1149\n00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,930\neven in a small organization you'll\ntypically have a good two or\n\n1150\n00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:51,590\neven three levels of support person.\n\n1151\n00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:55,290\nNow, your highest level people, you\ndon't want them answering the phone and\n\n1152\n00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,670\ndealing with things\nlike password requests.\n\n1153\n00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,650\nYou want the people with expertise\nworking on the hard problems.\n\n1154\n00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,790\nSo the reason we have these tiers\nis to kind of thin the herd, thin\n\n1155\n00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:09,180\nout the tickets so that only the really\ndifficult ones make it to the top level.\n\n1156\n00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,370\nOne of my early mentors\nin IT had this saying,\n\n1157\n00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:16,290\nhe said let the brain\nsurgeons do brain surgery.\n\n1158\n00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:18,500\nIf you were to meet a brain surgeon,\n\n1159\n00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,180\nthey went through some of the most\ndifficult medical school possible.\n\n1160\n00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,600\nAnd I bet, they could stitch up a cut if\nI got one on my hand, I bet they could do\n\n1161\n00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,340\nthat no problem, but their time would\nbe better served doing brain surgery.\n\n1162\n00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,220\nYou know, something that they can\ndo that not many other people can.\n\n1163\n00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,575\nSo, that's how we need to treat\nare experts inside of IT.\n\n1164\n00:57:37,575 --> 00:57:41,485\nIf you have somebody who's a brilliant\nnetwork engineer, they should not\n\n1165\n00:57:41,485 --> 00:57:45,875\nbe finding out why flash videos aren't\nplaying in somebody's web browser right?\n\n1166\n00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:47,645\nThey should be working\non the actual network.\n\n1167\n00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:51,970\nSo when you set up that hierarchy,\nit can be divided any number of ways but\n\n1168\n00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:55,720\nit's putting the expertise\naway from that initial call.\n\n1169\n00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,400\nSo a great example of that,\nthe bank that I work for,\n\n1170\n00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,280\nwe had really three tiers of\nsupport that we dealt with.\n\n1171\n00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,890\nSo the first tier, that was the service\ndesk that was the people that got called\n\n1172\n00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,080\nand they're the ones who had scripts and\nhelped people.\n\n1173\n00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:13,690\nOur service desk guys were actually\nreally well trained and intelligent, and\n\n1174\n00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,570\nthey were able to resolve\nproblems very quickly.\n\n1175\n00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,010\nIf it didn't get resolved,\nthen it went up to tier two,\n\n1176\n00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,080\nwhich was our desktop support.\n\n1177\n00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,045\nNow our desktop support people,\nthey didn't work on servers.\n\n1178\n00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:26,155\nThey just worked on work stations.\n\n1179\n00:58:26,155 --> 00:58:31,365\nSo those problems with applications and\nindividual machines, they diagnosed that.\n\n1180\n00:58:31,365 --> 00:58:34,730\nThey were able to solve a problem that\nwas just happening on a single computer.\n\n1181\n00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,760\nBut if they identify that the problem\nwasn't on the end user's side,\n\n1182\n00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,560\nif the problem was on the servers,\nthen it went up to the third tier.\n\n1183\n00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,100\nAnd the third tier, that's where the\nsystem admin and network admin teams were.\n\n1184\n00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,510\nThat's where I worked.\n\n1185\n00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,830\nSo for me,\n\n1186\n00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,080\nwhenever I got a ticket, it had already\nbeen sifted through these other tiers.\n\n1187\n00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,320\nI knew it wasn't an easy problem,\nbecause it made it past tier one.\n\n1188\n00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,560\nAnd I knew it wasn't a problem on the\nuser's end cuz it made it past tier two.\n\n1189\n00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,460\nSo, by the time it got\nto me I already knew\n\n1190\n00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,250\nthis was gonna be a problem on the\nnetwork, or a problem on the servers and\n\n1191\n00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,480\nthat's where I need to focus\nmy efforts for isolating.\n\n1192\n00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,930\nThat's the whole point of\nhaving a tiered hierarchy.\n\n1193\n00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,150\nAnd you might have many, many, many\nmore divisions in your environment just\n\n1194\n00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,890\ndepending on your organization but\nthat's a part of incident escalation.\n\n1195\n00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:22,500\nPeople need to know who's that\nnext step and what are the rules\n\n1196\n00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,140\nthat I need to make sure I've ticked\noff before I move up to that next tier.\n\n1197\n00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,670\nBecause we don't want people\njust passing a ticket along so\n\n1198\n00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,710\nthey don't have to deal with it.\n\n1199\n00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:33,470\nThere's gotta be a set of criteria\nthat qualifies that movement.\n\n1200\n00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,800\n>> At every level in that service\nhierarchy we're also gonna end up seeing\n\n1201\n00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,740\nthat there's gonna be\nsome investigation and\n\n1202\n00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,710\nsome more diagnostics\nthat need to take place.\n\n1203\n00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:47,820\nSo normally what we have is that every\nlevels gonna have to do their fair share\n\n1204\n00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,460\nwhen they get to that point so\n\n1205\n00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,370\nthat they recommend a solution\nthat's going to be implemented.\n\n1206\n00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:56,720\n>> And you never want the customer to have\nto go through something more than once.\n\n1207\n00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,050\nI've had that happen a ton of\ntimes where I call support and\n\n1208\n01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,730\nI explain my problem to one person and\nthey try and help me and\n\n1209\n01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:07,150\nit doesn't work and they escalate me and\nI get a new person who has no back story.\n\n1210\n01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,650\nAnd they say,\nokay can you describe your problem?\n\n1211\n01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:12,300\nAnd to me as the end user,\nI have to start all over again,\n\n1212\n01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,870\nand that's really frustrating.\n\n1213\n01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:18,060\nIf you have a ticketing system, that\nlogging system I mentioned earlier, well,\n\n1214\n01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,610\nat each tier people should be logging\nwhat's been done so that when it gets\n\n1215\n01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:26,180\nescalated, the next person in line can\njust read the log and say, okay well I can\n\n1216\n01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:31,360\nsee we're working with Sarah at the help\ndesk and she checked these things and\n\n1217\n01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,950\nI just wanna go a little bit beyond that\nand check some of these additional things.\n\n1218\n01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,040\nWould you mind taking a look at it for me?\n\n1219\n01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,430\nAnd so now, the end user, they\nunderstand and they appreciate that you\n\n1220\n01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,210\nare taking account the work they've\nalready done but it also saves you time.\n\n1221\n01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,560\nThere's no point in redoing something that\nSara at the help desk has already done\n\n1222\n01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,270\nif you can just read, and\nshe's not lying, probably not lying.\n\n1223\n01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,220\nSo you can skip past that and\nmove to the more advanced things.\n\n1224\n01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,330\nThat's all a part of that\ninvestigation and diagnosis.\n\n1225\n01:00:56,330 --> 01:01:00,320\nNow at this stage, we're not just\nfollowing a flowchart anymore, right?\n\n1226\n01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,360\nNow, we're applying some level of\nexpertise to try and isolate and\n\n1227\n01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,980\ndetermine a solution, right?\n\n1228\n01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,550\nWhat you need is you really\nneed to determine the details,\n\n1229\n01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,120\nthe nitty gritty details.\n\n1230\n01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:16,780\nThis might still be an incident, and you\nmight not know what the problem is, okay?\n\n1231\n01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,460\nSo you're trying to do two things.\n\n1232\n01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,380\nYou're trying to figure out what\nthe problem is if you can so\n\n1233\n01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,590\nyou can figure out how you\ncan solve this long term.\n\n1234\n01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:28,730\nBut at a minimum making sure you\nunderstand all the aspects of the incident\n\n1235\n01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,410\nso that you can possibly\ncreate a workaround to\n\n1236\n01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,840\nget people moving until\nyou can solve the problem.\n\n1237\n01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,980\nSo, again, juggling that balance, figuring\nout what you're trying to achieve there\n\n1238\n01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:43,170\nand not spending too much time creating a\nwork around versus solving the problem or\n\n1239\n01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,240\nsolving the problem versus creating\na work around, balancing the two.\n\n1240\n01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,270\n>> We'll also take a look\nat resolution and recovery.\n\n1241\n01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:55,230\nResolution and recovery gives us the\nability now or the process to go ahead and\n\n1242\n01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:57,460\nsay here's what we came up with.\n\n1243\n01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,340\nLet's go ahead and apply it and\nthen see if it ends up working.\n\n1244\n01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,870\nIf it works out, we now have to make sure\nthat we document what we've done so that\n\n1245\n01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:10,430\nwe can end up moving onto another step\nin just a moment, called closure, too.\n\n1246\n01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,140\n>> And if it doesn't work,\n\n1247\n01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,840\nwe need to undo whatever we just did and\ngo back to the planning board.\n\n1248\n01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,100\nNow, If we're actually\nmaking a change we're\n\n1249\n01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,100\ngonna have to get change\nmanagement involved.\n\n1250\n01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,088\nBut if we're just doing troubleshooting\nand isolating we come up with a solution\n\n1251\n01:02:25,088 --> 01:02:28,650\nand then we apply or\nwe submit a request for change.\n\n1252\n01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:32,020\nMaybe an emergency change if\nthis is a critical situation.\n\n1253\n01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,510\nWe get approved and we go and\nmake the change but\n\n1254\n01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,670\nbefore you make any change\nyou've got to do testing, right?\n\n1255\n01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,590\nSo that's what's all\nhappening right in here.\n\n1256\n01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,160\nWhen you're doing that investigation and\n\n1257\n01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,440\ndiagnosis you're actually coming\nup with an agreed upon solution.\n\n1258\n01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,910\nIt may be just you by yourself or\nyou might have a support group.\n\n1259\n01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:47,820\nSupport groups,\n\n1260\n01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,920\nthat's an important concept because it\nmight not just be a network problem.\n\n1261\n01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,490\nYou might need a network guy, a server\nguy, and a developer to all sit in\n\n1262\n01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:58,800\nthe same room and look at the problem so\nthey can all share information and\n\n1263\n01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,420\nfind the actual issue and\nthen agree upon that resolution.\n\n1264\n01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,840\nSo for resolution recovery,\nwe put that resolution in play, and\n\n1265\n01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,220\nhopefully there's our recovery.\n\n1266\n01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,140\nAnd now we're back up and running and\nthings are working great.\n\n1267\n01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:17,140\nNow, the resolution could be just\na workaround, a workaround so\n\n1268\n01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,660\nthat people can continue to work even\nthough the problem is still there.\n\n1269\n01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,650\nOr it could be a solution to the problem.\n\n1270\n01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:27,515\nNow, If it's a solution to the problem,\nthen we're really ready to move to\n\n1271\n01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:31,550\nincident closure where we shut this ticket\ndown, we've solved it, everything's good.\n\n1272\n01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,610\nBut if it's just a workaround\nthe end user is satisfied,\n\n1273\n01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,600\nthey're able to work now, but\nwe still have our work cut out for\n\n1274\n01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,480\nus because we've got to go and\nfind that problem and solve it.\n\n1275\n01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,590\nIt's our choice, if we want to\nleave that in the same incident and\n\n1276\n01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,730\njust kind of keep working that\nsame ticket from there, or\n\n1277\n01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,340\nmore commonly we'll split that\ninto a separate ticket So\n\n1278\n01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:58,260\nthat the incident is tracked in one ticket\nand the problem is tracked in another.\n\n1279\n01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,060\nThat's a common thing to do and you're\nattaching the incident to the problem,\n\n1280\n01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,200\nso now they're kinda in\nthese separate entities.\n\n1281\n01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,340\nThat's useful if there's a workaround.\n\n1282\n01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:10,476\nIf there's no workaround, then usually the\nincident leads right into the problem so\n\n1283\n01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:13,840\nwe keep them together, but\nthat's entirely up to you.\n\n1284\n01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,340\nAll right, that incident closure,\nis one of the easier stops right?\n\n1285\n01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,140\nThe problem is done.\n\n1286\n01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,520\nSo, we do need to verify that\nthe end user is satisfied.\n\n1287\n01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,650\nWhoever reported this in, just\nbecause we think we fixed the problem,\n\n1288\n01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:27,170\nwe may not have actually addressed it for\nthem.\n\n1289\n01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:28,970\nSo, we need to make sure\nthat their satisfied, and\n\n1290\n01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,560\nif they are, we close the ticket.\n\n1291\n01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,220\nWe document what happened,\nwe put everything in there so\n\n1292\n01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:37,240\nit's available for reference in\nthe future if the incident ever reoccurs.\n\n1293\n01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,990\nBut then we close it, and we walk away.\n\n1294\n01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,580\nKick your feet up on the desk and\ntake a break, right?\n\n1295\n01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:48,430\nNow unfortunately, things don't always\nstay fixed, it is possible to misdiagnose.\n\n1296\n01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,100\nWe may have seen the incident,\ntracked it back to a problem, and\n\n1297\n01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,950\nresolved the problem as far as we knew.\n\n1298\n01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,320\nDeployed it and\n\n1299\n01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,690\nnow we're back in business, but\nwe may not have fully patched the problem.\n\n1300\n01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,640\nOr there may have actually been a\nsecondary problem that we just didn't see\n\n1301\n01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,620\nuntil we only fixed part\nof our overall problem.\n\n1302\n01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:12,150\nAnd in that scenario we may\nget a new incident back again.\n\n1303\n01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:15,220\nAll right, now here's where things\nget a little bit tricky because\n\n1304\n01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,040\nyou could just create an all new incident\nand then start working the problem again.\n\n1305\n01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,760\nBut it's better if you can to\nreopen the previous incident.\n\n1306\n01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,340\nThat you closed it, but you reopen it so\nthat you can keep that relationship.\n\n1307\n01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:31,770\nThat you know hey, this is actually\ntied to this previous incident.\n\n1308\n01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:35,140\nAnd most ticketing software won't\nrequire you to open the original ticket.\n\n1309\n01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,290\nIt'll generate a new one and\nit'll link it to the original one so\n\n1310\n01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,000\nyou can see how that occurred,\n\n1311\n01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,028\nbecause it might be a completely different\nuser reporting the new one, right.\n\n1312\n01:05:44,028 --> 01:05:48,930\nSo maybe Ronnie called in one day and\nsaid the website was slow, and\n\n1313\n01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:52,410\nso we located a problem and we fixed it.\n\n1314\n01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:57,180\nBut then five days later, Nate calls\nin and says the website is slow, well,\n\n1315\n01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:58,610\nI don't want to go and\n\n1316\n01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:02,615\nreopen Ronnie's ticket because\nRonnie's not involved in this one.\n\n1317\n01:06:02,615 --> 01:06:06,435\nI wanna go in and create a new ticket cuz\nnow Nate is the person who reported there,\n\n1318\n01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:07,555\nthe end-user.\n\n1319\n01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:11,265\nBut I'm gonna link those together to say,\nit's the same problem.\n\n1320\n01:06:11,265 --> 01:06:12,985\nThey're both reporting\nthe website as slow.\n\n1321\n01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:15,885\nI say it's the same problem ,is it?\n\n1322\n01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:17,265\nDidn't that get solved?\n\n1323\n01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:17,895\nLet's find out.\n\n1324\n01:06:17,895 --> 01:06:20,230\nAnd we start to build our\ndiagnosis from there.\n\n1325\n01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:21,490\nTry and figure out that issue.\n\n1326\n01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,370\nSo that resolution recovery and\nincident closure,\n\n1327\n01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,610\nthose are important, but it might not\nquite fix things at the end of the day.\n\n1328\n01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,520\nAnd then we have to reopen that ticket.\n\n1329\n01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,490\nSo that's kinda that last stage.\n\n1330\n01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:37,540\nNow, that was a lot of stages,\nlet's just recap that real quick, right?\n\n1331\n01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:41,980\nWe did incident identification, so knowing\nthat the problem has occurred, right?\n\n1332\n01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,330\nThen, or, I say problem.\n\n1333\n01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:44,710\nKnowing that the incident has occurred.\n\n1334\n01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,390\nWe don't necessarily know the problem.\n\n1335\n01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:48,040\nThen, incident logging.\n\n1336\n01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,140\nWe log it, put it on record.\n\n1337\n01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:52,100\nIncident categorization, right?\n\n1338\n01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,130\nWe flag it with various labels, so\nthat we can use that for analysis later.\n\n1339\n01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:00,090\nIncident prioritization, so\nwe flag how urgent this is,\n\n1340\n01:07:00,090 --> 01:07:03,460\nso do we need to get on this\nincident right now, or can it wait?\n\n1341\n01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:09,480\nInitial diagnosis,we try and\nisolate the issue and fix it if we can.\n\n1342\n01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,830\nIf not, we move to incident escalation.\n\n1343\n01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,910\nWe move it up to the next\ntier of support personnel.\n\n1344\n01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,650\nThen investigation and diagnosis.\n\n1345\n01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,940\nWe actually dive in and try and\nfind what the real cause of this is.\n\n1346\n01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:25,060\nWhat the problem is and that's when\nwe come up with our resolution and\n\n1347\n01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,150\nrecovery right.\n\n1348\n01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,710\nWe solve the problem.\n\n1349\n01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,970\nWe put a resolution in place, and\nnow we're back up and running.\n\n1350\n01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:34,600\nThat leads to closure,\nwe shut the ticket down.\n\n1351\n01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,430\nAnd then lastly,\nif the problem isn't truly solved,\n\n1352\n01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:41,040\nwe reopen if necessary, all right?\n\n1353\n01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,300\nSo those are the steps\nrecommended by ITIL.\n\n1354\n01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,310\nTo go through and service a ticket,\nservice an incident that comes in.\n\n1355\n01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:53,540\nThere's a few extra little things that\nwe might add to this in our environment,\n\n1356\n01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,190\nwhich we'll see in some\nof the other processes.\n\n1357\n01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,270\nAnd there's some of these things that\nwe might choose to consolidate, right?\n\n1358\n01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,960\nNo sense in having a lot\nof things separate.\n\n1359\n01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,730\nLike prioritization and categorization.\n\n1360\n01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:07,680\nA lot of people will assign priorities\nby categories, so they combine those.\n\n1361\n01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,900\nSo your environment may look\na little bit different.\n\n1362\n01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,675\nBut these are all the different components\nthat are really being addressed as part of\n\n1363\n01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:14,753\nincident management.\n\n1364\n01:08:16,656 --> 01:08:20,658\nAll right, I think that is pretty much as\nfar as we can go on incident management\n\n1365\n01:08:20,658 --> 01:08:22,455\nwithout driving everybody nuts.\n\n1366\n01:08:22,455 --> 01:08:24,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you want to learn more,\n\n1367\n01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:27,380\ndefinitely check out\nthe service operation manual.\n\n1368\n01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:32,130\nBecause it goes into great depth,\nshowing all sorts of reports and\n\n1369\n01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:33,040\ninformation schemes.\n\n1370\n01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,325\nAnd all sorts of really good\nbest practices in there.\n\n1371\n01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:40,435\nBut, for ITIL foundation, that's basically\nwhat's involved with incident management.\n\n1372\n01:08:40,435 --> 01:08:41,625\n>> Yeah.\n\n1373\n01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,585\nMoving on from incidences,\n\n1374\n01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:48,560\nwhich really are the uninterrupted\nwork that we have in our business.\n\n1375\n01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,310\nUninterrupted work.\n\n1376\n01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:49,810\nWhat did I say?\n\n1377\n01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:54,670\nInterruptions to our regular work\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n1378\n01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:59,000\nWith incidences we not have things\nthat we have to do each and every day.\n\n1379\n01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,270\nChanges that end up occurring and\nas the service desk, as people that are in\n\n1380\n01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:08,570\nthe service operations we still need to\nrespond to what we call regular requests.\n\n1381\n01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:12,910\nAnd the way that we do that is through a\nprocess that we call request fulfillment.\n\n1382\n01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:16,280\n>> Yeah, and it's gonna be one of the\nresponsibilities of the service desk to\n\n1383\n01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,550\nidentify what they're dealing with.\n\n1384\n01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,590\nWhether it is an incident, and\nneeds to through full incident management.\n\n1385\n01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,870\nOr if it's just a request.\n\n1386\n01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:24,420\nAnd request we've already kind of planned\nout exactly what they're going to do.\n\n1387\n01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:28,890\nWe've got our chart of steps, our\npolicy or whatever on how to handle it.\n\n1388\n01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:32,570\nThat's no big deal on that one, and the\nservice desk will typically will resolve\n\n1389\n01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:36,350\nwhatever that request was, unless is\nrequires elevated privileges, right?\n\n1390\n01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,530\nSo it is definitely\na process we need to tackle,\n\n1391\n01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:42,910\nbut we don't have all that much time left\non our timer here so why don't we do this.\n\n1392\n01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:47,510\nLet's go ahead and wrap it up here and\nwe're gonna come back with a part\n\n1393\n01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,130\ntwo because we still have, we've got\nrequest fulfillment, problem management,\n\n1394\n01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,140\nand access management still to get to.\n\n1395\n01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,820\nBut we'll split those off\ninto a separate episode so\n\n1396\n01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:58,120\nwe don't blow our minds here all in one.\n\n1397\n01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,240\nInstant management was a lot to cover.\n\n1398\n01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,550\nSo we definitely wanna stop there and\n\n1399\n01:10:01,550 -->

00:00:38,090\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,970\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,250\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:41,920\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,010\n>> It is going well today.\n\n8\n00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,145\nWe are ready for\nanother episode into IT foundations.\n\n9\n00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:51,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, we're getting into, what is it?\n\n10\n00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,610\nRequest fulfillment.\n\n11\n00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,120\n>> Yep.\n>> Is what we're moving into.\n\n12\n00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,790\n>> Now in our last episode we\nstarted service operation and\n\n13\n00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,620\nwe spent the bulk of our time\ntalking about incident management.\n\n14\n00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,781\nWhich is really important.\n\n15\n00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,597\nBut, we didn't get to some of\nthe processes that were still available.\n\n16\n00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,483\nSo in this episode, we're picking up as a\npart two to the service operation episode\n\n17\n00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:10,440\nand continuing on with those processes.\n\n18\n00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,370\nAnd you're exactly right, Ronnie.\n\n19\n00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,500\nThe first one we need to\ntackle is request fulfillment.\n\n20\n00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,900\nNow, incident management and request\nfulfillment are very, very similar.\n\n21\n00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,420\nIn both scenarios you typically have an\nend-user call, email, whatever, reach out\n\n22\n00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,650\nto the support desk or the service desk\nand ask about something they need changed.\n\n23\n00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,050\nIn an incident,\nit's an unanticipated thing.\n\n24\n00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,170\nIt's some kind of deviation from what\nwe expect our network to be doing.\n\n25\n00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,240\nIt's an issue that we\nneed to get resolved.\n\n26\n00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,630\nBut requests fulfillment\nis very different.\n\n27\n00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,980\nThis is just a normal activity.\n\n28\n00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,440\nIt is a change that's being\nmade to the network but\n\n29\n00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,430\nit's a minor change and\nit's typically pre-authorized and\n\n30\n00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,640\nthat means it doesn't have to\ngo through change management.\n\n31\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,160\nThis is something that your service desk\npersonnel will have the authority to go\n\n32\n00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,340\nahead and implement without testing,\nwithout going through change management,\n\n33\n00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,730\nwithout having to get specific approval.\n\n34\n00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,870\nThis is a low impact activity that\nthey can take with generally no or\n\n35\n00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,670\nextremely little risk.\n\n36\n00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,620\nThat doesn't mean we don't\napply any oversight to it.\n\n37\n00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,250\nBut it means that they can just go and\n\n38\n00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,980\nget the job done without invoking\nthe rest of all of our processes.\n\n39\n00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n40\n00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,900\nFor example,\nwe may get somebody who calls up and says,\n\n41\n00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,190\nhey I forgot what my password is.\n\n42\n00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,820\nAnd I need my password reset.\n\n43\n00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,830\nWell that doesn't necessarily require\nan escalation up to somebody that's\n\n44\n00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,100\nworking on the servers to\nbe able to approve that.\n\n45\n00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,840\nWe might wanna go ahead and\nsay, all right.\n\n46\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,970\nAt this level, go ahead and\nallow that to be done.\n\n47\n00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,200\nIt could be that someone's machine just\nneeds to be replaced because they're\n\n48\n00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,370\nno longer able to get access\nto it due to malware.\n\n49\n00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,005\nWe may just go ahead and replace that and\nmachine out that, as well.\n\n50\n00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:51,110\nSo there's many different things that\nwe can do right here that will help to\n\n51\n00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,330\nrelieve some of the overburdening\npressure on some of our upper level tier\n\n52\n00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,580\nwith some of the things that we\ncan just do at the lowest level.\n\n53\n00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,980\n>> Yeah, and\nit may not even be a bad thing.\n\n54\n00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,690\nIt may be a good thing like,\nhey we hired a new employee.\n\n55\n00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,470\nSo that new employee,\nthey need a user account created and\n\n56\n00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,400\nthey need some permissions assigned so\nthey can get in and do some work, right?\n\n57\n00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,420\nThey need an email, mail box setup so\n\n58\n00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,420\nthose are not problems or\nincidents, this is just an activity.\n\n59\n00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,400\n>> Regular things.\n>> Yeah it's a request and\n\n60\n00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,860\nwe're fulfilling that request so that term\nrequest fulfillment is just kind of taking\n\n61\n00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,080\nthe kind of negativity away from it and\nsaying this is a standard item,\n\n62\n00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,650\nthis is what's gonna happen.\n\n63\n00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,740\nSo these are separated from incidents.\n\n64\n00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,270\nWhen a service desk personnel\nreceives that communication in\n\n65\n00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,370\nthey identify which it's going to be.\n\n66\n00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,610\nIf it sounds like an incident,\nif it's not normal stuff,\n\n67\n00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,270\nit needs to go through incident management\nand they'll shift it off to that process.\n\n68\n00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,280\nBut, if it's just request fulfillment,\nthen they'll handle the request and\n\n69\n00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,210\nit's possible that the end user\ncalls it in as an incident and\n\n70\n00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,730\nthe service personnel just has to\nconvert it over to being a request.\n\n71\n00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,690\nIt's not something critical.\n\n72\n00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,850\nThe end-user might think that it is but\nat the end of the day it isn't.\n\n73\n00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,400\nSo no escalation.\n\n74\n00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,730\nIt gets resolved right\nthere at the first tier.\n\n75\n00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,250\nAnd it's done.\n\n76\n00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,200\n>> Normally with this level of request\nfulfillment we are following fairly strict\n\n77\n00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,910\npolicies to ensure that our users are\ngetting the exact service that they need\n\n78\n00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,350\nand getting it resolved\nas quickly as possible.\n\n79\n00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,420\nSo here you'll see the use of things like\nscripts so that we can make sure that\n\n80\n00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,800\nwe're actually doing everything that\nreally can fulfill what their wish is, and\n\n81\n00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,590\nthat way we make sure that we're actually\ncovering everything that we need to.\n\n82\n00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,660\n>> You've gotta be careful with this.\n\n83\n00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,540\nThese are pre-authorized changes.\n\n84\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,500\nThat means they're gonna implement\na change in your network,\n\n85\n00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,160\ncreating a user account,\nresetting somebody's password.\n\n86\n00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,875\nThey're gonna implement that without\nsomeone else giving them review, right.\n\n87\n00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,920\nRview will happen afterwards,\nbut prior to the change,\n\n88\n00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,740\nnobody's double checking their work.\n\n89\n00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,400\nSo, you will typically have very strict\npolicies in place detailing exactly what\n\n90\n00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,990\nthey can do.\n\n91\n00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,930\nIf you have a script like Ronnie said,\nyou know the steps to get there.\n\n92\n00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,010\nHere's the information I need\nyou to get from the customer.\n\n93\n00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,130\nHere's the actions I'm allowed to take,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,300\nSo you'll typically couple these with very\nstrict policies that limit what people\n\n95\n00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,870\ncan do, as well as other\ntechnologies in the background.\n\n96\n00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,980\nLike yes, you can reset the passwords for\nregular employees, but\n\n97\n00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,160\nyou can't reset passwords for\nexecutives, right?\n\n98\n00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,950\nOr something of that nature to protect\nthe integrity of people's data.\n\n99\n00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,440\nSo you might have flowcharts, scripts,\nstep-by-step guides that explain\n\n100\n00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,380\nexactly what that service personnel\nis allowed to do, and if they need to\n\n101\n00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,830\ndeviate from that in any way, they need\nto do a request for change, RFC, right?\n\n102\n00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,890\nThey need to get some approval and\npeer review before they make that.\n\n103\n00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,920\nBut as long as they don't deviate,\n\n104\n00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,050\nthey're allowed to make this\nchange without approval.\n\n105\n00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,120\n>> A lot of times, the requests that come\nin, because we're following such strict\n\n106\n00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,770\npolicies, it should help that,\nthe service desk personnel,\n\n107\n00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,950\nto be able to identify that this is\na regular part of what needs to go on.\n\n108\n00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,680\nBut easily be able to identify when\nthis now becomes an incident instead.\n\n109\n00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,300\nThat way they know that hey, whoa,\nthis is beyond what I need to do.\n\n110\n00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,340\nLet me go ahead and make sure that\nwe get this to the right person.\n\n111\n00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,030\nAll right, so this is one of\nthe easiest of the processes for us.\n\n113\n00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,470\nIt's just handling that and\nnot escalating.\n\n114\n00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,740\nBut it's not an incident.\n\n115\n00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,810\nIt's just a request.\n\n116\n00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,150\nNow back in incident management,\n\n117\n00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,800\none of the things we mentioned there\nwas that the incident is the symptom.\n\n118\n00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,710\nThat's the issue as the end user sees it.\n\n119\n00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,720\nBut part of incident management\nis trying to isolate the problem.\n\n120\n00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920\nAnd the problem is the actual cause.\n\n121\n00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,360\nWhat's causing this incident, or\neven causing multiple incidents?\n\n122\n00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,130\nAnd that's what leads us into our next\nprocess which is problem management.\n\n123\n00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,080\nNow with problem management our number one\ngoal here is identifying that problem and\n\n124\n00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,830\ncoming up with a resolution.\n\n125\n00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,070\nAnd there's a number of different\nmethods we use for addressing that and\n\n126\n00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,740\nmoving it through.\n\n127\n00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,770\nBut before we dive into that, let's just\nrehash, because it was last episode.\n\n128\n00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,040\nLet's rehash that difference\nbetween a problem and an incident.\n\n129\n00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,980\nThe analogy I used in that episode was,\nit's kind of like when a person gets sick.\n\n130\n00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,610\nThey might have a fever, and a runny nose,\nand the fever and the runny nose,\n\n131\n00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,770\nthose are the incidents, right.\n\n132\n00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,580\nThat's the symptom that\nthey're experiencing, but\n\n133\n00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,520\nthe actual cause might\nbe like the flu virus.\n\n134\n00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,748\nSo that the virus is the cause,\nthat's the problem, and then the fever and\n\n135\n00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:10,670\nthe runny nose and what we see,\nthat's the incident.\n\n136\n00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,550\nSo when we deal with a service desk,\n\n137\n00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,050\nthey're getting incidents in, and several\ntimes, you'll find where those incidents,\n\n138\n00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,250\nthere's more than one incident\nall tied to the same problem.\n\n139\n00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,780\nSo we have to categorize that and\nidentify it.\n\n140\n00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,580\nAnd while they're resolving\nthe incident they may not know that.\n\n141\n00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,260\nAnd we might put a work around in place or\n\n142\n00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,270\nsomething that allows\npeople to continue to work.\n\n143\n00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,720\nAnd we still don't even\nknow what the problem is.\n\n144\n00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,020\nSo we have to go and\nisolate, and find that.\n\n145\n00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,450\nAnd that's what problem\nmanagement centers around.\n\n146\n00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,405\nIs the finding the actual\nroot cause of that incident.\n\n147\n00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:45,555\n>> In problem management, we may not only\nwant to identify what the root cause is,\n\n148\n00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:48,750\nbut we wanna try and\nprevent problems that end up\n\n149\n00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,685\nfinding as much as possible from\ncausing any other adverse impact.\n\n150\n00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:55,979\nSo the way that we do that is by trying to\nfigure it out and then trying to minimize\n\n151\n00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,559\nwhatever adverse impact we may end\nup getting from the problem and\n\n152\n00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,139\nresolving it at that point.\n\n153\n00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,798\nAnd there's really two different\nmethods that we can do that, right Don?\n\n154\n00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:07,536\n>> Yeah, we can proactive or\nwe can be reactive.\n\n155\n00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:08,718\nIf we're pro-active,\n\n156\n00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:12,650\nwe're trying to find the problem and\nresolve it before anybody reports it.\n\n157\n00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,280\nRight?\nRemember,\n\n158\n00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,410\nan incident that's when\nan end user is reporting\n\n159\n00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,038\nsomething that's going wrong, right?\n\n160\n00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,120\nSo it's possible you\ncould spot a problem and\n\n161\n00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,490\nfix it before anybody's\nactually run into it.\n\n162\n00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:23,990\nRight?\n\n163\n00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,720\nMaybe you noticed that there's\na bug in your software.\n\n164\n00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,910\nAnd if a person performs a certain set\nof actions they'll hit that bug and\n\n165\n00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,620\nthe software will crash.\n\n166\n00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,150\nBut the certain set of actions that's so\n\n167\n00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,330\ninfrequently used that most people\nwould never notice, all right.\n\n168\n00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,070\nIt's a problem.\n\n169\n00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,940\nYou found the cause.\n\n170\n00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,720\nYou know that if you recreate these steps,\nthis problem happens, and\n\n171\n00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,750\nthe program crashes, and\nnow you can go and fix it.\n\n172\n00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,530\nYou can submit a request for change,\npush in the change to fix it and now,\n\n173\n00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,200\nyou've patched the issue when\nan end user never even saw it.\n\n174\n00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,607\nYou could, in theory,\nhave a problem with no incidents, right.\n\n175\n00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,100\nBut, typically,\nsomebody's gotta discover the problem and\n\n176\n00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,850\nthat might come through good code review\nor a peer review of your code or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,540\nBut often times it's\nthe end users reporting it.\n\n178\n00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,210\nSo being proactive is finding the problem\nbefore any incidents have been created.\n\n179\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,030\nRight?\n\n180\n00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,110\nBecause that's not very common,\n\n181\n00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,530\nthat leads us to our other\none which is being reactive.\n\n182\n00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,960\nSomeone submits an incident and now we\ngotta find out what the problem was and\n\n183\n00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,330\nwe gotta fix it after the fact.\n\n184\n00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,340\nThe worst part about that one\nis your end users see it, right.\n\n185\n00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,860\nWe've impacted our end users\nto at least some degree and\n\n186\n00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,435\nwe like to avoid that whenever possible,\nbut it's difficult to take\n\n187\n00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:39,145\nevery potential scenario into account and\nthings slip through the cracks.\n\n188\n00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,715\nAnd so this is where we end up a lot of\ntimes is with that reactive approach.\n\n189\n00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,725\n>> Also in problem management,\nis taking the data and\n\n190\n00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,915\nreviewing it over and over again.\n\n191\n00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:53,545\nWhen we find the problem, trying to fix\nit and then learning from that incident\n\n192\n00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:57,045\nafterwards to be able to go back and\nsay, hey is this recurring again and\n\n193\n00:09:57,045 --> 00:10:01,350\nagain, have we actually went and\nsolved the root cause?\n\n194\n00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,430\nOr did we just put a band-aid on it and\nthen we have to review it again and\n\n195\n00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,760\nmake sure that we fix it.\n\n196\n00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040\nSo reviewing the data's part\nof the problem management.\n\n197\n00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,750\n>> And I have a great example of this.\n\n198\n00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,170\nWhen I worked out in Seattle we were\nin a really large office building and\n\n199\n00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,010\nbasically, if you wanted Internet access,\nyou had to have it\n\n200\n00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,340\npulled into the building first and\nthen, it was delivered to your floor.\n\n201\n00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,550\nWe had a fiber-optic link that was\nprovided by Quest Communications and\n\n202\n00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,315\nthe link itself was great.\n\n203\n00:10:29,315 --> 00:10:32,815\nWe had this reliable Metro ethernet\nconnection, that ran into our facility,\n\n204\n00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,495\nand it was our primary data system.\n\n205\n00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:39,385\nBut, we didn't rely on just that one,\nwe had backup ISPs, right.\n\n206\n00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:40,815\nSo we had a a bundle of T-1 lines,\n\n207\n00:10:40,815 --> 00:10:44,295\nthat we used as a backup,\nin the event the fiber went down.\n\n208\n00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:47,055\nAnd sure enough,\none month the fiber link went down.\n\n209\n00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:48,970\nIt went down for about two hours, and\n\n210\n00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:52,990\nduring that time,\nwe put a workaround in place, right?\n\n211\n00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,910\nWhich helps us to minimize that impact,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,590\nOur workaround was to move our data\nfrom the fiber line that was down\n\n213\n00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,890\nover to our bundle of T1s, all right.\n\n214\n00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,690\nSo we just switched over to this one.\n\n215\n00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,190\nNow, while we were over on\nthe T1's our network was slower.\n\n216\n00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,450\nSo we didn't want that, right.\n\n217\n00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,150\nOur Metro e-connection was about 40MB.\n\n218\n00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,340\nOur bundle of T1's was if I remember\nright, let's see there was six of them.\n\n219\n00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,680\nSo it would have been 9MB.\n\n220\n00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,240\nSo it was about maybe 25%\nof our normal bandwidth.\n\n221\n00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,730\nSo a huge performance degradation by\nstepping over to that other line.\n\n222\n00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,300\nBut it allowed us to stay operational\nwhile the fiber was down.\n\n223\n00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,270\nAnd after about two hours, the fiber came\nback up, and we moved our operation back.\n\n224\n00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,110\nWe took the workaround out, and\neverybody went back to the way\n\n225\n00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,570\nthat was in place before, and\nnow we were back, all right?\n\n226\n00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,850\nNow, our incident in that scenario\nwas that the line went down, right?\n\n227\n00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,020\nThat we weren't able to flow data over\nour fiber line but what was the problem?\n\n228\n00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,420\nAll of our equipment checked out.\n\n229\n00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,380\nWe didn't see any issue on our equipment.\n\n230\n00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,090\nAnd it turned out that a switch\nback at our service provider\n\n231\n00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,458\nwas doing some bad spanning\ntree calculations.\n\n232\n00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,980\nAnd basically it's spanning\ntree table locked up and\n\n233\n00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,510\nit stopped flowing traffic for\nour Metro Elink.\n\n234\n00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,990\nSo the problem was on their end and\nthey resolved it,.\n\n235\n00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,330\nSo they let us know, yep, that was fixed,\nit's gone, don't worry about it.\n\n236\n00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,890\nAnd you're in business.\n\n237\n00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,047\nSo, we documented it and\nwe closed the ticket, right.\n\n238\n00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,780\nNow, we didn't forget about it.\n\n239\n00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,220\nWe logged it so that we could remember it.\n\n240\n00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,805\nAnd by we, I mean me.\n\n241\n00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,460\n[LAUGH] So I logged this so\nI could remember it.\n\n242\n00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,390\nAnd a few months later, actually,\n\n243\n00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,290\nit was two months later,\nthe problem happened again.\n\n244\n00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,750\nFit the same scenario, same idea.\n\n245\n00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,820\nWe had a two hour outage.\n\n246\n00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,820\nIt was even about the same\ntime of the month.\n\n247\n00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,520\nThe first one happened on\nlike the 30th of the month.\n\n248\n00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,290\nThis one happened on\nthe 31st of the month.\n\n249\n00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,420\nSo it was really, really similar to\nwhat had happened two months before.\n\n250\n00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,020\nAll right, and again the ISP said, oh yeah\nwe had another problem on the switch.\n\n251\n00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,510\nWe went ahead and\nreplaced the entire switch this time.\n\n252\n00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,860\nLast time they replaced a card,\nthis time they replaced the whole switch.\n\n253\n00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,760\nYou're back up and you're stable.\n\n254\n00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,870\nAll right, two more months went by and\nthe same problem happened a third time.\n\n255\n00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,530\nAnd on that third time\nI reached out to them.\n\n256\n00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,600\nI said, look guys, I understand\nthat when you replace the card,\n\n257\n00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,890\nyou replace the switch it's\nfixing the problem, right.\n\n258\n00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,590\nAnd it's going away.\n\n259\n00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,880\nBut then it's coming back,\nand here's the pattern.\n\n260\n00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,650\nThis has happened once every two\nmonths for the last six months.\n\n261\n00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,400\nRight, I've got a documented pattern.\n\n262\n00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,920\nHere's the time, here's the occurrences,\n\n263\n00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,495\nhere's what's going on, and\nI said let's troubleshoot this together.\n\n264\n00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:22,585\nLet's get me more involved in this and\ntry and resolve it.\n\n265\n00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:27,695\nAnd what we were able to find was\nreplacing the switch was fixing\n\n266\n00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:32,940\nthe problem only because we would power\nthat one off and bring up a new switch and\n\n267\n00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,820\nthe memory was empty when it would come\nup and it would start to populate.\n\n268\n00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,240\nThere was a memory leak in their standing\ntree software that was basically\n\n269\n00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,210\nslowly eating up all of the RAM,\nand it would take 60 days.\n\n270\n00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,980\nAnd after 60 days it would run out of RAM\nand it would stop forwarding traffic.\n\n271\n00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,560\nAnd you wouldn't know thatif\nyou hadn't seen the pattern.\n\n272\n00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920\nIf you hadn't seen the pattern\nthat's occurring every 60 days,\n\n273\n00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,390\nyou wouldn't know that there\nwas this potential issue.\n\n274\n00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,700\nSo, trend analysis,\nbeing able to look at that history and\n\n275\n00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,925\ntrack the reports, is really\nimportant to finding the problem.\n\n276\n00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,875\nThe problem here wasn't\nthe physical switch,\n\n277\n00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:12,455\nreplacing the physical switch\nfixed it temporarily, right.\n\n278\n00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:14,065\nBut they didn't know it\nwas a temporary fix,\n\n279\n00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,825\ncuz they weren't stringing\ntogether the different incidences.\n\n280\n00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,175\nAnd that's a problem, right.\n\n281\n00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:21,805\nSo we've gotta be aware of\nthat to recognize when there's\n\n282\n00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:26,310\nthis kind of relationship between\nincidence and the problem itself.\n\n283\n00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,420\nSo that all kinda falls\ndown to that reviewing, and\n\n284\n00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,630\nit's important to maintain that data,\nthat log.\n\n285\n00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,150\nAnd this is where our Known Error Database\ncomes in, our K-E-D-B.\n\n286\n00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,860\nKnown Error Database.\n\n287\n00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,620\nWe keep track of every error,\n\n288\n00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,130\nof every incident that is created,\nand how it was resolved.\n\n289\n00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,700\nAnd that way we can look at it, if it ever\nhappens again we still got the resolution.\n\n290\n00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,660\nWe can go and pull it and\n\n291\n00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,120\nwe don't have to reinvent the wheel, or\nwe can start to establish a pattern.\n\n292\n00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,720\nSo you do need a good database to keep\ntrack of all of your support tickets and\n\n293\n00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,530\nhow they were resolved so you can string\nthat together into one big picture.\n\n294\n00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,330\nThat is really critical and\na lot of support software out there can be\n\n295\n00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,640\nincredibly expensive but it's because\nit provides functionality like that,\n\n296\n00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,770\nbeing able to string things together\ninto a system that makes sense and\n\n297\n00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,880\nwe can make informed\ngood decisions with it.\n\n298\n00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,470\n>> Having this known error database\nis really a good practice for\n\n299\n00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,940\nany organization\n>> Because it also allows not only for\n\n300\n00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,420\nDon having to go back and\nseeing the errors himself, but\n\n301\n00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,360\nit can also provide\nmaybe some guidance and\n\n302\n00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,750\nsome knowledge for others that\nmay be experiencing the problem.\n\n303\n00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,670\nAnd be able to actually see\nwhat the history is, be able\n\n304\n00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,520\nto know how it was resolved, and that way\nwe don't have to reinvent the wheel, or\n\n305\n00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,070\ngo back and do all the diagnostics again,\nwhich could take hours upon hours upon\n\n306\n00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,050\nhours while they could be fixing the issue\nby taking a look at the information there.\n\n307\n00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,620\n>> All right, so with that idea in mind,\nright, so what we're gonna be doing for\n\n308\n00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,840\nproblem management.\n\n309\n00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,241\nWe're ready to kind of\nmove through the process.\n\n310\n00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:02,183\nAnd just like we saw with incident\nmanagement ITIL has a recommended\n\n311\n00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,487\nseries of steps.\n\n312\n00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:06,645\nAnd you may or may not follow\nthese exactly in your environment.\n\n313\n00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:08,815\nBut these are kind of the basic\ncomponents we need to match.\n\n314\n00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:12,180\nNow, problem management,\nat least in the beginning,\n\n315\n00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,550\nis identical to incident management.\n\n316\n00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,490\nIn fact, our first four steps\nare the same from incident management.\n\n317\n00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,420\nFirst off,\nwe start with problem identification.\n\n318\n00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,190\nHow do we know there even is a problem?\n\n319\n00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,430\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nif the first four steps are the same,\n\n320\n00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,970\nwhy not just have this branch\nout from incident management?\n\n321\n00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,230\nRemember what I said at\nthe beginning of this show,\n\n322\n00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,330\nyou might have a problem\nwith no incident yet.\n\n323\n00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,210\nNobody's reported this problem yet, so\n\n324\n00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,580\nit hasn't entered that\nincident kind of process.\n\n325\n00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,360\nThat's why we have these separate,\nso that you can actually start your\n\n326\n00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,900\ninterface with problem management, can\njust be straight with problem detection.\n\n327\n00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,610\nNumber one, we identify that the problem\n\n328\n00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,170\nexists through whatever means\nit is that we discover it.\n\n329\n00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,370\n>> Just like incident management,\n\n330\n00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,660\ntoo, we also wanna make sure\nthat we log the problem.\n\n331\n00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,570\nLogging the problem gives us a time\nwhen we're actually starting to see\n\n332\n00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,960\nwhere the issues occurring, or\nwhen we first spotted it, so\n\n333\n00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,760\nthat we actually now have a good\nrecord of what's going on.\n\n334\n00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,550\n>> From there, we apply our\nprioritization and categorization.\n\n335\n00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,240\nI'm gonna to go ahead and\ncombine them but in the ITIL guide,\n\n336\n00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,850\nthey list them separate and\nwe saw these before.\n\n337\n00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,370\nCategorization is where we just\napply various labels to the problem,\n\n338\n00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,560\nso that we can use it for\ntrend analysis and other things later on.\n\n339\n00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,170\nWe want to be able to see where\nmost of our problems came from and\n\n340\n00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,350\nprioritization, how big of a deal is this?\n\n341\n00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,750\nHow much, priority,\nhow much weight do I wanna give to\n\n342\n00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,650\nthis problem over other problems that we\nmight have and you might have your high,\n\n343\n00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,530\nnormal, low priorities, or your sev1,\nsev2, sev3 type priorities, or whatever.\n\n344\n00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,940\nIt's pretty much the same\nas incidence management but\n\n345\n00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,485\nthere is a little bit of a difference when\nit comes to prioritization of a problem.\n\n346\n00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:02,755\nThat's because it's really built around\nwhether or not there have been any\n\n347\n00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:07,415\nincidents yet, and if there haven't,\nhow likely it is that there will be.\n\n348\n00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:13,355\nIf you found a problem but nobody\nhas reported it yet, is that urgent?\n\n349\n00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,460\nIt kinda goes back to the,\nif a tree falls in the forest and\n\n350\n00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460\nno ones there to hear it,\ndoes it make any sound?\n\n351\n00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480\nThat's kinda how this problem is.\n\n352\n00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,100\nJust because nobody's seen it yet doesn't\nmean that they're not about to five\n\n353\n00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,880\nminutes from now and if they do,\nhow much will that impact them?\n\n354\n00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,870\nSo we have to take this into consideration\nwhen we prioritize our problems.\n\n355\n00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,420\nJust like with incidences we still\nhave impact, we still have that but\n\n356\n00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,290\nour sense of urgency is\nharder to discover and\n\n357\n00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,370\nso that's really based around\nthe frequency of incidents.\n\n358\n00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,600\nHave I just received one\nreport on this and that's it?\n\n359\n00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,710\nThis might be a very, very minor thing,\nor am I receiving hundreds or\n\n360\n00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,790\neven thousands of incidents coming in.\n\n361\n00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,180\nIs this affecting my whole customer base?\n\n362\n00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,520\nThat's gonna impact my priority.\n\n363\n00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n364\n00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,230\nThe other way that we can also see this,\nis through the severity of the incidents.\n\n365\n00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,630\nSo Don, it may not take a thousand users,\n\n366\n00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,050\nit may take one who says,\nthis ate my machine.\n\n367\n00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,990\nWhen I went, it really did,\nit tore up my machine and\n\n368\n00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,380\nnow I don't have a hard drive left.\n\n369\n00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,940\nThe severity of that seems to also\ngive us, hey, this is actually\n\n370\n00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,340\na higher priority than someone who says,\nit's working a little bit slow.\n\n371\n00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:32,420\n>> Yeah, and just some current\nexamples of severity like that.\n\n372\n00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,160\n>> Apple, recently,\nthey rolled out their iCloud Drive and\n\n373\n00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,000\nthey found this scenario where if you had\na computer setup for iCloud Drive and\n\n374\n00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,360\nyou had your phone set up for iCloud\nDrive and you did a wipe of your phone.\n\n375\n00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,340\nIf you did a factory reset of your phone,\n\n376\n00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,850\nit could actually delete\ndocuments out of iCloud Drive.\n\n377\n00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,580\nNow very few people had\nexperienced that but\n\n378\n00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,880\nit was severe because the users lost data.\n\n379\n00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,180\nThat was a big deal.\n\n380\n00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,320\nSo that one, even though it had\na small frequency of incident\n\n381\n00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,850\nwas still high severity because\nthe impact that it caused.\n\n382\n00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,340\nAnother great example,\nwould be let's say, a security exploit.\n\n383\n00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,820\nMaybe a security researcher\ncontacts your company and\n\n384\n00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,680\nsays, guys, I wanna give you a heads up,\nI found this bug in your website and\n\n385\n00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,400\nif I leverage it in this particular way,\nI can download your full customer list.\n\n386\n00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,420\nYou'll leak customer data.\n\n387\n00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,220\nThey just gave you a heads up.\n\n388\n00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,630\nThere's no incident, nobody's\nactually leveraged this exploit yet.\n\n389\n00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,450\nSo there's absolutely no frequency of\nincident but this is high severity.\n\n390\n00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,340\nIf this problem were to actually happen,\nif somebody were to exploit this bug,\n\n391\n00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,910\nour customer database would get out\nthere and that would be really bad.\n\n392\n00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,700\nThis is high severity.\n\n393\n00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,510\nYou need to get on that right away,\n\n394\n00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,620\nclose that hole even though\nnobody's exploited it yet.\n\n395\n00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,220\nThose are kinda how we\ncan measure this and\n\n396\n00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,100\nthat makes it different than an incident.\n\n397\n00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,580\nWith an incident, it's all about\nhow it's impacting the customer.\n\n398\n00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,970\nIf it's not impacting the customer, then\nthey're not letting us know about it, and\n\n399\n00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,000\nwe don't have an incident,\nit doesn't happen.\n\n400\n00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,550\nBut because we can be proactive\nwith a problem, it can, so\n\n401\n00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,480\nthat's why this step differs from\nprioritization in an incident.\n\n402\n00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,810\nNow, that's really the last step,\nwhere we mirror incident management.\n\n403\n00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,565\nBeyond this, we start differing a good\nbit because with incident management,\n\n404\n00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:21,685\nit's all about escalating to the right\npeople, finding a work around and\n\n405\n00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:25,475\nputting it in place, or resolving that\nperson's issue and closing it off.\n\n406\n00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:28,135\nBut here we're actually trying to\nfind the problem and fix it, so\n\n407\n00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:31,325\nthe remaining steps that we have\nstart to differ and deviate.\n\n408\n00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:35,585\nIt's probably a good spot for us to stop\nand take a break anyway cuz I don't think\n\n409\n00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,290\nwe've given you anything to\nearth shatteringly new here.\n\n410\n00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,030\nWhen we get back,\n\n411\n00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,270\nwe can start to cover some of those\nother steps and dive into them.\n\n412\n00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,930\nSo let's pause here.\n\n413\n00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,005\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n414\n00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:52,960\n[SOUND] [SOUND] Welcome back, everybody.\n\n415\n00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,639\nSo we left off going through some of the\ndifferent steps of problem management and\n\n416\n00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:59,139\nwe're just gonna pick right\nback up where we left off.\n\n417\n00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:01,243\nThe steps we covered before the break,\n\n418\n00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:05,490\nthose are pretty much aligned with\nwhat we saw in incident management.\n\n419\n00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,000\nNow after the break,\nwe're gonna jump into the ones that differ\n\n420\n00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,680\nfrom incident management, and that starts\nwith problem investigation and diagnosis.\n\n421\n00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,690\nNow, we talked about doing diagnosis or\ninvestigation in incident management but\n\n422\n00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,560\nthere, you're investigating the incident\ntrying to figure out what the problem is.\n\n423\n00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,420\nHere, we're trying to figure out\nexactly what's causing the problem and\n\n424\n00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,910\nhow to fix it.\n\n425\n00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,450\nThis is definitely going beyond what you\nwould see in incident management and\n\n426\n00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,750\nit all stems from the fact that we're\nnow tracking the root cause and\n\n427\n00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,650\nfinding that root cause\ncan be a difficult thing.\n\n428\n00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,310\nYou might be in problem\nmanagement right right now but\n\n429\n00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,640\nyou still don't know what the problem is.\n\n430\n00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,590\nSo part of this might be isolating\nthat down and finding which one, or\n\n431\n00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,790\nwhat is exactly the problem.\n\n432\n00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,590\n>> Because ITIL is not really a\nprescriptive guide, and ITIL will tell you\n\n433\n00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,480\nthat, they're not teaching you how to\ndo each and every individual step.\n\n434\n00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,300\nThey do list multiple techniques that\nyou might use to go ahead and be able\n\n435\n00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,760\nto do the problem management as well, so\nwe've got a few that we want to point out.\n\n436\n00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,220\n>> Yeah, and it's really up to you,\nwhichever one you want to use.\n\n437\n00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,600\nDepending on your background,\nthere's a ton.\n\n438\n00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,720\nThey call out in the actual\nservice operation guide,\n\n439\n00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,470\nthere's ten or twelve different ones,\nsome of the big ones,\n\n440\n00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,250\nones you've probably heard of\nare things like fault isolation.\n\n441\n00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,040\nThat's usually one where I kinda start but\nyou got brainstorming,\n\n442\n00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,530\naffinity mapping, Ishikawa diagrams,\n\n443\n00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,100\nPareto analysis, all the different methods\nand techniques that are out there.\n\n444\n00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,580\nIf you haven't heard of all those,\ndon't sweat it.\n\n445\n00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,470\nThey don't make it onto the exam.\n\n446\n00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,510\nIf you go further though, if you actually\ngo to do the service operation exam,\n\n447\n00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,710\nthat one does go into a lot of those.\n\n448\n00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,866\nYou need to be familiar with them and it's\nall in the service operation guide for\n\n449\n00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:48,030\nITIL Foundation.\n\n450\n00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,750\nWe just need to be aware that\nthere's other techniques out there.\n\n451\n00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,840\nYou use the one that's most\nappropriate for your organization.\n\n452\n00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,540\nIf you don't have a technique, you\nshould probably research some of these.\n\n453\n00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,610\nThere's a ton of them that are out there.\n\n454\n00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,251\n>> We also can talk about using\nwhat we call a work around or\n\n455\n00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,870\nproblem management too.\n\n456\n00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,170\nSometimes when we're in the midst of\ntrying to figure out what the actual root\n\n457\n00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,335\ncause is and how to fix it- We may not\ncome up with a permanent solution, and\n\n458\n00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:16,367\nthat can be due to the timing and how\nfast we have to get things back up, but\n\n459\n00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:20,669\nwe may come up with what we call a\nworkaround, which is a temporary solution,\n\n460\n00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,902\na temporary fix, until we can actually\nfigure out what the actual issue is so\n\n461\n00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:28,250\nthat may be the way we also\nend up a taking a look.\n\n462\n00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:28,950\n>> Yeah, so for\n\n463\n00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,520\nexample, let's say you have a major power\noutage at your headquarters building.\n\n464\n00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,160\nYour headquarters is offline.\n\n465\n00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,580\nWell your workaround might be to have your\ndisaster recovery facility come online.\n\n466\n00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,074\nAnd everybody connects to that and\nnow your company is working again.\n\n467\n00:24:42,074 --> 00:24:45,850\nBut if short term, whenever power\nis restored to the headquarters\n\n468\n00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,590\nyou transition services back\nover to the headquarters.\n\n469\n00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,270\nNow you're back to normal operation,\nright.\n\n470\n00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,290\nThe work around was using your\ndisaster recovery center.\n\n471\n00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,680\nBut it was temporary, right.\n\n472\n00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,620\nWe don't wanna stay in the disaster\nrecovery center because we might have\n\n473\n00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,340\nfewer resources or\nlower capacity there, right?\n\n474\n00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,870\nSo it's a temporary thing,\nkind of a kludge or hacker\n\n475\n00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:12,000\nworkaround to get us around the problem\nuntil we can resolve our actual problem.\n\n476\n00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,900\nNow, when power is restored\nat the headquarters,\n\n477\n00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,540\nour problem has been fixed in a way.\n\n478\n00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,390\nBut we really need to continue to do some\nother analysis to say how can we prevent\n\n479\n00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,240\nthat in the future, right.\n\n480\n00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,010\nSo it does continue beyond that.\n\n481\n00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,530\nBut a workaround is designed to\nbe a temporary fix that just\n\n482\n00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,690\nminimizes the impact of the problem.\n\n483\n00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,480\nAnd that's kind of an optional step.\n\n484\n00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,360\nIn some scenarios you might not\nbother with a workaround if you\n\n485\n00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,210\nknow what the problem is and\nyou know how to fix it.\n\n486\n00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,830\nThe time you spend creating a workaround\nmight be longer than the time it would\n\n487\n00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,930\ntake to just fix the problem.\n\n488\n00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,830\nThis is one of those optional steps\nthat you may choose to leave out.\n\n489\n00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,340\nAnd just churn right\nthrough to the next step.\n\n490\n00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,250\n>> We can also take a look at\ncreating a known error record too.\n\n491\n00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,080\nJust like when we did in\nthe incident management,\n\n492\n00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,340\nwe wanna take a look at making sure that\nwe document what the actual error is and\n\n493\n00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,320\nalso be able of course to have,\nif possible, the actual resolution then.\n\n494\n00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,240\nBut if we can't, we'll make sure\nthat we at least document it, and\n\n495\n00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,380\nthat way other people could also\nbe able to submit their own\n\n496\n00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,310\ninformation to it to maybe help out and\nfigure out what we're gonna do next.\n\n497\n00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,570\n>> And that known error database, that\nis the main repository of knowledge for\n\n498\n00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,260\nthe Service Desk, right?\n\n499\n00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,720\nSo if we come up with a work around,\nhow do we let the Service Desk know?\n\n500\n00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,580\nWell we publish it in our\nknown error database.\n\n501\n00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,580\nAnd that way when they start\ngetting more calls for\n\n502\n00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,480\nthis problem, they can say, we're aware of\nthe issue, it's being worked on right now.\n\n503\n00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,660\nIn the meantime,\nif you follow these steps,\n\n504\n00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,410\nA B C D, then you can continue to work\nuntil we get this resolved, right.\n\n505\n00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,350\nOr, if you say, we're not doing a\nworkaround, we're working on the solution,\n\n506\n00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,030\nit should take approximately two hours.\n\n507\n00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,440\nThat goes in the known error database.\n\n508\n00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,940\nThis is a known existing\nerror in our environment\n\n509\n00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,880\nhere's the time frame for solving it.\n\n510\n00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,130\nCommunicate that to anybody\nthat calls in for an incident.\n\n511\n00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,680\nThis is all going back to the whole\nmodel of communications, right.\n\n512\n00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,000\nMaking sure that everyone's on\nthe same page as we move through\n\n513\n00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,560\nthe incidents and the problems.\n\n514\n00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,250\nNow our next step in there\nis problem resolution.\n\n515\n00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,480\nThe whole point of this is that if\nwe have a problem we need to get it\n\n516\n00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,290\nstraighten out.\n\n517\n00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,920\nNow unlike with an incident where you can\noften times resolve a person's incident\n\n518\n00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,690\nwithout doing a change ticket,\nwhen it comes to resolving a problem\n\n519\n00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,920\nit almost always results in a change or\na request for a change, a RFC.\n\n520\n00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,950\nSo once we find the solution, we've\ntested it, we've perfected it, we need to\n\n521\n00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,070\ndeploy it into our production environment\nto fix and get our services restored.\n\n522\n00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,660\nYou'll typically do a change ticket.\n\n523\n00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,620\nNow it might be an emergency change,\nright, if we're in a giant hurry,\n\n524\n00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,430\nbut you will still do a change ticket,\n\n525\n00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,990\nit will still be approved that creates\nthat documentation, that trail of exactly\n\n526\n00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,580\nwhat processes you went through before you\ncertified that change and pushed it in.\n\n527\n00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,920\nAnd if something goes wrong,\nyou've got your method to undo it.\n\n528\n00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,720\nWe're integrating change\nmanagement into this.\n\n529\n00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,400\nOne of the cool things is if we've got\nthe perfect solution, we push it out,\n\n530\n00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240\nproblem solved.\n\n531\n00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,880\nAnd it's a long term solution\ncuz we've removed the problem.\n\n532\n00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880\nAnd that takes care of any\nincident that was tied to it and\n\n533\n00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,990\nstops new incidents from\noccurring down the road.\n\n534\n00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,180\nIn some scenarios, this is actually\nsomething weird that can happen.\n\n535\n00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,920\nAnd this has never happened for me,\nbut it is in the ITIL guide, so\n\n536\n00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,090\nI wanna mention it.\n\n537\n00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,650\nWhich is, in some occasions,\nyou might create a workaround.\n\n538\n00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,160\nAnd in working through\nthe problem afterwards.\n\n539\n00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,370\nSo you create a workaround,\nyour end user's now fine, right?\n\n540\n00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,940\nThey're able to work.\n\n541\n00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,920\nYou're now analyzing the problem and\ntrying to come up with a solution.\n\n542\n00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:43,130\nYou might find that your workaround is\nthe best solution, that does happen.\n\n543\n00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,320\nOr you might find that the real solution\nis too expensive, or too timely,\n\n544\n00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,720\ntoo whatever, consumes too many\nresources or whatever, and so\n\n545\n00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,590\nyou decide, we're not going to fix\nthis problem, we're gonna leave it.\n\n546\n00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,880\nSo let's make the work around\npart of our official model.\n\n547\n00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,730\nSo the work around\nactually becomes the norm,\n\n548\n00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,100\nas opposed to being a temporary thing.\n\n549\n00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,910\nIt can happen.\n\n550\n00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,390\nIt's never happened for me, but it could.\n\n551\n00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,490\nAnd if that's the case,\nyou still have to do a request for\n\n552\n00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,540\nchange, because you got baselines, right.\n\n553\n00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,470\nA normal service operation NSO that's in\nplace and the workaround is now becoming\n\n554\n00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,850\npart of that baseline, or\npart of that normal service operation.\n\n555\n00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,810\nSo the change ticket is not saying\nI want to implement this change.\n\n556\n00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:29,220\nThe change ticket is saying I've\nalready implemented this change.\n\n557\n00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,820\nI want this to become normal.\n\n558\n00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,160\nAnd, it goes through\nthe change advisory board.\n\n559\n00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,750\nIt gets signed off and\n\n560\n00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,870\nnow what was a temporary solution\nbecomes the permanent one, right?\n\n561\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,750\nSo that is possible, but more commonly,\nthe request for change goes in and\n\n562\n00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,050\nwe remove our workaround and\nreplace it with the permanent solution,\n\n563\n00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,520\nor you leave the workaround in place, and\nthe permanent solution goes in beside it,\n\n564\n00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,010\nthat way users who have been told the\nworkaround can continue to do it that way,\n\n565\n00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,050\nor people can do things the normal way\nnow that the solution is in place.\n\n566\n00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,620\nKind of up to you which way we go on that.\n\n567\n00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,470\n>> Because problems can become more\ncomplex as we start working with them and\n\n568\n00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,170\nmore people get involved,\n\n569\n00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:10,670\nwe also want to make sure that everybody\nknows what page that we're on.\n\n570\n00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,130\nWhen the problem is actually resolved.\n\n571\n00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,300\nSo one of the best things that we can\ndo is we can close the problem out,\n\n572\n00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,750\nwe essentially label it and\nsay we've already fixed this problem, so\n\n573\n00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,780\nno one else goes ahead and continues\nto try and add more information to it,\n\n574\n00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,990\nit's fixed, it's resolved,\nwe want everybody to be able to know so\n\n575\n00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,810\nwe head into what we call, of course,\nthe problem closure state.\n\n576\n00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,370\n>> And\nthat's just everybody's in agreement,\n\n577\n00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,920\nthe problem is gonna resolve,\nand it's closed.\n\n578\n00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,810\nNow, unlike an incident,\nwhere we'll likely reopen an incident if\n\n579\n00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,380\nthe problem wasn't fixed,\nhere probably it's fixed.\n\n580\n00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,270\nAnd we know through thorough\ntesting that it has been repaired.\n\n581\n00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,570\nSo there shouldn't be a time that\nyou need to reopen a problem.\n\n582\n00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,150\nIf it does resurface,\n\n583\n00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,640\nit should be in some different form\nif you did your job correctly.\n\n584\n00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,170\nBut if done incorrectly,\nthen you might need to reopen a problem.\n\n585\n00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,370\nIt shouldn't happen.\n\n586\n00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,340\nIf we're thorough,\n\n587\n00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,380\nif we've analysed things, incidents might\nreopen but problems really shouldn't.\n\n588\n00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,190\nAnd that leads us to the final stage.\n\n589\n00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,008\nAnd this is something that we didn't\nreally talk about in incident management\n\n590\n00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:14,950\nbecause there we talked about logging\nin and getting our information.\n\n591\n00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,340\nBut, when it comes to a problem, this was\nsomething that was pretty significant.\n\n592\n00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,295\nIt's important to do a lessons learned and\n\n593\n00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:25,600\nITIL refers to this as\na Major Problem Review.\n\n594\n00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,050\nThe Major Problem Review just says,\nhere's what the problem was.\n\n595\n00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,320\nHere's how we fixed it.\n\n596\n00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,030\nThose are the two important pieces.\n\n597\n00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,860\nAnd then other valuable information to\ninclude, not just what the problem was and\n\n598\n00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,690\nhow we fixed it.\n\n599\n00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:42,000\nBut why the problem happened,\nhow it could have been prevented,\n\n600\n00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,500\nand what we recommend doing in the future\nto make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n601\n00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,980\nWe had a power outage at our home office,\nso we had to go to DR\n\n602\n00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,840\nwe fixed it by waiting for\nthe power company to restore power, right.\n\n603\n00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,670\nAnd we didn't do anything.\n\n604\n00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,253\nWe sat on our butts and waited for\npower company to restore power.\n\n605\n00:31:57,253 --> 00:32:00,772\nAnd then once that was done,\nwe moved everybody back to production, and\n\n606\n00:32:00,772 --> 00:32:02,222\nwe were happy again, right.\n\n607\n00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:06,293\nBut in the future, if we want to prevent\nthis from happening again We should really\n\n608\n00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,709\ninvest in some generators or\n\n609\n00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:11,610\nif we're in a large enough city we can\ndraw in power from a separate grid.\n\n610\n00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,800\nThere's different things we can do to make\nour headquarters survive the power outage,\n\n611\n00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,040\nand not have to worry about the disaster\nrecovery center, all right.\n\n612\n00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,310\nAnd maybe we need to take those steps.\n\n613\n00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,030\nOr maybe we know that\nwe could add redundant\n\n614\n00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,700\nexternal generators to our building and\nrun for weeks on end on diesel fuel.\n\n615\n00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,920\nBut it's really expensive.\n\n616\n00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,540\nAnd we say, you know what,\nwe've got the disaster recovery center.\n\n617\n00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,830\nThat's what it's there for.\n\n618\n00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,020\nSo we'll just rely on that.\n\n619\n00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,280\nWe know we can fail over\nfrom headquarters to DR.\n\n620\n00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,940\nSo we're not going to fix this problem,\nand we're going to make it a part\n\n621\n00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,620\nof our major problem review here\nto say we've accepted the risks.\n\n622\n00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,650\nWe know that there's a risk we could\nlose power at our home office.\n\n623\n00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,990\nBut instead of fixing it we're let\nit ride and here's our procedure for\n\n624\n00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,530\ndealing with that.\n\n625\n00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,350\nIf there's a power outage at\nthe home office, bail over to DR.\n\n626\n00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,730\nAnd because it's now a policy,\n\n627\n00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,010\nit's our procedure, we don't need change\ntickets and incident reviews and all that.\n\n628\n00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,990\nWe just need to say,\nall right, we lost power here,\n\n629\n00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,910\nhere's our process let's follow it,\nall right.\n\n630\n00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,430\nIt's not a problem anymore,\n\n631\n00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,990\nit's just known operation that becomes\npart of our normal service operation.\n\n632\n00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,910\nThe power goes out, we fail over.\n\n633\n00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,940\nThat's a big, big thing, right?\n\n634\n00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,450\nTo make sure that we recognize that and\ndocument it.\n\n635\n00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,140\nThat's major problem review.\n\n636\n00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,320\nSo those are the main steps right\nthere in problem management.\n\n637\n00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,200\nLet's just recap those because\nthere's a lot of them and\n\n638\n00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,830\nwe spread it across the break.\n\n639\n00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,460\nSo we started out almost\nidentical to incident management.\n\n640\n00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,750\nWe did problem identification\nto know the problem was there.\n\n641\n00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,850\nWe did problem logging\nto document the problem.\n\n642\n00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,020\nAnd product categorization to apply\nlabels to help us with With analysis.\n\n643\n00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,941\n[LAUGH] I can say it.\n\n644\n00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When we get to\n\n645\n00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,480\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n646\n00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,780\nAnd problem prioritization to weight\nthe significance of this problem.\n\n647\n00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,245\nBut it was a little different than\nwe say in incident management.\n\n648\n00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:05,980\nBecause here we're taking into\naccount the incident themselves and\n\n649\n00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,170\nthen how many of them are rolling in.\n\n650\n00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,650\nTo influence how urgent this is,\nall right.\n\n651\n00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,560\nThen we branched off and\nwe saw problem investigation and\n\n652\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,110\ndiagnosis where we dive\nin to find the cause.\n\n653\n00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,640\nThe work around development, if we've\ngot a workaround to get people up and\n\n654\n00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,920\ngoing to minimize the problem.\n\n655\n00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,990\nRaising a known error record.\n\n656\n00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,780\nThat was generating the known error and\nputting it in the known error database.\n\n657\n00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,780\nThe problem resolution, which is\nsimilar to the incident resolution.\n\n658\n00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,100\nThe problem closure,\nwhere we shut things down.\n\n659\n00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,370\nAnd then the major problem review.\n\n660\n00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:43,150\nThose are our overall steps as we\nmove through the actual process of\n\n661\n00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,700\nproblem management.\n\n662\n00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:51,030\nAll right well that brings us to our last\nprocess, which is access management.\n\n663\n00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,460\nBut let's do this.\n\n664\n00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,905\nWe might have enough\ntime in here to cover it.\n\n665\n00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:57,565\nBut just to be on the safe\nside let's pause for a break.\n\n666\n00:34:57,565 --> 00:35:00,695\nAnd when we get back we're going\nto tackle access management\n\n667\n00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:02,575\nwhich is the end of service operations for\nus.\n\n668\n00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:03,145\nSo stay tuned.\n\n669\n00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:05,870\nWe'll be back in just a moment.\n\n670\n00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:13,445\n[SOUND] All right welcome back everybody.\n\n671\n00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:18,180\nSo our final process for\nservice operation is access management.\n\n672\n00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,220\nAnd it's one of the simpler concepts,\nright.\n\n673\n00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,610\nWe're really just controlling\npeople's ability to use a service.\n\n674\n00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,590\nWhen you offer a service it's rare\nthat you want to just turn it\n\n675\n00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,440\nloose to the wilds and\nlet everybody do what they want with it.\n\n676\n00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,670\nYou're normally going to\nrestrict at a minimum,\n\n677\n00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,320\nusers abilities to interact\nwith each other's data.\n\n678\n00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,200\nSo you wouldn't want user A to be\nable to mess with user Bs data.\n\n679\n00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,500\nThat's kind of at a minimum.\n\n680\n00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,940\nBut usually even more so you're going to\nlimit who's even allowed to log in and\n\n681\n00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,280\nuse this service.\n\n682\n00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,210\nAnd, I've said log in, that's really the\nprimary way that we do access management.\n\n683\n00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,020\nTechnically, access management can cover\nother things like physical access and\n\n684\n00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,870\nBiometrics and so\n\n685\n00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:00,880\non, but more commonly it's just\ndealing with simple software access.\n\n686\n00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,690\nThe person's ability to\neven get the software,\n\n687\n00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,530\nif it's software that's the service.\n\n688\n00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,940\nOr just to be able to log in.\n\n689\n00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,930\nA username and password,\n\n690\n00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:11,830\nwhatever mechanism that is that's what\nwe're dealing with with access management.\n\n691\n00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,040\n>> When the access management then,\nthere are several different pieces\n\n692\n00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,860\nthat really help us to make sure\nthat we're doing it correctly.\n\n693\n00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,520\nSo the first thing that we may\nwant to tackle of course is\n\n694\n00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,290\nhow that user's going to\nbe requesting the access.\n\n695\n00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,870\nIt may come through just\na regular request for a change or\n\n696\n00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,770\nwe may have another process\nthat we choose to follow.\n\n697\n00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,850\nNow remember we talked about our\npre-authorized non-significant changes.\n\n698\n00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,630\nThose service requests, right?\n\n699\n00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,420\nOr a request for\n\n700\n00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,620\nservice, that we dealt with within\nthe request fulfillment process.\n\n701\n00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,740\nSo, maybe you hired a new employee and\nthat new employee needs to get access.\n\n702\n00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,600\nWell, they filed a service request, right?\n\n703\n00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,470\nNot an incident, just a request and\nwe need this to be done.\n\n704\n00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,050\nAnd as part of request fulfillment,\nthe service desk or whoever has authority\n\n705\n00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,940\nwill go through and create the user\naccount and assign permissions.\n\n706\n00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,500\nSo, it originated in request fulfillment.\n\n707\n00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,740\nBut the actual work is done\nright here in access management.\n\n708\n00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,540\nRight?\nThey're granting that access.\n\n709\n00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,410\nSo, where that request\ncomes from can vary.\n\n710\n00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,170\nRight?\n\n711\n00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,145\nNew users, those things come\nfrom request fulfillment.\n\n712\n00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:20,865\nOther things might come\nfrom well service you know.\n\n713\n00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,045\nAlways say in service integration\nI just can't seem to.\n\n714\n00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:23,765\n>> Transition.\n\n715\n00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:24,735\n>> Get it straight here.\n\n716\n00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:28,595\nService transition is we're deploying\na new service into production.\n\n717\n00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:32,225\nYou know when we're bringing that in\nas part of the service design package.\n\n718\n00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:35,115\nIt may have these accounts need to\nbe created for this purpose and\n\n719\n00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:36,640\nwhat access they need.\n\n720\n00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,470\nAnd I did kind of leave one thing out.\n\n721\n00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,890\nWhich is if not necessarily\njust granting someone access,\n\n722\n00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,310\nit might be removing that access too.\n\n723\n00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,330\nSo this could be a termination\nrequest coming in from\n\n724\n00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,540\nhuman resources or wherever.\n\n725\n00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,825\nAnd those will typically flow\nthrough the service desk also.\n\n726\n00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:55,395\n>> We also want to make sure that\nwe put some way of verifying\n\n727\n00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:57,345\nwho we're going to provide the service to.\n\n728\n00:37:57,345 --> 00:38:00,295\nWe can talk about making\nsure that we go ahead and\n\n729\n00:38:00,295 --> 00:38:05,475\nare able to verify that the user is\nwho he claims to be and also the level\n\n730\n00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:09,600\nthat they're going to actually use in\nour service that we provide to them.\n\n731\n00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,570\nDon, a lot of this sounds\nlike authentication and\n\n732\n00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,040\nauthorization is what it sounds like.\n\n733\n00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,970\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n734\n00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,900\nThat's what access\nmanagement is all about.\n\n735\n00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,500\nYou'll hear a lot of IT companies\nrefer to this as triple A.\n\n736\n00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,750\nAuthentication, authorization,\nand accounting.\n\n737\n00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,750\nWell in ITIL, we just wrap that\nup under access management.\n\n738\n00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,980\nThat's what you're doing.\n\n739\n00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,560\nNo just keep in mind, this is the hard\npart to wrap your head around.\n\n740\n00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,650\nA lot of people will get pigeon holed and\nthing username and password.\n\n741\n00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,240\nBut it could be other things too.\n\n742\n00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,240\nWhen we say verify the user is\nwho they claim to be, right,\n\n743\n00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,820\nthat they are who they say they are.\n\n744\n00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,960\nHow do you do that?\n\n745\n00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,020\nBiometrics, a thumb print, that'll do it.\n\n746\n00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:51,960\nA retinal scan, a token that they hold,\na key card, RFID, something like that,\n\n747\n00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,090\nsomething, some method for\nthem to authenticate who they are, right?\n\n748\n00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,760\nAnd, access management,\nthe verification piece,\n\n749\n00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,660\nthat's what that deals with is\nwhich method we choose to employ.\n\n750\n00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,480\nNow, once they've authenticated,\nonce they've\n\n751\n00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,380\nproven they are who they say they are\nthat's when we move into authorization.\n\n752\n00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,710\nWhat are they allowed to do?\n\n753\n00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,950\nSo authentication and\nauthorization are very much present here.\n\n754\n00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,340\nBut in the ITIL world,\nauthentication is called verification.\n\n755\n00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,820\nAnd authorization,\nfiguring out what they're allowed to do,\n\n756\n00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,740\nthat's called providing rights.\n\n757\n00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,810\nIt's a right that a person is exercising.\n\n758\n00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,730\nSo, they're not authorized to\ndo something specifically, but\n\n759\n00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,580\nthey're granted the right to be\nable to perform that action.\n\n760\n00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,910\nSo, do they have the right to unlock\nthat door and walk into the building?\n\n761\n00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,230\nDo they have the right to log\ninto this software and use it?\n\n762\n00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,390\nDo they have the right to be able to\nconnect to the wireless network, right?\n\n763\n00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,860\nThese are all things that we\ncontrol with access management, and\n\n764\n00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,260\nits their possession of the right\nthat lets them do that.\n\n765\n00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,445\n>> As we continue to allow users to\nuse the service that we provide,\n\n766\n00:39:55,445 --> 00:40:00,004\nwe need to make sure that we're monitoring\ntheir identity so that we can provide\n\n767\n00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:04,172\nthe proper access that they need and\nnot provide too much nor too little.\n\n768\n00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:07,496\n>> Yeah remember that somebody's\nstatus can change, right.\n\n769\n00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,097\nSo maybe five weeks ago.\n\n770\n00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:14,464\nWe got a service request in to grant a\nparticular user access to the system, and\n\n771\n00:40:14,464 --> 00:40:15,389\nso we did that and\n\n772\n00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:19,250\nfive weeks have gone by, and\nthat user's had access the whole time.\n\n773\n00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,860\nNow, we go back and\nwe do an audit and we find that,\n\n774\n00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,460\nthat employee was terminated three\nweeks ago but nobody told us.\n\n775\n00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,240\nThe account's been active.\n\n776\n00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,370\nThat user could still use the whole\nsystem, they just never got terminated.\n\n777\n00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,790\nThey never got removed from our system.\n\n778\n00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,540\nTheir access was never revoked.\n\n779\n00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,710\nWe always need to be on the watch for\nthat.\n\n780\n00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,070\nThere's of things that could cause it.\n\n781\n00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,110\nThis could be an employee who is\nterminated, employee could die.\n\n782\n00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,940\nDon't need access if they're dead,\nI assume.\n\n783\n00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,280\nWho knows what people do in their\nspare time when they're dead?\n\n784\n00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,000\nSo those are some kind of\ndrastic scenarios there.\n\n785\n00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,780\nThe employee was completely removed.\n\n786\n00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,940\nIt might not be so\n\n787\n00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,590\nmuch that they're removed,\nas just their job role has changed.\n\n788\n00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,680\nMaybe they got certain access because\nthey were attached to a project and\n\n789\n00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,270\nthe project is over and\nnow that the project is over,\n\n790\n00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,830\nthey don't need that\nlevel of access anymore.\n\n791\n00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,790\nThey still need access, they still need\nto be able to get into the system for\n\n792\n00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,520\ntheir normal operations activities but\n\n793\n00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,850\nthe extra access they got as a part\nof that project is no longer needed.\n\n794\n00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,360\nSo we need to go back in,\nremove the extra access.\n\n795\n00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,180\nSo in that scenario, we're actually just\nreducing their access, not eliminating,\n\n796\n00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,220\njust reducing,\nas opposed to granting access.\n\n797\n00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,130\nSo it does kind of go both ways.\n\n798\n00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,060\nSo demotion, transfer,\ntermination, any number\n\n799\n00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:41,100\nof scenarios are things that might cause\nsomebody's level of access to change.\n\n800\n00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,990\n>> We can also take a look at logging and\n\n801\n00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,170\ntracking the access that our users\nare also needing to the service.\n\n802\n00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,540\nWe might do this, not only for\nhistorical purposes,\n\n803\n00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,235\nbut this way, we actually can be\nable to provide better for them.\n\n804\n00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:58,930\nIf we have too many users at one time, it\nmight give us a hint that we might need to\n\n805\n00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,535\nadd in additional servers or we might\nneed to change our service to provide for\n\n806\n00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:05,300\na better experience for the user.\n\n807\n00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,730\n>> Outside of ITIL this is commonly\nknown as auditing or accounting.\n\n808\n00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,000\nIt's really the same thing and\nhere, we just call it logging and\n\n809\n00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,270\ntracking, it's the same idea.\n\n810\n00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,970\nAll four could really be\ninterchanged as terms.\n\n811\n00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,705\nOn the exam, you see logging and tracking.\n\n812\n00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:26,840\nWe need a log, to keep a record of\nwhen people access the system, and\n\n813\n00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,550\nwhen they access the system,\nwe need to understand what they're doing.\n\n814\n00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,180\n>> They might be accessing\nmultiple servers as part of their\n\n815\n00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,200\nongoing activities just as\nthey work in your system.\n\n816\n00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,560\nWe need to be able to track that and\n\n817\n00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,960\nkeep a record of it, that way we\ncan detect any unauthorized access.\n\n818\n00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,470\nWhen we see someone accessing\nthe system with old credentials or\n\n819\n00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,610\ncredentials that shouldn't even be active\nanymore, or an account that's unknown,\n\n820\n00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,750\nthat kind of thing.\n\n821\n00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,100\nIf an incident occurs, we want to be\nable to go and check and see who was in\n\n822\n00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,030\nthe system when that incident occurred,\nespecially when it comes to security.\n\n823\n00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,400\nSo this does normally fall under\nthe realm of IT security and\n\n824\n00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,670\nin their world, it's usually\ncalled auditing and accounting.\n\n825\n00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,140\nThose are the different kinda names there,\n\n826\n00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,340\nwhich basically corresponds\nwith logging and tracking.\n\n827\n00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,500\n>> Lastly, we can take a look at removing\nor restricting access to a user.\n\n828\n00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,730\nWe wanna make sure that we do this,\n\n829\n00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,250\nespecially because users identities do\nchange in our system, whether it's due to\n\n830\n00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,830\na promotion or a transfer, or the very\nfact that they've just been terminated.\n\n831\n00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:29,840\nWe don't want to give access to people\nthat don't really need it anymore.\n\n832\n00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,050\nWe wanna be able to have\nthe control that we need so\n\n833\n00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,960\nthat we can provide the best\npossible service that we can.\n\n834\n00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,390\n>> That's basically what it boils down to,\n\n835\n00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,970\naccess management should\nnever be a guessing game.\n\n836\n00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:46,150\nAccess management is all about having a\npolicy in place, a set of procedures that\n\n837\n00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,770\nsay, here's how people request access,\nhere's how we grant them the access.\n\n838\n00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,670\nHere's how we monitor them to ensure they\nstill need it and then here's how we\n\n839\n00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,970\nremove the access when they no longer need\nit and it's black and white, plain as day.\n\n840\n00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,720\nWe define that policy and then we turn it\nover to whoever the rights' manager is,\n\n841\n00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,180\nwhoever it is that's in charge\nof granting that access and\n\n842\n00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,940\nthat might be your service desk,\nit might not.\n\n843\n00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,960\nIn a high security environment,\nthe service desk might\n\n844\n00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,650\nnot have the authority to do that,\nso it might have to get escalated.\n\n845\n00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,150\nIt's up to you to define that for\nyour organization.\n\n846\n00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,380\nFor most organizations though,\n\n847\n00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,060\nthey'll let the service desk handle that\nbecause those are easy, low risk tickets.\n\n848\n00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,650\nA new employee is hired,\nwe need to grant them some access.\n\n849\n00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,300\nIt's pretty common.\n\n850\n00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,010\nNow, we might not let them set\npermissions on a file or on a server but\n\n851\n00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,120\nwe might let them manage\ngroup memberships.\n\n852\n00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,650\nSo I might have a group\ncalled accountants, and\n\n853\n00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,600\nthe service desk is allowed to put\npeople in the accountants group, or\n\n854\n00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,750\ntake people out of the accountants group.\n\n855\n00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,210\nThen, on the admin side,\nwe've added permissions to that group.\n\n856\n00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,490\nSo the service desk is not able to\nmodify the permissions themselves,\n\n857\n00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,720\nthey're just allowed to modify\nwho's in this one particular group.\n\n858\n00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,940\nThey can stick people in, take them out,\nto grant and remove the permissions and\n\n859\n00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,350\nthat's normally how we see that\nimplemented in production.\n\n860\n00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,190\nWhat worked for you might be different,\neverybody can have their own solution.\n\n861\n00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,280\nThat's just a common scenario right there.\n\n862\n00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:12,490\nWith that we've wrapped up the last\nprocess inside of service operation.\n\n863\n00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:16,740\nSo let's recap all the different things\nwe talked about in the last two episodes.\n\n864\n00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,160\nWe started out with the event management.\n\n865\n00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,940\nThat's just tracking of events,\n\n866\n00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:27,190\nwhenever our system differs from the\nbaseline of the normal service operation.\n\n867\n00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,020\nWe did incident management.\n\n868\n00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,870\nWhen things don't go in line\nwith the baseline, when\n\n869\n00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:36,160\nsomething unexpected occurs, we jump into\nincident management to try and resolve it.\n\n870\n00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,460\nAfter that we had requests fulfillment and\nrequest fulfillment and\n\n871\n00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,100\nincident management\nstart out the same way.\n\n872\n00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,730\nThey both start with a call to the service\ndesk and then from there they deviate.\n\n873\n00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,030\nWith incident management,\nwe have escalations and troubleshooting.\n\n874\n00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,870\nWith request fulfillment, we're just\nperforming a canned pre-authorized\n\n875\n00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,850\naction like creating a user account and\nwe carry that through.\n\n876\n00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,360\nIf we went into incident management,\nthough, the follow up for\n\n877\n00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,990\nthat is our next one which\nwas problem management.\n\n878\n00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,210\nWe try and find the cause, the root\ncause of that incident and correct it.\n\n879\n00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,990\nLastly, access management,\n\n880\n00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,150\nwhich kind of just falls to\nthe side of all these other ones.\n\n881\n00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,740\nThe other ones are all\nreally closely related,\n\n882\n00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,060\nand with access management we just control\npeople's ability to use the service.\n\n883\n00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,890\nThose are our primary components.\n\n884\n00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,370\n>> All these processes\nreally go into ensuring\n\n885\n00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,320\nthat we're providing the best thing\nthat we can for our customer.\n\n886\n00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,690\nWe're making sure that we're giving them\nthe day to day access that they need and\n\n887\n00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,570\nthat everything is meeting up to\nthose performance baselines or\n\n888\n00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,670\nthose baselines that we've set.\n\n889\n00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:42,170\nAnything that deviates from that, this is\nwhere we have a chance to correct that and\n\n890\n00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,520\nthat's what we wanna\nmake sure that we can do.\n\n891\n00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,080\nLadies and gentlemen, with that,\nwe've wrapped up service organization.\n\n892\n00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,150\nSo we're ready to progress on\nto the very last service area,\n\n893\n00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,020\nwhich is continual service improvement.\n\n894\n00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,460\nI know we referred to it multiple\ntimes throughout the last two episodes\n\n895\n00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,300\n>> So it's that logical next step.\n\n896\n00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,730\nSo we hope to see you on that video but in\nthe meantime, let me just remind you guys,\n\n897\n00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,580\nif you have questions on any of this,\nplease let us know.\n\n898\n00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,690\nLive during the show you\ncan got

today.\n\n908\n00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:35,240\nI don't know why I've started\nsaying video all of a sudden.\n\n909\n00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll file that away with\n\n910\n00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:40,595\nservice integration,\nmy new made up word for the day but\n\n911\n00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:43,265\nhope you guys enjoyed it,\nreally hope to see you next time.\n\n912\n00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:45,875\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n913\n00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:46,825\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n914\n00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:48,605\n>> And we'll

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,081\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,520\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,100\nBack again with Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,210\nHow's it going Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,045\n>> It is cold.\n\n10\n00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,280\n[LAUGH] It is plain cold in Florida.\n\n11\n00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,545\nIt's not supposed to be this cold.\n\n12\n00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:49,420\nIt is cold.\n\n13\n00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,076\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n14\n00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:52,070\nthis is one of those nice chilly days for\nus.\n\n15\n00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,961\nProbably be our coldest one on record for\nthe year.\n\n16\n00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:55,540\n>> So far.\n\n17\n00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,270\n>> But that's not gonna stop us-\n>> That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,960\n>> From jumping right back\ninto ITIL Foundations.\n\n19\n00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,320\nIn fact, this will more than likely be our\nfinal episode for ITIL Foundations because\n\n20\n00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,750\nthe only area we haven't hit is\nthe continual service improvement.\n\n21\n00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,910\nAnd that's what we're gonna be\ntackling in this episode right here.\n\n22\n00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,030\nAll of the other service areas that\nwe talked about, service strategies,\n\n23\n00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,115\nservice design.\n\n24\n00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:22,660\nWe did service transition and then service\noperation, the four main areas there.\n\n25\n00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,350\nThat's stuff that companies do all\nthe time, getting the service created,\n\n26\n00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,110\ngetting it into production.\n\n27\n00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,710\nAnd then using it, actually making\nit available to the customer.\n\n28\n00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,070\nBut once that's all done, what do we do?\n\n29\n00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,430\nWe don't just sit back.\n\n30\n00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,500\nWe look at what we've got and\nwe see how we can make it better.\n\n31\n00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,440\nAnd that's how we really get into\nthis area which is continual service\n\n32\n00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,480\nimprovement, and\nthat key word there is continual.\n\n33\n00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,740\nThis is not something that you just\ndo once and you call it a day.\n\n34\n00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,600\nYou continually look for\nways to make that service better and,\n\n35\n00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,240\nby making it better I mean increasing\nthe value to the customer.\n\n36\n00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,780\n>> Remember that we might think\nwe provide the perfect service.\n\n37\n00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,510\nBut because the very fact that business\nchanges, our needs change, the customers'\n\n38\n00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,515\nneeds changes, we always have to be\nin that cycle of reviewing our work,\n\n39\n00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,640\nmaking sure it's actually\nthe best possible.\n\n40\n00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,686\nAnd so ITIL includes that in as part of\nthe foundation that we all have to do when\n\n41\n00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:20,194\nwe are providing a service.\n\n42\n00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:24,233\nIs that we can't just sit back and expect\nthat everything's gonna go 100% right.\n\n43\n00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:28,545\nNor can we expect that what we did today\nis actually even good even for tomorrow.\n\n44\n00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:33,220\n>> Yeah, so when we talk about continual\nservice improvement we're not typically\n\n45\n00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,430\njust talking about a single service.\n\n46\n00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,490\nWe're talking about just our operations as\na whole, all the services that we offer.\n\n47\n00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,460\nSo when I say that we're gonna be\nimproving value to our customer,\n\n48\n00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,140\nwe're improving the value by maintaining\nthe proper service portfolio.\n\n49\n00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,710\nSo as we do improvements, yes,\nwe might be improving a single service.\n\n50\n00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,200\nIt might be something that we're making\nbetter, more efficient, less expensive,\n\n51\n00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,240\nwhatever it is that we\ndo to make that better.\n\n52\n00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,620\nBut it might also be adding additional\nservices, services that shore up some kind\n\n53\n00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,300\nof gap that we had, that maybe we\nhave identified some kind of missing\n\n54\n00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,360\ncomponent that's stopping us from\nmeeting our strategy, our goals.\n\n55\n00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,770\nSo there's all sorts of different types\nof improvements that are out there,\n\n56\n00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,230\nand the people at ITIL that\nhave drafted all of this,\n\n57\n00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,200\nthey can't predict every possible outcome.\n\n58\n00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,250\nAnd they don't even know what type\nof business you're operating in.\n\n59\n00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,890\nSo what we're looking at\nhere is just a framework.\n\n60\n00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,270\nA framework of what we\ncan do to go through and\n\n61\n00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,330\naddress our services and find unique\nways that match our individual business.\n\n62\n00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,220\nTo make them better, make them more\nefficient and keep that path going on.\n\n63\n00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,420\nSo that's what CSI is and that's kind of\nwhere we're gonna be jumping into this.\n\n64\n00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,260\nCSI, one fallacy that I kinda wanted to\ndeal with right here in the beginning.\n\n65\n00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,650\nA lot of people think we go ahead and\n\n66\n00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,050\ndeploy the service, and\nthen we start applying CSI afterwards.\n\n67\n00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,770\nBut continual service improvement actually\nstarts way back in the very beginning,\n\n68\n00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,000\neven before the service is in production.\n\n69\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,740\nAnd you might say,\n\n70\n00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,590\nwell how am I suppose to make a service\nbetter if it's not even there?\n\n71\n00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,250\nWell, simply reviewing.\n\n72\n00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,760\nReviewing the plans, reviewing\nthe strategies that have come up with,\n\n73\n00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,080\nreviewing the design,\nthe service design package, that SDP.\n\n74\n00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,220\nReviewing that and\nlooking for weaknesses and\n\n75\n00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,880\nareas to improve,\nthat's all a part of CSI.\n\n76\n00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,280\nNow we don't normally call it that,\n\n77\n00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,010\nwe don't say oh yeah, I'm doing\ncontinual service improvement right now.\n\n78\n00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,240\nWe just say, oh, we're doing\nanother peer review of this design.\n\n79\n00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,711\nWe're having another\nbrainstorming session.\n\n80\n00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,122\nThat is continual service improvement.\n\n81\n00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:34,500\nSo it really happens throughout\nthe entire life cycle of a service,\n\n82\n00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000\nnot just after it's reached production.\n\n83\n00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n84\n00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,570\nWe do this intuitively,\nif we've done a project before and\n\n85\n00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,650\nwe've realized,\nwe've made mistakes in the past.\n\n86\n00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,920\nAs we begin the new project, we go back\nand say, what can I do better this time?\n\n87\n00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,920\nAs we continue to do that it ingrains\nin us, it becomes more a part of us.\n\n88\n00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,387\n>> And even though we don't call it\na continual service improvement,\n\n89\n00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:56,040\nthat's exactly what we're doing.\n\n90\n00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920\nBecause we realize something.\n\n91\n00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,170\nWe're not actually, again,\nable to do everything perfectly.\n\n92\n00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,550\nAnd what we know is that everything\ncan be improved upon, so\n\n93\n00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,980\nthat's why we wanna continue\non in this process.\n\n94\n00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,250\n>> And now for each of the service\nareas in our previous shows,\n\n95\n00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,470\nwe've really divided them into\nthe primary processes, right.\n\n96\n00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,680\nSo here's the things you do as\na part of this service area.\n\n97\n00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,510\nSo when your dealing with service design,\nhere's the processes we go through.\n\n98\n00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,780\nWell each of those\nprocesses have an output.\n\n99\n00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,305\nThere's an input, the information we\nfeed into them and an output, and\n\n100\n00:05:24,305 --> 00:05:27,485\nthe output often times is\njust more information.\n\n101\n00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:30,095\nSometimes the output is\nthe actual service or\n\n102\n00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,415\na manual that tells the service\ndesk how to handle support calls.\n\n103\n00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,690\nThere's various other things\nthat might be output.\n\n104\n00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,880\nBut regardless of what the output is,\n\n105\n00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,660\nall of the output that comes out of\na process can serve as an input into CSI.\n\n106\n00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,470\nAnd ITIL calls this a feedback loop,\nright.\n\n107\n00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,870\nWe perform the activities\ninside of a process.\n\n108\n00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,720\nThe data that comes out of it\nwe use that appropriate, but\n\n109\n00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,020\nwe also send that into CSI.\n\n110\n00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,920\nCSI takes a look at the output and\n\n111\n00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,700\nsays, is there a way this\noutput could have been better?\n\n112\n00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,770\nCould have more closely met\nour customer's needs or\n\n113\n00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,140\nmore closely met our company's strategy?\n\n114\n00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,180\nIs there something we\ncan do to improve this?\n\n115\n00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,360\nAnd then we figure out what that is, and\nwe create a change, a request for change.\n\n116\n00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,128\nWe implement the change, and\nthen that's the new process.\n\n117\n00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,316\nAnd the output from that new\nprocess that just got changed,\n\n118\n00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:24,040\nwell that output goes back into CSI again.\n\n119\n00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,590\nSo this is a cycle.\n\n120\n00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,600\nIt's happening over and\nover and over again.\n\n121\n00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,170\nAnd that's a feedback loop.\n\n122\n00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,250\nYou get feedback, you process it,\nit goes back into the system.\n\n123\n00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,110\nYou get new feedback and you continue.\n\n124\n00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,130\nThat's why we call it\ncontinual service improvement.\n\n125\n00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:41,590\n>> Most of this is based off of what\nis also known as the Deming cycle, or\n\n126\n00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,940\npart of the PDCA process too.\n\n127\n00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,040\nAnd this comes from a man that\nactually did this around the turn of\n\n128\n00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,470\nthe last century.\n\n129\n00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,078\nDoug Deming, or Douglas Deming, Dr.\nDouglas Deming.\n\n130\n00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,628\n>> Your buddy Doug.\n\n131\n00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,752\n>> Doug, my bud.\n\n132\n00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:56,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He and I are pals.\n\n133\n00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,600\nDouglas Deming.\n\n134\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,480\nAnd he really based his\nprocess around analytics.\n\n135\n00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,150\nHe wanted everything to be done\njust around very carefully\n\n136\n00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,140\nthinking about the steps that we take,\nand the information that we get,\n\n137\n00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,415\nand how we can reuse that\ninformation over and over again.\n\n138\n00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:16,410\nAnd in neat processes that he really\nwanted us to honor that scientific\n\n139\n00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,930\nmethod that Francis Bacon came up with.\n\n140\n00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,180\nSo instead of actually taking\nthose scientific method steps,\n\n141\n00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,580\nhe turned them into business\nanalytics steps to be able to help.\n\n142\n00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,580\nAnd later on he even changed\nthis process a little bit.\n\n143\n00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,310\nBut ITIL goes back to the original\nfoundations because theirs is more\n\n144\n00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,720\naction oriented toward the management and\nservice side.\n\n145\n00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,720\n>> Yeah, and similarly you'll see a lot\nof this is used in manufacturing.\n\n146\n00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,620\nRight, you'll see companies\nthat manufacture cars or\n\n147\n00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,860\na physical, tangible product.\n\n148\n00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,868\nThey're really concerned about CSI.\n\n149\n00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:55,772\nThey're really concerned about how to\nmake their output yield better results.\n\n150\n00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:59,951\nWe use Intel as an example,\nwhen Intel manufactures processors.\n\n151\n00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:04,811\nRight, so If you got an Apple device or\na Windows device the odds are your\n\n152\n00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:09,680\nprocessor was made by Intel,\nmaybe AMD in some cases but mostly Intel.\n\n153\n00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,090\nAnd when they make those processors,\nthey make them in batches.\n\n154\n00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,080\nSo they might make a thousand processors\nat once and when they do that,\n\n155\n00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,870\nthe way they machine them, they actually\nexpect a certain percentage to fail.\n\n156\n00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,610\nAnd when it's a brand new processor\nthat they're just rolling out,\n\n157\n00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,150\nthey can have failure rates of up to 50%.\n\n158\n00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,840\nSo they make a thousand CPUs and only 500\nof them are suitable to sell, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,590\nWell, over time they improve their\nprocess, they refine their technology and\n\n160\n00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,510\nthey make it better.\n\n161\n00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,250\nAnd they get to where they're\nmaking that same thousand CPUs but\n\n162\n00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,660\nthis time 80% are ready to sell.\n\n163\n00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,550\nThat increases their profits,\n\n164\n00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,880\nthey're getting more money out\nof the yields they generate.\n\n165\n00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,360\nSo in the manufacturing world,\nthis is a very common topic.\n\n166\n00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,500\nAnd there are entire methodologies and\n\n167\n00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,570\nfundamental theories build around\nthis just for manufacturing.\n\n168\n00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,040\nAnd that's where you'll\nsee things like Six Sigma,\n\n169\n00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,380\nwhich is a big buzz word you'll hear.\n\n170\n00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,000\nBut that doesn't necessarily\napply very well to IT.\n\n171\n00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,740\nWith IT, we're not normally\nproducing a tangible service, right?\n\n172\n00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,280\nSomething that you can hold in your hand.\n\n173\n00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,120\nIt's a web server or a web page and\nit becomes very difficult to measure.\n\n174\n00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,215\nSo what ITIL does is it takes those\nconcepts starting with the Deming cycle,\n\n175\n00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:23,940\nplan-do-check-act and\nit kind of retrofits it or\n\n176\n00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,140\nmodifies it to match up\nwith the IT environment.\n\n177\n00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,440\nAnd they do that by exploding\nthe pieces a little bit and\n\n178\n00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,860\ninstead of just having a four\nstep cycle,plan-do-check-act.\n\n179\n00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,250\nInstead of that,\nwe expand it to seven steps.\n\n180\n00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,590\nAnd so inside of ITIL we have these\nseven step improvement process and\n\n181\n00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,050\nit still matches up\nwith plan-do-check-act.\n\n182\n00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,690\nIt's just some of them have\nbroken up into two steps.\n\n183\n00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,350\nIn fact, all of the except for\nact have been broken up.\n\n184\n00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,370\nOr wait, do.\n\n185\n00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,660\nAll of them except for\ndo have been broken up into two processes.\n\n186\n00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,430\nSo, we'll get a chance to see\nthose later on in the show.\n\n187\n00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,370\nBut that's basically what we're doing is\ntaking this idea that's just a given in\n\n188\n00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,580\nmanufacturing and applying it in IT\nto make things more important, right?\n\n189\n00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,170\nSo an example of this might be\nwhen we look at our servers,\n\n190\n00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,350\nour servers can probably handle a certain\namount of clients simultaneously.\n\n191\n00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,020\nSo if I've got a website developed and\nmy web architecture is built a certain way\n\n192\n00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,500\nthat each server can handle\na thousand simultaneous users.\n\n193\n00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,640\nAnd I've got 5000 simultaneous users,\nso I need at least five servers.\n\n194\n00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,897\nBut what if I could get to where\na server could handle fifteen hundred\n\n195\n00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,850\nsimultaneous users, right?\n\n196\n00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,430\nNow I could step down to\nfour servers if I wanted or,\n\n197\n00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,010\nI could stick with the same five and\n\n198\n00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,830\nI just wouldn't need to add new servers\nas soon as I would have before, right.\n\n199\n00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,760\nI'm getting more use out of\nthe hardware that I have.\n\n200\n00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,850\nSo when we start to enter into this plan,\ndo, check,\n\n201\n00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,770\nact, we start to enter the Deming cycle.\n\n202\n00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,225\nThe first thing is plan and\n\n203\n00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,710\nthat's we're trying to figure\nout what we want to achieve.\n\n204\n00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,400\nYou set a goal, you got to set a goal so\nyou know if you met it, right?\n\n205\n00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,900\nYou don't just go into CSI blind and\nsay, how can we prove this?\n\n206\n00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,590\nHow can we get better?\n\n207\n00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,590\nRight?\nWith just nothing in mind.\n\n208\n00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,840\nYou normally say, boy,\nwe would be better off\n\n209\n00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,590\nif we could improve our server\nthroughput by ten percent, right?\n\n210\n00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,600\nThen you go and you say,\nI need to plan how am I going to do that?\n\n211\n00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,550\nHow can I improve our\nthroughput by ten percent?\n\n212\n00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,205\nSo that's kind of that starting\npoint in plan-do-check-act, right?\n\n213\n00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,071\nYou set a goal.\n\n214\n00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,700\n>> Yup.\nAnd then when we move into the process of\n\n215\n00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,960\ndoing, we're now going to implement\nwhatever solution that we can do to\n\n216\n00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,030\nhelp us to meet that goal.\n\n217\n00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,510\nBy implementing that solution it\nalso gives the ability to log and\n\n218\n00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,810\nto be able check if we're actually doing\nthe right things to help us to meet\n\n219\n00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,880\nthat overall goal.\n\n220\n00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,130\n>> And then the most important of\nthe steps that's next is check.\n\n221\n00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,800\nSo, no matter how good\nthis looked on paper, and\n\n222\n00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,900\nno matter how perfectly\nyou determined yes,\n\n223\n00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,970\nthis will absolutely get us that\nadditional service throughput, right?\n\n224\n00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,270\nYou do it and then you check to see\nif it actually happened, all right.\n\n225\n00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,170\nSo, we're going to check and\nsay, all right,\n\n226\n00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,940\ncan our server actually handle those\nfifteen hundred simultaneous users now?\n\n227\n00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,670\nWe could wait.\n\n228\n00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,100\nWait until we actually have fifteen\nhundred users on the system and see.\n\n229\n00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100\nYou don't really want to do that.\n\n230\n00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,400\nSo you might fire up a load simulation\n\n231\n00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,990\nprogram that'll throw that fake load to\nthe server and you test it out, right.\n\n232\n00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,130\nDid it actually work?\n\n233\n00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,590\nOkay?\nIf it did, our checks pass and\n\n234\n00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,360\nwe're good, right?\n\n235\n00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,100\nWe've reached our goal.\n\n236\n00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,940\nIf we didn't, we go back to plan.\n\n237\n00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,580\nAnd we say, all right,\nlet's figure that out.\n\n238\n00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,635\nThat didn't work.\n\n239\n00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:27,235\nAll right?\n\n240\n00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:27,955\nWhy didn't it work?\n\n241\n00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,945\nWhat could we have done differently?\n\n242\n00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:30,245\nIs there another option?\n\n243\n00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:32,455\nCan we improve the option\nwe already picked?\n\n244\n00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:33,865\nOr do we need an all new option?\n\n245\n00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,435\nThe one we picked just isn't good, right?\n\n246\n00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,245\nDo we need to roll back the option we\nput in place cause it didn't give us\n\n247\n00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:39,085\nthe gains we want.\n\n248\n00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:41,800\nSo, checking is really important, right?\n\n249\n00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,090\nAnd it leads to how we make\nthe decision for the final step.\n\n250\n00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,090\n>> Yep, the final step, of course,\nis taking the action that we need.\n\n251\n00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,070\nWhether it's a corrective step or whether\nwe're actually going all the way back to\n\n252\n00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,730\nthe beginning to start the process over.\n\n253\n00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,360\nWe need to know that this is\nthe point once we get everything done\n\n254\n00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,090\nthat we have to have some sort of action\nto follow everything that we've done.\n\n255\n00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,300\n>> Now one thing we do have to remember is\nthis is a continual cycle so once you've\n\n256\n00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,540\nmade it better you don't just stop there,\nyou then try to make it even better.\n\n257\n00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,560\nYou say, all right,\nwe just improved our yield by ten percent.\n\n258\n00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,250\nCould we do another 10%?\n\n259\n00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,110\nCould we get a little more?\n\n260\n00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,250\nAnd maybe you can.\n\n261\n00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,990\nMaybe there's other techniques out there\nso you continually look for those.\n\n262\n00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,530\n>> Right?\nAnd\n\n263\n00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,020\nI even put in my note one of\nthe sayings that, you'll see a lot,\n\n264\n00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,120\nthere's always room for\nimprovement, right?\n\n265\n00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,750\nThat's kind of a given.\n\n266\n00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,650\nNo matter what you're doing, the odds\nare you're not doing it exactly perfect,\n\n267\n00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,830\nbecause we don't live in a perfect world,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,626\nSo there's always room for improvement.\n\n269\n00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:42,700\nBut we got to make a decision cause\nat some point there's room for\n\n270\n00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,060\nimprovement but the cost of improving\n\n271\n00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,780\nwould exceed the cost of just\nletting the failure happen, right?\n\n272\n00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,940\nSo there is a bit of an analysis that\nhas to happen, a judgement, right?\n\n273\n00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,640\nA cost to benefit analysis.\n\n274\n00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,620\nSo if I just improve my server through\nby 10%, the next time I try and\n\n275\n00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,075\nimprove maybe I only improve it by 5%,\nand then 3%, and then 1%.\n\n276\n00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:10,490\nEach time I'm getting less and\nless improvement.\n\n277\n00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,090\nHow much money is that\nimprovement going to make me\n\n278\n00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,250\nversus how much money am I going to\nhave to spend trying to improve it.\n\n279\n00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,930\nTime, money, resources,\nall that stuff that gets involved.\n\n280\n00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,580\nThere will come a tipping point.\n\n281\n00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:26,440\nYou know it's a balance beam and there\nwill come some point where the scales\n\n282\n00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,940\ntilt the other direction and your cost\nof improving exceeds the benefit.\n\n283\n00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,170\nSo, like with Intel, if they\nmanufacture a thousand processors and\n\n284\n00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,980\ntheir initial yield was only 50%,\nall right?\n\n285\n00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,260\nWell, if they can get that up to\nseventy or 80% that's great, right?\n\n286\n00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,740\nIf they get to 80% that's 30% more\nprocessors that they can sell.\n\n287\n00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,765\nAnd they're selling those on average for\n\n288\n00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,220\n$100 a piece,\nthat's $30,000 that they just made, right?\n\n289\n00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,330\nFor each batch of a thousand CPUs\nthey sell and I can tell you,\n\n290\n00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,970\nthey sell millions of CPUs so\nthere's no shortage there.\n\n291\n00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,360\nSo it ends up being a lot of money for\nthem.\n\n292\n00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,978\nBut after they hit 80% maybe the next\ntime they improve they get 5% more.\n\n293\n00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:08,330\nWell, how much money are they going to\nmake by selling those additional 5% CPUs?\n\n294\n00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,150\nVersus all the equipment retooling and\nscientific studies and\n\n295\n00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,140\nresearch analysis that went\ninto creating that new,\n\n296\n00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,545\nimproved production model to\nget that additional yield.\n\n297\n00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:21,655\nThere comes a point where they have to\nsay, all right, it's actually cheaper for\n\n298\n00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,495\nus to just let those remaining\n20% of the CPUs fail and we'll\n\n299\n00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:29,265\nthrow them in the trash versus trying to\nfix it and get those 20% working, right.\n\n300\n00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:29,865\nAnd that happens.\n\n301\n00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:33,540\nSo even though it's a continuous cycle,\n\n302\n00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,550\nthere comes a point where you\nhave to stop it, all right?\n\n303\n00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,010\nThe cycle doesn't stop itself.\n\n304\n00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,540\nThere's always room for\nimprovement, right?\n\n305\n00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,640\nBut you've got to stop it because sooner\nor later, it becomes cost prohibitive,\n\n306\n00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,940\nand you don't want to continue with that,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,360\nBut you don't stop forever.\n\n308\n00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,120\nYou just say, for\nright now I'm going to stop.\n\n309\n00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,200\nWe're good.\n\n310\n00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,970\nLet's check back in six months, right?\n\n311\n00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,040\nNow, why would we do that?\n\n312\n00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,337\nAdvancements in technology, right?\n\n313\n00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:57,636\nNew things come along.\n\n314\n00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,610\nAnd so we might find that right\nnow it's cost prohibitive.\n\n315\n00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,172\nBut six months from now,\na year from now It's not.\n\n316\n00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:06,451\nOr some new thing came out where\nwe can get better throughput, and\n\n317\n00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,250\nwe should implement that in place.\n\n318\n00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,000\nSo, you do continue to monitor just at\n\n319\n00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,380\nwider intervals after you've reached\nthat tipping point of cost to benefit.\n\n320\n00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,226\n>> For service then, we want to move away\njust from, I don't want to say move away\n\n321\n00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,064\nfrom PDCA but\nwhat we want to do is want to go ahead and\n\n322\n00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:26,400\nimplement that then into\nour service life cycle.\n\n323\n00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,720\nAnd this is where ITIL again specifically\ncalls out these seven steps.\n\n324\n00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,300\nSo instead of looking at four what we're\ngoing to be doing is taking a look at each\n\n325\n00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,130\nof those seven steps.\n\n326\n00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,740\n>> Another thing to keep in mind as we\ngo through the seven steps is what our\n\n327\n00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,890\noutcome is, what we're trying to achieve.\n\n328\n00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,360\nAnd the outcomes can be different\nbased on what kind of company you are.\n\n329\n00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,740\nSo we, at a basic level as\nwe run through all these,\n\n330\n00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,740\nthink of it as you set a goal, and\nachieving the goal is the outcome, right?\n\n331\n00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,940\nThat's what you want.\n\n332\n00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,750\nBut that's not always the case, so a few\nscenarios you want to just kind of stick\n\n333\n00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,110\nin the back of your mind as we run through\nall these is that when you reach the end,\n\n334\n00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,410\nwhat you might identify is the goal\nyou set is not achievable, or\n\n335\n00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,590\nneeds to be replaced\nwith a different goal.\n\n336\n00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,870\nSo your outcome might\nbe to change the goal.\n\n337\n00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,580\nThat can happen, and hopefully not\nfrequently, but it does happen.\n\n338\n00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,890\nThe other one is we might be\ntrying to improve beyond the goal.\n\n339\n00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,300\nSo our initial goal might not be.\n\n340\n00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,400\nLet me give you an example.\n\n341\n00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080\nIt's kind of hard to\nexplain without an example.\n\n342\n00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,560\nSo a great example is\na service level agreement.\n\n343\n00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,650\nThat you engage with a customer and\nas a part of delivering that service to\n\n344\n00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,090\nthe customer the customer says hey,\nwe'll do business with you forever.\n\n345\n00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,150\nIf you can guarantee you'll never have\nmore than 24 hours of downtime, right?\n\n346\n00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,640\nYour servers can go down, we understand,\nbut you've got to back up within a day,\n\n347\n00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,590\nall right?\n\n348\n00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,990\nSo there's our service level agreement.\n\n349\n00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,130\nWe guarantee that customers say,\nwe will always make sure that we're up for\n\n350\n00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,290\nthe majority of the time, but\n\n351\n00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,050\nif we ever have an outage,\nIt'll be shorter than 24 hours.\n\n352\n00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,150\nSo we take a look at our services and\nwe find ways to improve them to insure\n\n353\n00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,780\nthat outage is always less than 24 hours,\nright.\n\n354\n00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,420\nSo there's our availability planning, and\nthis goes back to service design really.\n\n355\n00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,390\nWell, once it's in place,\nwe met that goal.\n\n356\n00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,360\nThe goal of keeping our\ndowntime to below 24 hours.\n\n357\n00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,560\nWhy would we apply CSI to that?\n\n358\n00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,450\nWell, you still want to do improvement\non it because you want to be able to\n\n359\n00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,790\nexceed the SLA.\n\n360\n00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,300\nNot because you have to, right?\n\n361\n00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,170\nThe customer's happy.\n\n362\n00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,030\nWe're going to be back up within 24 hours.\n\n363\n00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,640\nThat's fine, right?\n\n364\n00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,330\nBut if our recovery pattern\ntakes exactly 24 hours, and\n\n365\n00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,060\nanything goes wrong in that\ntime then we break the SLA.\n\n366\n00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,710\nSo if we can get some bumper room, right?\n\n367\n00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,580\nIf we can get our recovery\nto only take 20 hours, now\n\n368\n00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,180\nwe have an extra four hours of breathing\nspace so that if and how this happens,\n\n369\n00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,780\nif something does go wrong,\nwe have an extra four hours built in.\n\n370\n00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,170\nWe can exceed the SLA.\n\n371\n00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:06,630\nSo that's another possibility as\nwe're going through these steps is\n\n372\n00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,790\nyou've already met your SLA,\nyou're already within the customer's\n\n373\n00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,460\nrecommended specifications, but we might\nchoose to exceed it and make it better.\n\n374\n00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,790\nAnd then if we can get it even lower and\nlower, if we can get it to 12 hours and\n\n375\n00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,200\nbelow then we can even tell the customer,\nhey you've got a 24 hour SLA on this.\n\n376\n00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,830\nWe will be back up from any outage\nwithin 24 hours guaranteed.\n\n377\n00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,530\nOr various penalties incur.\n\n378\n00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,660\nBut we strive for 12 hours.\n\n379\n00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,860\nAnd to the customer that creates value.\n\n380\n00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,345\nThey recognize that, and they say, hey, we\nneeded 24, these guys are going to do 12,\n\n381\n00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:38,415\nthat's perfect, right?\n\n382\n00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,945\nDefinitely exceeds our expectations,\n\n383\n00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,935\nwe're really happy with this product,\nwe created value, all right?\n\n384\n00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:45,005\nSo just bear that in mind\nas we run through these.\n\n385\n00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:49,055\nThe goal might be something that we're\nsetting to save money, be more efficient,\n\n386\n00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:54,730\nreduce employees, whatever it is, but\nit might also just be exceeding SLAs or\n\n387\n00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,400\nit might be determining a goal to change,\nright.\n\n388\n00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,450\nSetting a new goal,\nkind of redirecting where our focus is.\n\n389\n00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,950\nSo different possible outcomes from CSI.\n\n390\n00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,120\n>> ITIL likes to call these\nthings the effectiveness that we\n\n391\n00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,960\ncan offer to our customers as well as the\ncost effectiveness to our own business.\n\n392\n00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,080\nContinually service\nimprovement is all about that.\n\n393\n00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,250\nIt's making sure that our customers are\ngetting the best for what they pay us for,\n\n394\n00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,760\nand that we can also make the best\nuse of the money that we're doing, so\n\n395\n00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,310\nthat we can provide a better service.\n\n396\n00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,070\nThere's always this nice cycle\nin everything that we do, and\n\n397\n00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,140\nreally helps us to be a better company.\n\n398\n00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:34,400\n>> All right, so let's take\na look at our seven step process.\n\n399\n00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,192\nNow, as we run through this, it really\ndoesn't have to plan dude check act,\n\n400\n00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:39,100\nall right.\n\n401\n00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,180\nThe first two steps of the seven step\ncycle fall under plan, all right.\n\n402\n00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,680\nSo ITIL takes plan and\nbreaks it into two pieces.\n\n403\n00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,380\nAnd the very first piece is simply,\nidentify the strategy for improvement.\n\n404\n00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,980\nOkay.\n\n405\n00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,365\nWe got to figure what we want to do,\nwhat our strategies.\n\n406\n00:20:56,365 --> 00:21:00,105\nWhat improvement it is we're trying\nto create in our environment.\n\n407\n00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,515\nRemember that in ITIL\n\n408\n00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:05,715\nevery single service should align\nwith our overall business strategy.\n\n409\n00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:09,255\nAnd that means when we're improving things\nwhat we're trying to do is make them\n\n410\n00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:12,575\nmore effectively match\nour business strategy.\n\n411\n00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,315\nAnd our customers they have needs.\n\n412\n00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:17,385\nCustomers are coming to you\nwith particular needs or\n\n413\n00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:18,950\nwhatever they've got, requirements.\n\n414\n00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,400\nAnd our customers should match up\nwith our business strategy also.\n\n415\n00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,530\nIf our customers don't match\nup with the business strategy,\n\n416\n00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,810\nthen we're kind of dealing\nwith the wrong people, right.\n\n417\n00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,490\nWe either need to change our strategy\nto match the market demand, or\n\n418\n00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,620\nwe need to change our customers,\nwe're selling to the wrong people.\n\n419\n00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,290\nSo those should be in line already.\n\n420\n00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,340\nWell, as we make improvements.\n\n421\n00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,760\nWe're trying to provide\na value to the service, right?\n\n422\n00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,630\nIncrease the customer's happiness.\n\n423\n00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,200\nBut match up with our business strategy.\n\n424\n00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,330\nSo we look at that and\nwe figure out what ways match up with\n\n425\n00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,815\nour strategy that we could improve to\nmake us meet that strategy even better.\n\n426\n00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:55,325\n>> Our second step takes\na look at defining what\n\n427\n00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:57,925\nwe are actually going to have to measure.\n\n428\n00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:01,635\nWhen we do the continual service\nimprovement, it's easy to sit there and\n\n429\n00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:04,045\ngo, okay, here's the one I want to do.\n\n430\n00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:07,095\nBut we don't really\nknow it's actually done\n\n431\n00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:09,885\nexactly the way that we need it to be.\n\n432\n00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:15,030\nSo a lot of times what we're looking for\nis what we call a critical success factor.\n\n433\n00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,580\nThis is how we know that we\nactually started moving toward\n\n434\n00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,120\nthe improvement that we need when we\nmeet that critical success factor.\n\n435\n00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,250\n>> And here's where you'll see a lot\nof terminology on the exam, and\n\n436\n00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,380\nwe got to make sure we know it\n>> In a general sense this kind of goes\n\n437\n00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,020\nback to something we talked about\nin a very very early episode,\n\n438\n00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,680\nwhich was like a SMART analysis,\nand SMART,\n\n439\n00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,130\nthat stands for, let's see if I can\nremember them here, I'm going to cheat,\n\n440\n00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,080\nI'm going to look at my notes, specific\nand measurable, those are the two that\n\n441\n00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,310\nI always remember because those\nare the two important ones, right?\n\n442\n00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,220\nSpecific and measurable.\n\n443\n00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,560\nWe want something that is very specific.\n\n444\n00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,160\nWe know what what we're trying\nto improve and it's measurable.\n\n445\n00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,330\nWe can tell how much we've improved it.\n\n446\n00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,810\nIf you can't quantify something,\nif you can't turn it into a number\n\n447\n00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,080\nit becomes really difficult to\nunderstand what the heck is going on.\n\n448\n00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,400\nAnd so, making sure there's\nspecific measurables a key piece of\n\n449\n00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920\ndoing any kind of improvement.\n\n450\n00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,450\nAnd we need to do this in the plan stage,\n\n451\n00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,240\nbecause otherwise we won't be able to\nmeasure our success down the road, and\n\n452\n00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,530\nI'm just kind of cheating here in the\nbackground and pulling up the other three,\n\n453\n00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:22,850\nso it's specific, measurable, attainable,\nrelevant, and time-bound, all right?\n\n454\n00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,160\nSo attainable, you can actually do it.\n\n455\n00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,590\nAnybody can come up with a goal\nthat's outrageous, right?\n\n456\n00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,890\nI want to come up with\na goal to sell laptops and\n\n457\n00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,910\nI want my profit margin to be 100%.\n\n458\n00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,560\nI want my materials cost to be zero.\n\n459\n00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,700\nThat's a great goal, and\n\n460\n00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,920\nboy would you make some money\nwith a business model like that.\n\n461\n00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,660\nBut you're never going to be able to\nget materials cost to zero, right?\n\n462\n00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,610\nThat's not an attainable goal.\n\n463\n00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,350\nSo we've got to have\nsomething that's attainable.\n\n464\n00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,620\nRelevant.\n\n465\n00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,606\nWhat you're trying to achieve needs to be\nrelevant to the service that you offer.\n\n466\n00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:55,508\nSome people start attaching these\nfringe items to an improvement.\n\n467\n00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,619\nYou're adding a feature\nto a software package and\n\n468\n00:23:57,619 --> 00:23:59,283\nit's just not relevant to what you do.\n\n469\n00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:04,530\nIt's wasted resources now so it's not\na true improvement, it's sidetracking.\n\n470\n00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,460\nAnd then time bound just means\nit shouldn't be open ended.\n\n471\n00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,970\nWe need to be able to achieve\nthis goal and then revise it.\n\n472\n00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,325\nIf your goal is to just get the best\nperformance possible at all times,\n\n473\n00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:22,160\nwell that's not gonna end point,\nit's kinda hard to work toward that.\n\n474\n00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,350\nWhen do you even measure that?\n\n475\n00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,690\nYou say at all times.\n\n476\n00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,050\nWell, do I measure it every second,\nevery hour?\n\n477\n00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,580\nWhat do we do?\nSo\n\n478\n00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,090\nwe've got to set some sort of time limit.\n\n479\n00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,360\nBut you see the last three\nare somewhat common sense, right?\n\n480\n00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,754\nSo really it's those first two, specific\nand measurable that we care about.\n\n481\n00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:39,778\nSo when ITIL divides all this up,\nthat's what they're thinking about, and in\n\n482\n00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:44,360\nthe planning phase we create the critical\nsuccess factors that Ronnie mentioned.\n\n483\n00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,190\nAnd that is simply, that well it's kind\nof what the name implies, if you wanna\n\n484\n00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,490\nsucceed at this improvement there's going\nto be something that's critical to do.\n\n485\n00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,430\nSo if I'm wanting to improve\nthe yield rate of a CPU batch,\n\n486\n00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,080\nright so I want to get as many valid CPUs\nout of a manufacturer batch as possible,\n\n487\n00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,870\nmy critical success factor is\ngenerating functioning CPUs, right?\n\n488\n00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,010\nAnd we combine that with another\nthing which is called a metric, and\n\n489\n00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,380\na metric is what we measure.\n\n490\n00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,950\nThat's how we measure this stuff.\n\n491\n00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,440\nSo when I have those CPUs,\nthere's a thousand of them.\n\n492\n00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,140\nHow do I measure how many are valid?\n\n493\n00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,872\nAnd I might measure that in terms\nof just well a straight up number.\n\n494\n00:25:24,872 --> 00:25:30,600\nHere's 1000, 80 of them, or\n800 of them were valid, so 80%.\n\n495\n00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,350\nThat's my yield rate, okay?\n\n496\n00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,430\nI choose to go percent.\n\n497\n00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,100\nOr maybe I don't go percent,\nmaybe I just go raw number.\n\n498\n00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,550\n800, right?\n\n499\n00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,550\nSo we decide what that metric is\ngoing to be and how we measure it.\n\n500\n00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:46,660\nSo if I wanna improve the system by 10%,\nif I wanna get 10% better yield out then,\n\n501\n00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,300\ncurrently my yield is 800.\n\n502\n00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,730\nIf I want 10% better yield that means\nI need to get 80 more valid CPUs.\n\n503\n00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,090\nNot 10% of the total number,\n\n504\n00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,520\nit's the improvement I'm making\nover the existing batch.\n\n505\n00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,000\nSo, now I've got something I can measure,\nthat's my metric.\n\n506\n00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,380\nGoing to the software side, if I want to\nget more simultaneous users on my servers,\n\n507\n00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,080\nI want to be able to handle more sessions,\n\n508\n00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,540\nI'm really reducing the amount of\nresources that each session requires.\n\n509\n00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:21,570\nSo I might say each session on my server\nright now requires roughly 38k of RAM and\n\n510\n00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,840\nthat's my limiting factor because if I\nhave so many users that run out of RAM.\n\n511\n00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,930\nSo if we can get each\nsession down to 36k of RAM\n\n512\n00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,460\nthat's gonna bump my overall user amount\nup to X number and that's what I want.\n\n513\n00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,550\nNow I've got something measurable.\n\n514\n00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,150\nI can measure the amount of\nmemory that each session takes.\n\n515\n00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,560\nSo the critical success factor,\nthat's the one that we're tweaking,\n\n516\n00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,880\nwe're trying to make better.\n\n517\n00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,110\nAnd the metric is how we measure those.\n\n518\n00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,670\n>> The terminology that we use\nhere is what we call a KPI,\n\n519\n00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,610\na key performance indicator.\n\n520\n00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,730\nThe numbers that Don mentioned whether\nit's the 80, or whether it's the 80%,\n\n521\n00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,450\nor whether it's the increase in numbers.\n\n522\n00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,620\nWe actually know that we're hitting\nthat critical success factor\n\n523\n00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,800\nwhen we hit these indicators and that way\nwe know that we're doing what we need to.\n\n524\n00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,590\nA lot of times it's not\neasy to actually know what\n\n525\n00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,130\nthose critical performance indicators are\ngonna be until you start to try and go,\n\n526\n00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,060\nall right,\nhere's what the goal is gonna be.\n\n527\n00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,740\nWe want to see this increase when\nwe do this particular improvement.\n\n528\n00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,920\nAnd if we're not,\nwe're not really heading toward, or\n\n529\n00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,300\nnot really aiming as directly as we think\nthat we are towards being the successful\n\n530\n00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,900\nimprovement that we'll want it to be.\n\n531\n00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,570\n>> Yeah and the key performance\nindicators, the KPIs, those are just\n\n532\n00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:36,220\na combination of the CSF, the critical\nsuccess factor and the metric, right?\n\n533\n00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,280\nThat's what we're combining right there,\nthe metric for\n\n534\n00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,140\nthe CSF that becomes our KPI.\n\n535\n00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,410\nKPIs are normally percentages but\nthey don't have to be.\n\n536\n00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,510\nYou can render them however you want.\n\n537\n00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,120\nAnd we use them in our reports.\n\n538\n00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,370\nSo when you're reporting to people to\nlet them know how much you've achieved,\n\n539\n00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,150\nit's usually you're KPIs that do it.\n\n540\n00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,990\nAnd if you succeed or\nfail at making your improvement,\n\n541\n00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,700\nthe KPIs are what indicates that.\n\n542\n00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,670\nYou'll hear a lot of people refer to these\nas red lights/green lights, or dashboards,\n\n543\n00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,900\nor there will be\na component of a dashboard.\n\n544\n00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,310\nThe idea is that you can a quick look at\nthis KPI and determine where you're at.\n\n545\n00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,760\nIf you have any kind of project management\nbackground, you'll know that we do\n\n546\n00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,490\nschedule performance index, and\ncost performance index, and those things.\n\n547\n00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,560\nThose are KPIs also,\nthey're performance indicators,\n\n548\n00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,760\nthey let you know how\nthe project is running.\n\n549\n00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,250\nWell, here your continual service\nimprovement is basically a project, and\n\n550\n00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,190\nyou need to know how\nyou're performing on it,\n\n551\n00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,210\nhow far along have you\nmoved that performance.\n\n552\n00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,820\nThe metric is measuring the performance\ngain on the critical success factor, and\n\n553\n00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,420\nwe just reflect that together.\n\n554\n00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,600\nNow, the way you do that is up to you.\n\n555\n00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,000\nYou might just do a simple\nformula that calculates it out.\n\n556\n00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,470\nIt may just be that the straight\nup metric becomes your KPI and\n\n557\n00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,030\nit's just reflecting the CS out.\n\n558\n00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,130\nSo it's calculated different ways, but\nthat's what a key performance indicator\n\n559\n00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,860\nis, and it's how we know if we've\nreached our goal, it's our measurement.\n\n560\n00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,460\nNow, those two combined, right, so\nthat was identify the strategy for\n\n561\n00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,420\nimprovement, that was step 1, and define\nwhat you will measure, that's step 2.\n\n562\n00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,330\nWhen we've got those two in place,\nwe know what we want to do, and\n\n563\n00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,220\nwe know how we're going\nto measure our success.\n\n564\n00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,980\nThat takes care of the planning\npiece of the Deming cycle.\n\n565\n00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,050\nSo our first part of continual service\nimprovement is over even though it was\n\n566\n00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,390\ntwo steps, it was really that first part.\n\n567\n00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,910\nIdentify the strategy for improvement and\nto find what you will measure.\n\n568\n00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,480\nFrom there, we're ready to get to work.\n\n569\n00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,720\nAnd that's where we're going to move\nthrough the rest of our steps, but\n\n570\n00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,940\nwe're out of time on this segment.\n\n571\n00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,300\nSo let's stop and take a break, and\n\n572\n00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,380\nwhen we get back we're going to move\nthrough do, check, and act, right?\n\n573\n00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,316\nThe remaining five steps of\nthe seven-step CSI model,\n\n574\n00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:52,104\nso stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n575\n00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:57,386\n[MUSIC]\n\n576\n00:29:57,386 --> 00:29:59,160\nAll right welcome back everybody.\n\n577\n00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,880\nSo we started these seven-step continuous,\ncontinual improvement cycle.\n\n578\n00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,240\nBefore the break we got steps one and\n\n579\n00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,330\nstep two out of the way which\nwas kind of our planning.\n\n580\n00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,150\nNow we've kind of figured out\nwhat we want to achieve and\n\n581\n00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,009\nwe figured out how we're\ngoing to measure it.\n\n582\n00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,400\nNow it's time to sort out the whole mess\nof how we're going to do this stuff,\n\n583\n00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,140\nright and so here's where bit do portion.\n\n584\n00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,840\nNow it easy to confuse this because we\nthink about it as plan, do, check, act.\n\n585\n00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,280\nYou got do and act, they both sound like\nwe're performing some kind of action but\n\n586\n00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,140\nin the do side of things, we're\nactually not changing what we've got,\n\n587\n00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,340\nwe're gathering the data to be able to\nmake the informed decision that we need.\n\n588\n00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,280\nAnd that's actually the name of this one,\nwhich is step three, gather the data.\n\n589\n00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,340\n>> Yeah.\n\n590\n00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,420\nWe're gonna collect the data at this\npoint to make sure that we know what\n\n591\n00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,240\nour existing service is,\nthat we have a nice solid baseline for\n\n592\n00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,310\nour continual improvement process.\n\n593\n00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,270\n>> And I know we've mentioned that term\nbaseline before, but just to rehash,\n\n594\n00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,030\na baseline is basically showing what\nyour normal service operation is,\n\n595\n00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,600\nNSO, how things are running\non a normal day.\n\n596\n00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,260\nIf you're gonna improve something and\nyou're gonna measure the improvement you\n\n597\n00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,720\ngotta know where you started\nto figure out where you're at.\n\n598\n00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,890\nSo how do I know how far I went if\nI don't know kind of where I came\n\n599\n00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,790\nfrom in the beginning?\n\n600\n00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,500\nSo establishing that baseline\nis really important.\n\n601\n00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,610\nYour company might already\ngenerate baselines,\n\n602\n00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,090\nit just part of regular practice.\n\n603\n00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,990\nA lot of people do, or\nthey might not, and so you're the do.\n\n604\n00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,180\nThe activity we're actually talking\nabout is creating this baseline, right?\n\n605\n00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,710\nSo all of our existing data and\nwe get it arranged in a way that we\n\n606\n00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,490\ncan interpret and use it because\noften time you get a ton of data,\n\n607\n00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,010\nyou got to sift through that and\nmake it work the way that we want.\n\n608\n00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,702\nAnd that's what kind of\nleads in to the next part.\n\n609\n00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,511\nBut this one,\n\n610\n00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:49,776\ngather the data, is actually the only\none that falls inside of the do step.\n\n611\n00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:54,455\nAll of the other ones get broken into two,\nhere they just left it as one.\n\n612\n00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,488\nAll right, now that does lead\nus to our next one, step four,\n\n613\n00:31:57,488 --> 00:32:01,520\nwhich is process the data, and this where\nwe begin the check activity, right?\n\n614\n00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,750\nSo we did plan, do, now it's check.\n\n615\n00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,240\nSo process the data just says take all\nthat baseline data that we just got, and\n\n616\n00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,170\nlet's figure out what's relevant.\n\n617\n00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,020\nWe probably got more data than we needed,\nso we need to trim some of that data off.\n\n618\n00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,810\nNow that doesn't mean throw the data away,\nright.\n\n619\n00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,640\nSo you might have certain parts of data\nthat aren't important to the improvement\n\n620\n00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,640\nyou're working on right now, but\nthere might be improvements later on or\n\n621\n00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,300\nrunning simultaneous that\nwork with that data too.\n\n622\n00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,670\nSo we don't throw the data away,\njust for our intents and purposes,\n\n623\n00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,280\nwe filter it out for right now.\n\n624\n00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,950\nSo we dial in on the data that we need,\nand\n\n625\n00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:40,435\nwe start to think about how our\nKPIs affect this data, right?\n\n626\n00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:43,980\nSo if I have processor yields\nthat I'm measuring, or\n\n627\n00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,010\nserver throughput that I'm measuring,\nwhen I take my baseline,\n\n628\n00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,990\nI might be looking at\nthe server throughput today.\n\n629\n00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,630\nBut I probably need to look at\nhistorical server throughput too.\n\n630\n00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,190\nWhat about during high activity, peaks?\n\n631\n00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,170\nMaybe we run a winter sale on our website,\nand so\n\n632\n00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:06,080\nduring the winter time, we've got\na lot of heavy activity on the server.\n\n633\n00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,410\nThroughput might be different there,\nor different services,\n\n634\n00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,100\ndifferent things might impact that.\n\n635\n00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,850\nSo we need to look at the whole set of\ndata, and then maybe we choose to average\n\n636\n00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:18,560\nthat down or come up with a mean or\nwhatever it is that we decide to work with\n\n637\n00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,710\nand convert that into becoming\nthe basis of our KPI, right?\n\n638\n00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,330\nSo here's normal, at the end of\nthe day if we make an improvement and\n\n639\n00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,860\nit's still the same,\nwe've had no improvement, or\n\n640\n00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,790\nif we've gone down,\nwe might have actually hurt our service.\n\n641\n00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,100\nOr if it's gone up,\nthat's what we're hoping for and\n\n642\n00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,080\ndid we go up as far as we\nplanned to improve the service?\n\n643\n00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,810\nSo taking the data and\ntranslating into what we need, right?\n\n644\n00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,440\n>> We also have the ability to analyze the\ninformation that we're given and the data.\n\n645\n00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,940\nThis is where we have to\nbe able to take data,\n\n646\n00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,990\nthe pure facts that we know, change\nit into something that we understand\n\n647\n00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,790\nthe information which is\ngiving us the context.\n\n648\n00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,900\nAnd then being able to take that context\nand turn it into knowledge that's useful\n\n649\n00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,500\nand then ultimately putting it\ninto its right application.\n\n650\n00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,230\nSo it takes us through that process where\nwe're actually taking just raw facts and\n\n651\n00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,210\nmaking correct business decisions with it.\n\n652\n00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,870\n>> And that's something we covered\nin an earlier segment also, right?\n\n653\n00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,190\nIt was the old data becomes information,\n\n654\n00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:22,950\ninformation becomes knowledge,\nknowledge becomes wisdom, right?\n\n655\n00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:27,320\nSo we have to refine the data a couple of\ntimes to get it to where we can start to\n\n656\n00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,780\nmake decisions, and wisdom is where\nwe want to end up ultimately, right?\n\n657\n00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,010\nAnd what was the definition of wisdom?\n\n658\n00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:39,750\nIt was a correct decision, a correct,\nwell-informed decision, right?\n\n659\n00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,820\nEven if you're well-informed,\nif you make the wrong decision,\n\n660\n00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,840\nit's not wisdom at that point.\n\n661\n00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,650\nIt was knowledge, you made the best\ndecision you could with the knowledge you\n\n662\n00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:50,130\nhad, but it wasn't right, so\nthat's generally not good.\n\n663\n00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,830\nHaving a hard time thinking of\na situation where that would be good.\n\n664\n00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,470\nBut we want wisdom, right?\n\n665\n00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,320\nAnd that really does require an intimate\nknowledge of the data that we have and\n\n666\n00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,310\nrefining it and getting it to reflect\nthe information that we need.\n\n667\n00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,490\nSo wisdom is really important.\n\n668\n00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,640\nThe key concept there,\nif that doesn't sound reasonable,\n\n669\n00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,770\nis if you want to have wisdom\nto make a right decision,\n\n670\n00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,380\nyou really have to understand why\nthe data is a certain way, right?\n\n671\n00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,240\nAnd to put it in the old, the five Ws or\nwhatever, the who, what, when, where, why,\n\n672\n00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,270\nand how, right?\n\n673\n00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,580\nThat always gets thrown out there.\n\n674\n00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,350\nThe whole just raw data,\n\n675\n00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:31,430\nthat's kind of the who, what, when-\n>> Where, how.\n\n676\n00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,560\n>> And where, right?\n\n677\n00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,650\nThe information, we refine it,\nthat starts to become the how, right?\n\n678\n00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,330\nSo how all of this kind of happened.\n\n679\n00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,950\nAnd then as we start refining\nthat into knowledge,\n\n680\n00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,650\nwe're trying to figure out the why.\n\n681\n00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,570\nAnd once we understand why, why the data\nis that way, we can turn that into wisdom.\n\n682\n00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:54,250\nDecisions, well-informed decisions that\nwe make, that modify what we're doing\n\n683\n00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,270\nto change the data which ultimately leads\nup to the success that we want, right.\n\n684\n00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,510\nSo it's kind of a convoluted process,\nbut it really does make sense.\n\n685\n00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,610\nWe just need to refine data\nto get it the way we want.\n\n686\n00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,690\nAnd so that's what makes up our\ncheck of the plan, do, check act.\n\n687\n00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,200\nWe process the data, so\nreally just filtering it down, and\n\n688\n00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,860\nthen we analyze the information and data.\n\n689\n00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,670\nThat's the official name of step five,\nanalyze the information and data.\n\n690\n00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,600\nOnce we've got that, now we've got\nthe sound basis to move on and\n\n691\n00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,280\nreally start to work on the improvement.\n\n692\n00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520\nWe haven't improved\nanything at this point.\n\n693\n00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,680\nHave we, Ronnie?\n>> Nope.\n\n694\n00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,690\nOur final stage, of course,\nis the act stage.\n\n695\n00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,020\nAnd that begins with what\nwe call presenting and\n\n696\n00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,810\nusing the information\nthat we have on hand now.\n\n697\n00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,020\nWe wanna make sure that we can\ncommunicate the goals very clearly,\n\n698\n00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,000\nthat whether they've been achieved or not.\n\n699\n00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,140\nSo that we know that we need to go back or\nwe're actually on the right track.\n\n700\n00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,060\nWe also want to make sure that if\nwe haven't completely finished it,\n\n701\n00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,050\nthat by communicating what we know now, we\nknow what the next steps are gonna be so\n\n702\n00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,180\nthat we can achieve the improvement\nthat we're looking for.\n\n703\n00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,160\n>> And good communication.\n\n704\n00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,120\nThat's one that spans all of\nthe processes throughout ITIL.\n\n705\n00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,840\nFor any IT service management, one of our\nresponsibilities is always going to be\n\n706\n00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,440\nto properly communicate what's going on.\n\n707\n00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,200\nAnd unfortunately, it's one of\nthe hardest areas for IT workers, usually\n\n708\n00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,510\npersonal communications or interpersonal\ncommunications are not their strong point.\n\n709\n00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,200\nBut it is really critical, at least for\n\n710\n00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,910\nyour management team, to be able to relay\nthis information to the powers that be.\n\n711\n00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,890\nSo when we talk about present and use\nthe information, that's what we're doing.\n\n712\n00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,750\nWe're communicating with people\nhow things are going, and\n\n713\n00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,740\nwe haven't made our improvement yet.\n\n714\n00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,820\nSo what you're really presenting at\nthis stage is, what you plan on doing,\n\n715\n00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:40,260\nwhat your current data is, and\nhow you plan to affect change.\n\n716\n00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,080\nHow you want to modify that service\nto improve the result, right?\n\n717\n00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,300\nTo improve your KPI.\n\n718\n00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,910\nAnd that's where you\nbump into our last step,\n\n719\n00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,020\nwhich is implement the improvement, right?\n\n720\n00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,820\nSo in steps one through six, we have not\nchanged our production environment at all.\n\n721\n00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,820\nWe gathered a bunch of data,\nwe came up with a possible improvement,\n\n722\n00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,090\nit's in step seven that we\nimplement the improvement.\n\n723\n00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,800\nSo this is the last part of act.\n\n724\n00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,770\nWe submit an RFC, a request for\nchange, we modify the service,\n\n725\n00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,980\nand hopefully, it is better, right?\n\n726\n00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:17,650\nAnd that might mean it's optimized, so\nit works a little better, it's improved so\n\n727\n00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,150\nit provides more functionality or\nvalue to the user.\n\n728\n00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,960\nOr it's corrected,\n\n729\n00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,990\nit's fixed to do something that it should\nhave been doing in the first place, right?\n\n730\n00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,910\nSo it's one of those kinds of outcomes.\n\n731\n00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,180\nSo basically, it gets that set and\nif it's successful,\n\n732\n00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,880\nwhich we'll know because we can measure,\nright?\n\n733\n00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,100\nWe've got our KPIs.\n\n734\n00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,130\nIf it's successful,\nwe now have a new baseline.\n\n735\n00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,670\nAnd so we recreate or we redefine our\nbaselines to reflect this new measure.\n\n736\n00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,640\nIf you just improved performance by 10%,\nthere's no point in remembering\n\n737\n00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,940\nwhat your old measures were,\nbecause now it's improved by 10%,\n\n738\n00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,100\nthat's your new measure,\nthat's your new baseline.\n\n739\n00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:59,500\nSo if 800 out of a 1,000 CPUs is what you\nused to make, that was your baseline.\n\n740\n00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,380\nNow if we improvement by 10%,\nit's 880 CPUs per 1,000.\n\n741\n00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,880\nThat's our new baseline, and if we ever\ndip below that, we've got a problem.\n\n742\n00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,200\nMaybe we can make it better, right?\n\n743\n00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,120\nAnd when we're done with step seven,\nwhat do we do from there, Ronnie?\n\n744\n00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,260\n>> Continue to do it again.\n\n745\n00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,940\n>> Go right back to step one, right?\n\n746\n00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,520\nWay back at step one,\nif we just kinda jump back to that,\n\n747\n00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,190\nit was identify the strategy for\nimprovement, right?\n\n748\n00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,621\nIs it in line with our business\nstrategy to make this even better?\n\n749\n00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:27,260\nCould I go beyond 880 CPUs per yield,\nright?\n\n750\n00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,210\nAnd then define what we'll measure,\nhow are we gonna measure this?\n\n751\n00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,670\nIt's already done for us, we know what\nto measure, and now we start to recycle.\n\n752\n00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,030\nWe go through this process again and\n\n753\n00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,120\nsee if we can get better and\nbetter and better.\n\n754\n00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,060\nUntil we finally reach the point where\nwe look at it, and we say, well,\n\n755\n00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,942\nwe could get better.\n\n756\n00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:45,505\nBut it would cost this amount of dollars,\nand here's how much money\n\n757\n00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:49,602\nwe're actually losing by this flaw or\nlack of improvement.\n\n758\n00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:51,903\nIt would be cheaper to just\nlet the flaw stay, all right.\n\n759\n00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:55,297\nAnd that's what happens,\nthat's when the cycle stops, at least for\n\n760\n00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:57,900\nthat point in time until\nthings change down the road.\n\n761\n00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,178\nSo let's recap those seven steps.\n\n762\n00:40:01,178 --> 00:40:05,790\nStarting with plan,\nin fact let's leave the plan,\n\n763\n00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,150\ndo, check, act, out of it for a minute.\n\n764\n00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,600\nRight, so the official seven step\nITIL Continual Service Improvement Model,\n\n765\n00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,510\nor method, runs like this.\n\n766\n00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,590\nWe identify the strategy for\nthe improvement.\n\n767\n00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,020\nThen we define what we'll measure.\n\n768\n00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,420\nSo this is all just in the early stages.\n\n769\n00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,212\nStep three, we gather the data, and\nthen step four, we process the data.\n\n770\n00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:29,987\nIt kinda goes hand in hand.\n\n771\n00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:34,225\nStep five, we analyze the information and\nthe data, right.\n\n772\n00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,196\nHopefully the data's been turned\ninto information at this point.\n\n773\n00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:41,270\nStep six, we present and\nuse the information.\n\n774\n00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,880\nAnd that leads to step seven where\nwe implement the improvement.\n\n775\n00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,780\nAll right.\n\n776\n00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,980\nSeven steps, and it forms a circle.\n\n777\n00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,970\nIt goes right back on itself and\nyou start over again.\n\n778\n00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,650\nJust like plan, do, check, act,\nonce you act you go right back to plan.\n\n779\n00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,590\nThat's a circle, too.\n\n780\n00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,860\nSo these guys are in alignment.\n\n781\n00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,362\nAll right, now CSI,\nContinual Service Improvement,\n\n782\n00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:07,051\nit's one of the shorter topics as far as\nwe're covering it here on ITIL Foundation.\n\n783\n00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,639\nBut, when you actually\nlook at the book for it,\n\n784\n00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,120\nit's not much shorter\nthan the other books.\n\n785\n00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,220\nThere's a lot of information in there,\nbut it's not covered\n\n786\n00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,480\non the ITIL Foundation exam, because every\ncompany has slightly different needs.\n\n787\n00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,860\nAnd so there will be large\nportions of the CSI manual\n\n788\n00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,680\nthat don't apply to your company.\n\n789\n00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,830\nThat's really common.\n\n790\n00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,790\nVersus the other books where pretty much\nthe whole book is going to apply to your\n\n791\n00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,560\norganization, and you just add to it.\n\n792\n00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,350\nWith CSI there's entire parts that\nyou'll just leave out because they don't\n\n793\n00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,980\npertain to your environment.\n\n794\n00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,910\nIf you're manufacturing\nversus service oriented,\n\n795\n00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,780\neach of these are gonna change\nthe way your company approaches CSI.\n\n796\n00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,920\nSo this does make this one of\nthe smaller portions of the exam.\n\n797\n00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,210\nAnd, as you'll see right here,\nmakes it one of the smaller ones for us.\n\n798\n00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,331\nThat's really it,\nas far as CSI is involved, and\n\n799\n00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:53,755\nwhat we need to be familiar with.\n\n800\n00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:54,754\n>> Yeah.\n\n801\n00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:59,147\nWhen you go back and as you get into\nthose books, pay also attention as you\n\n802\n00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:03,650\nimplement this into your company,\nthe appendices that are there.\n\n803\n00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,300\nA lot of times you'll get a lot more\ninformation, especially when you see some\n\n804\n00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,350\nof these little topics that are not, or\nI should say, that are fairly short and\n\n805\n00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,580\nyou go, wow,\nthat's not a lot of information.\n\n806\n00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,370\nBut if you go and check out the appendix\nthat they're normally referring to,\n\n807\n00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,470\nyou get a lot of extra\ndetails in those appendices.\n\n808\n00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n809\n00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,470\n>> All right well, as far as CSI is\nconcerned we are all wrapping up there.\n\n810\n00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,764\nAnd as far as the exam\ncontent is concerned,\n\n811\n00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:30,190\nwe've now made ourselves feature complete.\n\n812\n00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,761\nSo, throughout the course, for\nthe last handful of episodes,\n\n813\n00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:37,750\nwe've covered all the exam objectives for\nthe ITIL Foundation exam.\n\n814\n00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,500\nWe've covered the basics\nof each service area and\n\n815\n00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,540\nwhat you need to know as far\nas what each one's purpose is.\n\n816\n00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,500\nNow, keep in mind we didn't dive too\nterribly deep into how to implement a lot\n\n817\n00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,310\nof this stuff and that's for the advanced\nlevel certifications as you move forward.\n\n818\n00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,620\nThe ITIL Foundation is\ndesigned to be that survey,\n\n819\n00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,500\nthat overview of all the different\nthings that ITIL has to offer.\n\n820\n00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,060\nSo hopefully as you watched the episodes\nyou saw a lot of things that would be neat\n\n821\n00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,440\nand useful to implement\nin your organization.\n\n822\n00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,450\nAnd moving in a direction that makes you\nfollow the ITIL framework makes sense.\n\n823\n00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,100\nSome of it might not have made sense for\n\n824\n00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,970\nyou, and you say,\nwe don't need that in our company.\n\n825\n00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,420\nWell, that's fine, it's a framework.\n\n826\n00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,400\nYou can pick and choose the pieces\nyou want and implement those, or\n\n827\n00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,220\nyou can choose to pass on the whole thing.\n\n828\n00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:24,300\nITIL is not a regulation requirement\nby the government in most countries.\n\n829\n00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,310\nI know in the UK if you wanna\nland a government contract they\n\n830\n00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,210\ndo require you to follow\nthe ITIL patterns.\n\n831\n00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,020\nYou know,\nthey're the ones that created this.\n\n832\n00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,270\nSo you may actually not have a choice\n[LAUGH] and you need to do it.\n\n833\n00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,880\nBut it does depend on your organization.\n\n834\n00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,990\nHere in the US a lot of companies\njust choose to adopt it because it's\n\n835\n00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,900\npretty darn useful.\n\n836\n00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,617\nIt helps you to improve your odds\nof success by following a standard\n\n837\n00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:46,719\nmethodology.\n\n838\n00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:49,427\nAll right, well, this is a good point for\nus to wrap it up.\n\n839\n00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,536\nSo let me just remind you guys,\n\n840\n00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:55,820\nif you have any questions you\nare always welcome to ask.\n\n841\n00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,614\nLive during the show, you can always\nuse the chat box beneath the video.\n\n842\n00:43:58,614 --> 00:44:02,305\nBut If you're watching this bit\nwe're probably not live anymore so\n\n843\n00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,258\ntake advantage of our Q&A forums.\n\n844\n00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:09,674\nAt the top of every page on the itpro.tv\nwebsite you'll see a link that says Q&A,\n\n845\n00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:10,575\nclick on it.\n\n846\n00:44:10,575 --> 00:44:14,670\nIt'll take you into the forums, you can\npost your questions there, we monitor and\n\n847\n00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,840\nanswer after the show.\n\n848\n00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,014\nWe want to make sure you guys\nhave the information you need to\n\n849\n00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:18,937\nbe successful, right.\n\n850\n00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:22,457\nYou'll find the ITIL Foundation\nexam is not the most challenging,\n\n851\n00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:24,960\nbecause it's pretty high level topics.\n\n852\n00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,790\nBut it is a lot of material and\nquestions will arise, so\n\n853\n00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,310\nfeel free to ask and\nwe love to reach out to our viewers.\n\n854\n00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,700\nAll right, well I hope you guys\nenjoyed the show and the whole series.\n\n855\n00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,880\nWe definitely look forward to doing more\nfor you guys in the future as we film\n\n856\n00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,600\nsome study tip episodes and\nother things, so look for those.\n\n857\n00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,250\nBut otherwise, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n858\n00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,190\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n859\n00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,533\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n860\n00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:56,533\n[MUSIC]\n\n861\n00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,710\n[SOUND]\n\n",
