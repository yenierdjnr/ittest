00:00:08.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:12.340\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.475\njoining us on ITProTV,\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.563\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we begin a new series, Kali Linux.\n\n8\n00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:25.434\nAnd today, we're gonna learn a little\nbit about the history of Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.223\nAnd the person bringing us\nthat information is Kalima!\n\n10\n00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:31.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's Mike Roderick, right over here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:32.568\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zack.\n\n12\n00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:33.810\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.642\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna be taking a look at\nKali Linux in this next several episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.040\nas we go through this series.\n\n15\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.148\nAnd is all good things, we wanna start, we\nneed to know where we came from in order\n\n16\n00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.374\nto really good idea of where\nwe're going and what can do.\n\n17\n00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:51.108\nSo I thought a little bit of history about\nKali Linux would maybe help us out here.\n\n18\n00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:52.361\nPlus it's interesting,\nit's fun stuff, right?\n\n19\n00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:53.340\n&gt;&gt; It's very interesting, yes it is.\n\n20\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.600\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff, so.\n\n21\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Especially the tassy with hearts.\n\n22\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwe'll actually come back to that too.\n\n23\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.190\nWe will talk about Kali and\nwhere that comes from as well.\n\n24\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.779\nSo we talk about Kali Linux,\nobviously it's a Linux distribution, but\n\n25\n00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:09.199\nit's a special Linux distribution.\n\n26\n00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:14.750\nIt's really designed to be\na penetration testing platform.\n\n27\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.340\nAnd when we say it's designed to\nbe a penetration testing platform,\n\n28\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.900\nwhat does that mean?\n\n29\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.080\nReally, it's all about the tools that\ncome pre-installed on this distribution.\n\n30\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.135\nThat's one of the big\ndrawing points to Kali Linux,\n\n31\n00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:30.050\nis all these tools are available\nthat you can go and\n\n32\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.232\ninstall on whatever distribution of\nLinux that you wanna run, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:37.737\nBut I can go and out and\nI can download an image of Kali Linux,\n\n34\n00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:42.455\nand I can have most of the tools that\nI need pre-installed, ready to go.\n\n35\n00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.345\n&gt;&gt; Who would benefit from\nhaving this installation?\n\n36\n00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:49.985\n&gt;&gt; Anybody that does penetration\ntesting or any type of security work.\n\n37\n00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.714\nThere's several options as far\nas running Kali Linux goes,\n\n38\n00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:54.648\nwe're gonna go through several of those.\n\n39\n00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:59.376\nLike being able to run them off of a live,\nwe'll say CD or DVD, but that doesn't\n\n40\n00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:03.990\nhappen too much anymore, we'll say\nUSB drive is probably more likely.\n\n41\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.260\nBut being able to have my pen testing\nplatform with me all the time on a thumb\n\n42\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.210\ndrive that I can boot up at any time from\nany machine is a fantastic capability.\n\n43\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.289\nAlso the fact, and like I said,\nyou can get these tools and\n\n44\n00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.564\ninstall them in just\nabout any Linux distro.\n\n45\n00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:22.904\nBut the fact is that our pre-compiled,\nit's there,\n\n46\n00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:27.734\nthey're very controlling about what is\nallowed to go into the repositories.\n\n47\n00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.406\nIt all has to be signed,\n\n48\n00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:34.100\nwe wanna make sure that our platform\nis stable and safe and secure.\n\n49\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.110\nAnd that's one of the advantages that\nwe get of running this particular\n\n50\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.520\ndistribution of Linux.\n\n51\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Now this sounds like Kali Linux is\nvery portable, and you mentioned USB,\n\n52\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.980\nis that the only way you can transport it?\n\n53\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.256\n&gt;&gt; No, we'll show you several options\nas far as running it from a USB.\n\n54\n00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:54.850\nI'll show you how to make it from Windows,\nfrom Linux, and we'll talk about Mac.\n\n55\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.560\nI probably won't do it, but it's very\nsimilar to doing it with Linux as well.\n\n56\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.060\nBut we could also run it in a VM, which\nis another very common way to run Linux.\n\n57\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120\nNot quite as portable, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.770\nBut it's an easy way to\nhave an installation\n\n59\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.020\nof Kali quickly available\nwhen you need it.\n\n60\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.285\nIf you're primarily a Windows person for\nyour day-to-day job duties, but\n\n61\n00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.511\nyou need to pull up Kali once in a while.\n\n62\n00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.164\nThe VM, virtual machine,\nmight be the option you wanna go.\n\n63\n00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:21.600\nOr dual boot, right,\n\n64\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.140\nwe can install it on side-by-side\nwith our Windows installation.\n\n65\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.643\nAnd I'll show you how to do that,\nand that way you've got a permanent,\n\n66\n00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.304\nyou've just got reboot your system and\npick which one you wanna boot into.\n\n67\n00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:34.936\n&gt;&gt; All right, we were talking about\ndual boot on a becoming a Linux system\n\n68\n00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.620\nadministrator in another\nepisode with Don Pezet.\n\n69\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.240\nSo let's talk about\nthe history of Kali Linux.\n\n70\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.610\n&gt;&gt; All right so-\n&gt;&gt; Kalia, Kalima.\n\n71\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Kalima, it's Debian based now.\n\n72\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.551\nIt wasn't back in the day, but\nwe'll say one, as far as Kali itself,\n\n73\n00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:55.270\ndesigned for digital forensics and\npenetration testing.\n\n74\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.028\nMaintained and funded by a group called\nOffensive Security, most of you out there\n\n75\n00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:02.203\nare probably familiar with them and\ntheir wonderful site they have.\n\n76\n00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:06.100\nAnd all the training that they provide and\na lot of great resources there.\n\n77\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.244\nCore developers just to give everybody\ncredit, and I apologize if I mispronounce\n\n78\n00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:16.890\nthese names, Mati Aharoni,\nDevon Kearns, and Raphael Hertzog.\n\n79\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.640\nThose are the three core developers,\nbut obviously there's several people\n\n80\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.360\nthat help maintain Kali, but they list\nthose guys out as their core developers.\n\n81\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.940\nAnd as I said, for installation options,\ninstall it on a hard disk,\n\n82\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.480\nboot it from a live CD,\nUSB, do a virtual machine.\n\n83\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.920\nBut for the history, we'll say that one,\n\n84\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790\nOffensive Security puts this out,\nit came out in 2013.\n\n85\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.690\nIt's Debian-based as of now, but as I\nthink Ryan put in our chat room there,\n\n86\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.060\nhe knows his history as well, he mentioned\none called WHAX, and even Whoppix,\n\n87\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.100\nbefore that BackTrack.\n\n88\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.850\nSo if we wanna follow the timeline,\n\n89\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.679\na long time ago there was a couple\ndistributions called WHAX and\n\n90\n00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:05.450\nWoppx, and another one called\nAuditor Security Collection.\n\n91\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.746\nAnd these were great Linux distributions,\nWHAX was Slack-based, very minimalistic.\n\n92\n00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:15.403\nAuditor Security Collection was\na live CD that was KOPPIX-based,\n\n93\n00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:21.950\nhad 300 tools pre-compiled in there, and\nthere was some overlap between those two.\n\n94\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.106\nSo what they did, that's really\nwhere BackTracks got its inception,\n\n95\n00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:29.292\nwas from combining or\nkind of taking the best of WHAX and\n\n96\n00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.907\nAuditor Security Collection,\nand putting those together.\n\n97\n00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:38.223\nAnd so BackTracks, for a long time was\none of the security distros to get.\n\n98\n00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:41.965\nI remember playing with that and\nusing it, wow,\n\n99\n00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:47.830\nthis comes with all these tools already\nbuilt in here, it was fantastic.\n\n100\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.210\nWell, back in 2012 the developers at\nOffensive Security, and the developers\n\n101\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.640\nthat were working on BackTracks really\ndecided they wanted to kinda redo things.\n\n102\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.270\nThey wanted to add a bunch of new\nfeatures and capabilities, but\n\n103\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.130\nrealized that it was gonna require\na lot of re-work under the hood.\n\n104\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.630\nAnd they decided that this would be just\na good time to kinda start over, and\n\n105\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.850\nthey switched over to Debian.\n\n106\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.055\nIn fact I want to say the last guy\nthey brought in, Raphael Hertzog,\n\n107\n00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:16.934\nI wanna say he was their Debian\nguru guy that they brought in.\n\n108\n00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:22.590\nBut that what's happened there,\nis they switched over to Debian.\n\n109\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.850\nThe first official release of Kali was\nin 2013, is when we had our first one.\n\n110\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.480\nSo BackTracks evolved into Kali Linux.\n\n111\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.510\nSo that's a little bit about the history,\nand then as we've been alluding to\n\n112\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.132\na few times, and Zack has talked about the\nname, it's always something that comes up.\n\n113\n00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:43.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It probably doesn't have a lot to\n\n114\n00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:47.245\nfunctionality-wise but hey, you know you\nwant to be able to talk intelligently.\n\n115\n00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:51.060\nAnd you get out there, and\npeople are like Kali, Kalima, right?\n\n116\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.750\nThink of Indiana Jones and\nthings like that.\n\n117\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.930\nBut if we take a look,\nin fact let's go out and\n\n118\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.440\nlook at Kali's website here,\nthis is Kali.org.\n\n119\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.585\nThis is where we're gonna\nbe able to get the ISOs or\n\n120\n00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:05.180\nwhatever else we need to install it.\n\n121\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.670\nYou get a lot of information here,\nthey've got their official documentation.\n\n122\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.940\nThey've got a great community\nthat you can be a part of.\n\n123\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.195\nOffensive Security, again, was the ones\nthat helped maintain and fund all of this.\n\n124\n00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:25.900\nAnd then as far as, I went back and\nfound one of their pages in their history.\n\n125\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.449\nThis is an old page, this is from 2012,\nback when Kali was released,\n\n126\n00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.754\nit actually came official I think in 2013.\n\n127\n00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:34.997\nBut it talks about what I\nwas just talking about,\n\n128\n00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:39.900\nhow they scrapped it all and\nstarted fresh, Ubuntu versus Debian.\n\n129\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.660\nBut down here,\nI thought I'd point this out,\n\n130\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.800\nsince we love to talk about this,\nwhat's in a name?\n\n131\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.040\nHindu goddess of time and\n\n132\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.305\nchange, Philippine martial art,\ncool word in Swahili.\n\n133\n00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:51.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; None of the above,\n\n134\n00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:54.561\nKali is simply a name we came up with for\nour new distribution.\n\n135\n00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:57.702\nSo there you go,\nstraight from the horses mouth.\n\n136\n00:07:57.702 --> 00:08:01.413\nIt really doesn't mean anything,\nit's just a word that they [CROSSTALK].\n\n137\n00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:06.370\n&gt;&gt; But I intend to think they so\nthat movie within [INAUDIBLE].\n\n138\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.692\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I mean maybe that works out\ngood for us because now I can, in my mind,\n\n139\n00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:12.722\nI can think of it as coming from that,\n\n140\n00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:16.143\nthey can do goddess\n&gt;&gt; Somebody else might have a different\n\n141\n00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:16.830\nopinion.\n\n142\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.650\nAnd hey, they don't disagree with us, so\n\n143\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.905\nhey, we can kind of have our own\ntruth maybe there if that works.\n\n144\n00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:29.280\n[LAUGH] All right, so a little bit about\nthe history of Kali, where it came from.\n\n145\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.610\nAgain, it's one of\nthe popular distributions,\n\n146\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.480\nif you are going to be doing pen testing.\n\n147\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.890\nAny type of security\nwork because of the fact,\n\n148\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.230\nthat it is, its got all of the tools,\nfree compiler that is installed in there,\n\n149\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.680\nthe repositories are available\nwith with additional tools.\n\n150\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.880\nThey keep tight control over what is\ngetting added to their repositories,\n\n151\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.330\nin fact they will tell you if you\ngo to their documentation in here\n\n152\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.480\none of the things that people are tempted\nto do is add additional repositories so\n\n153\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.240\nthey can go get these other tools.\n\n154\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.330\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that, but\njust understand that you are reducing\n\n155\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.340\nthe security that's built\nin to Kali by doing that.\n\n156\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.130\n&gt;&gt; You open the door.\n\n157\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they keep a tight\ncontrol over their repository.\n\n158\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.170\nAs you start adding other repositories,\nnow it's beyond their control and\n\n159\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.080\nyou can introduce things and\nintroduce instability or\n\n160\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.800\ninsecurity, which maybe is what you\nwant and you're okay with that.\n\n161\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.060\nOr if you're trying to\nkeep it buttoned down and\n\n162\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.060\nsecure, stick with your\nofficial repositories for Kali.\n\n163\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.430\n&gt;&gt; And the cost for it is zero?\n\n164\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.210\n&gt;&gt; It is zero.\n\n165\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.830\nIt is one of our favorite\nprice points here at IRProTV.\n\n166\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.950\nThe cost is free and\n\n167\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.500\nyou read on their website that you\nwill never have to pay for Kali Linux.\n\n168\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.220\nTheir intention is to keep it free\nforever, which is a good thing.\n\n169\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.060\nWe like free around here.\n\n170\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.570\nAll right, now requirement-wise.\n\n171\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.010\nAnd you can kill the screen feed here.\n\n172\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.350\nWell, actually, you know what?\n\n173\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.570\nI can go over and well,\nI'll show you this.\n\n174\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.100\nLet's go over to the Kali documentation.\n\n175\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.090\nSorry, Megan.\n\n176\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.050\nGoof on you up there.\n\n177\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.100\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe installation requirements.\n\n178\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.840\nSo I know it's a little bit small.\n\n179\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.820\nI can zoom in for you.\n\n180\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.560\nMinimum of 20 gigs hard space,\ndisk space for the Kali Linux install.\n\n181\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.920\nIf you're gonna be installing it,\non a hard drive right.\n\n182\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.580\nIf you're running it from a thumb drive or\nsomething like that.\n\n183\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.400\nObviously this requirement\ndoesn't apply to you.\n\n184\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.660\nRAM for I3 to 6 and 64-bit architecture,\n\n185\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.480\nminimum one gigabyte,\nrecommended 2 gigabytes or more.\n\n186\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.720\nAnd just like any operating system they\nwill tell I can run with 1 gigabyte and\n\n187\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.290\nthat's all you got we'll make it work,\nbut it's not gonna be painless.\n\n188\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.420\nIt gonna have to be a little slow\nespecially depending on what\n\n189\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.540\nyou are running, so\nas the application once you get booted up.\n\n190\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.080\n2 gigs recommended but just like\nany other OS the more we through at\n\n191\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.310\nit up to a certain point anyway that\nyou get the diminishing returns but\n\n192\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.290\nup to a certain point we wanna\ninput more memory in there.\n\n193\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.170\nCuz when we are loading things\nlike password crackers or\n\n194\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.790\nother things that might be CPU intensive\nthat need to store a lot of info in RAM\n\n195\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.710\nbetter have in more memory.\n\n196\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:52.770\nSo the more you can do it the better.\n\n197\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:01.290\nOr CD drive, DVD drive, or USB boot\nsupport to get it installed, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.220\nOther than that, pretty slight\nreally when it comes to language.\n\n199\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.650\nIt's like most Linux distros,\n\n200\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.940\nI mean they're pretty light\non their system requirements.\n\n201\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.970\nJust keep in mind, different tools that\nyou run also have requirements and\n\n202\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.380\nyou're gonna have to add those up, so\n\n203\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.820\nif you're planning on doing a lot of\nmultitasking or running any of those\n\n204\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.290\ndisks or memory-intensive applications or\nanything like that, you'll have to\n\n205\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.480\nthink about that when you're specing out\nyour system that you wanna run this on.\n\n206\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Now are you gonna have to download\nadditional software to manage\n\n207\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.230\nthe Kali Linux or is it all unto itself?\n\n208\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.310\n&gt;&gt; No, it's all unto itself.\n\n209\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.700\nSo let's take a look at\ntheir download page.\n\n210\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.790\nIn fact, let me jump back here.\n\n211\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.480\nAnd downloading Kali Linux.\n\n212\n00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.040\nSo, when you go out there and\nyou decide that you wanna run Kali,\n\n213\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.920\nyou've got your choices of how you're\ngonna go about running it, and\n\n214\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.570\nthen that will determine really what it\nis that you're going to be downloading.\n\n215\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.410\nPlatform wise,\nwhich I haven't mentioned yet, wide open,\n\n216\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.740\nI mean there are 32 bit or\n64 bit architecture.\n\n217\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.520\nThey even have a branch dedicated to ARM,\nthey have their\n\n218\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.980\nNetHunter which is dedicated to running on\nAndroid devices, really cool option there.\n\n219\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.790\nYou can go ahead and\nget like a little, an older Nexus or\n\n220\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.340\ncertain Galaxy, certain Samsungs.\n\n221\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.540\nThe one, what is it?\n\n222\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.400\nI forgot the name of that darn phone.\n\n223\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.970\nThe OnePlus One is another\none besides the Nexus.\n\n224\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.550\nNexus like 5 through Nexus 10,\nthese were NetHunter.\n\n225\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.880\nThis is for, basically it's\na version of Kali designed to run on\n\n226\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.010\nthis Android devices give you\na mobile platform, really cool.\n\n227\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.100\nNow what we're gonna go and\ndo here is we're gonna stick with\n\n228\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.580\nKali Linux this one but wanted to make\nsure you're aware they are available.\n\n229\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.220\nIt is just incredible like I know they can\nrun on things like a lot of your single\n\n230\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.470\nboard computers, like your BeagleBones,\nand your Raspberry Pi is a big one.\n\n231\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.950\nThey've got a distro designed\nto run on Raspberry Pi, so\n\n232\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.520\nyou can make headless units.\n\n233\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.120\nThey're talking about running\ndrones with these things.\n\n234\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.410\nAll kinds of neat stuff\nyou can do with Kali.\n\n235\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.920\nSo lots of options there.\n\n236\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.480\nNow, as far as,\nZach you're asking about downloading it,\n\n237\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.110\none of the things you want to do is make\nsure you're getting an official distro.\n\n238\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.750\nWhich means going to kali.org and\ndownloading it from there.\n\n239\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.540\nLet me switch back to the main page here,\nnot the documentation.\n\n240\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.820\nWhen you go to their main page,\nand I'll do that again.\n\n241\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.660\nRight on their main page you\ngot downloads up to the top.\n\n242\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.880\nYou can see download Kali Linux NetHunter.\n\n243\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.170\nThey got their release information.\n\n244\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.310\nYou can also click on the wonderful link\ndown here in the middle of the page.\n\n245\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.743\nEither way it's gonna take you\nover the Kali Linux distros.\n\n246\n00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:43.892\nHere you're gonna decide\nwhat it is you want.\n\n247\n00:13:43.892 --> 00:13:47.529\nYou got 32 and 64 bit Kali distributions.\n\n248\n00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:52.887\nGot a light version, which is you\ncan see the image is a lot smaller,\n\n249\n00:13:52.887 --> 00:13:56.910\ndoesn't have nearly\nthe tools built into it.\n\n250\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.000\nYou'd be on your own, but\nif you needed something smaller and\n\n251\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.500\nyou just needed certain tools\nmaybe that's the way you wanna go.\n\n252\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.920\nA few different versions for,\nwith the different desktops enabled.\n\n253\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.510\nWhich is something you can actually\ncustomize, but it's nice that you can pre\n\n254\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.750\nor download one that's pre-configured\nto use the desktop that you would like,\n\n255\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.240\nthe desktop manager you wanna use.\n\n256\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.560\nAs we scroll down further we get\ndown into our pre-built VMs.\n\n257\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.100\nVirtualization, right, this is a great\nway to get your feet wet in Kali Linux.\n\n258\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.610\nMost of us are gonna have some type\nof virtualization software available.\n\n259\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.540\nAnd Offensive Security has created\nthese virtual hard drives,\n\n260\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.490\nthese pre-built virtual machines\nthat we can simply download and run.\n\n261\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.460\n&gt;&gt; And that is good for\npractice you think?\n\n262\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.620\nWould you recommend that?\n\n263\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, this is probably\nthe easiest way to get started.\n\n264\n00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:47.635\nIf you are not sure that\nyou want to use Kali or\n\n265\n00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:52.085\njust want to see what it's about,\nsee if it's something you could use, and\n\n266\n00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:55.665\nyou've got virtualization software\navailable, this is probably the way to go.\n\n267\n00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:58.575\nBecause I don't have to install anything,\nit's all done.\n\n268\n00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:02.465\nI just fire up the virtual machine and\nit's there and if you're newer to Linux,\n\n269\n00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:05.445\nthe installation process can be\na little bit confusing sometimes.\n\n270\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.935\nAlthough it is much simpler\nthan it was years ago.\n\n271\n00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.465\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day.\n\n272\n00:15:11.465 --> 00:15:17.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now, like I said, this is\nprobably one of the easiest way to go.\n\n273\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.580\nYou can see if I go over\nto Kali virtual images\n\n274\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.880\nI either get several different platforms\nthat they are going to support.\n\n275\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.830\nI've got the Let's see,\nhere's my VMware images.\n\n276\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.430\nSo this is what I use, because I'm\nrunning Workstation on my laptop.\n\n277\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.370\nBut I've also got VirtualBox images.\n\n278\n00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.430\nSo if you've got a free.\n\n279\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.160\nVirtualBox is a free\nvirtualization software.\n\n280\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.460\nSo now I can get my\nvirtualization software and\n\n281\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.090\nmy Kali Linux pre-built hard drive for\nit all for free.\n\n282\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.830\nAnd they even have,\nbelieve it or not, HyperV image.\n\n283\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.620\nIsn't that nice of them?\n\n284\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.868\nUsually Windows gets left out.\n\n285\n00:15:53.868 --> 00:15:56.132\nHyperV is never considered.\n\n286\n00:15:56.132 --> 00:16:00.378\nBut the good folks over there at Offensive\nSecurity Have created a Hyper-V drive\n\n287\n00:16:00.378 --> 00:16:00.882\nas well.\n\n288\n00:16:00.882 --> 00:16:04.560\nThey most likely converted one but\nhey, anyway, it works.\n\n289\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.080\nI've downloaded it, I've thrown out\na Hyper-V server and it works just great.\n\n290\n00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.180\n&gt;&gt; And the price is right.\n\n291\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.890\n&gt;&gt; And the price is right.\n\n292\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.750\nExactly.\n\n293\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.180\nThey've got it for\nyour ARM hardware as well.\n\n294\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.060\nLike I said they have support for\na lot of different devices.\n\n295\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.140\nAnd then Kali NetHunter which is\ntheir mobile penetration platform.\n\n296\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.500\nBut what were gonna be focusing in\non in this series is going to be\n\n297\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.980\nour straight up Kali Linux.\n\n298\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.700\nWe'll take a look at some of\nthe different installation options.\n\n299\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.570\nAnd once we get it installed it doesn't\nmatter whether I'm running it from\n\n300\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.690\na Live or a VMWare or what have you.\n\n301\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.280\nThe tools are gonna be the same,\nexcept for persistence.\n\n302\n00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.050\nThat is something we'll\ntalk about as well.\n\n303\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.160\nIf you're running this from a live,\nfrom a USB drive, right.\n\n304\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.490\nIt's great because hey, I can take\nanybody's computer if it's available.\n\n305\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.200\nI can throw in my thumb drive,\nI can reboot and I can boot to Kali.\n\n306\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.670\nAnd I can run Linux right there.\n\n307\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.060\nOr run my Kali and have access to\nall my tools from right there.\n\n308\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.820\nSo that's great, except for\n\n309\n00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.400\nthe fact that we don't have\nany persistence there, right?\n\n310\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.910\nBecause when I shut that thing down or\nwhen I unplug that USB drive what about\n\n311\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.660\nlogs maybe that I captured or reports\nfrom tools I run and things like that.\n\n312\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.950\nThere is a way that you can set up\nan additional partition on the thumb drive\n\n313\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.560\nthat has persistence,\nthat will allow you to write to that and\n\n314\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.180\nsave things like output from tools,\nreports.\n\n315\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.720\nSo we will show you how to\nbuild one of those as well.\n\n316\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.100\nWhere else was I going with that?\n\n317\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.730\nSo, yeah,\nwe'll take a look at how to do that also.\n\n318\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.200\nWhat else do we talk about.\n\n319\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.481\nIs that we talked about the supportive\nplatforms, feature-wise,\n\n320\n00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:51.225\nlike I said, over 600 pre-installed\npenetration testing programs.\n\n321\n00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:53.330\nNow, that right there is great.\n\n322\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.170\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question.\n\n323\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:54.956\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; How many\n\n324\n00:17:54.956 --> 00:17:55.670\nprograms-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.156\n&gt;&gt; Never mind, go ahead.\n\n326\n00:17:58.156 --> 00:18:02.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's 600 things that I\ndon't have to try to install, right.\n\n327\n00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.570\nNow, I might not use but half of those.\n\n328\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.110\nBut yeah,\nhaving choices is a wonderful thing,\n\n329\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.540\ndifferent tools work at different times,\nwe've all been there.\n\n330\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.120\nIf you've done any kind of security work,\ntesting work you know,\n\n331\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.070\nsometimes one tool that worked great\nbefore, doesn't work so well in this\n\n332\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.270\nsituation and you need something else or\nyou need to confirm results, right?\n\n333\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.440\nThat's another thing that having\nmultiple tools is a big aid in.\n\n334\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.730\nOne running one tool, getting a set\nof results, running another tool.\n\n335\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.041\nGetting same results is confirmation.\n\n336\n00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.933\nThat's proof that I can use\nif we're ever prosecuting or\n\n337\n00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:35.490\nif we have a need to\nprovide this evidence.\n\n338\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.612\nAnd speaking of evidence,\nremember we said that this is\n\n339\n00:18:39.612 --> 00:18:43.483\na penetration\ntesting/forensics distribution.\n\n340\n00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:46.230\nWell what makes it\na forensics distribution?\n\n341\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.450\nWell, because one of the boot\noptions is actually to boot live,\n\n342\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.820\nwhich we've talked about already.\n\n343\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.342\nIt used to be, how can I explain this,\nin Back Tracks, prior to Kali,\n\n344\n00:18:57.342 --> 00:19:01.540\nright, so prior to 2012,\nwhen in running Back Tracks.\n\n345\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.160\nIt had a forensics mode.\n\n346\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.850\nWhen you went to boot Back Tracks\noff of a live live USB or\n\n347\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.960\na disk, it had a forensics\nmode that you could boot into.\n\n348\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.580\nAnd what that did is it prevented that,\nBack Tracks, from auto mounting.\n\n349\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.730\nIt basically disabled all auto mounting,\nso\n\n350\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.950\nit wouldn't automatically mount any hard\ndrives or anything else that it found\n\n351\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.360\nin the physical hardware that you\nare booting this live distro to.\n\n352\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.590\nAnd it won't touch any of the hard\ndrives internally or the swap space or\n\n353\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.170\nany of the paging systems or\nanything like that.\n\n354\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.053\nAnd the idea is,\nbecause if we're doing forensics,\n\n355\n00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:40.010\nI cannot modify that system\nthat I'm investigating.\n\n356\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.625\nI have to be very,\nvery careful about that.\n\n357\n00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:46.735\nAnd so having a distribution allows\nme to boot up in a mode that says,\n\n358\n00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:49.695\nhey I'm not gonna touch the system\nin any way, make any changes.\n\n359\n00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:53.955\nI'm not gonna touch the hard drive,\nI'm not gonna auto mount anything else.\n\n360\n00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.378\nI'm gonna leave it completely alone.\n\n361\n00:19:55.378 --> 00:19:57.395\nIt's a good thing and\nthey've included that in Kali.\n\n362\n00:19:57.395 --> 00:20:01.120\nSo in Back Tracks, it was forensics mode.\n\n363\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.010\nIn Kali Linux it's just called live, but\nit means, again, it won't auto mount or\n\n364\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.810\nanything like that.\n\n365\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.470\nSo great, great operating system.\n\n366\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.120\nWhere was I?\n\n367\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.370\nFeatures, we talked about there's a ton of\ntools that come available in Kali Linux.\n\n368\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.320\nIt's a supported platform for\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n369\n00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.927\nAnybody that's done anything in security,\npen testing, is familiar with Metasploit.\n\n370\n00:20:22.927 --> 00:20:27.594\nIt's a framework where we can build and\ntest and run exploits.\n\n371\n00:20:27.594 --> 00:20:30.518\nAnd Kali Linux is a supported platform,\n\n372\n00:20:30.518 --> 00:20:35.510\nwhich means I can get all of that\nMetasploit up and running on my Kali.\n\n373\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.090\nIn fact, it's installed in there already.\n\n374\n00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.400\nI say Kali a live mode.\n\n375\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.810\nOne thing I will say about that again,\nauto mounting is disabled,\n\n376\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.774\ndoesn't touch internal hard drive or\nswap space, but people in offensive\n\n377\n00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:55.795\nsecurity and something we should know\nalready, you must test it, right.\n\n378\n00:20:55.795 --> 00:21:00.275\nThey'll let you know hey, yes this is what\nit does, it shouldn't do any of these.\n\n379\n00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:05.532\nDo not go into a live active case and run\nKali for the first time in live mode and\n\n380\n00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:10.720\nhope that it's not gonna touch anything or\nmodify anything, right?\n\n381\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.955\nTest that out first outside of\nan actual case to make sure.\n\n382\n00:21:15.955 --> 00:21:19.891\nYou have to verify all of that and\nmake sure that your particular scenario,\n\n383\n00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:22.760\nyou're gonna get the results\nthat you expect.\n\n384\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.010\nYou don't want to corrupt anything or\ndestroy any evidence by testing out your\n\n385\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.470\nKali live thumb drive on\nactive evidence of any kind.\n\n386\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Trust, but verify.\n\n387\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Trust, but verify, exactly right.\n\n388\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.810\nAll right.\nWell, so\n\n389\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.760\nthat's a little bit about the history of\nLinux, where it came from, why we want,\n\n390\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.110\ndid I say Kali, the history of Linux, the\nhistory of Kali Linux, where it came from,\n\n391\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.620\nwhat it's built for, the different options\nthat we have to install, our requirements.\n\n392\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.040\nAnd so I think that'll do it for\nthis episode.\n\n393\n00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.260\nWhen we come back, we'll actually take\na look at getting it installed and\n\n394\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.310\ngetting it up and running.\n\n395\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike you got me excited and\nyou did a great job.\n\n396\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.740\nThank you very, very much.\n\n397\n00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.930\nSo it's a history of Kali Linux as we\ncontinue on with the series Kali Linux.\n\n398\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.180\nAnd thanks for watching.\n\n399\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.410\nAnd make sure you watch all\nof the videos in that series.\n\n400\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.360\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n401\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.750\nRemember a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n402\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.730\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n403\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n404\n00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.697\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n405\n00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:25.282\n[MUSIC]\n\n406\n00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:28.509\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for
