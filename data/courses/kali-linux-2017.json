00:00:08.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:12.340\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.475\njoining us on ITProTV,\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:22.563\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we begin a new series, Kali Linux.\n\n8\n00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:25.434\nAnd today, we're gonna learn a little\nbit about the history of Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.223\nAnd the person bringing us\nthat information is Kalima!\n\n10\n00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:31.052\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's Mike Roderick, right over here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:32.568\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zack.\n\n12\n00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:33.810\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.642\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna be taking a look at\nKali Linux in this next several episodes,\n\n14\n00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.040\nas we go through this series.\n\n15\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.148\nAnd is all good things, we wanna start, we\nneed to know where we came from in order\n\n16\n00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.374\nto really good idea of where\nwe're going and what can do.\n\n17\n00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:51.108\nSo I thought a little bit of history about\nKali Linux would maybe help us out here.\n\n18\n00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:52.361\nPlus it's interesting,\nit's fun stuff, right?\n\n19\n00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:53.340\n&gt;&gt; It's very interesting, yes it is.\n\n20\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.600\n&gt;&gt; It's good stuff, so.\n\n21\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Especially the tassy with hearts.\n\n22\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nwe'll actually come back to that too.\n\n23\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.190\nWe will talk about Kali and\nwhere that comes from as well.\n\n24\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.779\nSo we talk about Kali Linux,\nobviously it's a Linux distribution, but\n\n25\n00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:09.199\nit's a special Linux distribution.\n\n26\n00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:14.750\nIt's really designed to be\na penetration testing platform.\n\n27\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.340\nAnd when we say it's designed to\nbe a penetration testing platform,\n\n28\n00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.900\nwhat does that mean?\n\n29\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.080\nReally, it's all about the tools that\ncome pre-installed on this distribution.\n\n30\n00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.135\nThat's one of the big\ndrawing points to Kali Linux,\n\n31\n00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:30.050\nis all these tools are available\nthat you can go and\n\n32\n00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.232\ninstall on whatever distribution of\nLinux that you wanna run, right?\n\n33\n00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:37.737\nBut I can go and out and\nI can download an image of Kali Linux,\n\n34\n00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:42.455\nand I can have most of the tools that\nI need pre-installed, ready to go.\n\n35\n00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:45.345\n&gt;&gt; Who would benefit from\nhaving this installation?\n\n36\n00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:49.985\n&gt;&gt; Anybody that does penetration\ntesting or any type of security work.\n\n37\n00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:52.714\nThere's several options as far\nas running Kali Linux goes,\n\n38\n00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:54.648\nwe're gonna go through several of those.\n\n39\n00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:59.376\nLike being able to run them off of a live,\nwe'll say CD or DVD, but that doesn't\n\n40\n00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:03.990\nhappen too much anymore, we'll say\nUSB drive is probably more likely.\n\n41\n00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.260\nBut being able to have my pen testing\nplatform with me all the time on a thumb\n\n42\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.210\ndrive that I can boot up at any time from\nany machine is a fantastic capability.\n\n43\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.289\nAlso the fact, and like I said,\nyou can get these tools and\n\n44\n00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.564\ninstall them in just\nabout any Linux distro.\n\n45\n00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:22.904\nBut the fact is that our pre-compiled,\nit's there,\n\n46\n00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:27.734\nthey're very controlling about what is\nallowed to go into the repositories.\n\n47\n00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.406\nIt all has to be signed,\n\n48\n00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:34.100\nwe wanna make sure that our platform\nis stable and safe and secure.\n\n49\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.110\nAnd that's one of the advantages that\nwe get of running this particular\n\n50\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.520\ndistribution of Linux.\n\n51\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.830\n&gt;&gt; Now this sounds like Kali Linux is\nvery portable, and you mentioned USB,\n\n52\n00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.980\nis that the only way you can transport it?\n\n53\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.256\n&gt;&gt; No, we'll show you several options\nas far as running it from a USB.\n\n54\n00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:54.850\nI'll show you how to make it from Windows,\nfrom Linux, and we'll talk about Mac.\n\n55\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.560\nI probably won't do it, but it's very\nsimilar to doing it with Linux as well.\n\n56\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.060\nBut we could also run it in a VM, which\nis another very common way to run Linux.\n\n57\n00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.120\nNot quite as portable, right?\n\n58\n00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.770\nBut it's an easy way to\nhave an installation\n\n59\n00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.020\nof Kali quickly available\nwhen you need it.\n\n60\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.285\nIf you're primarily a Windows person for\nyour day-to-day job duties, but\n\n61\n00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.511\nyou need to pull up Kali once in a while.\n\n62\n00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.164\nThe VM, virtual machine,\nmight be the option you wanna go.\n\n63\n00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:21.600\nOr dual boot, right,\n\n64\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.140\nwe can install it on side-by-side\nwith our Windows installation.\n\n65\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.643\nAnd I'll show you how to do that,\nand that way you've got a permanent,\n\n66\n00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:31.304\nyou've just got reboot your system and\npick which one you wanna boot into.\n\n67\n00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:34.936\n&gt;&gt; All right, we were talking about\ndual boot on a becoming a Linux system\n\n68\n00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.620\nadministrator in another\nepisode with Don Pezet.\n\n69\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.240\nSo let's talk about\nthe history of Kali Linux.\n\n70\n00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.610\n&gt;&gt; All right so-\n&gt;&gt; Kalia, Kalima.\n\n71\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Kalima, it's Debian based now.\n\n72\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.551\nIt wasn't back in the day, but\nwe'll say one, as far as Kali itself,\n\n73\n00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:55.270\ndesigned for digital forensics and\npenetration testing.\n\n74\n00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.028\nMaintained and funded by a group called\nOffensive Security, most of you out there\n\n75\n00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:02.203\nare probably familiar with them and\ntheir wonderful site they have.\n\n76\n00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:06.100\nAnd all the training that they provide and\na lot of great resources there.\n\n77\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.244\nCore developers just to give everybody\ncredit, and I apologize if I mispronounce\n\n78\n00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:16.890\nthese names, Mati Aharoni,\nDevon Kearns, and Raphael Hertzog.\n\n79\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.640\nThose are the three core developers,\nbut obviously there's several people\n\n80\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.360\nthat help maintain Kali, but they list\nthose guys out as their core developers.\n\n81\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.940\nAnd as I said, for installation options,\ninstall it on a hard disk,\n\n82\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.480\nboot it from a live CD,\nUSB, do a virtual machine.\n\n83\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.920\nBut for the history, we'll say that one,\n\n84\n00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.790\nOffensive Security puts this out,\nit came out in 2013.\n\n85\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.690\nIt's Debian-based as of now, but as I\nthink Ryan put in our chat room there,\n\n86\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.060\nhe knows his history as well, he mentioned\none called WHAX, and even Whoppix,\n\n87\n00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.100\nbefore that BackTrack.\n\n88\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.850\nSo if we wanna follow the timeline,\n\n89\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.679\na long time ago there was a couple\ndistributions called WHAX and\n\n90\n00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:05.450\nWoppx, and another one called\nAuditor Security Collection.\n\n91\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.746\nAnd these were great Linux distributions,\nWHAX was Slack-based, very minimalistic.\n\n92\n00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:15.403\nAuditor Security Collection was\na live CD that was KOPPIX-based,\n\n93\n00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:21.950\nhad 300 tools pre-compiled in there, and\nthere was some overlap between those two.\n\n94\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.106\nSo what they did, that's really\nwhere BackTracks got its inception,\n\n95\n00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:29.292\nwas from combining or\nkind of taking the best of WHAX and\n\n96\n00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:32.907\nAuditor Security Collection,\nand putting those together.\n\n97\n00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:38.223\nAnd so BackTracks, for a long time was\none of the security distros to get.\n\n98\n00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:41.965\nI remember playing with that and\nusing it, wow,\n\n99\n00:05:41.965 --> 00:05:47.830\nthis comes with all these tools already\nbuilt in here, it was fantastic.\n\n100\n00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.210\nWell, back in 2012 the developers at\nOffensive Security, and the developers\n\n101\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.640\nthat were working on BackTracks really\ndecided they wanted to kinda redo things.\n\n102\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.270\nThey wanted to add a bunch of new\nfeatures and capabilities, but\n\n103\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.130\nrealized that it was gonna require\na lot of re-work under the hood.\n\n104\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.630\nAnd they decided that this would be just\na good time to kinda start over, and\n\n105\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.850\nthey switched over to Debian.\n\n106\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.055\nIn fact I want to say the last guy\nthey brought in, Raphael Hertzog,\n\n107\n00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:16.934\nI wanna say he was their Debian\nguru guy that they brought in.\n\n108\n00:06:16.934 --> 00:06:22.590\nBut that what's happened there,\nis they switched over to Debian.\n\n109\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.850\nThe first official release of Kali was\nin 2013, is when we had our first one.\n\n110\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.480\nSo BackTracks evolved into Kali Linux.\n\n111\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.510\nSo that's a little bit about the history,\nand then as we've been alluding to\n\n112\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.132\na few times, and Zack has talked about the\nname, it's always something that comes up.\n\n113\n00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:43.834\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It probably doesn't have a lot to\n\n114\n00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:47.245\nfunctionality-wise but hey, you know you\nwant to be able to talk intelligently.\n\n115\n00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:51.060\nAnd you get out there, and\npeople are like Kali, Kalima, right?\n\n116\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.750\nThink of Indiana Jones and\nthings like that.\n\n117\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.930\nBut if we take a look,\nin fact let's go out and\n\n118\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.440\nlook at Kali's website here,\nthis is Kali.org.\n\n119\n00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.585\nThis is where we're gonna\nbe able to get the ISOs or\n\n120\n00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:05.180\nwhatever else we need to install it.\n\n121\n00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.670\nYou get a lot of information here,\nthey've got their official documentation.\n\n122\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.940\nThey've got a great community\nthat you can be a part of.\n\n123\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.195\nOffensive Security, again, was the ones\nthat helped maintain and fund all of this.\n\n124\n00:07:19.195 --> 00:07:25.900\nAnd then as far as, I went back and\nfound one of their pages in their history.\n\n125\n00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.449\nThis is an old page, this is from 2012,\nback when Kali was released,\n\n126\n00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.754\nit actually came official I think in 2013.\n\n127\n00:07:31.754 --> 00:07:34.997\nBut it talks about what I\nwas just talking about,\n\n128\n00:07:34.997 --> 00:07:39.900\nhow they scrapped it all and\nstarted fresh, Ubuntu versus Debian.\n\n129\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.660\nBut down here,\nI thought I'd point this out,\n\n130\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.800\nsince we love to talk about this,\nwhat's in a name?\n\n131\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.040\nHindu goddess of time and\n\n132\n00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.305\nchange, Philippine martial art,\ncool word in Swahili.\n\n133\n00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:51.105\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; None of the above,\n\n134\n00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:54.561\nKali is simply a name we came up with for\nour new distribution.\n\n135\n00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:57.702\nSo there you go,\nstraight from the horses mouth.\n\n136\n00:07:57.702 --> 00:08:01.413\nIt really doesn't mean anything,\nit's just a word that they [CROSSTALK].\n\n137\n00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:06.370\n&gt;&gt; But I intend to think they so\nthat movie within [INAUDIBLE].\n\n138\n00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.692\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I mean maybe that works out\ngood for us because now I can, in my mind,\n\n139\n00:08:10.692 --> 00:08:12.722\nI can think of it as coming from that,\n\n140\n00:08:12.722 --> 00:08:16.143\nthey can do goddess\n&gt;&gt; Somebody else might have a different\n\n141\n00:08:16.143 --> 00:08:16.830\nopinion.\n\n142\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.650\nAnd hey, they don't disagree with us, so\n\n143\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.905\nhey, we can kind of have our own\ntruth maybe there if that works.\n\n144\n00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:29.280\n[LAUGH] All right, so a little bit about\nthe history of Kali, where it came from.\n\n145\n00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.610\nAgain, it's one of\nthe popular distributions,\n\n146\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.480\nif you are going to be doing pen testing.\n\n147\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.890\nAny type of security\nwork because of the fact,\n\n148\n00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.230\nthat it is, its got all of the tools,\nfree compiler that is installed in there,\n\n149\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.680\nthe repositories are available\nwith with additional tools.\n\n150\n00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.880\nThey keep tight control over what is\ngetting added to their repositories,\n\n151\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.330\nin fact they will tell you if you\ngo to their documentation in here\n\n152\n00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.480\none of the things that people are tempted\nto do is add additional repositories so\n\n153\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.240\nthey can go get these other tools.\n\n154\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.330\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that, but\njust understand that you are reducing\n\n155\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.340\nthe security that's built\nin to Kali by doing that.\n\n156\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.130\n&gt;&gt; You open the door.\n\n157\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they keep a tight\ncontrol over their repository.\n\n158\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.170\nAs you start adding other repositories,\nnow it's beyond their control and\n\n159\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.080\nyou can introduce things and\nintroduce instability or\n\n160\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.800\ninsecurity, which maybe is what you\nwant and you're okay with that.\n\n161\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.060\nOr if you're trying to\nkeep it buttoned down and\n\n162\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.060\nsecure, stick with your\nofficial repositories for Kali.\n\n163\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.430\n&gt;&gt; And the cost for it is zero?\n\n164\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.210\n&gt;&gt; It is zero.\n\n165\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.830\nIt is one of our favorite\nprice points here at IRProTV.\n\n166\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.950\nThe cost is free and\n\n167\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.500\nyou read on their website that you\nwill never have to pay for Kali Linux.\n\n168\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.220\nTheir intention is to keep it free\nforever, which is a good thing.\n\n169\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.060\nWe like free around here.\n\n170\n00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.570\nAll right, now requirement-wise.\n\n171\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.010\nAnd you can kill the screen feed here.\n\n172\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.350\nWell, actually, you know what?\n\n173\n00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.570\nI can go over and well,\nI'll show you this.\n\n174\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.100\nLet's go over to the Kali documentation.\n\n175\n00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.090\nSorry, Megan.\n\n176\n00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.050\nGoof on you up there.\n\n177\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.100\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe installation requirements.\n\n178\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.840\nSo I know it's a little bit small.\n\n179\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.820\nI can zoom in for you.\n\n180\n00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.560\nMinimum of 20 gigs hard space,\ndisk space for the Kali Linux install.\n\n181\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.920\nIf you're gonna be installing it,\non a hard drive right.\n\n182\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.580\nIf you're running it from a thumb drive or\nsomething like that.\n\n183\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.400\nObviously this requirement\ndoesn't apply to you.\n\n184\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.660\nRAM for I3 to 6 and 64-bit architecture,\n\n185\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.480\nminimum one gigabyte,\nrecommended 2 gigabytes or more.\n\n186\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.720\nAnd just like any operating system they\nwill tell I can run with 1 gigabyte and\n\n187\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.290\nthat's all you got we'll make it work,\nbut it's not gonna be painless.\n\n188\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.420\nIt gonna have to be a little slow\nespecially depending on what\n\n189\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.540\nyou are running, so\nas the application once you get booted up.\n\n190\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.080\n2 gigs recommended but just like\nany other OS the more we through at\n\n191\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.310\nit up to a certain point anyway that\nyou get the diminishing returns but\n\n192\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.290\nup to a certain point we wanna\ninput more memory in there.\n\n193\n00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.170\nCuz when we are loading things\nlike password crackers or\n\n194\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.790\nother things that might be CPU intensive\nthat need to store a lot of info in RAM\n\n195\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.710\nbetter have in more memory.\n\n196\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:52.770\nSo the more you can do it the better.\n\n197\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:11:01.290\nOr CD drive, DVD drive, or USB boot\nsupport to get it installed, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:06.220\nOther than that, pretty slight\nreally when it comes to language.\n\n199\n00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.650\nIt's like most Linux distros,\n\n200\n00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.940\nI mean they're pretty light\non their system requirements.\n\n201\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.970\nJust keep in mind, different tools that\nyou run also have requirements and\n\n202\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.380\nyou're gonna have to add those up, so\n\n203\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.820\nif you're planning on doing a lot of\nmultitasking or running any of those\n\n204\n00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.290\ndisks or memory-intensive applications or\nanything like that, you'll have to\n\n205\n00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.480\nthink about that when you're specing out\nyour system that you wanna run this on.\n\n206\n00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.600\n&gt;&gt; Now are you gonna have to download\nadditional software to manage\n\n207\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.230\nthe Kali Linux or is it all unto itself?\n\n208\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.310\n&gt;&gt; No, it's all unto itself.\n\n209\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.700\nSo let's take a look at\ntheir download page.\n\n210\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.790\nIn fact, let me jump back here.\n\n211\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.480\nAnd downloading Kali Linux.\n\n212\n00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.040\nSo, when you go out there and\nyou decide that you wanna run Kali,\n\n213\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.920\nyou've got your choices of how you're\ngonna go about running it, and\n\n214\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.570\nthen that will determine really what it\nis that you're going to be downloading.\n\n215\n00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.410\nPlatform wise,\nwhich I haven't mentioned yet, wide open,\n\n216\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.740\nI mean there are 32 bit or\n64 bit architecture.\n\n217\n00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.520\nThey even have a branch dedicated to ARM,\nthey have their\n\n218\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.980\nNetHunter which is dedicated to running on\nAndroid devices, really cool option there.\n\n219\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.790\nYou can go ahead and\nget like a little, an older Nexus or\n\n220\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.340\ncertain Galaxy, certain Samsungs.\n\n221\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.540\nThe one, what is it?\n\n222\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.400\nI forgot the name of that darn phone.\n\n223\n00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.970\nThe OnePlus One is another\none besides the Nexus.\n\n224\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.550\nNexus like 5 through Nexus 10,\nthese were NetHunter.\n\n225\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:32.880\nThis is for, basically it's\na version of Kali designed to run on\n\n226\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.010\nthis Android devices give you\na mobile platform, really cool.\n\n227\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.100\nNow what we're gonna go and\ndo here is we're gonna stick with\n\n228\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.580\nKali Linux this one but wanted to make\nsure you're aware they are available.\n\n229\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:49.220\nIt is just incredible like I know they can\nrun on things like a lot of your single\n\n230\n00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.470\nboard computers, like your BeagleBones,\nand your Raspberry Pi is a big one.\n\n231\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.950\nThey've got a distro designed\nto run on Raspberry Pi, so\n\n232\n00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.520\nyou can make headless units.\n\n233\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.120\nThey're talking about running\ndrones with these things.\n\n234\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.410\nAll kinds of neat stuff\nyou can do with Kali.\n\n235\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.920\nSo lots of options there.\n\n236\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.480\nNow, as far as,\nZach you're asking about downloading it,\n\n237\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.110\none of the things you want to do is make\nsure you're getting an official distro.\n\n238\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.750\nWhich means going to kali.org and\ndownloading it from there.\n\n239\n00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.540\nLet me switch back to the main page here,\nnot the documentation.\n\n240\n00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.820\nWhen you go to their main page,\nand I'll do that again.\n\n241\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.660\nRight on their main page you\ngot downloads up to the top.\n\n242\n00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.880\nYou can see download Kali Linux NetHunter.\n\n243\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.170\nThey got their release information.\n\n244\n00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.310\nYou can also click on the wonderful link\ndown here in the middle of the page.\n\n245\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.743\nEither way it's gonna take you\nover the Kali Linux distros.\n\n246\n00:13:41.743 --> 00:13:43.892\nHere you're gonna decide\nwhat it is you want.\n\n247\n00:13:43.892 --> 00:13:47.529\nYou got 32 and 64 bit Kali distributions.\n\n248\n00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:52.887\nGot a light version, which is you\ncan see the image is a lot smaller,\n\n249\n00:13:52.887 --> 00:13:56.910\ndoesn't have nearly\nthe tools built into it.\n\n250\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.000\nYou'd be on your own, but\nif you needed something smaller and\n\n251\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.500\nyou just needed certain tools\nmaybe that's the way you wanna go.\n\n252\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.920\nA few different versions for,\nwith the different desktops enabled.\n\n253\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.510\nWhich is something you can actually\ncustomize, but it's nice that you can pre\n\n254\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.750\nor download one that's pre-configured\nto use the desktop that you would like,\n\n255\n00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.240\nthe desktop manager you wanna use.\n\n256\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.560\nAs we scroll down further we get\ndown into our pre-built VMs.\n\n257\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.100\nVirtualization, right, this is a great\nway to get your feet wet in Kali Linux.\n\n258\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.610\nMost of us are gonna have some type\nof virtualization software available.\n\n259\n00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.540\nAnd Offensive Security has created\nthese virtual hard drives,\n\n260\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.490\nthese pre-built virtual machines\nthat we can simply download and run.\n\n261\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.460\n&gt;&gt; And that is good for\npractice you think?\n\n262\n00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.620\nWould you recommend that?\n\n263\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, this is probably\nthe easiest way to get started.\n\n264\n00:14:44.445 --> 00:14:47.635\nIf you are not sure that\nyou want to use Kali or\n\n265\n00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:52.085\njust want to see what it's about,\nsee if it's something you could use, and\n\n266\n00:14:52.085 --> 00:14:55.665\nyou've got virtualization software\navailable, this is probably the way to go.\n\n267\n00:14:55.665 --> 00:14:58.575\nBecause I don't have to install anything,\nit's all done.\n\n268\n00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:02.465\nI just fire up the virtual machine and\nit's there and if you're newer to Linux,\n\n269\n00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:05.445\nthe installation process can be\na little bit confusing sometimes.\n\n270\n00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.935\nAlthough it is much simpler\nthan it was years ago.\n\n271\n00:15:08.935 --> 00:15:11.465\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day.\n\n272\n00:15:11.465 --> 00:15:17.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But now, like I said, this is\nprobably one of the easiest way to go.\n\n273\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.580\nYou can see if I go over\nto Kali virtual images\n\n274\n00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.880\nI either get several different platforms\nthat they are going to support.\n\n275\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.830\nI've got the Let's see,\nhere's my VMware images.\n\n276\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.430\nSo this is what I use, because I'm\nrunning Workstation on my laptop.\n\n277\n00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.370\nBut I've also got VirtualBox images.\n\n278\n00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.430\nSo if you've got a free.\n\n279\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.160\nVirtualBox is a free\nvirtualization software.\n\n280\n00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.460\nSo now I can get my\nvirtualization software and\n\n281\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:47.090\nmy Kali Linux pre-built hard drive for\nit all for free.\n\n282\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.830\nAnd they even have,\nbelieve it or not, HyperV image.\n\n283\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.620\nIsn't that nice of them?\n\n284\n00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.868\nUsually Windows gets left out.\n\n285\n00:15:53.868 --> 00:15:56.132\nHyperV is never considered.\n\n286\n00:15:56.132 --> 00:16:00.378\nBut the good folks over there at Offensive\nSecurity Have created a Hyper-V drive\n\n287\n00:16:00.378 --> 00:16:00.882\nas well.\n\n288\n00:16:00.882 --> 00:16:04.560\nThey most likely converted one but\nhey, anyway, it works.\n\n289\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.080\nI've downloaded it, I've thrown out\na Hyper-V server and it works just great.\n\n290\n00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.180\n&gt;&gt; And the price is right.\n\n291\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.890\n&gt;&gt; And the price is right.\n\n292\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.750\nExactly.\n\n293\n00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.180\nThey've got it for\nyour ARM hardware as well.\n\n294\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.060\nLike I said they have support for\na lot of different devices.\n\n295\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.140\nAnd then Kali NetHunter which is\ntheir mobile penetration platform.\n\n296\n00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.500\nBut what were gonna be focusing in\non in this series is going to be\n\n297\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.980\nour straight up Kali Linux.\n\n298\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.700\nWe'll take a look at some of\nthe different installation options.\n\n299\n00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.570\nAnd once we get it installed it doesn't\nmatter whether I'm running it from\n\n300\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.690\na Live or a VMWare or what have you.\n\n301\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.280\nThe tools are gonna be the same,\nexcept for persistence.\n\n302\n00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.050\nThat is something we'll\ntalk about as well.\n\n303\n00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.160\nIf you're running this from a live,\nfrom a USB drive, right.\n\n304\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.490\nIt's great because hey, I can take\nanybody's computer if it's available.\n\n305\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.200\nI can throw in my thumb drive,\nI can reboot and I can boot to Kali.\n\n306\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.670\nAnd I can run Linux right there.\n\n307\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.060\nOr run my Kali and have access to\nall my tools from right there.\n\n308\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.820\nSo that's great, except for\n\n309\n00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.400\nthe fact that we don't have\nany persistence there, right?\n\n310\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.910\nBecause when I shut that thing down or\nwhen I unplug that USB drive what about\n\n311\n00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.660\nlogs maybe that I captured or reports\nfrom tools I run and things like that.\n\n312\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.950\nThere is a way that you can set up\nan additional partition on the thumb drive\n\n313\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.560\nthat has persistence,\nthat will allow you to write to that and\n\n314\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.180\nsave things like output from tools,\nreports.\n\n315\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.720\nSo we will show you how to\nbuild one of those as well.\n\n316\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.100\nWhere else was I going with that?\n\n317\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.730\nSo, yeah,\nwe'll take a look at how to do that also.\n\n318\n00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.200\nWhat else do we talk about.\n\n319\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.481\nIs that we talked about the supportive\nplatforms, feature-wise,\n\n320\n00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:51.225\nlike I said, over 600 pre-installed\npenetration testing programs.\n\n321\n00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:53.330\nNow, that right there is great.\n\n322\n00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.170\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question.\n\n323\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:54.956\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; How many\n\n324\n00:17:54.956 --> 00:17:55.670\nprograms-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.156\n&gt;&gt; Never mind, go ahead.\n\n326\n00:17:58.156 --> 00:18:02.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's 600 things that I\ndon't have to try to install, right.\n\n327\n00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.570\nNow, I might not use but half of those.\n\n328\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:08.110\nBut yeah,\nhaving choices is a wonderful thing,\n\n329\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.540\ndifferent tools work at different times,\nwe've all been there.\n\n330\n00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.120\nIf you've done any kind of security work,\ntesting work you know,\n\n331\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.070\nsometimes one tool that worked great\nbefore, doesn't work so well in this\n\n332\n00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.270\nsituation and you need something else or\nyou need to confirm results, right?\n\n333\n00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.440\nThat's another thing that having\nmultiple tools is a big aid in.\n\n334\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.730\nOne running one tool, getting a set\nof results, running another tool.\n\n335\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.041\nGetting same results is confirmation.\n\n336\n00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.933\nThat's proof that I can use\nif we're ever prosecuting or\n\n337\n00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:35.490\nif we have a need to\nprovide this evidence.\n\n338\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.612\nAnd speaking of evidence,\nremember we said that this is\n\n339\n00:18:39.612 --> 00:18:43.483\na penetration\ntesting/forensics distribution.\n\n340\n00:18:43.483 --> 00:18:46.230\nWell what makes it\na forensics distribution?\n\n341\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.450\nWell, because one of the boot\noptions is actually to boot live,\n\n342\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.820\nwhich we've talked about already.\n\n343\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.342\nIt used to be, how can I explain this,\nin Back Tracks, prior to Kali,\n\n344\n00:18:57.342 --> 00:19:01.540\nright, so prior to 2012,\nwhen in running Back Tracks.\n\n345\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.160\nIt had a forensics mode.\n\n346\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.850\nWhen you went to boot Back Tracks\noff of a live live USB or\n\n347\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.960\na disk, it had a forensics\nmode that you could boot into.\n\n348\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:16.580\nAnd what that did is it prevented that,\nBack Tracks, from auto mounting.\n\n349\n00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.730\nIt basically disabled all auto mounting,\nso\n\n350\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.950\nit wouldn't automatically mount any hard\ndrives or anything else that it found\n\n351\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.360\nin the physical hardware that you\nare booting this live distro to.\n\n352\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.590\nAnd it won't touch any of the hard\ndrives internally or the swap space or\n\n353\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.170\nany of the paging systems or\nanything like that.\n\n354\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.053\nAnd the idea is,\nbecause if we're doing forensics,\n\n355\n00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:40.010\nI cannot modify that system\nthat I'm investigating.\n\n356\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.625\nI have to be very,\nvery careful about that.\n\n357\n00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:46.735\nAnd so having a distribution allows\nme to boot up in a mode that says,\n\n358\n00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:49.695\nhey I'm not gonna touch the system\nin any way, make any changes.\n\n359\n00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:53.955\nI'm not gonna touch the hard drive,\nI'm not gonna auto mount anything else.\n\n360\n00:19:53.955 --> 00:19:55.378\nI'm gonna leave it completely alone.\n\n361\n00:19:55.378 --> 00:19:57.395\nIt's a good thing and\nthey've included that in Kali.\n\n362\n00:19:57.395 --> 00:20:01.120\nSo in Back Tracks, it was forensics mode.\n\n363\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.010\nIn Kali Linux it's just called live, but\nit means, again, it won't auto mount or\n\n364\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.810\nanything like that.\n\n365\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.470\nSo great, great operating system.\n\n366\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.120\nWhere was I?\n\n367\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.370\nFeatures, we talked about there's a ton of\ntools that come available in Kali Linux.\n\n368\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.320\nIt's a supported platform for\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n369\n00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.927\nAnybody that's done anything in security,\npen testing, is familiar with Metasploit.\n\n370\n00:20:22.927 --> 00:20:27.594\nIt's a framework where we can build and\ntest and run exploits.\n\n371\n00:20:27.594 --> 00:20:30.518\nAnd Kali Linux is a supported platform,\n\n372\n00:20:30.518 --> 00:20:35.510\nwhich means I can get all of that\nMetasploit up and running on my Kali.\n\n373\n00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.090\nIn fact, it's installed in there already.\n\n374\n00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.400\nI say Kali a live mode.\n\n375\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.810\nOne thing I will say about that again,\nauto mounting is disabled,\n\n376\n00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.774\ndoesn't touch internal hard drive or\nswap space, but people in offensive\n\n377\n00:20:50.774 --> 00:20:55.795\nsecurity and something we should know\nalready, you must test it, right.\n\n378\n00:20:55.795 --> 00:21:00.275\nThey'll let you know hey, yes this is what\nit does, it shouldn't do any of these.\n\n379\n00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:05.532\nDo not go into a live active case and run\nKali for the first time in live mode and\n\n380\n00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:10.720\nhope that it's not gonna touch anything or\nmodify anything, right?\n\n381\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.955\nTest that out first outside of\nan actual case to make sure.\n\n382\n00:21:15.955 --> 00:21:19.891\nYou have to verify all of that and\nmake sure that your particular scenario,\n\n383\n00:21:19.891 --> 00:21:22.760\nyou're gonna get the results\nthat you expect.\n\n384\n00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.010\nYou don't want to corrupt anything or\ndestroy any evidence by testing out your\n\n385\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.470\nKali live thumb drive on\nactive evidence of any kind.\n\n386\n00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Trust, but verify.\n\n387\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.060\n&gt;&gt; Trust, but verify, exactly right.\n\n388\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.810\nAll right.\nWell, so\n\n389\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.760\nthat's a little bit about the history of\nLinux, where it came from, why we want,\n\n390\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.110\ndid I say Kali, the history of Linux, the\nhistory of Kali Linux, where it came from,\n\n391\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.620\nwhat it's built for, the different options\nthat we have to install, our requirements.\n\n392\n00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.040\nAnd so I think that'll do it for\nthis episode.\n\n393\n00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.260\nWhen we come back, we'll actually take\na look at getting it installed and\n\n394\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.310\ngetting it up and running.\n\n395\n00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, Mike you got me excited and\nyou did a great job.\n\n396\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.740\nThank you very, very much.\n\n397\n00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.930\nSo it's a history of Kali Linux as we\ncontinue on with the series Kali Linux.\n\n398\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.180\nAnd thanks for watching.\n\n399\n00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.410\nAnd make sure you watch all\nof the videos in that series.\n\n400\n00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.360\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n401\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.750\nRemember a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n402\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.730\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n403\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.520\n&gt;&gt; And

ITPRO.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:17.220\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.620\nAs we continue one with Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.520\nAnd right now, we're gonna be\ndoing Kali USB drive work, right?\n\n10\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.420\nWe're going to learn actually\nhow to download onto a USB.\n\n11\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.853\nAnd Mike Rodrick is gonna do that for us.\n\n12\n00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:33.205\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because he's much smarter than I am.\n\n13\n00:00:33.205 --> 00:00:35.225\nI don't know about that but\nthanks for having me here Zack.\n\n14\n00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.345\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And exactly what we wanna look\n\n15\n00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.895\nat in this episode is how I can run\n\n16\n00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:43.810\nCali Linux off of the USB drive\nbasically running it live.\n\n17\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.359\nRight?\nI don't want to install it maybe on my\n\n18\n00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.365\nmachine I just want to test it out,\n\n19\n00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:52.060\nI don't want to mess anything\nup on my everyday driver.\n\n20\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.220\nOr I want a version of Kali that I can\ncarry around with me in my pocket or\n\n21\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.430\nin my go bag, right.\n\n22\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.450\nI can have that with me and I can anywhere\nI've got access to physical hardware, and\n\n23\n00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.380\nwill allow me to use and\nit's setup to boot to USB or\n\n24\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.370\nI can change that if they let me.\n\n25\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.400\nYou know I can boot up my\nKali Linux Distro and go from there.\n\n26\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.070\nWhere you're gonna see\neventually how we can do this\n\n27\n00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.330\nwith persistence where I can actually\nadd a persistent storage space.\n\n28\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.870\nBut for right now, let's focus in on, one,\nobtaining our image, verifying that image.\n\n29\n00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.310\nAnd then getting it onto a thumb drive, so\n\n30\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850\nwe can carry our carry our Kali\ndistro with us wherever we go.\n\n31\n00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.810\nSound like a plan?\n\n32\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.450\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a plan.\n\n33\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.480\nAnd Kali is kind of like\nhaving a computerized.\n\n34\n00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.410\nColombo, right?\n\n35\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.215\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much.\n\n36\n00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:36.319\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n37\n00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.605\n&gt;&gt; When we talked about\n\n38\n00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:41.918\nin the other episodes where it is\na distribution that is designed for\n\n39\n00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.500\npen testing as well as forensics works.\n\n40\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.490\nSo that's it, it's great because it has\nall these tools pre compiled in there,\n\n41\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.900\nyou can do custom images, but\n\n42\n00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.450\nheck, I don't know,\n[LAUGH] there's not a lot to add to it.\n\n43\n00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.570\nThere is a few things but it comes with\njust about everything you need in there.\n\n44\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.808\nSo, great stuff.\n\n45\n00:01:57.808 --> 00:02:00.840\nAll right, so, first thing we've gotta do,\nwhen we talk about\n\n46\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.150\ncreating a USB thumb drive that's\ngonna be running [INAUDIBLE] Linux.\n\n47\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.710\nOur requirements are gonna be pretty\nsimple, we need an ISO, right?\n\n48\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.770\nThat's easy to obtain, we go out to\nCali.org and we get that for free.\n\n49\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.370\nI'll show you where that\nis in just a second.\n\n50\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.920\nAnd we're gonna be doing\nthis from Windows.\n\n51\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.160\nI'll show you a couple commands where\nyou can do this from Linux as well, and\n\n52\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.360\nmaybe we'll even have time to try it out.\n\n53\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.240\nI figure a lot of people that\nare getting into Cali are just getting\n\n54\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.410\nfamiliar with Cali.\n\n55\n00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.460\nAre probably running Windows\nas a daily driver, so\n\n56\n00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.340\nthat's what I want to start with,\nshow you how to do that, and for\n\n57\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.100\nthat we'll need a utility that allows me\nto create a bootable USB withing Windows.\n\n58\n00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.690\nThere's several out there available.\n\n59\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.824\nUbuntu.\n\n60\n00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:42.881\nI can't remember how to say that one.\n\n61\n00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:43.532\n&gt;&gt; Ubuntu.\n\n62\n00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:46.810\n&gt;&gt; There's several good ones\nout there that you can get.\n\n63\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.320\nI'll show you the one that I use.\n\n64\n00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.810\nIt's actually the one that offensive\nsec or kali.org recommends.\n\n65\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.530\nBut it's not the only one.\n\n66\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.860\nThere's definitely more.\n\n67\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.050\nAnd then what else do we need?\n\n68\n00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800\nA thumb drive.\nNow the drive needs to be at least\n\n69\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.450\nfour gigabytes in size.\n\n70\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.670\nIt's what they're gonna recommend,\nlarger will be better.\n\n71\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.260\nI've got a 16 gig in here, eight gig, I\nmean a four gig was really would be okay.\n\n72\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.120\nIf you wanna do persistence I wouldn't\ngo with anything smaller than eight,\n\n73\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.430\n16 being ideal and\ncheapest thumb drives are today.\n\n74\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.300\n&gt;&gt; Get a 32 for that matter.\n\n75\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's something you don't\nreally need too much more space than that,\n\n76\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.150\nbut having a nice 16 gig\nwhich is plenty of room for\n\n77\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.370\nthe installation, plenty of room for your\npersistent partition later on as well.\n\n78\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.930\nAll right, so with that being said we\nknow what we need to do to do this.\n\n79\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.520\nLet's go out and get it done.\n\n80\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.660\nTake a look at my screen here.\n\n81\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.250\nI'm gonna open up Kali.org and I'm gonna\ngo to their downloads page and this is\n\n82\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.480\nwhere we're gonna download the ISO that we\nare gonna try to put on that phone drive.\n\n83\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.880\nYou got a couple choices here.\n\n84\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.560\nLet me zoom in just a little bit.\n\n85\n00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.761\nWe're gonna stick with the full\nblown version of Kali,\n\n86\n00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.178\nthe latest one at the time\nof the shooting is 2017.1.\n\n87\n00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:05.475\nAnd you can see those top 2 lines there,\nyou got 64-bit and you've got 32-bit.\n\n88\n00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.735\nAnd you should know the difference\nat this point, if not,\n\n89\n00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:12.305\nremember your 32-bit can only\naccess up to 4 gigs of memory.\n\n90\n00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:17.510\nWhere 64-bit can go well beyond that,\nso people always think,\n\n91\n00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.150\nI'm gonna grab the 64-bit version\nbecause that's the one I want and\n\n92\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.510\nit can use more memory, let's get it.\n\n93\n00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.460\nI will tell you that if you're\ngonna be running off of a live,\n\n94\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.750\nlike this off of a thumb drive,\nmight want to consider the 32-bit\n\n95\n00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.550\nbecause we know is not\nthat heavy on memory and\n\n96\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.580\n32 bit can run on more hardware right?\n\n97\n00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.280\nWhereas if I get that 64 bit version,\n\n98\n00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.460\nI might run into hardware\nthat doesn't support 32.\n\n99\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.330\nSo when I go to plug that thumb drive\nin there and reboot, it won't work.\n\n100\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.600\nSo, a lot of times I will go with the 32\nbit version for my live on my thumb drive.\n\n101\n00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.970\nSo you would download the ISO.\n\n102\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.390\nBy clicking on that ISO link, or\nusing a torrent client if you want,\n\n103\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.020\nwhichever one you found appropriate.\n\n104\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.600\nAnd then you would also\nwant to get this checksum.\n\n105\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.130\nYou see this last column here,\nsha256sum, that is our checksum.\n\n106\n00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.480\nSo what they're doing,\nis they've posted this ISO up there, and\n\n107\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.860\nthey've given you the sha256 Checksum.\n\n108\n00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.950\nWhat they expect you to do or\nwhat you should want to do,\n\n109\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.470\nis download this ISO,\nrun your own checksum against it,\n\n110\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.430\ncompare it with a number a number\nthey've got posted up here.\n\n111\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.060\nThat way you know, that your download\nis not corrupt, it's complete.\n\n112\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.785\nAnd it hasn't been modified\nfrom what Offensive Security or\n\n113\n00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:39.550\ncali.org wants you to get, right?\n\n114\n00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.970\nAnd that's something that a lot\nof the bade guys try to do,\n\n115\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.550\nespecially with things like this, they can\ndo DNS poisoning, somehow redirect you.\n\n116\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.900\nYou know, they've got control over their\nsite, but if there's mirrors that you're\n\n117\n00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.740\npulling from you know, how do they\nverify what the mirrors are doing?\n\n118\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.960\nAre those guys.\n\n119\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.110\nModifying that software somehow, and\n\n120\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.230\nthen putting it up there with a new\nchecksum, or whatever the case may be.\n\n121\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.340\nSo do be careful with that.\n\n122\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.030\nMake sure you go through the steps,\nit's really easy, I'll show you,\n\n123\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.630\nto verify that your download\nis indeed intact and\n\n124\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.270\ndoesn't have anything extra, in there that\nyou might not want, some nasty surprise.\n\n125\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.440\nAlright, Zack, so\nI've got this downloaded.\n\n126\n00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.780\nLet's see where I put that guy.\n\n127\n00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.660\nYou'd think I would have that.\n\n128\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.170\nThere we go.\nI lied.\n\n129\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.730\nI moved it already.\n\n130\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.500\nIt's over here.\n\n131\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.734\nD ISO's.\nAnd there is my Kali/Linux ISO.\n\n132\n00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:31.430\nAlright.\n\n133\n00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.050\nAlright?\n\n134\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.880\nNow what I wanted to do.\n\n135\n00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.260\nI went ahead and downloaded it but\n\n136\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.092\nI didn't think you guys\nwanted to watch that.\n\n137\n00:06:36.092 --> 00:06:37.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I do want to verify that.\n\n138\n00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.790\n&gt;&gt; If you got a couple of hours.\n\n139\n00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.920\nIf you do, that's fine.\n\n140\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.480\n&gt;&gt; I do want verify that check sum.\n\n141\n00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.620\nSo, let me.\n\n142\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.020\nActually, that's it my downloads folder.\n\n143\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.030\nAgain, one of those things where\nthere's several different utilities\n\n144\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.400\nthat can do this for you.\n\n145\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.570\nI got this md5 and hsa check sum utility.\n\n146\n00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.831\nThen I'm gonna fire up.\n\n147\n00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:57.031\nAnd what I want to know is what file and\nwhat hash do I have so\n\n148\n00:06:57.031 --> 00:06:59.720\nthat it can do the comparison for me.\n\n149\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:08.310\nSo I'm gonna browse, and go over to ISO's\nand grab that Kali Linux ISO, alright?\n\n150\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.930\nIt's gonna begin the process of running.\n\n151\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.240\nI should have uncheck a couple of those\nbecauseI really all I need The SHA-256,\n\n152\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.350\nbut we'll go ahead and\nlet it calculate the others out as well.\n\n153\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.174\n&gt;&gt; Besides, it's fun it's animation,\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n154\n00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:21.600\n&gt;&gt; Which makes it fun for everybody.\n\n155\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.180\n&gt;&gt; It's fun to watch.\n\n156\n00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.020\nAnd while that's going I'm going I'm\ngonna go over here to the website and\n\n157\n00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.800\nI'm gonna grab the check sum.\n\n158\n00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.810\nThat they have made available and\nwe'll copy that.\n\n159\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.470\nGo back over to our program.\n\n160\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.640\nAnd there's the HSA256 value.\n\n161\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.430\nI am going to paste mine in there.\n\n162\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.100\nI can do a visual, right?\n\n163\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.878\nI can zoom in here.\n\n164\n00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:47.030\n[COUGH] And I could state\ncomparing five zero one bravo\n\n165\n00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.090\nthree seven four seven echo\nfive alpha chart, yeah no.\n\n166\n00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.910\nNot so much.\n\n167\n00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.245\nHow about I just click the verify button?\n\n168\n00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:58.401\nAnd it tells me hey\nthe SHA256 hash mashed.\n\n169\n00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.173\nSo I'm good to go.\n\n170\n00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:02.044\nI know that my ISO that I downloaded.\n\n171\n00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:03.500\nIs indeed intact.\n\n172\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.309\nThere was no accidental\ncorruption during the download.\n\n173\n00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:09.200\nThere's nothing else added to\nthat ISO that I wasn't expecting.\n\n174\n00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.360\n&gt;&gt; That's incredible.\n\n175\n00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.353\nThey make it so complete and\nthey give you that back security as well.\n\n176\n00:08:15.353 --> 00:08:16.298\nBack.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n177\n00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:18.760\nAll right, so\nnow that we've gotta downloaded,\n\n178\n00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.570\nthe next thing we are going to do\nis create our bootable thumb drive.\n\n179\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.000\n&gt;&gt; Bootable.\n&gt;&gt; So I've got my thumb drive plugged in.\n\n180\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.010\nThis is my good old pny sitting\nover here and I'm going to fire\n\n181\n00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.690\nup a little program called Win32\ndisk imager, a nice free utility.\n\n182\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.560\nSo we always like free, right?\n\n183\n00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Free is good.\n\n184\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Free is good, and\nlet me zoom in with another tool so\n\n185\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.870\nI can actually do some\nclicking while we're in here.\n\n186\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.420\nSo you can see it's a simple utility,\ndoesn't even install.\n\n187\n00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.760\nIt just runs.\n\n188\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.880\nI'm gonna go find my image file,\nwhich in my case, and\n\n189\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.630\nnow that I'm zoomed in I\ncan't see my entire window.\n\n190\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.050\nLet me go find that guy,\nI dumped it over to my ISO folder.\n\n191\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.000\nNow it does ask me for a disk image.\n\n192\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.240\nIt's looking for an img file by default.\n\n193\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.850\nThat's okay, I can change that.\n\n194\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.810\nI noticed nothing shows up in my folder.\n\n195\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.070\nI can change that to all files.\n\n196\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.830\nNow I can see my dot ISOs.\n\n197\n00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.540\nAnd there's my Kali Linux.\n\n198\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.730\nAnd I'm gonna click Open.\n\n199\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.730\nSo even though it was defaulting to IMG,\nit'll work fine with a .iso file.\n\n200\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.650\nSo I've got that.\n\n201\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.730\nNow I wanna make sure I've\ngot the right device.\n\n202\n00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.040\nThis is something you\nwould definitely wanna do.\n\n203\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.170\nYou do not want to\noverwrite the wrong drive.\n\n204\n00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.070\nMake sure you've got your thumb drive and\nlet me do it.\n\n205\n00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.960\nI'll do a I just file in Windows Explorer.\n\n206\n00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.710\nI can see my drive is E colon.\n\n207\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.960\nIt's actually showing up as E and G, and\n\n208\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.930\nthat's because it's\nalready been formatted.\n\n209\n00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.980\nI've run through this as\na test beforehand, so\n\n210\n00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.580\nWindows is having trouble trying to\nfigure out what is on the drive,\n\n211\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.020\nnot recognizing the file\nsystem all that well.\n\n212\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.870\nBut that's okay cuz we're\ngonna format it anyway.\n\n213\n00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.100\nSo I've got my correct device selected,\nnot gonna bother with this, but\n\n214\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.270\nnotice this utility actually\nwill do SHA-256 as well.\n\n215\n00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.570\nSome of your disk writing\nutilities don't do that.\n\n216\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.110\nThat's why I have a separate\nprogram to check my hashes.\n\n217\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.980\nOnce you've got your ISO and\nyour device selected,\n\n218\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.470\nit's as simple as clicking Write.\n\n219\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.180\nAnd it's gonna tell me, hey,\nyou could corrupt your device,\n\n220\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.620\nyou could write to the wrong drive.\n\n221\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.230\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n222\n00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.100\nThis is your chance to double check.\n\n223\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.010\n&gt;&gt; We did the checksum.\n\n224\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.140\n&gt;&gt; We did the checksums and\nwe're ready to go.\n\n225\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.500\nWe'll click Yes, and\nit'll begin the process.\n\n226\n00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.480\nAnd we'll let this run, it shouldn't\ntake more than ten minutes or so.\n\n227\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.410\nBut rather than you guys have me\nsit here and watch my progress bar\n\n228\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.690\nthrough the magic of TV we'll come\nback as soon as it's finished.\n\n229\n00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.460\n&gt;&gt; I could serenade them.\n\n230\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.650\n&gt;&gt; It's a possibility.\n\n231\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.865\n&gt;&gt; Nah, never mind, we'll come back.\n\n232\n00:10:43.865 --> 00:10:46.335\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nAll right,\n\n233\n00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:47.345\nwe're back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n234\n00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:50.105\nIf we take a look at my screen in here,\nI will zoom in for us.\n\n235\n00:10:50.105 --> 00:10:52.525\nAnd we've got the old right successful.\n\n236\n00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:53.825\nThat's a good sign, all right.\n\n237\n00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:54.785\n&gt;&gt; It's a good thing.\n\n238\n00:10:54.785 --> 00:10:56.165\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll click Okay.\n\n239\n00:10:56.165 --> 00:10:57.955\nAnd I'll exit out of that program.\n\n240\n00:10:57.955 --> 00:11:02.235\nNow that thumb drive, according to\nWindows is gonna look really fugly.\n\n241\n00:11:02.235 --> 00:11:04.355\nAnd it's not gonna recognize it, right.\n\n242\n00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:07.143\nCuz it's not gonna be able\nto read that file system.\n\n243\n00:11:07.143 --> 00:11:11.130\nBut we could now reboot my system and\n\n244\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.350\nthen maybe hit F12 or whatever it is on\nyour computer, like on my laptop here,\n\n245\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.300\nF12 to get my one time boot menu, pick\nmy usb drive and I could boot to that.\n\n246\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.880\nThe problem is I wouldn't be able to show\nyou because I don't have the display port\n\n247\n00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.320\nand mirroring driver,\nsome things like that.\n\n248\n00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.800\nWhat I can try to do is install\nthis into a virtual machine and\n\n249\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.030\nshow you that we did succeed in booting or\ncreating this live thumb drive.\n\n250\n00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.660\nSo let's do that.\n\n251\n00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.740\nLet's flip over to.\n\n252\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:37.860\n&gt;&gt; Let's do that.\n\n253\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.910\n&gt;&gt; We're going to try.\n\n254\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.350\nThis can be tricky, again.\n\n255\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.820\nBut once the write finishes, you just\ntake that thumb drive to whatever system.\n\n256\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.090\nThrow it in there.\n\n257\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.850\nGet to your one time boot menu.\n\n258\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.830\nChoose the thumb drive and it should\nboot up to Cali Lennox no problem.\n\n259\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.980\nTrying to do it a virtual\nmachine sometimes can be tricky.\n\n260\n00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.570\nOk so VM ware, or\na VM workstation is what I'm using.\n\n261\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.170\nYour virtualization software might\nbe a little bit different as far as\n\n262\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.690\nhow you get it to boot to USB.\n\n263\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.580\nI had to go in here and\nchange my advanced options and\n\n264\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.000\nboot with UFI instead of BIOS which\nallows me to boot to the USB.\n\n265\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.646\nAgain check your documentation for\nyour particular virtualization,\n\n266\n00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:21.299\nbut my thumb drive is in, we are going\nto power this virtual machine up.\n\n267\n00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:27.240\nIt's gonna warn me cuz the USB stick,\nWindows has control of it now.\n\n268\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.090\nWorkstation is gonna take it over, so\nit disappears from my system tray for\n\n269\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.980\nWindows, which is behind my\npicture in picture down there.\n\n270\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.780\nIt disappeared from here and\nnow it's showing up in my Kali.\n\n271\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.290\nAnd we'll see, we'll let this boot.\n\n272\n00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.700\nSo there you can see it's\ngoing to the EFI boot.\n\n273\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.680\nProbably will take it a minute as it\nchecks to see what boot options are there.\n\n274\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.450\nYou can see a trial to virtual SCSI,\na trial to virtual SETA.\n\n275\n00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.480\nNow it's hitting the EFI network.\n\n276\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.030\nIt should hit my thumb drive\nhere in just a second and\n\n277\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.080\nactually boot up to Kali Linux.\n\n278\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.540\nSo we'll give it a minute.\n\n279\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.870\nAnd we'll use magical TV, so\nwe don't have to watch it.\n\n280\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.580\nWe'll come back as soon as I finish.\n\n281\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.590\nAll right and we're back and there we go.\n\n282\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.120\nNow take it a little while\nto boot to that USB.\n\n283\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.740\nI mean, we're going through one,\nwe're going to USB,\n\n284\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.540\nthen we're going to my\nvirtualization technology.\n\n285\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.490\nIt's gonna load that stuff in the memory\nand give me this options here,\n\n286\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.240\nbut [COUGH] Mm, excuse me.\n\n287\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.100\nI can see that I've got my\nKali Linux live boot menu.\n\n288\n00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.920\nI've got several options,\nI'll choose Live System.\n\n289\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.410\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n290\n00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.010\nAnd it should boot up or\nfinish the boot process here.\n\n291\n00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.740\nAnd give me my desktop.\n\n292\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.690\nNow it will be ugly because at this point-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.810\n&gt;&gt; In my virtualization,\n\n294\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.430\nthere's no drivers-\n&gt;&gt; I think it's beautiful.\n\n295\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway if you're a Linux fan,\n\n296\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.930\nyou'll love watching this scroll by.\n\n297\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.390\nThat's usually a good sign,\nlots of green, okay,\n\n298\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.180\nas it's starting up different services,\nmounting different devices there.\n\n299\n00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.339\nWe do like to see that.\n\n300\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.800\nJust my resolution'll be a little off\nbecause I haven't had time to install.\n\n301\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.230\nOr I won't be able to install the VM\nworkstation tools, the virtualization\n\n302\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.490\ntools to give me my stretchable\ndesktop and all that good stuff.\n\n303\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.660\nBecause it is a live distro.\n\n304\n00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.836\nSo wait for that desktop to pop up.\n\n305\n00:14:16.477 --> 00:14:18.910\nAnd eventually, there we go.\n\n306\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.920\nWe are at Kali.\n\n307\n00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.240\nAnd I've got a full blown\nrunning install of Kali Linux.\n\n308\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.350\nBut again, it's on our thumb drive.\n\n309\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.070\nSo I can kick this thing out and\ntake it with me wherever I want.\n\n310\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.450\nAny machine that I got physical access to.\n\n311\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.790\nIt's got the supporting hardware and\nit boots to USB.\n\n312\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:41.260\nI can fire this up and\nwe should be good to go, all right?\n\n313\n00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.120\nLet's see what else.\n\n314\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.045\nSo that's my USB install from Windows.\n\n315\n00:14:45.045 --> 00:14:47.395\nNow from Linux,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n316\n00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:51.465\nWe'll try to use that same thumb drive and\njust see if we can override it,\n\n317\n00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:54.615\nor at least I'll get the process\nstarted so you can see it.\n\n318\n00:14:54.615 --> 00:14:56.265\nBut everything else is\ngonna be the same right?\n\n319\n00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:59.275\nOnce it finishes, you take it to\na machine and you go boot in up.\n\n320\n00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:02.765\nSo let me flip over to the,\nI'm gonna shut this guy down so\n\n321\n00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:04.775\nI can free up that thumb drive.\n\n322\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.060\nI'm not even gonna worry about\ndoing graceful shutdowns.\n\n323\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.782\nI'm gonna flip over to my Linux VM,\nor my Kali VM.\n\n324\n00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:22.020\nGet logged in here,\nget rid of that message from Windows.\n\n325\n00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.040\nCuz as soon as I shut that machine down,\n\n326\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.100\nthe thumb drive went back over to Windows\nand it said hey, I don't recognize this.\n\n327\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.200\nDo you wanna format it?\n\n328\n00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.367\nNo, no we don't Windows, leave it alone.\n\n329\n00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:35.024\nIn this one we can go full screen so\nwe can see it a little bit better.\n\n330\n00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:40.087\nSo this is just a VM that I've, actually\none of the VM's that I've downloaded\n\n331\n00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:44.766\nby Cali.org provided by Offensive\nSecurity, that I use all the time for\n\n332\n00:15:44.766 --> 00:15:50.010\na lot of my shows, but if we are going to\nCreate a bootable thumb drive from Linux.\n\n333\n00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.322\nMake that little bit bigger so\nyou guys can see that out there.\n\n334\n00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:59.763\nThe same thing would have to happen,\nfirst we'd have to have an ISO,\n\n335\n00:15:59.763 --> 00:16:01.763\nwhich I think I dumped in here.\n\n336\n00:16:01.763 --> 00:16:04.272\nThere is my Cali-Linux ISO.\n\n337\n00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:05.560\nThat I've downloaded.\n\n338\n00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.970\nWe wanna go through and do our checksum\nto make sure that that is valid.\n\n339\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.340\nReally, I've already checked it\non the Windows side of things and\n\n340\n00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.440\nthen I copied the ISO over\nhere to my Linux machine.\n\n341\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.720\nSo I'm not worried about anything\ngetting slipped in, in the meantime.\n\n342\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.830\nFor this though, let's do this.\n\n343\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:29.590\nLet's make sure my thumb\ndrive is ejected from Kali.\n\n344\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.316\nSo I'm going to drop down out of this\nmaximize mode and just make sure, yep,\n\n345\n00:16:33.316 --> 00:16:35.659\nthat thumb drive is not\nshowing up under there.\n\n346\n00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:38.642\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n347\n00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:41.090\nAll right, cuz really what you'd wanna do,\nthe biggest thing.\n\n348\n00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.200\nAnd we were talking about this in the chat\nroom is with Linux we're gonna be using DD\n\n349\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.130\nto write the ISO to the thumb drive.\n\n350\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.994\nIt's really no big deal, just moving that\nfile over there, getting a bootable,\n\n351\n00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:51.892\nwe're good to go.\n\n352\n00:16:51.892 --> 00:16:56.035\nBut, with DD, there's not a lot of checks,\nin other words,\n\n353\n00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:58.119\nyou're doing it from a shell.\n\n354\n00:16:58.119 --> 00:17:02.340\nYou're typing in the in-file,\nthe input file, the ISO in this case, and\n\n355\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.757\nthen the output file which is\ngonna be your removable media,\n\n356\n00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:07.773\nyour device you want to write it to.\n\n357\n00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:10.310\nIf you get that wrong there's\nnot a lot of checks involved.\n\n358\n00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.510\nYou can end up overwriting\nthe wrong drive.\n\n359\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.662\nSo one of the things you\ncould do is do an flist.\n\n360\n00:17:15.662 --> 00:17:16.692\nI'm sorry, flist.\n\n361\n00:17:16.692 --> 00:17:18.021\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:20.922\n&gt;&gt; Let's do an fdisk- l to see what I've\n\n363\n00:17:20.922 --> 00:17:22.590\ngot, all right?\n\n364\n00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.650\nAnd this is the hard drive,\nmy normal hard drive, for my Linux boot.\n\n365\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.980\nI can see my SDA and\nthen my three partitions on there.\n\n366\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.590\nMy swap partition, my extended partition,\nand my actual Linux partition.\n\n367\n00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:33.500\nSo we're good to go.\n\n368\n00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.980\nWhat this is doing is saying, all right,\n\n369\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.940\nlet me see what I've got in my system\nbefore I put the thumb drive in.\n\n370\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.290\nNow lets put the thumb drive in and\nrun this command again and\n\n371\n00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.830\nsee what changed, that way I know for\nsure which one is my thumb drive and\n\n372\n00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.120\nI'm not overwriting the wrong drive,\nright.\n\n373\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.909\nSo I am going to drop out of my maximize\nmode just so I can get to my icon.\n\n374\n00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:57.205\n[COUGH] Or\nactually I could do that from here.\n\n375\n00:17:57.205 --> 00:18:02.146\nI guess if we go up to the menu and go to\nVM, Removable Devices and I can grab that\n\n376\n00:18:02.146 --> 00:18:06.722\nthumb drive, disconnect from the host,\npop it into my Linux machine.\n\n377\n00:18:09.104 --> 00:18:12.394\nAnd it sees it that it's Kali,\ncuz we just finished formatting and\n\n378\n00:18:12.394 --> 00:18:14.040\nwriting Kali to it, right?\n\n379\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.100\nWe're gonna do it again.\n\n380\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.710\nBut now if I do the same command,\n\n381\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.400\nif I f disk dash l,\nlet's see what we get that's new.\n\n382\n00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.560\nWe can see when I ran it the first time\nI just got those three for SDA one.\n\n383\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.510\nStill have my sda1 now I have my sdb1 and\n2, all right.\n\n384\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:37.270\nSo that is what we are going to write to,\nIs it's going to be that sdb.\n\n385\n00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.350\nSo let's do this.\n\n386\n00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.950\nLet me clear that screen up for us.\n\n387\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:49.050\nAnd the command is simply gonna be DDE and\nthen your input file equals,\n\n388\n00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.360\nand then wherever I put that now I\ncan't remember where did I put that?\n\n389\n00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.895\nI put that in ISOs right.\n\n390\n00:18:54.895 --> 00:19:01.026\nSwitch ISOs and did I capitalize that?\n\n391\n00:19:01.026 --> 00:19:02.360\nIs it not liking that?\n\n392\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.060\nAll right, let's doublecheck my directory.\n\n393\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.163\nWho knows what I wrote there.\n\n394\n00:19:07.163 --> 00:19:10.050\nAnd I did in fact, it's ISOs, all right.\n\n395\n00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.770\nSo let's try that one more time.\n\n396\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:16.716\nLet's do dd, and then my input file =,\n\n397\n00:19:16.716 --> 00:19:22.685\nswitch, that could be\nwhat I was missing there.\n\n398\n00:19:22.685 --> 00:19:24.681\nSwitch ISOs.\n\n399\n00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:27.578\nWhy I capitalize those, I'll never know.\n\n400\n00:19:27.578 --> 00:19:32.504\nAnd then inside there is my, if I\nremember what the name of that file is.\n\n401\n00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.798\nKali, it starts with Kali, there we go.\n\n402\n00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:37.642\nAll right, so\nI got my path to my input file, and\n\n403\n00:19:37.642 --> 00:19:40.430\nthen I'm gonna have my output file.\n\n404\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:45.240\nEqual to switch Dev,\nswitch sd, what is that,\n\n405\n00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.560\nsdb, in our case.\n\n406\n00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.772\nAnd then you got your block size,\nwhere you can change that,\n\n407\n00:19:52.772 --> 00:19:55.256\nthey're gonna recommend 512.\n\n408\n00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.451\nAs far as the guys and gals out there\nat Offense Security and Kali.org,\n\n409\n00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.047\nthey recommend 5-12.\n\n410\n00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:05.804\nYou can change that, you can speed\nup the write process a little bit\n\n411\n00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:10.163\nby changing that block size, but they're\ntelling us that hey this is the size\n\n412\n00:20:10.163 --> 00:20:13.002\nwe found that's most\nconsistently successful.\n\n413\n00:20:13.002 --> 00:20:16.745\nIn fact if you go to a Mac because\nyou can do this on Mac OS,\n\n414\n00:20:16.745 --> 00:20:22.830\nyou've got your DD command there disk util\ninstead of F disk to list your partition.\n\n415\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.560\nSame process, list them out before\nyou plug the thumb drive in.\n\n416\n00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.500\nList them out once you plug the thumb\ndrive in using disk util and then it's\n\n417\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.720\nthe same DD command, although they'll\nrecommend using a block size of one meg.\n\n418\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.050\nWhen writing it for Mac OS X,\nthey say this is the size,\n\n419\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.510\nwe found this is the most successful.\n\n420\n00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:46.490\nSo we'll go ahead and run that and\nassuming I did everything correctly,\n\n421\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.890\nit should write this out\nto my thumb drive and\n\n422\n00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.740\nI'll again have another\nbootable thumb drive.\n\n423\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.610\nSo we'll do a magic of TV timeout,\nat least let this finish command.\n\n424\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.020\nI can show you what the results\nlook like and we'll go from there.\n\n425\n00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.370\nSo we'll be back in a couple,\nall right, there we go.\n\n426\n00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.798\nThrough the magic of TV,\n\n427\n00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:08.286\nwe are done writing that file out to our\nUSB thumb drive and we now have a bootable\n\n428\n00:21:08.286 --> 00:21:13.048\nUSB thumb drive that is running Kali Linux\nthat we can take with us anywhere we want.\n\n429\n00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:16.043\nFantastic, now some of you\nmight be asking yourself, boy,\n\n430\n00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:18.524\nthat was a lot of work just\nto get it running in a VM.\n\n431\n00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:22.833\nAnd remember, I didn't do this to get\nthe thumb drive to work in the VM.\n\n432\n00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:26.556\nIf you need the portability of a USB thumb\ndrive, that's definitely the way to go.\n\n433\n00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:29.170\nI used the VM just to\nshow you that it worked.\n\n434\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.215\nIf I didn't need that portability,\nif I just want to get my feet wet with\n\n435\n00:21:32.215 --> 00:21:37.260\nKali Linux, download the ISO, use your\nvirtualization software to just mount up\n\n436\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.560\nthat ISO on a blank virtual machine and\nyou'll get the same results, right?\n\n437\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.340\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n438\n00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:48.908\nAll right, I'm going to flip\nover to another VM that I have.\n\n439\n00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:51.809\nThis is a VM that I just\ncreated before the show.\n\n440\n00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:53.530\nThere's nothing installed on it.\n\n441\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.230\nIt's a blank hard drive,\nI just gave it the name.\n\n442\n00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.966\nIn face, I misspelled Kali up there.\n\n443\n00:21:57.966 --> 00:22:00.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just gave it a name in a blank hard\n\n444\n00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:03.190\ndrive and did nothing to it.\n\n445\n00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.520\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nmake sure my ISO is mounted.\n\n446\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.820\nSo I go to my CD/DVD drive,\nI have that ISO mounted.\n\n447\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.460\nI'm also gonna make sure that it connects\nthat CDROM drive when it boots up so\n\n448\n00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.770\nthat I don't have to worry about that.\n\n449\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.200\nI'll click OK, and\nI'll give this VM some power.\n\n450\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.990\n&gt;&gt; And there we go.\n\n451\n00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.874\nTada, tada, it hits the ISO,\nI'll say I wanna go ahead and run it live.\n\n452\n00:22:29.874 --> 00:22:34.244\nLet me give it focus, and\nit begins the boot process, right?\n\n453\n00:22:34.244 --> 00:22:34.919\n&gt;&gt; Marvelous.\n\n454\n00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:38.045\n&gt;&gt; Now the only thing I won't\nhave any persistence here.\n\n455\n00:22:38.045 --> 00:22:42.475\nI won't be able to install my vm\nwork station tools, for example,\n\n456\n00:22:42.475 --> 00:22:45.345\nto give me that nice big desktop and\nbe able to change my\n\n457\n00:22:45.345 --> 00:22:48.425\nresolution because I'm running it\noff in ISO which is read only.\n\n458\n00:22:48.425 --> 00:22:53.065\nBut that might be all I need just to\nsee if Kali is what I want to use and\n\n459\n00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:55.835\nif this is the distro of Linux for me.\n\n460\n00:22:55.835 --> 00:23:00.476\nSo now you have several different ways\nthat you can end up running Kali if you're\n\n461\n00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:02.424\ntrying it out for the first time.\n\n462\n00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:06.270\nGo out, download that ISO from Kali.org.\n\n463\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.490\nEither mount it up,\n\n464\n00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.470\nmount the ISO itself up in your\nvirtualization software of choice.\n\n465\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.090\nBoot it up or\ncreate a bootable thumb drive, and\n\n466\n00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.710\nnow you can use your physical hardware,\nyou can reboot\n\n467\n00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.920\nto that live USB thumb drive and play with\nKali Linux till your heart's content.\n\n468\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.102\n&gt;&gt; Great job, Mike.\n\n469\n00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:27.352\nIn further episodes I'm sure we'll learn\nhow to do building persistence too, right?\n\n470\n00:23:27.352 --> 00:23:28.633\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n471\n00:23:28.633 --> 00:23:32.323\n&gt;&gt; So Kali bootable USB drive and\nthis is Kali Linux, and\n\n472\n00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:34.880\nthere'll be more in this series.\n\n473\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.410\nWanna make sure you watch every\nsingle video, you'll be glad you did.\n\n474\n00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.060\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.466\nRemember a good IT pro is always learning.\n\n476\n00:23:43.466 -->

00:00:08.114\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:12.380\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.210\nHello, and thanks for watching ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.130\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we are continuing on with Kali Linux.\n\n7\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.840\nAnd this topic today is interesting.\n\n8\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.131\nWe're gonna be booting\nlive with persistence, so\n\n9\n00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.950\nshowing you how to use\npersistence with your Kali Linux.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.600\nAnd who's giving us that information,\n\n11\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.980\nbut Mike Rodrick-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.610\n&gt;&gt; Because he knows much more then I do\n\n13\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.560\nabout the subject.\n\n14\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.950\nMike, nice to have you here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Great to be here, Zach,\nthanks for having me.\n\n16\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.820\nAnd thanks everybody for joining us.\n\n17\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.160\nAnd in this episode,\nZach is exactly right.\n\n18\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.810\nWhat we're gonna try to do is\nadd a little bit of persistence.\n\n19\n00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.650\nSo let's get our back story.\n\n20\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.406\nPrevious episode, we learned how\nto install Kali Linux on USB, so\n\n21\n00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:51.640\nthat we can have our Kali Live, right?\n\n22\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.580\nWe can take that USB thumb drive anywhere\nwe want where we've got access to\n\n23\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.238\nhardware.\n\n24\n00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.390\nAnd assuming the system will boot to USB,\nwe can boot up to that thumb drive, and\n\n25\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.920\nbe running our Kali Linux.\n\n26\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.630\nWith all of our pen testing tools\nright there at our fingertips, right?\n\n27\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.060\nSo it's great, it's portability.\n\n28\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.210\nThe downside was,\nthere was no persistence.\n\n29\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.690\nAnything we did, any configuration changes\nwe made to our Kali Linux install.\n\n30\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.090\nIf we wanted to save log files, or\nresults from tools that we're running,\n\n31\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.440\nand things like that,\nit became a real challenge.\n\n32\n00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.850\nBecause that thumb drive\nwas not persistent, and\n\n33\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390\nas soon as you shut it down,\nall your changes will be gone.\n\n34\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, what do you mean\nby persistent, or persistence?\n\n35\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.020\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n36\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the ability really to\nsave something, make it permanent.\n\n37\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.807\nBecause it's a live distro running off\nthat thumb drive, it's just like running\n\n38\n00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:42.785\nif off of a CD-ROM like we used\nto do back in the day, or a DVD.\n\n39\n00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:44.930\nThere's no write capabilities.\n\n40\n00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.020\nSo any of your configuration changes\nwould just be lost next time you boot.\n\n41\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.590\nIt's booting right back\nto that read-only media.\n\n42\n00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.050\nAnd that was an issue.\n\n43\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.850\nThere were ways we'd go around,\nbringing other external media with us, and\n\n44\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.320\ntrying to map that from our Kali Live,\nand save stuff to there.\n\n45\n00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.803\nBut again, the mapping goes away,\neverything goes away.\n\n46\n00:02:04.803 --> 00:02:06.420\nYou'd have to do it all\nagain the next time.\n\n47\n00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.060\nSo there were ways to save information,\nbut it was a real pain.\n\n48\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.710\nWith persistence,\nwe can basically add another partition\n\n49\n00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.730\nto that Kali Linux thumb\ndrive that we've created.\n\n50\n00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.600\nAnd configure Kali to save things\nto that extra partition, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.850\nAnd that way we've got persistence.\n\n52\n00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.820\nSo when we boot that Kali Live back up,\nall our configuration changes are still\n\n53\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.660\nthere, files that we've created,\nthings like that, would still be there.\n\n54\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.800\nAnd that's really what we\nmean by that persistence.\n\n55\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.939\n&gt;&gt; Are there any other advantages\nto having persistence?\n\n56\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are gonna take a look,\nin another episode,\n\n57\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.080\nabout how we might try to\nencrypt that persistence.\n\n58\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.900\nBecause as a pen tester,\nas a security professional,\n\n59\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.500\na lot of times that information\nthat you're storing,\n\n60\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.310\nthose reports, scans you've run,\nthings like that.\n\n61\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.060\nYou might have non-disclosure agreements,\nor just, in general,\n\n62\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.620\nsensitive information that\nneeds to be protected.\n\n63\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.350\nAnd the downside of a thumb drive is,\nthey are easy to lose, right?\n\n64\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.797\nYou leave them laying somewhere,\nsomebody picks it up.\n\n65\n00:03:04.797 --> 00:03:06.582\nSo we'll talk more about\nthat in the future.\n\n66\n00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:08.382\nBut other than that, no.\n\n67\n00:03:08.382 --> 00:03:13.307\nReally, the persistence is all about\nbeing able to save changes when running\n\n68\n00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:15.590\nKali Linux off of that thumb drive.\n\n69\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.690\n&gt;&gt; Let's get right into it.\n\n70\n00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:17.800\nShow us how to do this.\n\n71\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.940\nHow do you install it?\n\n72\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.779\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n73\n00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.250\nAnd we'll start from where we left\noff in our previous episodes.\n\n74\n00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.530\nSo if you haven't, go back,\nwatch the other episodes.\n\n75\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.610\nMake yourself a Kali Linux USB thumb drive\nthat you can boot into that live mode.\n\n76\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.758\nOnce we've got that set up,\nthen we just go back in, and\n\n77\n00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:39.450\nwe make some configuration changes to that\nKali Linux install on that thumb drive.\n\n78\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.840\nSo let's see how to do it.\n\n79\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.600\nBasically, I got everything ready to go.\n\n80\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.230\nRight now, I've got my Windows 10 machine.\n\n81\n00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.150\nAnd I've plugged in my thumb drive.\n\n82\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.070\nAnd I've rebooted my system.\n\n83\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.660\nAnd I've chose to boot to the thumb drive.\n\n84\n00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.050\nSo this is my Kali Linux.\n\n85\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.620\nThe thumb drive we made in\nthe previous episode, right?\n\n86\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.148\nWe can kind of run Kali Linux Live.\n\n87\n00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:00.387\nAnd the choice is there.\n\n88\n00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:03.220\nI'm just gonna choose that first one,\nlive system.\n\n89\n00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.830\nI'll go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n90\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.770\nIf all goes well, we should boot\nup into our Kali Linux desktop.\n\n91\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.050\nAnd I apologize about the resolutions.\n\n92\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.705\nIt's not filling the screen up nicely, but\n\n93\n00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.800\nthat's because I can't save my changes,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.328\nIt's running off of that live ISO,\nso it's just using all the defaults.\n\n95\n00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:25.060\nThere's no VMWare, or workstation tools in\nmy case, or anything like that installed.\n\n96\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.150\nAnd there's nothing I can do about it,\nbecause there is no persistence.\n\n97\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.095\nI could make the changes, but\nit'd be right back to the way it was.\n\n98\n00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:33.927\nThe next time I rebooted, it would\nbe right back to the way it was, so\n\n99\n00:04:33.927 --> 00:04:35.310\nI'd have to start all over.\n\n100\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.140\nAnd I'd have to do that every time.\n\n101\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.765\nThat's why we like that persistence.\n\n102\n00:04:39.765 --> 00:04:42.260\nAll right, so we'll give this\na second to finish booting up.\n\n103\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.240\nI promise that black screen\nis what we should be seeing.\n\n104\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.290\nNot the most exciting but, there it goes.\n\n105\n00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.280\nAll right, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; Wait, that's exciting.\n\n106\n00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.840\nI like that.\n\n107\n00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, good.\n\n108\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.860\nThat's a little more exciting, right?\n\n109\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.400\nAgain, resolution's not the best.\n\n110\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.460\nBut this is my Kali Linux Live,\nrunning off of that thumb drive.\n\n111\n00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.520\nSo what we're going to do, to get this\nstarted, is I'm actually gonna fire up,\n\n112\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.880\nI'm gonna use the graphical\nuser interface for this one.\n\n113\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.790\nYou could do this from\nthe command line as well.\n\n114\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.540\nBut I think it makes it\na little bit easier,\n\n115\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.620\nthe first time you through it,\nto use the GUI.\n\n116\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.460\nSo that you can kinda see and\nmake sense of what your choices are.\n\n117\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.508\nSo I'm gonna launch parted,\nwith the g out in front of it,\n\n118\n00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.772\nto give me that graphical user interface.\n\n119\n00:05:21.772 --> 00:05:27.480\nSo gparted, and\nI should get a nice GUI for my parted.\n\n120\n00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.750\nAnd remember,\nparted is the way we can go and\n\n121\n00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.201\nwork with our partitions in\nour Linux system, all right?\n\n122\n00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.120\nAnd what we see,\nis kind of what I expected.\n\n123\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.650\nHopefully you guys can\nread this out there.\n\n124\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.541\nI've got an NTFS 500\nmegabyte partition on sda1.\n\n125\n00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:48.442\nOn sda2, so\nthe second partition on that first drive,\n\n126\n00:05:48.442 --> 00:05:52.180\nis my 80 gigabyte drive with 10 gigs used.\n\n127\n00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.570\nThat's my Windows install, right?\n\n128\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.960\nRemember, we are booting\nto a live thumb drive.\n\n129\n00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.720\nSo it's seeing the underlying hardware,\nincluding that hard drive inside there.\n\n130\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.630\nAnd then I have my unallocated space.\n\n131\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.560\nSo this is not where I\nwanna make any changes.\n\n132\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.420\nThis is my Windows system, right?\n\n133\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.080\nSo we're gonna go up to this\ndrop-down list, and choose sdb.\n\n134\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.956\nsdb, the second drive in the system,\nthis is my thumb drive.\n\n135\n00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:19.070\nAnd you're gonna look for\n\n136\n00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.960\nthings like hey, I know the size of\nmy thumb drive is a 64 gigabyte.\n\n137\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.010\nI can see 58.89, so minus overhead,\nthat's most likely the right drive.\n\n138\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.470\nI can see here that I've\ngot a couple partitions.\n\n139\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.800\nIt's labeled as Kali Live\non that first partition.\n\n140\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.090\nA little, tiny hidden boot partition.\n\n141\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.260\nThen I've got a FAT16 media route,\nKali Live.\n\n142\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.860\nSo that's what we're\nrunning from right now.\n\n143\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.660\nAnd then there's all of this unallocated\nspace, right, that Linux, or\n\n144\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.150\nthe Kali partition,\ndidn't take up that much space.\n\n145\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.682\nLet's see what the total size of that was.\n\n146\n00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:59.732\nIt's a little bigger than that, but\nthat's just showing me what's used there.\n\n147\n00:06:59.732 --> 00:07:02.444\n2.6 gigs, so right around 3,\na little over 3.\n\n148\n00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:05.582\nWhat I think Offensive Security and\nKali.org will tell you,\n\n149\n00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:07.948\nis about 4 gigs for\nthe install of Kali Linux.\n\n150\n00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:12.650\nOr for that ISO, 3.7\n&gt;&gt; And then you were saying that you\n\n151\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.770\nrecommend for your thumb drive,\nmaybe 8 gigs, if you're using Kali?\n\n152\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.761\n&gt;&gt; Yep, at least 8.\n\n153\n00:07:17.761 --> 00:07:21.604\nBecause if you only had 4,\nyour Kali install, that ISO-\n\n154\n00:07:21.604 --> 00:07:22.780\n&gt;&gt; Would take up everything.\n\n155\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you'd have no space\nleft to create an additional partition.\n\n156\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.340\nNow, the 64 gigs, it might be overkill.\n\n157\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.180\nBut hey, it's what I had laying around.\n\n158\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.475\nI can create a really\nbig partition if I want.\n\n159\n00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:34.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You could actually create multiple\n\n160\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.640\npersistent partitions.\n\n161\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.893\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, you're probably\ngonna have different versions, or\n\n162\n00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.292\nmultiple versions, of Kali on there too.\n\n163\n00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.066\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n164\n00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:44.490\nwell we're going to talk later about how\nto encrypt this persistent partition.\n\n165\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.990\nI might have one persistent\npartition that's not encrypted, and\n\n166\n00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.310\nanother one that is encrypted, right?\n\n167\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.502\nSo you can create multiple\nsystem partitions.\n\n168\n00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:55.231\nYou could even choose which one\ngets mounted up automatically,\n\n169\n00:07:55.231 --> 00:07:56.656\nevery time you boot up into Kali.\n\n170\n00:07:56.656 --> 00:07:58.146\nBut that's another episode.\n\n171\n00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:00.418\nFor now, We'll just stick with this.\n\n172\n00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:02.706\nI'm gonna right click on\nthis unallocated space.\n\n173\n00:08:02.706 --> 00:08:06.758\nAnd again there's different ways you can\ndo it from the menu, I'm a right clicker,\n\n174\n00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:08.888\nI come from a Windows world.\n\n175\n00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:15.920\nAnd I'm gonna do New, and I'm going to\nmake this guy about 20 gigs in size.\n\n176\n00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.059\nSo for the new size I'll put 2480.\n\n177\n00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:22.356\nEverything else I'll pretty much leave\nalone as far as the creating a primary\n\n178\n00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:23.420\npartition.\n\n179\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.650\nMy file system is goinna be ext4,\nthe label, I'm going to put persistence.\n\n180\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.549\nAnd I've gotta spell that right.\n\n181\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.329\nNow I will tell you that some blogs you\nread say that is extremely important,\n\n182\n00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:38.566\nthat the label has to be persistence.\n\n183\n00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:42.890\nI haven't experimented with it to see\nif I could call it anything else.\n\n184\n00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.209\nSo I'm just gonna stick\nwith what I know works.\n\n185\n00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:50.370\nYou might try something else if you want,\nbut again that's just the label.\n\n186\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.040\nPersistence all lowercase.\n\n187\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.304\n&gt;&gt; Could you call it fuzzy ears?\n\n188\n00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:55.168\n&gt;&gt; We might,\nwe might try that in another episode.\n\n189\n00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:56.056\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:08:56.056 --> 00:08:56.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n191\n00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:58.799\n&gt;&gt; All right, so give it your size,\n\n192\n00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.289\ngive it your file system,\n\n193\n00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:03.968\ngive it your label,\nwhich is gonna be persistence, click Add.\n\n194\n00:09:03.968 --> 00:09:08.460\nNow that doesn't actually make the changes\nwith that just shows me what I've done.\n\n195\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.592\nCuz I could go back and create\nadditional partitions if I needed to.\n\n196\n00:09:12.592 --> 00:09:17.120\nEverything looks good,\nanother cool I'll show you as we go here.\n\n197\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.213\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\ncommit those changes.\n\n198\n00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:22.670\nSo, Apply All Operations.\n\n199\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.250\nNow we'll click it.\n\n200\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.760\nIt says are you sure, you could end\nup hosing up your thumb drive there.\n\n201\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.990\nWe'll say Apply.\n\n202\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.210\nAnd, what's really cool is it shows you\nthe MKFS for your make file system.\n\n203\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.680\nI don't know if you saw that there.\n\n204\n00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.318\nYou can see the command that it ran.\n\n205\n00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:42.752\nSo you can see some of that information,\nlet's see.\n\n206\n00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:44.890\nSet it part to four.\n\n207\n00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.080\nThere's the actual command there\nthat set the file system to EXT4 and\n\n208\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.860\nadded the label.\n\n209\n00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.410\nSo that's why I say it's kind of\nfun to start out in the GUI and\n\n210\n00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.460\nthen you can move on to the command\nline once you learn your commands, but\n\n211\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.071\nthis is how you learn those commands.\n\n212\n00:09:57.071 --> 00:10:00.326\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and\nclose that one.\n\n213\n00:10:00.326 --> 00:10:03.570\nWe should be good to go\nas it refreshes the view.\n\n214\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.663\nI see that I have a third partition as DB,\nB being my second drive,\n\n215\n00:10:08.663 --> 00:10:12.107\n3 being the third partition on that drive.\n\n216\n00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:13.806\nAnd its label is persistence.\n\n217\n00:10:13.806 --> 00:10:15.725\nIt's about 20 gigs in size.\n\n218\n00:10:15.725 --> 00:10:19.536\nSo we should be good to go there,\nall right?\n\n219\n00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.540\nSo we'll close out of that.\n\n220\n00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.720\nSo now we've got this partition, and\nlet me clear up my screen a little bit.\n\n221\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.993\nWe've got this partition sitting there,\nbut Kali doesn't really, I don't want\n\n222\n00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:34.220\nto say doesn't know about it, but it's not\ngonna be there if I reboot the system.\n\n223\n00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.440\nIt's not gonna be persistent, right?\n\n224\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.562\nSo what I need to do is\nadd that persistence, and\n\n225\n00:10:38.562 --> 00:10:39.897\nthat's what we'll do next.\n\n226\n00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:41.083\nHopefully you guys can see this.\n\n227\n00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:45.933\nI'm gonna do a make directory or mkdir and\n\n228\n00:10:45.933 --> 00:10:50.645\na -p, and then switch mount, switch,\n\n229\n00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:57.470\nI'm just gonna call it my_usb and\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n230\n00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.749\nAll right, so\nthat's making that directory over there.\n\n231\n00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:04.874\nIn fact, if we wanted to do\na ls switch mnt minus usb,\n\n232\n00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:12.750\nwell I guess there's nothing in it, so\nit didn't really good to list it out.\n\n233\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.441\nBut that created that directory there,\nmy_usb.\n\n234\n00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:20.757\nAll right, I guess if we did a CD switch\nmount, we could see that in there.\n\n235\n00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:27.370\nNow there is my USB directory, all right.\n\n236\n00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:32.060\nI don't have all the my normal\naliases in this virtual machine,\n\n237\n00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.180\nso you'll see me typing some weird\nthings and it's not working,\n\n238\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.192\nthat's cuz I'm used to my aliases.\n\n239\n00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:39.620\nAll right, so\nnow we've got that directory created,\n\n240\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.560\nwe're gonna mount that\nup with a mount command.\n\n241\n00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.291\nSo we're gonna do a mount\n\n242\n00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:52.699\nswitch dev switch SDB-3,\n\n243\n00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:56.320\nswitch MNT MY usb.\n\n244\n00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.314\nSo we're taking that partition\nthat we just created, SDB-3, and\n\n245\n00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:02.830\nwe're giving it a mount point.\n\n246\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.292\nWe're calling that MY-USB\ndirectory that we just created,\n\n247\n00:12:07.292 --> 00:12:10.635\nright, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit Enter,\n\n248\n00:12:10.635 --> 00:12:14.688\nand no errors,\nwe should be good to go, there, right?\n\n249\n00:12:14.688 --> 00:12:17.988\nNow, I'm gonna do an echo.\n\n250\n00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:23.127\nWe're gonna echo out, and this is\nwhere the syntax is really important.\n\n251\n00:12:23.127 --> 00:12:26.610\nAnd you go out there and you start\nlooking at some of these blogs and\n\n252\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.903\nthese forums, and\npeople give you directions and they don't\n\n253\n00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:33.850\nput the code up there quite right and\nyou can easily miss some of this here.\n\n254\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.146\nThis is a quote, /,\n\n255\n00:12:37.146 --> 00:12:41.552\nspace, union, end quote.\n\n256\n00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:47.050\nWhen you're looking at posts of code,\nsometimes the spaces aren't so obvious.\n\n257\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.529\nSo it's important that there's a space\nin between that forward slash and\n\n258\n00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:53.540\nthat word union.\n\n259\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.175\nAll right, end my quote and\nthen a little greater than sign,\n\n260\n00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:04.810\nand then we're gonna pump that out to MNT,\nswitch My_usb,\n\n261\n00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.360\nswitch persistence.comf [SP], all right.\n\n262\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.294\nSo we're creating\na persistence.configuration\n\n263\n00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:18.980\nfile in that My_usb directory, all right?\n\n264\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.390\nAnd it's basically gonna be / space union,\n\n265\n00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.550\nis what's gonna be in\nthat configuration file.\n\n266\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.320\nRight, make sure I spelled that right.\n\n267\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.976\nPersistence.conf, we should be good to go,\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n268\n00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.576\nAnd again, everything is good.\n\n269\n00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:34.280\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n270\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.142\nSo that's really all we did, was create\na file in that mounted partition,\n\n271\n00:13:40.142 --> 00:13:43.410\ncalled persistence.conf, all right?\n\n272\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.308\nAnd in that file, / space union\nis what's going to be in there.\n\n273\n00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:52.050\nAll right, now we're gonna unmount\nwith a little umount command.\n\n274\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:58.840\nSwitch dev, switch sdb3,\nunmount that guy, and that's it.\n\n275\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.825\nWe should be good to go, now we're gonna\nreboot, and we're gonna see what happens,\n\n276\n00:14:03.825 --> 00:14:04.529\nall right?\n\n277\n00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:11.683\nSo let me give this guy a quick reboot And\n\n278\n00:14:11.683 --> 00:14:16.288\nsometimes it'll take more than one\nreboot to get this to kick in.\n\n279\n00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:18.830\nSometimes you gotta go and\nmake changes to that file, so\n\n280\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.380\nI'll show you what we mean here.\n\n281\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.677\n&gt;&gt; So at this point Mike,\nit's not on the thumb drive yet?\n\n282\n00:14:24.677 --> 00:14:27.149\n&gt;&gt; Well, it is, it is on there.\n\n283\n00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:27.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.990\n&gt;&gt; But what we wanna see is,\ndo we have persistence?\n\n285\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.030\nIn other words, can we make a change,\nreboot the system again, and\n\n286\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.340\nhave that change still be there?\n\n287\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.767\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's the trick.\n\n288\n00:14:37.767 --> 00:14:40.902\nSo here I'm booting to\nnot just live system,\n\n289\n00:14:40.902 --> 00:14:43.990\nlive system persistence, all right?\n\n290\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.270\nYou can actually modify those entries,\nbut we'll save that for another day.\n\n291\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:51.583\nSo live system persistence and\nI'm gonna hit enter.\n\n292\n00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:56.114\nAnd we'll let this guy boot up and\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n293\n00:14:56.114 --> 00:14:57.380\n&gt;&gt; It's a good thing we don't have\nto read all of that right now.\n\n294\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:03.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It does flash a lot of stuff by there.\n\n295\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.930\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n296\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.831\n&gt;&gt; It's nice cuz, in a Windows world,\nwe don't see all of that.\n\n297\n00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:09.743\nThey like to hide that from us.\n\n298\n00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.520\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n299\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI see a bunch of green there.\n\n300\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.056\nWe are good to go, booting up.\n\n301\n00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:17.375\nWaiting waiting waiting.\n\n302\n00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:26.221\nIt will take a minute to reboot here,\nand we'll see what we get.\n\n303\n00:15:26.221 --> 00:15:31.514\nHopefully we'll be able to make changes,\nand then reboot again,\n\n304\n00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:38.010\nand have those changes remain and\nbe persistent through that reboot.\n\n305\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n306\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.360\n&gt;&gt; As it stares at me, there we go.\n\n307\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.840\n&gt;&gt; My favorite screen.\n\n308\n00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.810\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n309\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:51.416\nAll right now, here's a word of caution or\nan FYI I guess.\n\n310\n00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:55.239\nIf you come to this, you can see this\nKali live partition sitting here.\n\n311\n00:15:55.239 --> 00:16:00.065\nIf you come here and there's another\ndrive and it's caller persistence,\n\n312\n00:16:00.065 --> 00:16:04.630\nthat's telling us that that\nunion statement didn't work.\n\n313\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.380\nAnd what you should be able to do\nis double-click on that drive.\n\n314\n00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.300\nIn that drive should be that\npersistence.conf file that you created.\n\n315\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:19.130\nOpen that file up, edit it, and what'll\nhappen sometimes is the quotes stay.\n\n316\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.320\nAnd so when it echoed it out,\n\n317\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.580\nit actually echoed it as quote\nforward slash space union end quote.\n\n318\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.610\nSo just if you see that,\nit probably didn't read it correctly and\n\n319\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.270\ndidn't do the union.\n\n320\n00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.870\nAnd it's just showing\nyou that drive there.\n\n321\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.260\nGo in there,\nedit the persistence.conf file.\n\n322\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.480\nJust take out the quotes so\nthat it's just forward slash space,\n\n323\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.740\nunion, save it, reboot,\nlive with persistence.\n\n324\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.260\nAnd you should work.\n\n325\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.900\nAll right, so\nnow we need to prove to ourselves that we\n\n326\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.870\ntruly do have persistence.\n\n327\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.640\nSo let's do this.\n\n328\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.080\nActually, you know what I'll do?\n\n329\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.300\nI'll just do it right here on the desktop.\n\n330\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.940\nWe'll just create a new folder and\nwe'll call it\n\n331\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.460\npersistence test because I'm so creative.\n\n332\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Or fuzzy ears.\n\n333\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or fuzzy ears.\n\n334\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.522\nTell you what, we'll make a,\nlet's do this.\n\n335\n00:17:10.522 --> 00:17:13.925\nWe'll say and\n\n336\n00:17:13.925 --> 00:17:18.231\nI'll say fuzzy ears.txt.\n\n337\n00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:21.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good for you.\n\n338\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.070\n&gt;&gt; And then, we'll do an LS,\nand there's our file in there.\n\n339\n00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.030\nAnd we should be good to go.\n\n340\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.875\nOkay, so now we got a file.\n\n341\n00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:30.760\nWe've got a folder out\nhere on our desktop.\n\n342\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.060\nWe need to see if it survives.\n\n343\n00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.670\nLet's see if this persistence\nis actually working.\n\n344\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n345\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.610\n&gt;&gt; That means, we gotta reboot.\n\n346\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.100\nSo I'll be a little patient here.\n\n347\n00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:39.770\nWe'll restart.\n\n348\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.970\nAnd we'll-\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n349\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:42.870\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n350\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.800\nI would say look through\nthe magic of TV timeout,\n\n351\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.660\nlet's do this but\nmany might not believe me, right?\n\n352\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.320\nYou might think yeah, they did a time\nout and they just rolled back to when\n\n353\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.190\nthe folder was already there\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n354\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.430\nSo I want you guys to see.\n\n355\n00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:55.720\n&gt;&gt; This is happening live.\n\n356\n00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.380\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n357\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.440\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So either I failed miserably live\n\n358\n00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.740\nin camera or\nwe have some persistence here.\n\n359\n00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.890\nSo I'm gonna go down to live system\npersistence and we shall boot.\n\n360\n00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.820\nThen do our desktop.\n\n361\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.780\n&gt;&gt; There we go, all those words.\n\n362\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.840\n&gt;&gt; And yep, now we need that drumroll.\n\n363\n00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.740\nAnd we shall see.\n\n364\n00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.530\nI should have that folder on my desktop.\n\n365\n00:18:19.425 --> 00:18:21.161\nBasically all it's doing is again,\n\n366\n00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:25.375\nit's is using that mount point to save\nany configuration changes that you make.\n\n367\n00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.785\nThat's what that union is doing.\n\n368\n00:18:27.785 --> 00:18:33.365\nIt means it's kinda redirecting\noutput to that partition.\n\n369\n00:18:33.365 --> 00:18:37.619\nSo at this point if all goes well, we're\ngonna have Kali Linux on a thumb drive and\n\n370\n00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:40.275\nthe persistence available as well, right?\n\n371\n00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:40.835\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly right.\n\n372\n00:18:40.835 --> 00:18:41.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.\n\n373\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.090\n&gt;&gt; So we get to our desktop and\nwe´ll see what happens.\n\n374\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.327\nIt´s coming up in three, two, one.\n\n375\n00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:51.130\nI was a little off on my count,\nbut look at there.\n\n376\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.325\nThere is my folder inside of there.\n\n377\n00:18:54.325 --> 00:18:57.350\n&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]\n&gt;&gt; It is my file that I created.\n\n378\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.100\nAnd notice I didn´t do anything different.\n\n379\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.710\nWhen I created the folder, I didn't\nnavigate to that persistent partition,\n\n380\n00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.990\nhave to create it in any certain way.\n\n381\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.390\nIt's smart enough to know,\nbecause the way it works with that union,\n\n382\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.530\nit's doing some magic in there.\n\n383\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.410\nWe're not going to get into the technical\ndetails of what it's doing back there.\n\n384\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.370\nBut it's saying, any changes,\nany writes that need to be made,\n\n385\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.060\nbecause you're basically booting\nto an ISO, which is read-only.\n\n386\n00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.600\nYou can't make changes to that ISO.\n\n387\n00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.600\nBut I'm saying any changes that are being\nmade, store them over here in this mounted\n\n388\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.182\npartition, and then read from that when\nyou boot up to that live persistence.\n\n389\n00:19:33.182 --> 00:19:36.150\nThat's what that configuration\nfile is actually doing.\n\n390\n00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.690\nSo I don't have to do anything special,\n\n391\n00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:41.530\nanything out of the ordinary\nto save log files.\n\n392\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.040\nIf I go and I run end map, and\n\n393\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.740\nI create a folder in my directory for the\ndifferent machines that I'm scanning, and\n\n394\n00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.340\nI save those reports to a file\nin those folders, that's it.\n\n395\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.570\nI mean they will be there the next time\nI boot up, so love this persistence.\n\n396\n00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.690\nAs you saw, it really wasn't\ntoo terrible to get set up.\n\n397\n00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.860\nI know sometimes these,\nwell we'll leave that alone,\n\n398\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.920\nwe'll just say it wasn't that right.\n\n399\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.860\nWe had to create the partition,\n\n400\n00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.710\nwe had to create a configuration\nfile in that partition.\n\n401\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.840\nAnd really the main thing was to\nunderstand how to create that config file,\n\n402\n00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.160\nright, what to put in that config file.\n\n403\n00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.740\nAnd all that was was a forward slash,\nif I can speak.\n\n404\n00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.160\nForward slash space union.\n\n405\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.020\nWe reboot and we're golden.\n\n406\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.920\nNow we have a Kali Linux install that we\ncan carry with us wherever we want, and\n\n407\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.700\nwe have persistence.\n\n408\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.150\nWe can save the output of our\ndifferent reports and our tools and\n\n409\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.570\nanything else we need to have with us\nwhen we Take our thumb drive on the go.\n\n410\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.710\n&gt;&gt; So you don't have to worry about saving\nfiles cuz you got the persistence right\n\n411\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.929\nthere, built into the thumb drive now\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely\n\n412\n00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:43.365\n&gt;&gt; Well, life of persistence,\n\n413\n00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:47.760\nKali Linux, and there's a lot of\nvideos in the series of Kali Linux.\n\n414\n00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.240\nSo, you wanna check them all out\nbecause you'll be glad you did.\n\n415\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.920\nAny last words Mike, or we're good?\n\n416\n00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know what Zach?\n\n417\n00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.560\nLet's see, we've got,\n\n418\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.690\nwe've proven that the files\nare going to be persistent, right?\n\n419\n00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.070\nThat folder and\nthat file we created is still there.\n\n420\n00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.310\nLet's do a configuration change and\ntest out how that works.\n\n421\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.440\nSo we take a look at my screen again.\n\n422\n00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.940\nThe resolution is not that hot, so\nI'm going to pull up my settings.\n\n423\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.070\nAnd go into my displays.\n\n424\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.350\nAnd let's change this up.\n\n425\n00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.910\nNow this might not be something you do\nin the real world cause you're gonna\n\n426\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.870\nbe taking this thumb drive to different\nscreens, different resolutions,\n\n427\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.950\nbut it's more just to prove that\nthe persistence applies not only\n\n428\n00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.692\nto files we create, but configurations\nchanges that make to Kali itself.\n\n429\n00:21:30.692 --> 00:21:34.845\nAll right, so\nlet's change that to something,\n\n430\n00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:39.840\n16x10 and we'll apply that,\nwe'll keep those changes.\n\n431\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:45.780\nWe'll close that down and\nnow we'll reboot the system.\n\n432\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.670\nHit restart, and then again we'll wait.\n\n433\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.920\nAnd we'll see what happens\nwhen this guy reboots.\n\n434\n00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.680\nAnd so hopefully, Zach,\nwe'll see that there's a folder there\n\n435\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.960\nas well as my resolution should be\nset to some type of 16x10 resolution.\n\n436\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.550\nSorry about the whole boot to a CD,\nI've still got the Windows disk in there.\n\n437\n00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.980\nSo I'm gonna choose my\nlive system persistance.\n\n438\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.550\nRemember, if I chose live system,\nit's not going to load that config file,\n\n439\n00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.670\nand I wouldn't see my persistent info.\n\n440\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.390\nMaybe I need to boot, and\nI don't want that at some point.\n\n441\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.880\nBut if you want persistence,\nmake sure you go down and choose that.\n\n442\n00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.440\nThat's what's going to tell it,\nhey, read that configuration file.\n\n443\n00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.450\nGrab that mount point,\nmake that available.\n\n444\n00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.290\n&gt;&gt; So you have to choose that.\n\n445\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.660\nThat's not an automatic feature.\n\n446\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.190\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n447\n00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.410\nEvery time you boot, because like I said,\nthere might be times when you wanna boot,\n\n448\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.890\nand you don't want access to that info.\n\n449\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.760\nAnd so you could just use live system.\n\n450\n00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.260\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n451\n00:22:39.265 --> 00:22:41.125\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nit's looking for my floppy.\n\n452\n00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:44.420\nDidn't find one, how about that?\n\n453\n00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.645\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I got a floppy at home.\n\n454\n00:22:46.645 --> 00:22:47.445\nIt's an old one.\n\n455\n00:22:47.445 --> 00:22:49.145\n&gt;&gt; It's an old one.\n\n456\n00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:50.695\nGood to have still now and again.\n\n457\n00:22:50.695 --> 00:22:53.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so here we go.\n\n458\n00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:55.985\nGetting ready to boot\nup to our desktop and\n\n459\n00:22:55.985 --> 00:22:57.819\nI already like it cuz\nI see my scroll bars.\n\n460\n00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.490\nIt's a good sign that we are 16x10, and\n\n461\n00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.840\nnot that little 4x3 shrunk\nin the middle thing.\n\n462\n00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.906\nAnd there we go.\nWe see that my desktop is indeed still\n\n463\n00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:11.360\na 16x10 ratio.\n\n464\n00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.080\nSo not only are our files, our reports and\n\n465\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.640\nthings like that that we create\ngonna be there when we reboot but\n\n466\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.630\nconfiguration changes, that we make\nto the system are gonna be there.\n\n467\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.540\nSo, here we're talking you know,\nI used display resolution,\n\n468\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.910\nbut we could be talking network settings,\n\n469\n00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.865\nanything else that I do to the system\nis going to prove to be persistent.\n\n470\n00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:33.237\nSo now, you've got that Kali Linux\nthumb drive that you can take with you.\n\n471\n00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:36.435\nYou get the advantages of having,\nyou know, a live distro.\n\n472\n00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:38.305\nBeing about to carry it around with you,\n\n473\n00:23:38.305 --> 00:23:42.542\nboot to it any time you can get\nto a machine that boots to USB.\n\n474\n00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:47.372\nAnd we get persistence because now we can\nsave files and configuration changes, so\n\n475\n00:23:47.372 --> 00:23:49.152\nthe best of both worlds.\n\n476\n00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:50.137\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, Mike.\n\n477\n00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:54.092\nLive persistence, Kali Linux and\nnow the next episode,\n\n478\n00:23:54.092 --> 00:23:55.742\nwe're gonna be looking at encryption,\nright?\n\n479\n00:23:55.742 --> 00:23:58.192\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like you said I think\ntowards the beginning of this episode,\n\n480\n00:23:58.192 --> 00:24:01.952\nthere might be times when that data we're\nstoring on that persistent partition,\n\n481\n00:24:01.952 --> 00:24:04.270\nespecially as a penetration tester.\n\n482\n00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.070\nAnd you're gathering information\nabout a company's systems\n\n483\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.850\nyou got a non-disclosure agreement with\nthem, that information can't get out.\n\n484\n00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.280\nIf you lose that thumb drive, cuz you've\nadded persistence and you save some of\n\n485\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.350\nthat info and now you lose the thumb\ndrive, that information gets out.\n\n486\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.020\nThey can come back to you so\nyou wanna you protect that information,\n\n487\n00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.430\nand that would mean encrypting it.\n\n488\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.670\nSo, that's what we'll try next.\n\n489\n00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Mike.\n\n490\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.370\nThat was fantastic, and there is\nmore in the Kali Linux video series.\n\n491\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.680\nMake sure you watch all the videos.\n\n492\n00:24:29.680 -->

00:00:08.330\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.175\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:12.829\n&gt;&gt; Hello and\n\n6\n00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.910\nthank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.780\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Kali Linux.\n\n8\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.696\nAnd this topic today is really cool\nbecause we've learned about Persistence\n\n9\n00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:34.355\nand how to add Persistence, but this topic\nshows how we can encrypt with Persistence.\n\n10\n00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.765\nAnd bringing us all that information,\nMike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.085\nBecause he's the man!\n\n12\n00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.165\nHe is the man!\n\n13\n00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:39.885\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see.\n\n14\n00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:41.545\nThat remains to be seen, right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:42.315\nAll right, so yes.\n\n16\n00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.025\nWe're taking it a step further.\n\n17\n00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.357\nWe've seen how to create\na live thumb drive so\n\n18\n00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:50.610\nwe can boot Kali Linux\nfrom our thumb drive.\n\n19\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.827\nThen in a previous episode we\nadded Persistence to that so\n\n20\n00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:57.513\nthat we could save configuration changes,\n[COUGH] tool outputs,\n\n21\n00:00:57.513 --> 00:01:01.880\nreports, things like that to a persistent\npartition on our thumb drive.\n\n22\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.130\nFantastic.\n\n23\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.898\nNext thing we wanna try to do is encrypt\nthat partition because then when you're\n\n24\n00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:10.442\na penetration tester or security\nprofessional, some of that information\n\n25\n00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:14.490\nthat you're saving onto your new\npersistent partition could be sensitive.\n\n26\n00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.222\nCompany proprietary information that\nyou're capturing to prove you were there,\n\n27\n00:01:19.222 --> 00:01:22.340\nreports about services and\nsystems on their network.\n\n28\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.648\nAnd if, thumb drives are easy to lose,\neasy for people to steal.\n\n29\n00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:29.552\nI've got non-disclosure statements signed\nwith these organizations I cannot let that\n\n30\n00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:30.550\ninformation get out.\n\n31\n00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.920\nSo I wanna make sure that that Information\nis encrypted on that thumb drive.\n\n32\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.780\nSo if somebody steals my thumb drive,\nor I lose that thumb drive,\n\n33\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.230\nthey're not gonna be able\nto access that information.\n\n34\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.570\nSo that's what we're gonna do here.\n\n35\n00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.790\n&gt;&gt; So encryption is all about security.\n\n36\n00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.340\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n37\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.960\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, we'll start\nby making us a new thumb drive.\n\n39\n00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.790\nLet me zoom in there a little bit.\n\n40\n00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.090\nAnd we're gonna just use our dd command.\n\n41\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.133\nRemember in our previous episode\nwhen we created our thumb drive,\n\n42\n00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.143\nactually I think we did\nit through Windows,\n\n43\n00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:00.820\nso now you'll get to see how to\ndo that from a Linux distro.\n\n44\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.600\nSo we're gonna use dd.\n\n45\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.570\nAnd I'll tell you what,\nbefore I do that's, let's do this.\n\n46\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.320\nLet's do parted.\n\n47\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.220\nAnd let's do print devices, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.960\nJust to verify the path to my thumb drive.\n\n49\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.600\nI can see it's sdb.\n\n50\n00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.860\nIt's 63 gigabytes.\n\n51\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.290\nI could select that and\nthen do another print and\n\n52\n00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.901\njust verify it that it was\nthe right thumb drive, or\n\n53\n00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:27.000\nif I have more than one removable device\nin here, make sure I have the right one.\n\n54\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.780\nBut I'm good to go, I know what it is,\nso we can quit out of there.\n\n55\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.910\nAnd we're just gonna do dd,\nactually you know what?\n\n56\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.644\nLet me change over to my ISO's folder,\nbecause in here I should have my Linux and\n\n57\n00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:43.710\nthat way you don't have to\ntype out that whole path.\n\n58\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.861\nAll right, so there I've got my Linux ISO,\nnow we'll do our dd command,\n\n59\n00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.550\ninput file is gonna\nequal my Kali Linux ISO.\n\n60\n00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.282\nAnd then my output file is gonna equal my\nthumb drive which in this case is dev/sdb,\n\n61\n00:03:01.282 --> 00:03:05.820\nand I'm gonna set the block\nsize to 1 megabyte.\n\n62\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.570\nAnd we'll run that command.\n\n63\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.041\nSo basically again we're creating\na Kali live on a thumb drive, and\n\n64\n00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.480\nthen we'll use magic of TV time out.\n\n65\n00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.070\nWe come back,\nthis command should have completed.\n\n66\n00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.270\nAll right, there we go, dd completed.\n\n67\n00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.630\nIt actually didn't take that long, and so\n\n68\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.115\nnow we've got our USB thumb drive\nwith Kali Live running on it.\n\n69\n00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.680\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ncreate our partition.\n\n70\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.240\nJust like we did before,\nwe set up Persistence.\n\n71\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.060\nWe need to create a partition,\ncreate that persistence.com file.\n\n72\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.086\nThis time we're just gonna add a couple\nmore steps to encrypt that partition,\n\n73\n00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:40.710\nall right?\n\n74\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.700\nSo, we're gonna type in parted.\n\n75\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.500\nAnd I'll do my print devices again,\njust to verify.\n\n76\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.870\nIt's always good to be safe when\nyou're working with the parted or dd.\n\n77\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.530\nAnd I can see, there's my thumb drive,\nthat's that 63.2 gigs.\n\n78\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.070\nSo I am going to select switch\ndev switch sdb, make that active.\n\n79\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.870\nAnd then I'm gonna print\nthe information about that sdb.\n\n80\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.517\nAnd here I can see that my thumb\ndrive has two partitions on it,\n\n81\n00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:15.760\nthe two that were created\nwhen we copied that ISO over.\n\n82\n00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.385\nAll right, so\n\n83\n00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:20.070\nI've got my hidden boot partition and\nI've got my Kali partition there.\n\n84\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.800\nWe're gonna create another partition.\n\n85\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.290\nThat's gonna be our persistent\npartition and our encrypted partition.\n\n86\n00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.360\nSo we'll do a little make dir primary.\n\n87\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.842\nAnd you wanna look, you see where the, on\nthat line right above where we're at now,\n\n88\n00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:37.360\nnumber two, that second partition.\n\n89\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.510\nLook at the ending byte for that, right?.\n\n90\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.000\nThat is kind of the mark on\nthe drive where that partition ends.\n\n91\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.390\nSo at 2856 took about three\ngigs to install Kali.\n\n92\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.180\nThat is where I wanna start the next\npartition that we're creating.\n\n93\n00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.210\nSo make dir primary and I'll do 2856.\n\n94\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.789\nAnd then I want to make it\nroughly 20 gigs, give or\n\n95\n00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.310\ntake minus three gigs here for Kali,\nso I'm just gonna say 20480 to end.\n\n96\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.942\nSo I'm telling it where to\nstart this new partition,\n\n97\n00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:12.180\nwhere to end this new partition\non this hard drive, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.870\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n99\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.425\nAnd evidently I did not do that right.\n\n100\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.390\nMake dir, how about we change\nthat command up a little bit?\n\n101\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.200\nMy bad.\n\n102\n00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.160\nWe're not making a directory in this case,\nwe're making a partition.\n\n103\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.540\nSo let's do make part.\n\n104\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.040\nThat will succeed a little bit\nbetter when you're inside a parted.\n\n105\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.570\nOkay, so make part primary, where you\nwanna start it, where you wanna end it.\n\n106\n00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.611\nSo now we have a new partition,\nin fact if we do a print,\n\n107\n00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:43.588\nwe'll see our third partition\nthat we just created,\n\n108\n00:05:43.588 --> 00:05:47.310\nof approximately a little bit,\n17, 17 and a half gigabytes.\n\n109\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.030\nPlenty of space for\nmy persistent partition.\n\n110\n00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.700\nAll right, so now that we got that done,\nwe'll quit out of parted.\n\n111\n00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.920\nI'm gonna clear up my screen.\n\n112\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.210\nGive us a little more room\nto work with from the top.\n\n113\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.638\nNext thing I wanna do,\n\n114\n00:06:02.638 --> 00:06:06.860\nis I want to mark that partition\nthat we just created as encrypted.\n\n115\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.300\nAnd we're gonna use LUKS for that.\n\n116\n00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.119\nSo we're gonna do a little,\nif I can type and talk at the same time,\n\n117\n00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:16.876\ncryptsetup I'll do --verbose, so\n\n118\n00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:21.370\nwe can get a little bit of\ninformation back about the process.\n\n119\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.631\n--verify, -- pass phrase,\n\n120\n00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:33.988\nAnd then we're gonna do luksFormat.\n\n121\n00:06:33.988 --> 00:06:40.520\nAnd I'm doing this on dev-SDB3,\nI make sure I type that correctly, right?\n\n122\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.316\nAnd again, make sure you know which\npartition you're working with,\n\n123\n00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:48.060\nalways a good idea to do your print\nwith your parted command, right?\n\n124\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.563\nShould be good to go, we'll hit Enter,\nand it warns me, hey,\n\n125\n00:06:51.563 --> 00:06:54.160\nit's gonna wipe that partition, So, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.404\nWe'll type in YES, all upper case, and\n\n127\n00:06:56.404 --> 00:06:59.408\nwe'll give it our pass\nphrase that we're gonna use.\n\n128\n00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:04.665\nThis is gonna become the key that\nI need to decrypt that partition.\n\n129\n00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:07.713\nThat -- verify pass phrase\nmade it ask me twice so\n\n130\n00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:12.980\nI can make sure there's no typos in\nthere as I create that pass phrase.\n\n131\n00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.470\nAll right, so we should be good to go.\n\n132\n00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.152\nNow we're gonna type in cryptsetup, And\n\n133\n00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:23.780\nthen luksOpen.\n\n134\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.630\nAnd I wanna open up that encrypted.\n\n135\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.224\nSo we're gonna say -dev/sdb3.\n\n136\n00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:34.424\nAnd I'm gonna open that up as my_usb.\n\n137\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.509\nSo it says hey, if you're gonna work with\nthat partition, what's the password for\n\n138\n00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:40.134\nit, right?\n\n139\n00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:41.390\nCuz it is encrypted at this point.\n\n140\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.482\nSo we type in the password,\neverything is good to go,\n\n141\n00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:47.380\nit's able to open up that partition.\n\n142\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.200\nNow we can write to that partition.\n\n143\n00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.538\nWe're gonna do our,\nmake file system, or mkfs.\n\n144\n00:07:54.538 --> 00:08:00.184\nAnd I'm gonna do EXT-4 for the format for\nthat partition, the file system.\n\n145\n00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:03.439\nI'm going to add a -L and\n\n146\n00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:08.399\nwe're going to call it Persistence,\n\n147\n00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:13.359\nand /dev/mapper/my_usb right,\n\n148\n00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:16.306\nand we'll hit Enter.\n\n149\n00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:23.152\nAnd it's writing that file system out\nto that partition as we speak, and\n\n150\n00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:28.590\nthere we go, it has finished up, so we've\ncreated our partition, we've encrypted it.\n\n151\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.536\nWe've given it our passphrase and\nnow we've opened that partition up and\n\n152\n00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:35.790\nwe've written a file system\nto that partition, all right.\n\n153\n00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:41.346\nThe next thing I wanna do is\nmake sure that label set,\n\n154\n00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:46.146\nE2 label is gonna be\nswitch dev switch mapper\n\n155\n00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:50.967\nswitch my usb, and\nam I spelling that right?\n\n156\n00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:55.866\nPersistence, and I wanna hit Enter,\nand we should be good to go there.\n\n157\n00:08:55.866 --> 00:09:01.038\nAll right, now we've gotta\ncreate our persistence.comp\n\n158\n00:09:01.038 --> 00:09:05.700\nfile in that volume that we just created,\nall right.\n\n159\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.295\nSo that's gonna be my mkdir, this time\nwe are gonna do mkdir not mkpart,\n\n160\n00:09:11.295 --> 00:09:16.184\nso we're going to make directory-p\nswitch mnt switch my usb.\n\n161\n00:09:16.184 --> 00:09:21.396\nWe'll create a new directory in there,\n\n162\n00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:29.838\nand then I'm gonna mount switch\ndev switch mapper switch my USB.\n\n163\n00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:37.293\nAnd we're gonna mount that up as,\nlet's just do mount switch my USB.\n\n164\n00:09:39.243 --> 00:09:41.716\nAll right, so we got that mounted up,\nand now we're right out to it.\n\n165\n00:09:41.716 --> 00:09:45.082\nWe're going to echo out same thing\nwe did before when we created\n\n166\n00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:47.127\nthat persistent partition, right?\n\n167\n00:09:47.127 --> 00:09:50.238\nThis is really just like before,\nwe've added the encryption already,\n\n168\n00:09:50.238 --> 00:09:52.024\nnow we're just creating that comp file.\n\n169\n00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:56.943\nAnd we're going to echo out the same thing\nwe did before forward slash space union\n\n170\n00:09:56.943 --> 00:09:57.968\nand your quote.\n\n171\n00:09:57.968 --> 00:10:04.552\nAnd we'll do a little greater-than symbol\nto write that out to switch mount,\n\n172\n00:10:04.552 --> 00:10:10.252\nswitch my USB, persistence.conf,\nhave if I spelled that right?\n\n173\n00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:16.349\nDouble check, should be good to go,\nso it's going to write that out and\n\n174\n00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:21.041\nthen we'll umount, or\nwe'll unmount that, my USB.\n\n175\n00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:25.393\nSo switch dev switch mount, switch my USB,\n\n176\n00:10:25.393 --> 00:10:29.860\nI'm sorry not mount\nmappers is what we used,\n\n177\n00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.102\nmy USB, and we'll unmount that, [COUGH].\n\n178\n00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:39.246\nAll right,\nnow we're gonna close out of luks,\n\n179\n00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:44.400\nso we're gonna type in\ncryptSetup luksClose.\n\n180\n00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.619\nAnd we'll close that down, our connection\nto that encrypted partition with our\n\n181\n00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:56.850\nswitch devs switch mapper,\nWhatever we wanna call it,\n\n182\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:01.860\nmy_usb and we should be good to go,\nall right, and that's it.\n\n183\n00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.890\nSo at this point we've built our\nbootable thumb drive with Kali Linux,\n\n184\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.480\nwe've created a third partition.\n\n185\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.030\nAnd we've made that persistent and\nthen we've encrypted that partition.\n\n186\n00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.890\nSo now we're gonna reboot and\nsee what happens all right, so\n\n187\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.825\nlet's reboot this box, actually let me\nconfigure this box to boot from USB.\n\n188\n00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:26.267\nThis is just particular to my\nparticular virtualization software,\n\n189\n00:11:26.267 --> 00:11:30.030\nI gotta shut it down to\nmake that change though.\n\n190\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.360\nSo let's shut this guy down and\nthen it will make that change.\n\n191\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.392\nAgain, depending on what you're using for\nvirtualization, these steps here might be\n\n192\n00:11:40.392 --> 00:11:46.349\na little different, so\nI'm gonna go into my settings, And\n\n193\n00:11:46.349 --> 00:11:49.093\ntell it to do an EFI Boot.\n\n194\n00:11:52.552 --> 00:11:56.124\nSo my thumb drive's plugged in, all I'm\ngonna do is boot this machine back up and\n\n195\n00:11:56.124 --> 00:11:57.665\nit should boot to the thumb drive.\n\n196\n00:11:57.665 --> 00:12:02.596\n[SOUND] [LAUGH] Okay it's enough\n\n197\n00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:06.547\nof that binging thing.\n\n198\n00:12:06.547 --> 00:12:07.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n199\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.793\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're waiting for it to boot,\n\n200\n00:12:10.793 --> 00:12:13.660\nthis lovely black screen we have got here.\n\n201\n00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.450\nAnd you'll be able to tell that we're\nbooting to the thumb drive because my\n\n202\n00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.668\nresolution is not gonna be very good,\nright?\n\n203\n00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:23.992\nAnd there it is, we get to this point and\nwe should be able to come\n\n204\n00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:28.926\ndown to the option,\nlive system encrypted persistence.\n\n205\n00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:33.453\nIf everything worked we should be able\nto boot into that, so I hit Enter and\n\n206\n00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:36.461\nwe'll let it wear and\ngrind and see what it does.\n\n207\n00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:43.976\nAll right, there it goes and\nit should stop here in a minute and say,\n\n208\n00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:45.610\nwait a second.\n\n209\n00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.321\nThat third partition is encrypted,\n\n210\n00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:50.499\nI'm not gonna open that up unless\nyou can tell me the password.\n\n211\n00:12:50.499 --> 00:12:51.063\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n212\n00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:56.890\n&gt;&gt; And I know that's really small to read\nbut on that very last line it's saying,\n\n213\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.442\nplease unlock disk/dev/sdb3, all right.\n\n214\n00:13:00.442 --> 00:13:05.067\nSo I'm simply gonna type in the pass\nphrase we set, hit Enter, and\n\n215\n00:13:05.067 --> 00:13:09.952\nassuming I typed it in correctly,\nit'll continue the boot process.\n\n216\n00:13:17.753 --> 00:13:20.168\nAnd it's just about there to my desktop.\n\n217\n00:13:24.208 --> 00:13:27.321\nWaiting for it, wait for it.\n\n218\n00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:30.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No real way to speed this process\n\n219\n00:13:30.662 --> 00:13:31.219\nup, right?\n\n220\n00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:35.886\n&gt;&gt; But this is just so you know that we're\ndoing this live and it's on memorex.\n\n221\n00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:37.070\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right\nalmost there I promise.\n\n223\n00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.999\nIt's taking a little bit longer, there it\ngoes, bing, all right, and there we go,\n\n224\n00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:50.940\nand we'll give it just a second,\neverything looks good.\n\n225\n00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.430\nAll right, so now we need to test it out,\nright, we need to see if we truly\n\n226\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.110\nhave persistence and if our encryption and\nour passphrase is working.\n\n227\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.790\nAnd then if all of that is working\nwe'll try to go back and add that nuke\n\n228\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.170\nkey that I think we talked about earlier,\nwhere I wanna set a second password.\n\n229\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.710\nAnd if you type in that password it\ndoesn't unlock the encrypted partition,\n\n230\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.630\nit wipes the encrypted partition.\n\n231\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the other layer of\nsecurity in case someone gets a hold of\n\n232\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:23.390\nyour thumb drive and the last bash gen\nwould be to just destroy what's on there.\n\n233\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.319\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all right so let's do this,\n\n234\n00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:32.230\nlet's create a folder right\nout here on my desktop and\n\n235\n00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.957\nI'm just gonna call it Encrypt_Test.\n\n236\n00:14:35.957 --> 00:14:41.437\nI'm gonna click Create, and why not,\nlet's put a file in there as well, right.\n\n237\n00:14:46.963 --> 00:14:51.521\nI'm a little faster than computer today,\nlet's do, what do you like to use,\n\n238\n00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:52.480\nfuzzy what?\n\n239\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.150\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy ears.\n\n240\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.457\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy ears.txt, all right,\n\n241\n00:14:59.457 --> 00:15:04.360\n[LAUGH] That will be our test.\n\n242\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.576\n&gt;&gt; No, that's me I'm talking about,\nI have fuzzy ears, I'm sorry.\n\n243\n00:15:07.576 --> 00:15:12.727\n&gt;&gt; Okay, there we go, so we've got our\nencrypt.test folder and our fuzzy ears\n\n244\n00:15:12.727 --> 00:15:17.657\nfile inside there, we are gonna reboot\nthis system and see what happens.\n\n245\n00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:23.490\nAll right, so give it a minute,\nas it reboots again the same thing\n\n246\n00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.260\nshould happen, right, my virtual machine\nis set to boot to the thumb drive.\n\n247\n00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.125\nSo it's gonna boot up my Kali Live,\nI'm gonna choose the Live\n\n248\n00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:36.725\nwith Encrypted Persistence,\nall right, now hit Enter.\n\n249\n00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:43.312\nAnd let's test it successfully first, and\n\n250\n00:15:43.312 --> 00:15:46.949\nthen we'll see if we can\nget it to fail on us.\n\n251\n00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:51.821\nSo again it should stop in a minute and\nprompt me for that password, there it is,\n\n252\n00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:56.943\nprompting me for the passphrase for SDB 3,\nI'll type it in, hopefully correct.\n\n253\n00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.860\nAnd then we'll let it whir and\ngrind and finish the boot process.\n\n254\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.870\nSo If I typed in the right password and\n\n255\n00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.890\nwe saw that it didn't balk at me during\nthe boot process, we should come\n\n256\n00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.290\nup to our desktop and we should see\nthat folder and that file there.\n\n257\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.350\nAnd then what we'll do is we'll reboot and\nenter the wrong password or\n\n258\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.090\nno password and see what Callie does.\n\n259\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:29.990\nSo there we go, there's our folder,\nwith our fuzzyears.txt inside there.\n\n260\n00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.850\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; We are good to go.\n\n261\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.620\nThe persistence is working right?\n\n262\n00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:38.228\nThrough our reboot, this folder still\nexists, we saw an earlier episode of\n\n263\n00:16:38.228 --> 00:16:42.985\nconfiguration changes as well, like I\ncould set my resolution at this point.\n\n264\n00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:44.426\nAll right, now we're gonna reboot.\n\n265\n00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:50.010\nAnd again, it should boot to USB.\n\n266\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.970\nIt should ask me for\nthe pass phrase for sdb3, our encrypted\n\n267\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.780\npartition, and let's see [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And purposely you're gonna put in\n\n268\n00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.470\nthe wrong pass phrase at this\npoint to see if it will block you.\n\n269\n00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.490\n&gt;&gt; That's the idea.\n\n270\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So somebody found my thumb drive,\n\n271\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.010\nthey've plugged it into their system.\n\n272\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.711\nThey're gonna try to boot here into\nthis with the encrypted persistance and\n\n273\n00:17:12.711 --> 00:17:14.683\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n274\n00:17:16.498 --> 00:17:21.255\nAll right so as it mounts everything\nup and it mounts up our drives and\n\n275\n00:17:21.255 --> 00:17:26.095\nour file systems, you see it pauses here,\nasks me for the password,\n\n276\n00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:29.200\nand I'm just gonna type\nin good old qwerty.\n\n277\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.580\nHit enter.\n\n278\n00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.236\n&gt;&gt; Qwerty?\n\n279\n00:17:32.236 --> 00:17:35.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, something.\n\n280\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.930\nIt says there was an error decrypting dev.\n\n281\n00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.356\nHopefully you guys can see that,\nthe very bottom line.\n\n282\n00:17:40.356 --> 00:17:45.194\nThere was an error decrypting dev sdb 3.\n\n283\n00:17:45.194 --> 00:17:46.428\nRetry, yes or no.\n\n284\n00:17:46.428 --> 00:17:49.260\nNo key available with this pass phrase.\n\n285\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.980\nSo there you go.\n\n286\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.060\nIt is recognizing an-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n287\n00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.750\n&gt;&gt; Incorrect password and it's gonna say,\ndo you wanna retry it or not.\n\n288\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.120\nIf I say yes, it would prompt me for\na password again.\n\n289\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:07.210\nIf I say no,\nlet's see what it does, right?\n\n290\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.310\n&gt;&gt; And then a question I\nwould have at this point is,\n\n291\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.890\nyou probably can set it so just so\nmany tries can happen, right?\n\n292\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.760\n&gt;&gt; With this one you might be able\nto set up a script that kind of,\n\n293\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.660\nthat monitors that.\n\n294\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.870\nBut not as easy as I think what\nyou're thinking about here.\n\n295\n00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.310\nThe normal log on system.\n\n296\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n297\n00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll let this run, or\nlet this boot up and what we should see\n\n298\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.690\nis that it still boots just fine even\nthough I didn't put in the password, or\n\n299\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.480\nthe correct password, for\n\n300\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.300\nthat encrypted volume, it didn't prevent\nme from booting into the system.\n\n301\n00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:41.090\nBut what it did do, you notice I do not\nhave my folder out there on my desktop.\n\n302\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.700\nSo it's saying, hey, I'll continue to boot\nbut I can't access this partition, and\n\n303\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.560\nthat's where all your persistent\ninformation is being stored.\n\n304\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.480\nI couldn't decrypt it so\nI'm just gonna do a default boot into.\n\n305\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.900\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So it still lets me boot up.\n\n306\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.210\nI just can't access that encrypted info.\n\n307\n00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.330\nFantastic, that's exactly what we want.\n\n308\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.770\nSo somebody could steal my thumb drive,\nthey could successfully boot into Kali,\n\n309\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:02.530\nand think, woohoo.\n\n310\n00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.610\nI got a thumb drive that's\nrunning Kali Linux on there.\n\n311\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:09.160\nThey might not ever realize that\nthere is an encrypted partition.\n\n312\n00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.140\nIf they do try that option in the boot,\nand\n\n313\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.640\nsay, let's boot to the encrypted\npartition, see if they've got one.\n\n314\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.340\nThey'll get prompted for the password.\n\n315\n00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.620\nNow they'll know, there is one here.\n\n316\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.580\nBut they won't have the password, so they\nwon't be able to get into that partition.\n\n317\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.740\nAll right, now,\nthat being said, they're good,\n\n318\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.950\nthey might try to break that password.\n\n319\n00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.890\nThey might try to hack into that and\nget into my encrypted partition.\n\n320\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.070\nSo the next thing I want to try to do is\nset up that nuke key that we talked about.\n\n321\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.170\nLux will allow me to create another\npass phrase that acts as a new key.\n\n322\n00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.000\nWhat will happen is if you\nput the correct password in,\n\n323\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.070\nit will decrypt the volume and\nyou can see the info.\n\n324\n00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.311\nIf you put the second correct password,\nthe new key password in there,\n\n325\n00:19:54.311 --> 00:19:58.640\ninstead of decrypting the volume,\nit will wipe the volume, all right?\n\n326\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.560\nAnd the idea is, the theory is,\nuse a really good, long,\n\n327\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.531\nstrong passphrase to decrypt your volume.\n\n328\n00:20:05.531 --> 00:20:13.370\nUse a medium to low passphrase, medium to\nlow security passphrase, for your new key.\n\n329\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.740\nAnd if they start running\npassword crackers, hopefully they\n\n330\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.640\ncrack the password for the new key first\nbecause it's intentionally weaker, right?\n\n331\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.400\nI might even use a dictionary word for\nthat because they're going to run their\n\n332\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.210\ncracker and go, my gosh, look, this guy\nused password123 as his password and\n\n333\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.980\nnow they're going to go and enter that,\nthey're going to reboot the system.\n\n334\n00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.870\nEnter password 123 when it asks\nthem to decrypt that volume and\n\n335\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.050\ninstead of decrypting it,\nthey'll end up wiping the volume for me.\n\n336\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.970\nAnd now all that, really what it's doing\nis it destroys the decryption key so\n\n337\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.400\nI can no longer decrypt the volume and\nthey're not going to get access to it.\n\n338\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.350\nSo it's like as we were talking earlier-\n&gt;&gt; Mission Impossible all over again.\n\n339\n00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Alright so now what I am going to do is\nI'm going to restart this virtual machine\n\n340\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.030\nwithout booting to my thumb drive.\n\n341\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.400\nI remembered that my,\nthe live is not patch.\n\n342\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.790\nI dont' think it has\nthe Luke's new patch on their.\n\n343\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:07.460\nLet's me grab my settings and\n\n344\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.730\njust have this guy boot\ninto my normal install.\n\n345\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.210\nOf course I got to shut it down,\nI forget that every time.\n\n346\n00:21:15.572 --> 00:21:18.130\nYou get used to be able to\nmake certain changes while\n\n347\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.800\nthe virtual machine is running.\n\n348\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.450\nAnd I kind of get in that bad habit.\n\n349\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.870\nAll right, so now I'm gonna edit, and\nI'm gonna go into Options, Advanced, and\n\n350\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.510\ndo away with that.\n\n351\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.806\nAgain, this will depend on\nyour virtualization software.\n\n352\n00:21:29.806 --> 00:21:33.634\nHowever, you can boot to the thumb\ndrive or not boot to the thumb drive.\n\n353\n00:21:33.634 --> 00:21:36.847\nAll right, so\nbooting back up into my Kali VM.\n\n354\n00:21:42.317 --> 00:21:43.580\nAnd let it run.\n\n355\n00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:49.340\nAnd we'll give it a second, let it boot.\n\n356\n00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.792\nAnd I'll go ahead and log in.\n\n357\n00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:59.200\n&gt;&gt; [BLANK AUDIO] I actually\nlike saying blooks nooks.\n\n358\n00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.730\nBlooks nooks sounds good, blooks nooks.\n\n359\n00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.830\n&gt;&gt; That is kinda fun isn't it.\n\n360\n00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.210\nAll right, so now we want to,\nremember we've got the thumb drive.\n\n361\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.760\nIt's still plugged into this Kali system.\n\n362\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.410\nIt's just not booting to it.\n\n363\n00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.930\nBut it is plugged in and it's accessible.\n\n364\n00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.440\nAnd I want to go back and\nadd a second pass phrase,\n\n365\n00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.540\nI want to add my nuke option to that\nencrypted volume on my usb thumb drive.\n\n366\n00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:28.250\nSo for that, we are going to first verify\nand figure out where my devices are.\n\n367\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:35.250\nSo I'm gonna do part it and\nthen I'm gonna do a print devices.\n\n368\n00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.525\nAnd you have to spell that right.\n\n369\n00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.602\n[LAUGH] I did it again.\n\n370\n00:22:39.602 --> 00:22:41.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; One more time.\n\n371\n00:22:43.183 --> 00:22:43.940\nThere we go.\n\n372\n00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.090\nAnd SDB is my thumb drive,\nso I'm good to go there.\n\n373\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.970\nI'm going to quit out of SDB.\n\n374\n00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.352\nWe'll clear my screen up a little bit.\n\n375\n00:22:55.352 --> 00:23:00.740\nAll right so now the command is\ngoing to be crypt set up and\n\n376\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.029\nthen Luke's ad nuke.\n\n377\n00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:08.170\n&gt;&gt; Luke's Nuke.\n\n378\n00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:14.610\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm going to do switch dev,\nswitch SDB 3.\n\n379\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.740\nThat's that third partition\non that thumb drive.\n\n380\n00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.650\nAnd it sees it, and says, wait a second.\n\n381\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.240\nThis is already encrypted.\n\n382\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.660\nSo before you can go making changes to it,\n\n383\n00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.110\nyou better know the passphrase\nto decrypt that partition.\n\n384\n00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.403\nSo we will type in our\npassphrase that we set earlier.\n\n385\n00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:37.410\nAnd then enter new passphrase for\nnew key slot.\n\n386\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.190\nThis is gonna be my new key, right?\n\n387\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.764\nAnd I'm just gonna put\nall lowercase password.\n\n388\n00:23:47.924 --> 00:23:51.838\nNow say that out loud so you guys can\nremind me if I forget what it is.\n\n389\n00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:53.955\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All lower case password.\n\n390\n00:23:53.955 --> 00:23:57.639\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n391\n00:23:57.639 --> 00:24:00.414\nAnd that's it, a crazy difficult, right?\n\n392\n00:24:00.414 --> 00:24:07.450\nBut now we've got a password that we can\nuse to wipe the encrypted partition.\n\n393\n00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.560\nSo, we'll test it out.\n\n394\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.090\nWe'll shut the machine down,\n\n395\n00:24:19.014 --> 00:24:22.000\nAnd we'll switch it to\nboot to the thumb drive.\n\n396\n00:24:29.455 --> 00:24:33.041\nSo we can boot up to our handy\ndandy Kali USB drive, and\n\n397\n00:24:33.041 --> 00:24:35.690\nwe know what's gonna happen, right?\n\n398\n00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:41.920\nAs it boots up, it's gonna stop and\nprompt us for our passphrase.\n\n399\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.457\nAnd we already know if I enter the right\npassphrase, I'll be greedy with my\n\n400\n00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:49.444\ndesktop, and I'll see that folder we\ncreated because I've got that persistence,\n\n401\n00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:50.868\nand it's nicely encrypted.\n\n402\n00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:54.390\nNow what we're gonna do is we'll try\nthe new passphrase, and see what happens.\n\n403\n00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.999\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna pretend\nthat we're bad actors.\n\n404\n00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:59.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so we're gonna go down\nto live system, encrypted persistence.\n\n405\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.410\nNow, we'll let it boot.\n\n406\n00:25:04.871 --> 00:25:08.144\nWait for it,\nthis is the exciting part, right?\n\n407\n00:25:08.144 --> 00:25:10.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let that run.\n\n408\n00:25:10.131 --> 00:25:11.805\n&gt;&gt; All lowercase.\n\n409\n00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:17.524\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n[LAUGH] it's mounting up by system.\n\n410\n00:25:17.524 --> 00:25:19.548\nAnd we know if I enter\nthe right passphrase,\n\n411\n00:25:19.548 --> 00:25:22.200\nmy folder would be sitting\nthere on my desktop.\n\n412\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.430\nNow we're gonna see if we enter the new\nkey if it truly wipes that partition,\n\n413\n00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.669\nlet's find out.\n\n414\n00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:32.539\nAll right,\nan all lowercase password, right?\n\n415\n00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:40.080\nSo we add that passphrase,\nand now we see what happens.\n\n416\n00:25:42.689 --> 00:25:46.984\nFailed to read from key storage,\nthere is an error decrypting sdb3, retry.\n\n417\n00:25:46.984 --> 00:25:52.034\nLet's just go, no retry,\n\n418\n00:25:52.034 --> 00:25:56.433\njust keep on tracking.\n\n419\n00:25:57.485 --> 00:26:00.007\nActually, you know what,\nI should have entered the right one, and\n\n420\n00:26:00.007 --> 00:26:02.120\nthen we could see, well,\nwe'll try it both ways.\n\n421\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.560\nWe'll see what happens here.\n\n422\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.720\nSo this time I entered no passphrase so\nnow that I think about it, probably,\n\n423\n00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.752\nI won't see the encrypted partition, so I\ncan't verify that the data has been lost.\n\n424\n00:26:13.752 --> 00:26:14.252\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n425\n00:26:18.822 --> 00:26:22.890\n&gt;&gt; So, no folder which we expected,\nso I'm gonna reboot.\n\n426\n00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:33.708\nAnd we'll try now to enter\nthe correct passphrase, and\n\n427\n00:26:33.708 --> 00:26:36.999\nsee if it can decrypt the volume,\nand if the data is still there.\n\n428\n00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.790\nWhat should have happened is\nwhen I entered that new key,\n\n429\n00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.250\nit should have thrown away the information\nneeded to decrypt the volume.\n\n430\n00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.880\nSo now, even though I know the right\npassphrase, I shouldn't get access to it.\n\n431\n00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:56.432\nSo I chose to boot to the live\nencrypted persistence.\n\n432\n00:26:56.432 --> 00:27:01.040\nIt's gonna go through a process, start\nmounting at my file systems, my devices.\n\n433\n00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:09.810\nAsk me for the passphrase to unlock sdb3,\nI will type in the correct passphrase.\n\n434\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:16.136\nAnd notice this says,\nno key available with this passphrase.\n\n435\n00:27:19.015 --> 00:27:21.530\nIt's not happy,\nplease unlock the disk, all right?\n\n436\n00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.130\nAgain, I'll type in the right password.\n\n437\n00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.960\nAnd it says, there was an error,\nand I'm not hitting yes or no.\n\n438\n00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.110\nIt's moving on to the next line,\nit's not even giving me the option,\n\n439\n00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.150\nthere was an error, retry, yes or no.\n\n440\n00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.990\nIt's just saying, can't do it, or\nthere's not any keys to even try it.\n\n441\n00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.289\nSo at this point,\nwe have successfully set up a nuke option.\n\n442\n00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:42.390\n&gt;&gt; So we nuked it.\n\n443\n00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.800\n&gt;&gt; We nuked it.\n\n444\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.730\nAgain, technically,\nthe data's still there.\n\n445\n00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:51.560\nWhat it's actually doing is it's\nremoving the decryption keys\n\n446\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.690\nto decrypt that volume.\n\n447\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.840\nSo, nobody's going to be\nable to get access to it.\n\n448\n00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:00.770\nSo now,\nwe can set up an encrypted persistent\n\n449\n00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:06.220\npartition on our Kali Linux\nlive USB thumb drive.\n\n450\n00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.380\nWe can even add a little bit of\nextra protection, that kill switch,\n\n451\n00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.700\nif you will, to where if somebody\ntries to get access to it.\n\n452\n00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.910\nThey enter in that wrong passphrase,\nthey can end up wiping all the data.\n\n453\n00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.884\nAnd as I said earlier,\nI think the idea would be,\n\n454\n00:28:18.884 --> 00:28:22.700\nlet's use a relatively weak passphrase for\nthe new key.\n\n455\n00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.780\nSomething that somebody might guess or\ntry, and end up doing us a favor, and\n\n456\n00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:32.624\nwiping out the access to that encrypted\npartition with that stolen thumb drive.\n\n457\n00:28:32.624 --> 00:28:36.650\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, live with encrypted\npersistence, Kali Linux, Mike,\n\n458\n00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.560\nanything else you'd like to add?\n\n459\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.250\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so,\nI think we've covered quite a bit there.\n\n460\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.700\nWe've really covered the gamut of\ninstalling Kali on a thumb drive.\n\n461\n00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.910\nWe saw how to simply make\na bootable thumb drive.\n\n462\n00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.680\nWe can take Kali with us\nanywhere we wanna go.\n\n463\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.230\nThen we saw how to make that thumb drive\npersistent so that configuration changes,\n\n464\n00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.480\nfiles, reports,\nthings like that can actually be saved.\n\n465\n00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.480\nAnd then we saw how to encrypt\nthat persistent partitions so\n\n466\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.120\nthat we can protect that sensitive data\nthat we're storing on that thumb drive.\n\n467\n00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.610\nAnd then in the last one we saw\nhow to add a new key to it so\n\n468\n00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.100\nthat we could wipe it with ease,\nthat encrypted partition,\n\n469\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.890\nor hopefully the bad guys that stole my\nthumb drive will end up wiping it for us.\n\n470\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.270\nSo a lot of good stuff there.\n\n471\n00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.790\n&gt;&gt; And\nMike is doing a great job with Kali Linux.\n\n472\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:27.150\nAnd there's a lot more in the video\ncontent in the Kali Linux library.\n\n473\n00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.310\nSo make sure you watch all the videos,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n474\n00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.263\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:29:31.263 --> 00:29:35.050\nRemember, an IT Pro is always learning,\nI'm Zach

Hey, a little sleep deprived,\n\n14\n00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:39.250\nbut that's okay.\n\n15\n00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.045\nMe anyway, yes that's exactly what we're\ngonna do, we're gonna be taking a look at\n\n16\n00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:47.510\nthe virtual images that offensive\nsecurity makes available for Kali Linux.\n\n17\n00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.940\nRemember, offensive security the guys and\ngals that fund and write and\n\n18\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.430\nsupport Kali Linux,\nour favorite this throw.\n\n19\n00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.360\nSo that's what we're gonna do today and\n\n20\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.386\nyou know, this is probably one\nof my favorite ways to run Kali.\n\n21\n00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:04.500\nWe've seen some different options\nthat we can do with Kali.\n\n22\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.679\nWe've looked at running it\nlive off of a USB thumb drive,\n\n23\n00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.340\nshould be the same thing\nas running it off a DVD.\n\n24\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.894\nWe've also seen how to make those thumb\ndrives persistent because we've got some\n\n25\n00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:19.382\nwritable space on that thumb drive we were\nable to store data there, and now all of\n\n26\n00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:23.600\na sudden have a portable version of\nKali Linux that had persistence.\n\n27\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060\nAnd we saw how we could actually\nencrypt that persisted area.\n\n28\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.585\n&gt;&gt; Security.\n\n29\n00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:31.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that if we've got sensitive\ninformation in there we could make sure\n\n30\n00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:32.950\nthat it is kept safe.\n\n31\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.550\nAnd even wiped if somebody\ntried to enter in or\n\n32\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.240\nsomebody got access to my thumb drive.\n\n33\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.962\nWe could nuke that basically.\n\n34\n00:01:39.962 --> 00:01:40.720\n&gt;&gt; The nuke button.\n\n35\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.193\n&gt;&gt; Partition which is cool as well.\n\n36\n00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:45.736\nBut, I'll tell you that all are great and\nthey've got their place,\n\n37\n00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:49.278\nmy favorite way though, if you really\nwant to play with Kali Linux and\n\n38\n00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:53.520\nyou wanna use it not as your daily driver\nbut as your frequently operating system.\n\n39\n00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600\nThat this is your job, if you're\na a security professional with your\n\n40\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.310\norganization if you're\na penetration tester but\n\n41\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.980\nyou don't really wanna I\nuse it as your daily driver\n\n42\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.405\nvirtualization is probably the way\nto go in my humble opinion, right.\n\n43\n00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.585\n&gt;&gt; And Offensive Security is the place\nthat you recommend, we get the platform?\n\n44\n00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:15.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact it's the only\nplace that we can get it from.\n\n45\n00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:16.888\n&gt;&gt; The only one, okay.\n&gt;&gt; They are the guys that put\n\n46\n00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:17.391\nit together, yes.\n\n47\n00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.185\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n48\n00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:21.130\n&gt;&gt; But\nas far as methods to run it because,\n\n49\n00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.710\nI get the best of all the worlds\nin my opinion, right?\n\n50\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.805\nWe can just download this virtual\nhard drive from Offensive Security.\n\n51\n00:02:27.805 --> 00:02:32.240\nThat they've already installed,\nbuilt, and made available for us.\n\n52\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.250\nThey've got it available in\nseveral different platforms,\n\n53\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.220\nwhich we'll take a look at.\n\n54\n00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.420\nSo it's basically download it and run it.\n\n55\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.380\nAnd it's got persistence.\n\n56\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.470\nIt's a virtual hard drive.\n\n57\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.680\nIt's a virtual machine.\n\n58\n00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.840\nSo it's got persistence.\n\n59\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.670\nI can full screen it,\nmake it look like and, for all intents and\n\n60\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.334\npurposes, feel like it's\ninstalled on my laptop locally.\n\n61\n00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:55.628\nI get access to with the right\nvirtualization drivers,\n\n62\n00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:58.060\nI get access to all of my hardware.\n\n63\n00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.021\nIt's just really, really easy.\n\n64\n00:03:01.021 --> 00:03:04.050\n&gt;&gt; And Mike you said that there\nare several platforms there.\n\n65\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.790\nIs there anyone better than others or\nany couple or two or three or.\n\n66\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.400\n&gt;&gt; It really depends on what\nyou're re-running it a lot, right?\n\n67\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.590\nAnd your price point that you like.\n\n68\n00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.325\nWhen it comes to virtualization software,\nif you're running Windows.\n\n69\n00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:16.850\nHyper-V is built in.\n\n70\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.238\nIt's free.\nYou can use it as a full blown type two\n\n71\n00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:25.647\nhypervisor that is going to give\nyou access to all the hardware.\n\n72\n00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:30.510\nSome people don't like\nworking with Hyper-V.\n\n73\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.570\nSo maybe you wanna go with a virtual or\nlike I use VM Workstation.\n\n74\n00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.820\nWorkstation Pro.\n\n75\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.940\nBut that's because my organization\npays for that software for me,\n\n76\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.090\nI don't have to go out and buy it.\n\n77\n00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.980\nI don't wanna pay for a license for\nthat but my work provides it for me.\n\n78\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.890\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou do have to buy that type of laptop.\n\n79\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's workstation, and\nVMWare has a free version as well,\n\n80\n00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.580\nthey have VM Player that\nyou could use this with.\n\n81\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.340\nSo there's a free one of those.\n\n82\n00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.330\nAnd the nice thing about Hyper-V is\nyou can move your machines from your\n\n83\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.420\nlaptop to a production Hyper-V server\nif you needed to for any reason.\n\n84\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.817\nVirtual Box is another great\none that's completely free.\n\n85\n00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:10.990\nSo not quite as feature-rich because it's\na, and I might be getting this backwards.\n\n86\n00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.750\nIt's a type one, hypervisor, where it's\nan application they have runs on your\n\n87\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.960\ndesktop, so it's installed on top of\nan operating system whereas when we talk\n\n88\n00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.110\nabout things like Hyper-V and workstation,\nthese are installed underneath,\n\n89\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.000\ndirectly above the hardware and then your\nactually running desktop, Windows or\n\n90\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.510\nwhatever is really just\na guest operating system.\n\n91\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.790\nIt's being virtualized or it's going\nthrough that same virtualization layer,\n\n92\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.990\nbut you get much better performance\nwhen you run it that way, but\n\n93\n00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.660\nas far as you know working with this,\nlike I said\n\n94\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.880\nit's a great way to do it in my opinion\nbecause you get the ease of installation.\n\n95\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.550\nI don't have to be familiar with Linux,\nthe file systems,\n\n96\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.740\nthe participating,\nto be able to run Linux, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.630\nDual booting can be a real\nchallenge trying to get Linus and\n\n98\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.090\nWindows to play along.\n\n99\n00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.335\nDealing with your boot manager.\n\n100\n00:04:58.335 --> 00:05:02.140\nTrying to switch everything over\nto grab and keep Windows working.\n\n101\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.640\nResizing your partition\nthat can be a pain.\n\n102\n00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.073\nWhereas with my virtualized image of Kali,\nlike I said,\n\n103\n00:05:09.073 --> 00:05:10.939\nI can fire it up any time I want.\n\n104\n00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.184\nAnd as far as going back to\nusing it as a daily driver,\n\n105\n00:05:13.184 --> 00:05:15.698\nthere's nothing wrong with\nusing Kali as a daily driver.\n\n106\n00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:19.250\nBut it really is designed\nto be a security tool.\n\n107\n00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.890\n&gt;&gt; Forensics.\n\n108\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.240\n&gt;&gt; Yes, where I'm doing digital\nforensics or penetration testing.\n\n109\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.650\nAnd it drives me crazy because\nI go out to these websites, and\n\n110\n00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.310\nI see these people like, the top 20\nthings that I do to my Kali install.\n\n111\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.030\nAfter I've installed it and they start\ndoing things like enabling auto log on,\n\n112\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.492\ninstalling flash,\ninstalling this, that, the other.\n\n113\n00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:43.309\nYou might as well just in my opinion,\nyou might as well just go get\n\n114\n00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.860\nyour Linux Mint or some other-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Daily drive type Linux distro\nthat's meant to be a desktop and\n\n116\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.920\nhave all those features.\n\n117\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.800\nKali is supposed to be secure or getting\napps only from Kali's repositories.\n\n118\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.100\nWe're not installing flash, we're not auto\nlogging on the administrator account.\n\n119\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.830\nThese are things that you\nwouldn't really want to do.\n\n120\n00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.540\nSo and again that's my opinion.\n\n121\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.320\nIf you wanna use Kali\nas a daily driver and\n\n122\n00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.010\nnot as a secure penetration testing\nplatform that's perfectly fine too.\n\n123\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.260\nIt's a great operating system.\n\n124\n00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.510\nIt's got a lot of tools built into it,\nso whatever you feel like doing.\n\n125\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.590\nThat's the great thing about Linux's,\nthere's hundreds of disk droves and\n\n126\n00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.680\nhundreds of flavors,\nand it's a lot of fun.\n\n127\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.980\n&gt;&gt; So, how do we install it?\n\n128\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.050\n&gt;&gt; Let's check it out here.\n\n129\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.384\nI'm gonna go out to my browser and\nwe're gonna navigate over to kali.org.\n\n130\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.090\nAnd that is going to\nbe our site of choice.\n\n131\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.720\nAnd then on Kali's webpage, we'll click on\ndownloads and go to download Kali Linux.\n\n132\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.240\nAnd here we're gonna see\nthe different options, right?\n\n133\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.560\nNow we've already played\na round with our ISOs,\n\n134\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.650\nwe put it on a thumb drive, we put it on\nour live version and all that good stuff.\n\n135\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.660\nI'm gonna scroll down\na little bit further, and\n\n136\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.370\ndown here I get to Kali Linux VMware\nvirtual box and arm images, right?\n\n137\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.440\nThese are put together again by, oops,\n\n138\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.410\nI was trying to highlight that\nnot move it, Offensive Security.\n\n139\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.650\nThey're also the founders and\nthe developers of Kali Linux,\n\n140\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.160\nso who better to get it from than right,\nthe people who wrote it?\n\n141\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.610\nAnd here's my Kali virtual images.\n\n142\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.880\nI can do ARM images if I'm trying\nto work with an ARM processor.\n\n143\n00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.048\nThey've got some build scripts for that.\n\n144\n00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:23.080\nWe're gonna do the Kali virtual images.\n\n145\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.500\nAnd then once I get on this page,\nas I scroll down,\n\n146\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.120\nyou'll see I have several choices.\n\n147\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.070\nFor Kali Linux VMware images,\nI could do a 64 bit VM,\n\n148\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.860\na 32 bit VM and\nthen there's their light version.\n\n149\n00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.570\nNotice the difference in the size.\n\n150\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.775\nHopefully you guys can see that out there.\n\n151\n00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:45.550\n2.1GB for the normal version, 0.5GB for\nthat light version, all right.\n\n152\n00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.350\nIf I'm not using VMware, either player or\nworkstation or workstation pro,\n\n153\n00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.220\nI can go to the virtual box.\n\n154\n00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.847\nThey've got my same choices there.\n\n155\n00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:57.048\nAnd then the one I loved, and\nagain I come from a Windows world.\n\n156\n00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:59.198\nI've taught Windows courses for\nyears, and years, and years.\n\n157\n00:07:59.198 --> 00:08:00.278\nYears.\n\n158\n00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:01.445\nAnd Hyper-V was my thing.\n\n159\n00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:04.540\nAnd I remember when they first\nadded an actual Hyper-V image.\n\n160\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.880\nI was so thankful because trying\nto install Kali Linux, or really,\n\n161\n00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.240\nany Linux under Hyper-V a few years.\n\n162\n00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.858\nIt's getting much better now, but\nyears ago it was really difficult.\n\n163\n00:08:14.858 --> 00:08:15.617\n&gt;&gt; Back in the olden days.\n\n164\n00:08:15.617 --> 00:08:18.284\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou know how it is in computer terms.\n\n165\n00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:21.740\nI mean back in the day was, [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] years ago.\n\n166\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, so\nI'm really happy when they put that out.\n\n167\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.360\nWorked like a champ.\n\n168\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.850\nLove it, love it.\n\n169\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.490\nBut for us, and I'm not actually\ngonna actually download it.\n\n170\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.090\nWe don't need to sit here and\nwatch two gigs of data being downloaded.\n\n171\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.920\nOnce you guys find this site you\ncan go download it yourself.\n\n172\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.230\nYou would just click on the link.\n\n173\n00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.240\nOr if you wanna use your favorite\ntorrent client you can click on torrent.\n\n174\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.340\nRemember just like we did with the ISO,\nthey provide us a checksum.\n\n175\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.880\nSo that if I happen to go to a mirror\nsite and I make sure that they're hosting\n\n176\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.620\nthe actual image that\nOffensive Security built,\n\n177\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.570\nnot something that they've added\nthings to that I might not want there.\n\n178\n00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.200\nSo always check your signatures\nonce you're done downloading,\n\n179\n00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.900\nit makes sure it's not corrupt or\nmodified in any way.\n\n180\n00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.570\nSo pick your choice, whatever your\nvirtualization platform is, go ahead and\n\n181\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.840\npick it and download it.\n\n182\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.360\nNow, once we've got it download, Zack,\nthat's when we're gonna go find it and\n\n183\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.540\nI again save this some time and\ndownloaded this ahead of time.\n\n184\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.811\n&gt;&gt; You did?\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n185\n00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:20.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n186\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.030\nhere it is, if I can zoom in on this for\nyou, there you go.\n\n187\n00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:30.487\nTheres my Kali-Linux-2017.1-vm-amd64.7z,\n\n188\n00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:33.901\nand that is the one I downloaded.\n\n189\n00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.280\nNow, once you've downloaded it,\nyou would want to extract it out.\n\n190\n00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.260\nNow here's another thing I love about\nrunning it virtualized like this.\n\n191\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.940\nYou could use Kali as your daily driver.\n\n192\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.000\nMost people don't, most people use it\nas a tool when they need it, I think,\n\n193\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.200\nmore than I see it being\nused as a daily driver.\n\n194\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.570\nAlso when you're setting this up, are you\ngoing to, what's a good way to say this,\n\n195\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.380\nis it going to be a throw away, right?\n\n196\n00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.725\nWhich is what I do all the time.\n\n197\n00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:06.220\nYou notice that I've got this, like,\nsitting here, I'll give you a hint,\n\n198\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.790\nI didn't just download this this morning.\n\n199\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.612\nIt's been here for a long time.\n\n200\n00:10:10.612 --> 00:10:14.676\nAnd that's because I'll extract it out,\nfire up a new VM, running Kali,\n\n201\n00:10:14.676 --> 00:10:17.150\ngoof around, do whatever I want to it.\n\n202\n00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.500\nMake changes, play with it, run tools,\ntest things, what have you,\n\n203\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.820\nand when I'm done, I'll blow it away and\nextract it out again and\n\n204\n00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.400\nstart with a nice fresh install, right?\n\n205\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.450\nIt's a throw away operating system for me.\n\n206\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.060\nIt's a tool that I use, and\nthen it's so easy to just\n\n207\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.820\nextract out a new copy of it and start\nall over with a nice fresh clean install.\n\n208\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.620\n&gt;&gt; So you can save your changes right?\n\n209\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.300\nI mean you could.\n\n210\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Save your work that you've done.\n\n211\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.470\nBut you choose just not to do that.\n\n212\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\nit depends on your scenario right?\n\n213\n00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.930\nIt you're a pen tester you might not want\nany lingering objects from your last job\n\n214\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.945\nto be with you on this job.\n\n215\n00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:56.590\nRight, I don't know what configuration\nchanges you had to make in your last job.\n\n216\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.670\nWhat files you've added,\nwhat info might still be there.\n\n217\n00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.985\nMight be better off just starting up a new\nversion for each and every job maybe.\n\n218\n00:11:04.985 --> 00:11:08.700\nSo, it just really depends on\nhow you choose to do it, use it.\n\n219\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.720\nI've got one Kali Linux VM\nthat I save that's mine.\n\n220\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.518\nI take snapshots of it, all of my stuff.\n\n221\n00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:20.466\nI customized my prompt, all the things you\nwould normally do on an operating system\n\n222\n00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:23.750\nthat you are gonna run every day or\nfrequently.\n\n223\n00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.820\nBut then I have several other Kali images\nextracted out that are my throw aways.\n\n224\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.570\nThat I use for shows like this that\nI'll fire up, I'll use for shows, and\n\n225\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.440\nthen I'll blow them away.\n\n226\n00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.130\nSo you can do both.\n\n227\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.390\n&gt;&gt; So that download that we just did,\n\n228\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.780\nis that similar for\nall virtualization platforms?\n\n229\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.610\nIt is, you gotta pick the right platform.\n\n230\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whether you're Hyper-V,\n\n231\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.680\nwhether you're VMware,\nwhether you're virtualBox.\n\n232\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.230\nBut yes, you're gonna download\nsome kind of compressed file.\n\n233\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.810\nAnd what you need to do is extract it out.\n\n234\n00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.240\nSo we will head to extract this one out.\n\n235\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.830\nI'm going to extract it.\n\n236\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.010\nNot just here, I wanna make sure\nI add a little folder for this.\n\n237\n00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.491\nAnd I'll call this one Kali demo.\n\n238\n00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:07.891\n&gt;&gt; And that's just the folder I'm gonna\nput it in, making sure I have my password\n\n239\n00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:11.060\nprotected or anything and\nI'll go ahead and click OK.\n\n240\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.570\nAnd it's not gonna take too terribly long,\nhopefully to extract this out and\n\n241\n00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.010\nwe'll sit here and\n\n242\n00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.750\nwatch rather than do TV magic cuz I\ndon't think it's gonna take that long.\n\n243\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.580\nSo while that's extracting out, yes,\n\n244\n00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.380\nthe procedure would be the same\nif I downloaded a virtual box.\n\n245\n00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.708\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Or if I download Hyper-V.\n\n246\n00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:28.646\nDownload it, extract it out.\n\n247\n00:12:28.646 --> 00:12:32.755\nNow, where it will differ a little bit is\nonce you get it extracted, how do you get\n\n248\n00:12:32.755 --> 00:12:37.183\nyour virtualization software to recognize\nthe virtual machine you just downloaded?\n\n249\n00:12:37.183 --> 00:12:42.637\nMost of them they have a file type\nassociation with their appropriate\n\n250\n00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:47.930\nhard drive extensions,\nvirtual hard drive extensions.\n\n251\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.071\nLike the workstation or\nVMwares, the VMDKs.\n\n252\n00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.890\nHyper-V is a .vhdx.\n\n253\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.276\nSo if double-click on a .vhdx or\nreally not the hard drive,\n\n254\n00:12:57.276 --> 00:13:03.890\nusually the configuration file, which like\nin Hyper-V is a VMC file or a VMCX file.\n\n255\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.717\nI'll show you here once we get this\nextracted out, the Kali files.\n\n256\n00:13:07.717 --> 00:13:11.351\nIf you double-click on the appropriate\none, most likely if you've already got\n\n257\n00:13:11.351 --> 00:13:15.390\nyour virtualization software installed\nit'll detect it and automatically add it.\n\n258\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:21.210\nOtherwise you might have to go in and\nsay I need to import a VM.\n\n259\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.816\nThe cool thing about these,\nthey're not just the hard drives,\n\n260\n00:13:23.816 --> 00:13:25.130\nthey are configuration files.\n\n261\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.510\nThey're a full blown virtual machine.\n\n262\n00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.880\nI've seen some places, not Kali, but\n\n263\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.230\nother things that I've downloaded where\nall it is is a virtual hard drive and\n\n264\n00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.780\nyou have to make a new virtual machine,\nnetwork adaptor, all that stuff.\n\n265\n00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.420\nAnd then, when it comes to\nthe virtual hard drive you say use\n\n266\n00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.700\nan existing virtual hard drive, and you\npoint it to the one you just downloaded.\n\n267\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.600\nSo you basically make a new machine\nwith an existing hard drive.\n\n268\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.068\nIn this case they've got the config\nfiles and everything, so\n\n269\n00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:49.306\nyou're just launching it up.\n\n270\n00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:52.892\nYou don't have to go and\ncreate a new machine first, and\n\n271\n00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:56.110\nthen attach the hard drive or\nanything like that.\n\n272\n00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.920\nSo, again,\n\n273\n00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.930\nOffensive Security does a great job,\nreally love what they're doing out there.\n\n274\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:06.421\nKali Linux is steadfastly\nbecoming the go-to platform for\n\n275\n00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:11.105\npenetration testing and\nsecurity odds and things like that.\n\n276\n00:14:11.105 --> 00:14:13.951\n&gt;&gt; And what's great about Offensive\nSecurity is they do give you the checksum\n\n277\n00:14:13.951 --> 00:14:16.674\ntoo, so you can absolutely make sure\nyou're getting the right thing.\n\n278\n00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:19.285\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly right,\nwhich is very important, right?\n\n279\n00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:21.375\nI always tell people that\nis the easiest way for\n\n280\n00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:26.715\nthe bad guys to get stuff on your machine,\nis to offer free things that people like.\n\n281\n00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:29.895\nThere's that site that offers you, hey,\nwe've got drivers for your system,\n\n282\n00:14:29.895 --> 00:14:30.905\nwhat are you looking for?\n\n283\n00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:33.006\nI'm sure we've got it,\nand you go into downloads-\n\n284\n00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:34.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We've got your drivers.\n\n285\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.475\nWe got your drivers right over here.\n\n286\n00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:37.535\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; From, Mark's Driver's AVC and\n\n287\n00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:41.500\nyou're like, wait,\ndo you really trust these people.\n\n288\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.170\nYou might get the driver but you might get\nsome other baggage round along with that.\n\n289\n00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's happened to me.\n\n290\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's easier too.\n\n291\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.940\nAll right so now that it's extracted out,\nthere's my folder Kali_Demo,\n\n292\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.880\nlet's go in there and\ntake a look at what's inside there.\n\n293\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.607\nNotice I made another folder,\nKali Linux, I will zoom in for you,\n\n294\n00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:59.348\nKali-Linux2017 [SOUND].\n\n295\n00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:01.538\nAnd inside there, there's another folder.\n\n296\n00:15:01.538 --> 00:15:04.680\n[LAUGH] That's Kali-Linux and\ninside there, there's all the good stuff.\n\n297\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.530\nSo here's what I'm going to do.\n\n298\n00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:07.960\nI'm gonna cheat and\n\n299\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.330\nI'm going to cut this out because\nit's just because it drives me crazy.\n\n300\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.740\nAnd I'm gonna paste,\nyou don't have to do that at all.\n\n301\n00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.830\nI'm just getting ready of the,\nI don't wanna cut down.\n\n302\n00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.420\nI want to delete that, the zoom is\nhiding some of our options here.\n\n303\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.460\nI just want to get rid\nof the double layers of\n\n304\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.900\nfolders there that just drives me crazy.\n\n305\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.834\nSo here is what we extracted out and\n\n306\n00:15:33.834 --> 00:15:37.503\nwhat you will see as I zoom back in\nhere is there are several files,\n\n307\n00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:41.798\nthe primary ones that we're looking for\nthis vmdk, actually not that one.\n\n308\n00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:45.752\nYeah, I think that is the first one.\n\n309\n00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:50.029\nBut you can see the way virtual for\nmy virtualization software, for\n\n310\n00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:54.755\nVM work station, sometimes they will\ndivide the hard drive up in to several\n\n311\n00:15:54.755 --> 00:15:57.548\nsmaller chunks which\nis what they did here.\n\n312\n00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.912\nIt can make certain things easier.\n\n313\n00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:03.510\nBut the vmx file is,\nlet me make this a little wider.\n\n314\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.131\nThe vmx is the virtual\nmachine configuration file.\n\n315\n00:16:08.131 --> 00:16:11.718\nAnd Hyper-V again,\nthat's the vmc file or the vmcx file,\n\n316\n00:16:11.718 --> 00:16:14.241\nI forget what they call it in VirtualBox.\n\n317\n00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:17.170\nIt's something similar\nactually to the VM Player.\n\n318\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.720\nBut that's the machine.\n\n319\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.670\nThat's what I wanna double-click on.\n\n320\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.830\nSo I'm just gonna double-click on that.\n\n321\n00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:23.750\nAnd let's see what happens.\n\n322\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.778\nAnd notice VM workstation opened up,\n\n323\n00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:30.174\nour VMware Workstation I should say\nlet me say their name properly.\n\n324\n00:16:30.174 --> 00:16:34.448\nAnd I've got my new machine sitting\nright here that it brought in,\n\n325\n00:16:34.448 --> 00:16:38.199\nthat's ready to go, it's ready for\nme to start using it.\n\n326\n00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:41.899\nAn no I'm not teasing you it is the one\nthere you can see it's the actual one from\n\n327\n00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:42.920\nthe Kali demo.\n\n328\n00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.430\nIt's not one I had set up already, it was\nthat easy to get this up and running.\n\n329\n00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.972\nOops, and I just goofed up my zoom,\nthere we go.\n\n330\n00:16:50.972 --> 00:16:54.540\nAll right, so let's see what\nhappens if we go to power this on.\n\n331\n00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.170\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclick power on the virtual machine.\n\n332\n00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.230\nIt's gonna ask me, now this is specific VM\nworkstation has to do with the unique IDs\n\n333\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.710\nthat it assigns to the virtual machines.\n\n334\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.550\nI'm gonna tell it I copied it so\nit'll generate a new ID.\n\n335\n00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.960\nIf I had moved it,\nI could have chosen move.\n\n336\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.147\nWhen you invoke workstation,\n\n337\n00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:18.622\nif you just copy something you'll have\ntwo machines with the same unique ID.\n\n338\n00:17:18.622 --> 00:17:21.318\nAnd if you try to use them both at\nthe same time you're gonna get a problem.\n\n339\n00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:24.700\nSo by cops telling it you copied it,\nit'll generate a new ID and\n\n340\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.620\nyou won't get any conflicts.\n\n341\n00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.257\nSo let this boot up and\nwe should be good to go.\n\n342\n00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:32.874\nIt should come up here in just a second.\n\n343\n00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:35.380\n&gt;&gt; While we're waiting on that I\nhave just a quick question for you.\n\n344\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Now that we've done this,\n\n345\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.170\nnow that we have our new VM here.\n\n346\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.133\nDo we need to get persistance or\nis that built in?\n\n347\n00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:46.431\n&gt;&gt; It is built in and\nthat's a great point.\n\n348\n00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:50.714\nWe spent a lot of time the other\nday getting our live thumb drive to\n\n349\n00:17:50.714 --> 00:17:52.310\nsupport persistence.\n\n350\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.038\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we did.\n&gt;&gt; There was a little bit of work involved\n\n351\n00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:54.920\nthere, right?\n\n352\n00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.200\nWell, this is a virtual machine.\n\n353\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.132\nIt's got a virtual hard drive.\n\n354\n00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:59.672\nEverything I'm going to\ndo is going to stay.\n\n355\n00:17:59.672 --> 00:18:04.829\nI mean, I can take snapshots and roll it\nback, which are fantastic, another great\n\n356\n00:18:04.829 --> 00:18:10.003\nfeature of doing it virtually like this\nbut yeah, I had persistence built into it.\n\n357\n00:18:10.003 --> 00:18:10.800\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n358\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.652\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be riding it\nto that virtual hard drive.\n\n359\n00:18:12.652 --> 00:18:16.870\nSo no extra work or\nanything like that to get that set up.\n\n360\n00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.672\nIf I log in, with that default password.\n\n361\n00:18:20.672 --> 00:18:26.440\nIf you go out there and get a VM from\nOffensive Security root is the default log\n\n362\n00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.503\non and toor, root backwards\nT-O-O-R is the default password.\n\n363\n00:18:31.503 --> 00:18:35.112\nNow, obviously we're gonna change\nthat as soon as we get in there.\n\n364\n00:18:35.112 --> 00:18:36.670\nI assure you that.\n\n365\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.191\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy ears.\n\n366\n00:18:37.191 --> 00:18:38.576\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy ears would be a good one to use.\n\n367\n00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:41.470\nBut I'll show you that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n368\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.022\nAnd there you go.\n\n369\n00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:45.160\nThat quick,\ndepending on your download speed.\n\n370\n00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:51.954\nLet's say it takes you five minutes to\ndownload the 3 or 4 gigs that it is.\n\n371\n00:18:51.954 --> 00:18:53.330\nI think it was 3 or 4 gigs.\n\n372\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.180\nLet's check that.\n\n373\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:01.391\nWe go back out to VMs,\nyeah 2.1 gigs roughly, right around there.\n\n374\n00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:04.000\nIt takes you a couple\nof minutes to download,\n\n375\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.484\n30 seconds to a minute to extract it out.\n\n376\n00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:10.624\nYou double click on it and\nwithin 15 minutes you've\n\n377\n00:19:10.624 --> 00:19:15.230\ngot an install of kinda Linux up and\nrunning and ready to go.\n\n378\n00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.434\nIf you need another one, if I goofed this\none up, all I've gotta do is extract that\n\n379\n00:19:18.434 --> 00:19:21.930\nout again, double-click on it, and I've\ngot another virtual machine sitting there.\n\n380\n00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.370\n&gt;&gt; And certainly you can delete\nthis virtual machine as well.\n\n381\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.600\nI mean you can get rid of it totally.\n\n382\n00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n383\n00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:28.698\nIn fact let's go.\n\n384\n00:19:28.698 --> 00:19:32.010\nThat'll depend again a little bit\non your virtualization software.\n\n385\n00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.910\nBut if I did not want this machine anymore\nI can simply remove it from my console.\n\n386\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.273\nSomewhere here's the option to remove.\n\n387\n00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:44.120\nIt's running, so it's like gonna\nlet me remove this grade out.\n\n388\n00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.418\nI would just choose remove and\nthen we're good delete the files, right?\n\n389\n00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:47.399\n&gt;&gt; Bing, bing, bing.\n\n390\n00:19:47.399 --> 00:19:51.253\n&gt;&gt; And that's exactly what I would do\nif I was using this as a throw away or\n\n391\n00:19:51.253 --> 00:19:52.875\nI brought up a second.\n\n392\n00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:56.435\nBecause you can see, well you can\nprobably see from my list here.\n\n393\n00:19:56.435 --> 00:19:58.135\nThere is, how many Kali Linux do I have?\n\n394\n00:19:58.135 --> 00:19:59.950\nLet me zoom back out, zoom in.\n\n395\n00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:06.340\nThere's one, there's two, there's three,\nthere's four, there's five, there's six.\n\n396\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.296\nSo I have extracted it out several times,\n[LAUGH].\n\n397\n00:20:09.296 --> 00:20:09.806\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:13.822\n&gt;&gt; And several different,\nI can't zoom back out, come one zoom.\n\n399\n00:20:13.822 --> 00:20:18.607\nYeah, I have extracted out several times\nand I just kep reusing it over and\n\n400\n00:20:18.607 --> 00:20:20.007\nover and over again.\n\n401\n00:20:20.007 --> 00:20:23.461\nNow at some point I might go out and\nget a newer version because\n\n402\n00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:26.935\nthey might have rolled in some\nnew updates into their build.\n\n403\n00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:29.521\nBut it's easy enough to\njust update it from here,\n\n404\n00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.060\nwhich I'll show you in\na future episode as well.\n\n405\n00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:37.210\nSo hopefully that gives you an idea\nof really how easy it is to\n\n406\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:42.110\nget an instance of Kali Linux up and\nrunning on your system.\n\n407\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:47.013\nPick your virtualization platform, go\nwith something free, go out to kali.org,\n\n408\n00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:52.780\ndownload a pre-built virtual machine\nfrom Offensive Security, fire it up.\n\n409\n00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.840\nAnd you're good to go.\n\n410\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.180\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great job, Mike.\n\n411\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.150\nThank you so very much.\n\n412\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.810\nKali virtual machine images,\nas we continue on with Kali Linux and\n\n413\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.280\ndon't forget, there's a lot of\nvideo content in this series.\n\n414\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.840\nCheck out all the videos,\nyou're gonna be very glad that you did.\n\n415\n00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.036\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n416\n00:21:09.036 --> 00:21:12.340\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n417\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.210\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n418\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.970\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:11.961\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.068\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:15.963\nwhere we help you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.963 --> 00:00:19.290\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Kali Linux.\n\n7\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.990\nIn this episode we are going to be looking\nat post installation configurations.\n\n8\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.640\nWho's bringing us\nthe information that we need?\n\n9\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.419\nNot me, no.\n\n10\n00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.918\nMike Rodrick, right over here,\nhe's got the answers.\n\n11\n00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Don't let him fool you, he knows all\nof this stuff too, he's just teasing.\n\n12\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.210\nBut yes, thanks Zach for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.709\nThanks for you guys being here.\n\n14\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.560\nIn our previous episode we looked\nat different ways we could\n\n15\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.740\nobtain Kali Linux and\ninstall and run Kali Linux.\n\n16\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.279\nWhether we're running it live off of\na thumb drive or with persistence,\n\n17\n00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:52.794\nwith encrypted persistence.\n\n18\n00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:54.013\nAnd my favorite one,\n\n19\n00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:58.280\nthe virtual image, that we can\ndownload from Offensive Security.\n\n20\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.283\nSo now that we've got Kali running and\nwe're gonna assume that,\n\n21\n00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:04.993\nif you're running it off of a thumb drive,\nwell you're not gonna be doing a lot of\n\n22\n00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:07.356\nconfiguration because\nthere's no persistence.\n\n23\n00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:10.417\nYou put it in, you boot up to it,\nyou use your tools and\n\n24\n00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:15.270\nthen you lose everything as soon as you\nunplug your thumb drive or shut it down.\n\n25\n00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.615\nWe added some persistence\non that one episode,\n\n26\n00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:22.660\nwhich now I could make some configuration\nchanges and they would be persistent.\n\n27\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.830\nSo that would be nice.\n\n28\n00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.180\nAnd in that case,\nthese are some things you want to do.\n\n29\n00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.620\nBut especially if you've installed it\nlocally, either as your daily drive or\n\n30\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.110\nas a dual boot, or like me, if you're\nrunning it in a virtual image with your\n\n31\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.300\nvirtualization software, then there are\nsome things that you're gonna wanna do.\n\n32\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.480\nYou want to make some\nconfiguration changes, one,\n\n33\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.400\nto help secure it, we gotta keep it up\nto date, and make it usable and fun and\n\n34\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.080\nmake it something that\nwe enjoy using everyday.\n\n35\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.750\nAll right, so\nthat's what we're going to do.\n\n36\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.650\nIn the end of the previous episode,\nif you're watching them in order,\n\n37\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.100\nwe had downloaded a virtual\nimage from Offensive Security.\n\n38\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.190\nAnd we are running that now currently, so\nI'm gonna just flip over to my screen and\n\n39\n00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.700\nI'll show you what we typically\ndo to a system like this.\n\n40\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.240\nSo here it is, fresh install.\n\n41\n00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.960\nI am going to log in with\nthat default password toor,\n\n42\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.333\nT-O-O-R, and we're good to go.\n\n43\n00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.700\nAll right,\nthere's my beautiful desktop, again,\n\n44\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.790\nlove the virtual images that makes this so\nmuch easier.\n\n45\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.560\nNow one of the first things\nyou'll really wanna do is\n\n46\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.410\ndepending on your virtualization\nsoftware that you're using,\n\n47\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.120\nis install your virtualization tools,\nin most cases.\n\n48\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.510\nLike if you've installed this from\nthe disk, let's say you downloaded an ISO,\n\n49\n00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.840\nbuild a blank virtual machine, and\ninstalled Kali Linux from that ISO.\n\n50\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360\nThen you're gonna wanna to install\nwhat's called your virtualization tools.\n\n51\n00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.682\nThese are tools that you're\nvirtualization platform uses to allow you\n\n52\n00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:54.140\nto interact with that virtual machine.\n\n53\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.027\nYes, Mike?\n\n54\n00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:58.266\n&gt;&gt; Well just real quick,\nwhen you've done that download,\n\n55\n00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.848\ndoes it not come with tools like\npre-installed, a few right.\n\n56\n00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:02.921\n&gt;&gt; Some, yes.\n\n57\n00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.029\nAnd let's make sure we understand\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n58\n00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:10.680\nNow I'm not talking about tools like Nmap\nor Metasploit, or anything like that.\n\n59\n00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.140\nThose tools yes, are all in there, but\nwhat you use to interact with that virtual\n\n60\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.870\nmachine, those you'll have to add if\nyou're installing it from the ISO.\n\n61\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.085\nBecause the ISO is planning on you\ninstalling it on actual hardware or\n\n62\n00:03:24.085 --> 00:03:28.590\nin a virtual machine and then, again,\nyou install your Hyper-V tools,\n\n63\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.041\nyou install your VMware tools,\nyou install your VirtualBox add-ons.\n\n64\n00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.073\nAnd what that allows it to do is to take\nyour mouse input and take your keyboard\n\n65\n00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:41.660\ninput away from your physical machine and\ndirect it into the virtual machine.\n\n66\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.640\nAnd there's other things that these\ntools will allow you to do as well like,\n\n67\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.150\nshare folders.\n\n68\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.807\nI love being able to go to my\nphysical machine download things,\n\n69\n00:03:50.807 --> 00:03:53.504\nscan them with my AV,\ndo whatever I need to do.\n\n70\n00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.918\nAnd then put them in a location,\ngo to my virtual machine and\n\n71\n00:03:56.918 --> 00:04:01.358\nI can access that location on my Windows\nhard drive and copy those files over or\n\n72\n00:04:01.358 --> 00:04:03.590\nwhatever it is that I'm doing.\n\n73\n00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.949\nSo the ability to do that kind of thing\nis a lot of times dependant on the tools.\n\n74\n00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.657\nNow, that being said, when you\ndownload the actual virtual image like\n\n75\n00:04:11.657 --> 00:04:14.561\nI've done here, we don't have to do that,\n\n76\n00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.110\nbecause Offensive Security\ntook care of that for us.\n\n77\n00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.430\nThey've actually got a custom set of\nvirtualization tools built into the image.\n\n78\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.940\nThat's why they have different ones,\nformat for one, but also for these tools.\n\n79\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.350\nWhen you download\nthe VMWare virtual machine,\n\n80\n00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.650\nit's got the VMWare tools in there.\n\n81\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.870\nWhen you download the one for\nVirtualBox, they've already added their\n\n82\n00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.156\nown custom VirtualBox add-ins to allow\nyou to interact to that machine.\n\n83\n00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.470\nSo another advantage of downloading their\nimage is the fact that you don't have to\n\n84\n00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.439\ndo any of that, right?\n\n85\n00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.987\nIt's all there.\n\n86\n00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:50.748\nIn fact, if you try, it'll usually tell\nyou when you go to VM workstation, for\n\n87\n00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:54.516\nexample, if I go in and\ntry to install the normal VM workstation\n\n88\n00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:57.784\nvirtualization tools,\nit's gonna tell me hey look,\n\n89\n00:04:57.784 --> 00:05:03.150\nthere's already some open source custom\nvirtualization tools installed there.\n\n90\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.262\nAre you sure you wanna replace them?\n\n91\n00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:08.334\nUsually you're better off going with those\ntools that were prepared by the company\n\n92\n00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:09.799\nthat made the virtual image.\n\n93\n00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:10.627\n&gt;&gt; Bingo!\n\n94\n00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:12.810\n&gt;&gt; In that case,\nI don't bother switching them out.\n\n95\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.170\nBut if I had installed this from an ISO,\n\n96\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.750\nthat would definitely be one of\nthe first things I would do.\n\n97\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.120\nCuz if you don't,\nthings that'll happen is,\n\n98\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.930\nyou click on the desktop\nof your virtual machine.\n\n99\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.790\nAnd now your mouse is captured, and\n\n100\n00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.610\nyou can't move it outside\nyour virtual machine.\n\n101\n00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.960\nSo if you wanted to go back\ndown to your Windows menu or\n\n102\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.770\nto another virtual machine, you have\nto do a keyboard combination to release\n\n103\n00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.100\nthe mouse from the virtual machine and\ngive it back to the physical machine.\n\n104\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.300\nThat's a pain in the butt.\n\n105\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.737\n&gt;&gt; And\nit sounds like the great title of a movie.\n\n106\n00:05:40.737 --> 00:05:41.800\nRelease the Mouse, I like it.\n\n107\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So with these tools, you don't\nhave to do any of that and so it's great.\n\n108\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.050\nSo anyway,\nmy point of this long ramble was,\n\n109\n00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.058\ndepending on how you install it that might\nbe one of the first things you do is,\n\n110\n00:05:53.058 --> 00:05:58.210\nadd those add-ins to make it easier just\nto work with the virtual machine itself.\n\n111\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.670\nIt my case, they're already there.\n\n112\n00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.370\nI will show you,\nif we take a look at my screen here.\n\n113\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.021\nIf this was not a pre-built and\nI had installed Kali from an ISO,\n\n114\n00:06:07.021 --> 00:06:11.241\nthe next thing I'd do is go up\nto in VM Workstation anyway,\n\n115\n00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:16.100\nyou go up to your menu, and\nyou would choose install VMware tools.\n\n116\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.475\nAnd that would add those tools specific to\nthis particular virtualization platform.\n\n117\n00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:23.510\nHyper-V is gonna be a little bit different\nfrom how you install their add-ons,\n\n118\n00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.470\nVirtual Box, a little bit different, but\n\n119\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.130\nthe same general concept, find it in\nyour menu and install those tools.\n\n120\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.880\nNotice mine says update.\n\n121\n00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.125\nIt actually sees that my virtual\nmachine already has tools,\n\n122\n00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.850\nthanks to Offensive Security.\n\n123\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.473\nAnd it gives me the option to update,\nbut again if I go through\n\n124\n00:06:38.473 --> 00:06:41.612\nthe process it'll just tell me, hey,\nyou really don't wanna do this,\n\n125\n00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:43.941\nyou should stick with the ones\nthat they put in there.\n\n126\n00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.135\nSo I'm not gonna do that in this show\nbecause, again, I don't have to.\n\n127\n00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:50.361\nNow let's zoom back out\nif I can see [CROSSTALK].\n\n128\n00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:51.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If it ain't broke don't fix it.\n\n129\n00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:53.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n130\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720\nSo next thing we would do then,\n\n131\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.980\njust like any other operating system that\nyou install, you want to get it updated.\n\n132\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.120\nWhen was that image created?\n\n133\n00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.220\nA week ago, a month ago, six months ago.\n\n134\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.750\nThere's been updates since then.\n\n135\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.750\nCritical updates, security updates.\n\n136\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.411\nUpdates to programs and\npackages that I need to get.\n\n137\n00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:18.310\nAnd that's always going to be one of the\nfirst things you do is get your updates.\n\n138\n00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.213\nSo in our Linux box here,\nagain, Kali comes,\n\n139\n00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:26.201\nOffensive Security's got preconfigured\nto reach out to their repositories,\n\n140\n00:07:26.201 --> 00:07:30.010\nwith their signed packages,\nand I don't ever change that.\n\n141\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.910\nYou can, you can add additional\nrepositories and download and\n\n142\n00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.690\ninstall programs that\nthey weren't planning or\n\n143\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.210\nthat you wanna add that aren't\npart of this normal distribution.\n\n144\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.318\nBut they'll tell you that you can end up\nreducing the security of your machine by\n\n145\n00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:45.003\ndoing that.\n\n146\n00:07:45.003 --> 00:07:48.577\nThat's your call, if you feel that\nthere is a program out there that\n\n147\n00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:52.153\nis absolutely necessary that you\nwant to get and it's not available\n\n148\n00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:55.555\nthrough the normal repositories for\nKali by all means add that.\n\n149\n00:07:55.555 --> 00:07:59.623\nBut we're gonna stick with what\noffensive security recommends and\n\n150\n00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:03.772\nthat is just to Use their repositories\nthat are already configured.\n\n151\n00:08:03.772 --> 00:08:09.481\nSo, the command then, let me bump up\nthat command prompt a wee bit and\n\n152\n00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:11.530\nsee what we can do here.\n\n153\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.960\nSo, I'm gonna try to maximize.\n\n154\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.260\nLet me see if I can get this guy\nto stretch out, there it goes.\n\n155\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.210\nAgain, great thing about their image.\n\n156\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.130\nAll my video drivers, all of that.\n\n157\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.240\nNormally this wouldn't stretch.\n\n158\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.360\nIf I had just installed it from the ISO,\nI'd get the four by three and\n\n159\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.100\nI'd have to go install drivers for\nvideos and things like that, so.\n\n160\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.350\n&gt;&gt; Does Zoomid work on this?\n\n161\n00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.750\n&gt;&gt; It does not.\nZoomid is a Windows thing, so.\n\n162\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n&gt;&gt; There are ways around that.\n\n163\n00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.020\nThere is a Zoom Accessibility\noption in Linux,\n\n164\n00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.410\nit wreaks havoc with my tools, though.\n\n165\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.950\nAs soon as I turn on the zoom feature, I\ncan't release the mouse automatically, and\n\n166\n00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.625\nI start having to do that keyboard\nshortcut again, which I absolutely hate.\n\n167\n00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:52.850\n[LAUGH] But I will zoom in\nwhen necessary if I need to.\n\n168\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.073\nAll right, so to do our updates,\nwe're gonna do apt-get, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:01.100\nApt-get Update and I'll hit Enter, and\n\n170\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.230\nI'll let it run and\nwe'll talk about it while it's going.\n\n171\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.730\nComing from a Windows world like me,\nyou might think, there he goes,\n\n172\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.610\nhe's doing his updates.\n\n173\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.030\nJust like going out Windows Update and\ngetting updates.\n\n174\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.615\nYou would be incorrect.\n\n175\n00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:15.570\n[LAUGH] If you think\nthat's what's happening.\n\n176\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.620\nI know I was incorrect the first\ntime I played around with this.\n\n177\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.420\nIt's not updating the software or\nanything like that.\n\n178\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.410\nWhat it's actually doing\nis updating your catalogs.\n\n179\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.010\nIt's reaching out to the repositories and\n\n180\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.050\nit's checking to see what is the latest\nversion of all these packages.\n\n181\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.780\nIf there's new dependencies or\nanything like that.\n\n182\n00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.810\nSo it's updating its catalog\nof what's available.\n\n183\n00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.900\nSo before you actually go get the updates,\n\n184\n00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.220\nyou wanna make sure that\nyou update your catalog.\n\n185\n00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.030\nBecause if your catalog's out of date,\nwhen it goes and reaches out for\n\n186\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.940\nthe update it's gonna\nbe betting older stuff.\n\n187\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.980\nIt doesn't know about the new stuff yet.\n\n188\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.130\nSo before you do an upgrade or\na just upgrade, which we're gonna do next.\n\n189\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.380\nYou wanna make sure you\nupdate your catalog.\n\n190\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.640\nBasically saying, hey,\ngo see what the latest and\n\n191\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.080\ngreatest stuff is that's available in\nthe repository and make a note of it.\n\n192\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.760\nAnd that's what it is.\n\n193\n00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.805\nYou can see if we look here,\nit's reaching out to\n\n194\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:13.400\narchive.Linux.duke.edu/KaliLinux rolling\nin release, yadda, yadda, yadda.\n\n195\n00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.744\nAnd so then you can see like amd64\npackages, and it's reaching out.\n\n196\n00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:21.793\nIt says okay, this is what I'm running,\nwhat packages are available?\n\n197\n00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:24.324\nLet me download that list and\nupdate my catalog.\n\n198\n00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:28.211\nAnd then the last line there,\nreading package lists, done.\n\n199\n00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.713\nSo now we're good to go as\nfar as our catalog goes.\n\n200\n00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:35.181\nIt now is aware of all the latest versions\nof all the different packages that we have\n\n201\n00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:36.610\ninstalled.\n\n202\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.190\nNow the next command you're gonna run,\nyou could actually do one or\n\n203\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.870\nthe other or even both I suppose.\n\n204\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.490\nLet me clear this up a little bit.\n\n205\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.816\nYou could do app-get.upgrade,\nor you can do app-get,\n\n206\n00:10:53.816 --> 00:11:00.950\nif I can get my cursor in the right spot,\na dis-upgrade right.\n\n207\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.828\nNow they really do the same thing, almost.\n\n208\n00:11:03.828 --> 00:11:06.389\nApp-get.upgrade does reach out and\n\n209\n00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:13.140\nget the packages based on the catalog that\nwe just updated with the app-date.update.\n\n210\n00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.360\nSo it'll go out, and\nit'll get the new packages, and\n\n211\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.330\nit'll bring them down, and install them.\n\n212\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.096\nWhat app-get.upgrade doesn't do,\n\n213\n00:11:21.096 --> 00:11:26.010\nis it doesn't pay attention\nto the dependencies.\n\n214\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.092\nWhereas,apt-get dist-upgrade also\nlooks at any changing dependencies,\n\n215\n00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:34.172\nlike this new libraries\nthat this new package.\n\n216\n00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:38.958\nMaybe they've upgraded a package and\nthey.ve added an additional dependency,\n\n217\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.857\na new library that's out that\nthey're making part of their code.\n\n218\n00:11:42.857 --> 00:11:47.982\nSo apt-get dist-upgrade does\nthe of the packages as well as\n\n219\n00:11:47.982 --> 00:11:53.918\nthe updating of any dependencies\nthat those new packages might have.\n\n220\n00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:56.777\nSo it's a much smarter upgrade, so\n\n221\n00:11:56.777 --> 00:12:01.557\nthat's what I'm going to do,\nwe'll do a dist-upgrade.\n\n222\n00:12:01.557 --> 00:12:05.580\nNow this will take a little while because\nnow we're not just updating the catalog,\n\n223\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.560\nwe're actually reaching out and looking\nfor new packages and downloading them.\n\n224\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.830\nSo I'll go and start it up and\nit's gonna rifle through, and\n\n225\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.621\nwhat it's doing here,\nlet's blow this up a wee bit.\n\n226\n00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:22.170\nWhat you can see here is this is\nbasically the results of the catalog.\n\n227\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.260\nIt's saying calculating upgrade, done.\n\n228\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.560\nThe following packages were automatically\ninstalled and are no longer required.\n\n229\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.900\nSo I'm gonna use\napt-autoremove to remove them.\n\n230\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.840\nIt's letting me know I've got some\nold packages that I can get rid of,\n\n231\n00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.370\nI don't need anymore.\n\n232\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.790\nThey're just taking up disk space.\n\n233\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.340\nAll right, the following new\npackages will be installed, and\n\n234\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.390\nthen it list all of those.\n\n235\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.370\nThe following packages will be upgraded,\nthen it lists all of those.\n\n236\n00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.971\nSo it's telling me what\nit's getting ready to do.\n\n237\n00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:56.951\nAnd you can see,\nthere's quite a few, all right.\n\n238\n00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:00.827\nAnd again, that's all based on the fact\nthat this image by Offensive Security was\n\n239\n00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.007\ncreated some time ago and\n\n240\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:05.283\nmade available on their site back\ntowards the beginning of the year.\n\n241\n00:13:05.283 --> 00:13:10.300\nThis is 2017.1, if I remember right,\nthis particular version.\n\n242\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.578\nThere's been a few updates that have\nbeen released in the last six months.\n\n243\n00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:18.708\nNow eventually, they'll release\nan updated VM, and I won't have as\n\n244\n00:13:18.708 --> 00:13:23.328\nmany updates to get, but this is a matter\nof, it was just released yesterday.\n\n245\n00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:26.480\nI'm always gonna check and\nsee if there's updates available.\n\n246\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.820\nSo it tells me that it's gonna need\nan additional 479 megabytes of\n\n247\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.020\nadditional disk space,\ndo I want to continue?\n\n248\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.292\nAnd I'm gonna say Y for yes.\n\n249\n00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:39.968\nYou see the default is the capital\nletter there, so if I just hit Enter,\n\n250\n00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:42.150\nit'll do whatever the default is.\n\n251\n00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:47.790\nBut I'm gonna put an Y and hit Enter and\nnow it's going to begin the process.\n\n252\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.660\nThis will continue for some time so\n\n253\n00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.530\nwe'll let this run and\nthrough the magic of TV will come back,\n\n254\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.880\nprobably not when it's finished because at\nsome point, it's gonna ask me a question.\n\n255\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.470\nAnd I wanna sho you those as well so\n\n256\n00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.190\nyou're not confused or\nwonder what the heck's going on.\n\n257\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.310\nWhy didn't that do it when Mike did it?\n\n258\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.080\nSo we'll come back as soon as it prompts\nme for some additional information.\n\n259\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.170\nAll right, so there we go, this guy\nI wanna say is just about finished.\n\n260\n00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.450\nBut notice it's stopped,\nit's not scrolling anymore.\n\n261\n00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.120\nIf you look down at my bottom left hand\ncorner there, you'll see my cursor.\n\n262\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.360\nI've got this colon in that cursor and\n\n263\n00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.880\nbasically this is just like if you've\nhad pull up a man page, right?\n\n264\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.850\nIt's my app list changes, news and it's\nshowing me a lot of the different things\n\n265\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:38.020\nthat it updated and this list,\nit's not that long I guess.\n\n266\n00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.710\nAnd when I get to the very bottom\nit does tell you what to do.\n\n267\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.570\nBut I've seen people get kinda stuck\nright here, scared to touch anything,\n\n268\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.690\nnot sure what it's doing.\n\n269\n00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.670\nIs it still updating?\n\n270\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.150\nIs it doing something?\n\n271\n00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.280\nI don't wanna CTRL+C or Q or get out\nof it if I'm gonna break something.\n\n272\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.650\nAnd this is just a page of notes showing\nyou some of the things that it's updated.\n\n273\n00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:03.841\nSo you can hit Q to quit and\nit'll jump right back into the updates.\n\n274\n00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:06.280\nSometimes, depending on\nwhat's being updated,\n\n275\n00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.352\nI've seen that pop up more than\nonce where I've had, okay, Q.\n\n276\n00:15:09.352 --> 00:15:11.860\nI'm done reading that man page,\nkeep on going.\n\n277\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.490\nHere's another thing that's popped up.\n\n278\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.540\nDump cap can be installed in a way that\nallows members of the Wireshark system\n\n279\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.570\ngroup to capture packets,\nrecommended over the alternative\n\n280\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.235\nof running Wireshark\ntshark directly as route.\n\n281\n00:15:23.235 --> 00:15:28.710\nShould non-superusers be\nable to capture packets?\n\n282\n00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.600\nSomething that you're\ngonna have to decide.\n\n283\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.760\nI'm gonna say no,\nI want you to have to be at root to do it.\n\n284\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.570\nThat's just me, all right.\n\n285\n00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.449\nAnd that's primarily because I\nalmost always log on as root.\n\n286\n00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:44.140\nI know it's probably not a best practice,\nbut again, this isn't my daily driver.\n\n287\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.080\nI pull it up and open it, and\nI use tools and I do things.\n\n288\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.773\nAnd just about everything is gonna\nneed root, so I log in as root.\n\n289\n00:15:51.773 --> 00:15:55.555\nI know I should be pseudoing\na lot of that stuff but\n\n290\n00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:59.982\nagain I'm not surfing the internet or\nopening up email Or\n\n291\n00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:03.594\nanything like that when\nI'm in my Kali Linux.\n\n292\n00:16:03.594 --> 00:16:05.278\nAll right, so\nthat's gonna keep on rolling,\n\n293\n00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:07.060\nI guess it was not as close\nto the end as I thought.\n\n294\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.728\nSo we'll take another quick break and\nas soon as it finishes, we will be back.\n\n295\n00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:15.904\nAll right, so there we go,\nit has finished, took probably about five,\n\n296\n00:16:15.904 --> 00:16:17.141\neight minutes or so.\n\n297\n00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:21.842\nAgain, it'll depend on your connection\nspeed and how out of date it is, etc, etc.\n\n298\n00:16:21.842 --> 00:16:24.750\nSo there we go, we are done.\n\n299\n00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:29.469\nSo I think what I'll do now is do\na little shut down with a restart now.\n\n300\n00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:31.984\nAnd I'm probably have to\npseudo that aren't I?\n\n301\n00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:34.078\nLet see if it let's me do it.\n\n302\n00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:37.018\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n303\n00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Because you are running as root, right?\n\n304\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am as root,\nso I have permissions.\n\n305\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.810\nBut sometimes, some of those\ncommands you still have to pseudo.\n\n306\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.940\nAnd, there you go, reboot.\n\n307\n00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.049\nAnyway, it didn't tell me to.\n\n308\n00:16:50.049 --> 00:16:53.201\nI did see one or\ntwo lines in there that were saying, hey,\n\n309\n00:16:53.201 --> 00:16:57.142\nReboot when you get a chance and\nI will update this package type thing but\n\n310\n00:16:57.142 --> 00:17:02.560\nthere wasn't anything that was saying you\nmust reboot after this update is finished.\n\n311\n00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.321\nJust have it.\n\n312\n00:17:03.321 --> 00:17:05.848\nI like saying all right\nwe've sold a bunch of stuff,\n\n313\n00:17:05.848 --> 00:17:07.520\nwe have removed a bunch of a stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.357\nLet's reboot the system and\nkinda flash out the caches and\n\n315\n00:17:11.357 --> 00:17:16.611\naccess anything that might have been\nlocked and used that was trying to update.\n\n316\n00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:20.810\nLet it take care of all that good stuff,\nand we come back and we log back in.\n\n317\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.752\nSo log back in as root,\nand what did I say?\n\n318\n00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.733\nWe had tour for my password.\n\n319\n00:17:25.733 --> 00:17:26.391\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd\n\n320\n00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:29.856\nI was going to ask you something about\nthat because you mentioned this earlier\n\n321\n00:17:29.856 --> 00:17:33.700\nabout changing your password, is this now\nwhen you want to change your password?\n\n322\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.262\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n323\n00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:35.199\n&gt;&gt; The root password as well?\n\n324\n00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:36.703\n&gt;&gt; Yup, absolutely.\n\n325\n00:17:36.703 --> 00:17:39.680\nIn fact at this point,\nthe only account on here is root.\n\n326\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.720\nYou notice it is set auto log, no I'm\nsorry it was not, some of the live ones\n\n327\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.920\nwill auto log in this image from offensive\nsecurity is not set to auto login but\n\n328\n00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.762\nroot is the account, and\nagain there's reason for that, right.\n\n329\n00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:59.280\nWe know if we've watched any of our\nother Linux classes, beginner Linux,\n\n330\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.020\nsuper user all that stuff that we've got\nin there, we don't like to log on as root.\n\n331\n00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.490\nIt's like logging on as the domain\nadmin in a windows environment.\n\n332\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:10.600\nI'd much rather do a run as it's\na much more secure- practice.\n\n333\n00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.751\nBut Kali's a little bit different,\nit's not your normal daily driver,\n\n334\n00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:19.653\nthis is a tool that just about\neverything that you run and\n\n335\n00:18:19.653 --> 00:18:23.662\ndo inside Kali is gonna require\nthose root permissions.\n\n336\n00:18:23.662 --> 00:18:26.920\nAnd like I said earlier,\nyou're not serving the Internet.\n\n337\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.103\nYou're not checking email.\n\n338\n00:18:28.103 --> 00:18:31.391\nSo there's no chance of you\nclicking on a malicious link and\n\n339\n00:18:31.391 --> 00:18:35.030\nit running malware as route with\nvery little chance I should say.\n\n340\n00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.530\nSo that's why like I\nsaid I log in as root.\n\n341\n00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.875\nBut we definitely wanna\nchange the password because\n\n342\n00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:44.445\nit is the default password and\neverybody knows that.\n\n343\n00:18:44.445 --> 00:18:45.735\nI can go out to offensive security.\n\n344\n00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:46.885\nIn fact, we could.\n\n345\n00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:49.025\nLet's see how long it would take somebody.\n\n346\n00:18:49.025 --> 00:18:55.205\nIf I go to my browser and\nI say default password,\n\n347\n00:18:55.205 --> 00:18:59.842\nKali Linux there it is right there,\n\n348\n00:18:59.842 --> 00:19:04.970\nI know you have to click on the link.\n\n349\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:11.512\nAll right, so yes this is done very\nsecure if you're going to leave that.\n\n350\n00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:14.692\nI don't know I give up for it coz I wanna\nsay I but then again this is in your\n\n351\n00:19:14.692 --> 00:19:17.395\ndesktop that's seating there\nthat people are walking by and\n\n352\n00:19:17.395 --> 00:19:19.160\nlogin to it's a virtual machine-\n&gt;&gt; It's VM.\n\n353\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.170\n&gt;&gt; That you start off when necessary.\n\n354\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.887\nBut yes, best practice just get in\nthe habit of always changing any default\n\n355\n00:19:25.887 --> 00:19:29.199\npasswords no matter what operating\nsystem or what you're doing.\n\n356\n00:19:29.199 --> 00:19:30.520\n&gt;&gt; Better be safe than sorry.\n\n357\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nthen back to answer you question.\n\n358\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.090\nAre we gonna change the password?\n\n359\n00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.815\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes we are.\n\n360\n00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:37.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it is what we do.\n\n361\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.022\nSo I'm gonna open up a show.\n\n362\n00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:45.271\nAnd I'm gonna bump that font size up for\nyou a little bit so that you may see and\n\n363\n00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:51.050\nI'm gonna type in passwd and it's gonna\nsay enter your new Unix password.\n\n364\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.550\nAnd I will enter in my super\nsecret password twice,\n\n365\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:00.070\nmaking sure that I know what it is, and\nit can type it two times successfully.\n\n366\n00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.120\nAnd now my password has changed,\nand we're good to go there.\n\n367\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.612\nSo we're already a little bit\nmore secure than we were.\n\n368\n00:20:05.612 --> 00:20:09.889\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good.\nNow can you add a non root user password,\n\n369\n00:20:09.889 --> 00:20:11.955\nor do you want to?\n\n370\n00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:13.809\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\nthat's something that you can do.\n\n371\n00:20:13.809 --> 00:20:15.477\nIf you want to follow best practice, and\n\n372\n00:20:15.477 --> 00:20:17.600\nyou don't want to be logged\nin as root all the time.\n\n373\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.000\nIf you are using this as a daily\ndriver to surf the Internet or\n\n374\n00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.790\ncheck email, then you definitely\nwanna add a non-root user, all right?\n\n375\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.880\nSo let's see how we would go on\nabout adding an additional user.\n\n376\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.486\nUser add is going to be the command.\n\n377\n00:20:35.486 --> 00:20:36.650\nIn fact, let's do this.\n\n378\n00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.070\nLet's say, man user add.\n\n379\n00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.765\nAnd see what kinda fun stuff we get there.\n\n380\n00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:45.220\nAll right, so\nthis is telling me about the command.\n\n381\n00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.927\nUser add is what I'm gonna do to create\na new user and then your options and\n\n382\n00:20:49.927 --> 00:20:53.338\nthen the name that you wanna\ngive them to login with.\n\n383\n00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:58.160\nReally, for the most part,\nI don't use a lot of these options.\n\n384\n00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.810\nIt depends on what you're going\nto be doing with that account.\n\n385\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.360\nThe only thing I would say\nto set would be the M,\n\n386\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.290\nwhich is the made directories,\nor create home, I should say.\n\n387\n00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.640\nI use this little m right here.\n\n388\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.480\nThe capital M, no create home.\n\n389\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.132\nSo it wouldn't create the home directory.\n\n390\n00:21:16.132 --> 00:21:21.696\nThe other thing I might do is add\nthis user to the pseudo group so\n\n391\n00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:26.629\nthat I can be logged on as\nthis user running as non root.\n\n392\n00:21:26.629 --> 00:21:31.023\nBut then when I need it to run\na command that required root,\n\n393\n00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:35.340\nI could still do my pseudo and\nget that root level access.\n\n394\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.685\nIt should be a capital G in here\nsomewhere for groups, there we go.\n\n395\n00:21:39.685 --> 00:21:45.018\nCapital G for Groups,\nand then -s for shell.\n\n396\n00:21:45.018 --> 00:21:49.668\nAnd you can set that shell to what\ntheir default shell is going to be,\n\n397\n00:21:49.668 --> 00:21:51.885\na new user's login shell.\n\n398\n00:21:51.885 --> 00:21:56.981\nNow a lot of this can be pulled\nfrom there's a config file in\n\n399\n00:21:56.981 --> 00:22:01.873\nhere that when you add your\nusers of what it's gonna do.\n\n400\n00:22:01.873 --> 00:22:05.580\nI am gonna go ahead and specify all\nof this in my command so I'll quit.\n\n401\n00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.103\nJust a q to get out of that main page,\n\n402\n00:22:09.103 --> 00:22:13.683\nthen I'm gonna do user add,\nlet's do a -m and\n\n403\n00:22:13.683 --> 00:22:17.876\na -G I add myself to the psuedoers\n&gt;&gt; Psuedoers.\n\n404\n00:22:17.876 --> 00:22:23.691\n&gt;&gt; Yep -s/bin/bash to make\nbash my default shell and\n\n405\n00:22:23.691 --> 00:22:27.929\nthen I'll give it a username of Mike.\n\n406\n00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:30.491\nI'll hit Enter and that's it, right?\n\n407\n00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:31.440\nSort of.\n\n408\n00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.398\n&gt;&gt; Sort of?\n\n409\n00:22:32.398 --> 00:22:36.163\n&gt;&gt; Sort of because notice what we\ndidn't do, we didn't set a password for\n\n410\n00:22:36.163 --> 00:22:37.769\nthis account\n&gt;&gt; Nope\n\n411\n00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:39.416\n&gt;&gt; So that's a separate command that\n\n412\n00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:42.319\nwe have to do that we did it just\na minute ago we did the passwd.\n\n413\n00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.812\nBut if I do just passwd,\n\n414\n00:22:43.812 --> 00:22:47.866\nit's changing the password of\nwho I'm currently logged in as.\n\n415\n00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:53.094\nBut if I do passwd Mike now it's gonna\nallow me to set the password for\n\n416\n00:22:53.094 --> 00:22:54.299\nthat account.\n\n417\n00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:59.885\nSo I will set that account type\nit in a couple of times and\n\n418\n00:22:59.885 --> 00:23:03.420\npassword updated successfully.\n\n419\n00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:11.800\nAll right, so let's do this, let's log\noff That's not what I wanted to do.\n\n420\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.230\nCancel that, let me log out.\n\n421\n00:23:17.921 --> 00:23:23.742\nAnd we just test our new account or use my\nuser name Mike, my super secret password.\n\n422\n00:23:23.742 --> 00:23:27.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.789\n&gt;&gt; It's Mountain Dew, we know that.\n\n424\n00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:31.954\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Shh, don't tell everybody.\n\n425\n00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:35.160\nAll right and there we go.\n\n426\n00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.888\nI am now logged on as Mike.\n\n427\n00:23:36.888 --> 00:23:44.820\nIf I open up my terminal, there we can see\nmy bash shell, who am I shows me as Mike.\n\n428\n00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.530\nI'll bump that up so you guys can.\n\n429\n00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.110\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n430\n00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.800\n&gt;&gt; I'll bump that up, so there we go.\n\n431\n00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.391\nMike is now set.\n\n432\n00:23:52.391 --> 00:23:55.202\nWhat I should have done,\nI could also show you.\n\n433\n00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.312\nWell here,\nwe'll even use the graphical interface.\n\n434\n00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:02.959\nWe'll go over here, and\nwe'll take a look at the computer itself.\n\n435\n00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:07.088\nAnd I should see, where we at here?\n\n436\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.915\nYeah, there's my home directory Mike\nwith all of my stuff inside there.\n\n437\n00:24:12.915 --> 00:24:15.429\nAnd that's again,\nbecause of that lower case m.\n\n438\n00:24:15.429 --> 00:24:17.840\nTry to make of my home directories.\n\n439\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.765\nSo I'm going to switch back out,\nI could just say log on as Mike.\n\n440\n00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:25.840\nI guess it wouldn't hurt anything,\nI'm in that pseudo-account.\n\n441\n00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.000\nBut I'm gonna logout and log back in as.\n\n442\n00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.480\nAll right, so some other things\nthat you might want to do.\n\n443\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.860\nI know we've got a couple\nminutes left here.\n\n444\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.050\nAgain, we're not really talking\nabout configuring tools or\n\n445\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.850\nsetting up databases, or\nanything like that just yet.\n\n446\n00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:49.050\nBut a couple of other just interface\noptions that you might want to do.\n\n447\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.390\nWhat did I say?\n\n448\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.440\nYeah, the sidebar.\n\n449\n00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.540\nThis guy over here, let me open up\na browser, see if I can show you.\n\n450\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.345\nThis is their little,\nI forget the name that they call that guy.\n\n451\n00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:05.010\nNotice how when I maximize\nmy window it goes away.\n\n452\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.170\nI minimize, it comes back.\n\n453\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.450\nI think if I move this over it will\ndisappear over there, all right?\n\n454\n00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.700\nIt's auto-hiding that guy, kind of like\nyou can do with your Windows Task bar.\n\n455\n00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.580\nPersonal preference.\n\n456\n00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.590\nWhatever you like, right?\n\n457\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.240\nSome people like that,\nsome people don't like that.\n\n458\n00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.310\nIt annoys the heck out of me.\n\n459\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.660\nEither be there or\ndon't be there, I don't care.\n\n460\n00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.365\nDon't hide.\n\n461\n00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:26.330\n&gt;&gt; Don't play hide and go seek.\n\n462\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't like that.\n\n463\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.310\nAnd that's just me.\n\n464\n00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.450\nSo I'll show you, you can change that\none if we go to this little tweak tool,\n\n465\n00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.300\nwhich is a little gray icon over there.\n\n466\n00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.652\nIf I can get it to launch.\n\n467\n00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:41.769\nThere we go.\n\n468\n00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:44.111\nGot a few different things\nyou can change here.\n\n469\n00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:48.958\nTheme, desktop, icons you want to show,\nlike I don't want to see\n\n470\n00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:53.570\nthose mounted volumes where\nit's mounted my shared folders.\n\n471\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.880\nMaybe I'll go ahead and get rid of that.\n\n472\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.960\nThe one I was actually going to\nshow you here is under extensions.\n\n473\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.920\nThis is that dash to dock,\nthis is this guy right over here.\n\n474\n00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.460\nAnd so you can see it´s turned on.\n\n475\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.550\nI could turn it off all together.\n\n476\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.544\nIf you´re one of those people that doesn't\nlike that, that's too Windows like,\n\n477\n00:26:10.544 --> 00:26:11.490\nI don't want it.\n\n478\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.860\nI want to use my applications menu.\n\n479\n00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.530\nYou could just turn the dash\ndock off completely, all right?\n\n480\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.870\nOr if you like it, but\nyou just want to tweak it a little bit,\n\n481\n00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.620\nyou can click on this little gear icon or\nsplat.\n\n482\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.811\nAnd I'm gonna put mine on the bottom cuz\nlike I said, I come from Windows world.\n\n483\n00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:29.120\nSo it's natural for me to have that.\n\n484\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.508\nThat's where my eyes look for open\napplications and short cuts [CROSSTALK].\n\n485\n00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:34.397\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n\n486\n00:26:34.397 --> 00:26:36.063\n&gt;&gt; So that's where I'll put it, right?\n\n487\n00:26:36.063 --> 00:26:37.190\nSo I'll put it at the bottom.\n\n488\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.411\nIntelligent auto-hide.\n\n489\n00:26:38.411 --> 00:26:42.520\nHide the dock when it obstructs a window\nof the available current application.\n\n490\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.090\nMore refined settings are available.\n\n491\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.250\nSo I can turn it off,\nthe auto-hide, off completely.\n\n492\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.430\nAnd now, it shouldn't hide at all.\n\n493\n00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.288\nSee how things go behind it?\n\n494\n00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:56.103\nI turn that back on, and it hides,\nit gets out of the way, all right?\n\n495\n00:26:56.103 --> 00:26:57.520\nTurn it back off.\n\n496\n00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.290\nThe only thing I would say some people\ndon't like about that is now if you\n\n497\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.910\nmaximize something,\nit doesn't truly maximize.\n\n498\n00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.450\nIt stays on top of that bar,\nit won't go behind it.\n\n499\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.740\nAnd some people really don't like that.\n\n500\n00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.540\nSo, again,\n\n501\n00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.940\nthat's what's great about this, though,\nyou can do whatever you want with it.\n\n502\n00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.655\n&gt;&gt; Cosmetics.\n\n503\n00:27:12.655 --> 00:27:16.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can change the,\nI guess I got it turned off so\n\n504\n00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.310\nI can't click on any of the settings.\n\n505\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.410\nThere's the additional settings.\n\n506\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:22.650\nRequire pressure if you have touch screen.\n\n507\n00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.370\nEnable in full screen mode.\n\n508\n00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.056\nThings like that.\n\n509\n00:27:25.056 --> 00:27:28.449\nSo really I'm not showing you any\nparticular setting, I'm just showing you\n\n510\n00:27:28.449 --> 00:27:30.414\nwhere to kinda of get-\n&gt;&gt; Just some options.\n\n511\n00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:31.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n512\n00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:33.040\nYou can kinda make it your own.\n\n513\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.420\n&gt;&gt; Can you lock the screen, Mike?\n\n514\n00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.740\nCan you-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n515\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.470\nWe can drop that dock\nsize down a little bit.\n\n516\n00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.200\nWe can make those icons\na little bit smaller.\n\n517\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.350\nIf they get in your way,\nyou can drop those down.\n\n518\n00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.678\nSo all kinds of stuff\nyou can configure here.\n\n519\n00:27:46.678 --> 00:27:51.090\nAs well as lots of other stuff.\n\n520\n00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.818\nLots of stuff which you can configure,\nall right?\n\n521\n00:27:54.818 --> 00:27:56.460\nAnd yes,\nyou were asking about the lock screen.\n\n522\n00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.605\nYeah, that's another thing that,\nactually if you go out and read,\n\n523\n00:27:59.605 --> 00:28:02.480\nit's funny if you go out and\nread offensive security site, and\n\n524\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.300\nyou look, and they'll have like the top\nten things that they do to their installs.\n\n525\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.400\nThey apologize.\n\n526\n00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.070\nThey're like we're sorry, we left it.\n\n527\n00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.890\nIt'll lock your screen.\n\n528\n00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.230\nI wanna say it's after five minutes.\n\n529\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.620\nIt's not very long and\nit really does get a little bit annoying.\n\n530\n00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.320\nSo they're like we'll take care\nof that in our next release.\n\n531\n00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.970\nBut for now,\njust go in your display settings.\n\n532\n00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:26.408\nSo I'm gonna go over here in my little\nwrenches and screwdriver icon there.\n\n533\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.960\nAnd then I can go into my privacy and\nscreen lock.\n\n534\n00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.096\nI'm gonna turn that off, all right?\n\n535\n00:28:37.096 --> 00:28:39.720\nOr you could adjust\nthe time if you wanted.\n\n536\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.260\nI'm just gonna kill it cuz when I'm\nrunning in Kali, I'm here I'm at my desk,\n\n537\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.610\nI'm doing work.\n\n538\n00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.410\nThis, again, is not my daily driver.\n\n539\n00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.140\n&gt;&gt; You don't want it to lock\ncuz you're working on it.\n\n540\n00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I turn around, if I'm doing\nsome reading on a webpage or a forum or\n\n541\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.670\nsomething like that, or going through\na report, I don't wanna come back and\n\n542\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.790\nhave my screen locked.\n\n543\n00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.686\nThat's just me, so\nI turn that off altogether.\n\n544\n00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:03.335\nYou could also check your power options.\n\n545\n00:29:03.335 --> 00:29:04.923\nGo back into settings there.\n\n546\n00:29:04.923 --> 00:29:08.160\nYou can take a look at the power options.\n\n547\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.380\nAnd this blank screen,\n\n548\n00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.540\nfive minutes, that's the one that\nreally will drive you crazy.\n\n549\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.382\nSo probably what I would recommend if\nyou're gonna be using this in an Office\n\n550\n00:29:17.382 --> 00:29:20.443\nenvironment and\nmaybe 15 minutes on the blank screen, and\n\n551\n00:29:20.443 --> 00:29:22.380\nthen locking the screen eventually.\n\n552\n00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.300\nOr never blanking it out but\nlocking it eventually.\n\n553\n00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.240\nIt is a good security precaution if\nyou're gonna walk away from your desktop,\n\n554\n00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.920\nespecially if you're logged in as root\nbecause somebody can come behind you.\n\n555\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.310\nI'm going to turn that to never.\n\n556\n00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:43.510\nAnd so now I basically have a Kali\nmachine that's updated, ready to go.\n\n557\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:47.728\nI've changed my password, I've made\nmy desktop look the way I wanted.\n\n558\n00:29:47.728 --> 00:29:51.450\nI didn't get crazy and change themes and\nbackgrounds and things like that.\n\n559\n00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.070\nThat's very personal you know.\n\n560\n00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.400\nWhatever you want to do to make\nit your own install, is fine.\n\n561\n00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.530\nI just wanted to show\nyou some of the basics.\n\n562\n00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:04.508\nIn a future episode, we'll come back and\nwe'll look at configuring a couple\n\n563\n00:30:04.508 --> 00:30:09.576\nof other things that are more than\ncosmetic, like Metasploit, for example.\n\n564\n00:30:09.576 --> 00:30:12.928\nMaking sure that the database is up and\nready to go so\n\n565\n00:30:12.928 --> 00:30:18.208\nthat Metasploit can launch faster, and\nthen we don't have to worry about that.\n\n566\n00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:22.900\nMaybe we'll add our SSH keys so\nthat we can maybe get remote access,\n\n567\n00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.220\nchanging whether or\nnot root can remote in.\n\n568\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.258\nA few of those things that are a little\nmore than cosmetic, right?\n\n569\n00:30:28.258 --> 00:30:32.738\nSome actual functional updates that you\nmight wanna do to your brand new Kali\n\n570\n00:30:32.738 --> 00:30:33.372\ninstall.\n\n571\n00:30:33.372 --> 00:30:34.850\n&gt;&gt; Looking forward to it, Mike.\n\n572\n00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.510\nThanks very much, post installation\nconfiguration, Kali Linux, and\n\n573\n00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.110\nthere are a lot of videos in this series.\n\n574\n00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.740\nMake sure you watch every single one\nof them, you'll be glad you did.\n\n575\n00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.040\nKali Linux.\n\n576\n00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.140\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n577\n00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.650\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n578\n00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.720\nI'm Zach

watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.330\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.520\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.502\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with more Kali Linux,\n\n7\n00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:26.600\nand today it's post-installation\nconfiguration part deuce.\n\n8\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.370\nIn which we've had a part one,\nwe need a part two, and\n\n9\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.860\nMike Rodrick is gonna give us all\nthe information we need, right?\n\n10\n00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.100\n&gt;&gt; I am.\n&gt;&gt; Why do we need a part two?\n\n11\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.600\n&gt;&gt; Well because there's more to do.\n\n12\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.005\n&gt;&gt; Of course there is.\n\n13\n00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:39.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I like that, part deuce is\nlike a combination of languages there.\n\n14\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.480\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n15\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.470\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n16\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.070\nAll right, so yeah,\n\n17\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.870\nwe had an episode where we took a look at\ndoing some basic customizations of our\n\n18\n00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.870\nKali Linux post-installation\nthings that we wanted to do.\n\n19\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.290\nLike changing the root default password\nfor when you download those or\n\n20\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.070\nget the ISO from offensive security,\nthe default is root and toor for\n\n21\n00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.590\nthe password, you need to change that.\n\n22\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.472\nWe took a look at some of the options with\nthe floating dock and things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:04.472 --> 00:01:06.823\nI wanna do a few more things\nthat we typically do, or\n\n24\n00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:09.765\nmost people will typically do\nwhen they first get a system.\n\n25\n00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.350\nWe took a look at doing our updates too.\n\n26\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, right.\n&gt;&gt; Which was a very important part\n\n27\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.190\nwith our app get update, and our app\nget disk upgrade, and those options.\n\n28\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.810\nNow today we'll continue on and a couple\nmore things that we're gonna wanna do.\n\n29\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.080\nOne would be changing the host name,\nright,\n\n30\n00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.850\nit really depends on\nthe environment you're using it in.\n\n31\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.792\nThe default host name or the name of your\nKali Linux machine is gonna be Kali,\n\n32\n00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:39.134\nK-A-L-I, and we can see that if\nwe take a look at my screen here.\n\n33\n00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:43.552\nI'll open up my little bash shell and\ntype in host name,\n\n34\n00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:46.654\nsimple enough, easy to remember, and\n\n35\n00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:51.453\nI can see that it is indeed Kali\nwhich in a lot of cases is fine.\n\n36\n00:01:51.453 --> 00:01:56.455\nIf I'm doing this in a lab environment\nlike what I do here it's all virtualized,\n\n37\n00:01:56.455 --> 00:02:01.678\nhalf the time it's host only networking so\nthey can't talk to the rest of the network\n\n38\n00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:06.535\nor at least the other boxes, so there's\nno conflict, there's no problem and\n\n39\n00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:10.909\ntypically I might not be trying to\naccess it remotely so Kali's okay.\n\n40\n00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:15.298\nIf though you're gonna use this as your\ndaily driver, or use it on your production\n\n41\n00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:18.988\nnetwork to be testing machines and\ndoing your security work you might\n\n42\n00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:22.828\nwanna change that, there might be\nother people that are running Kali.\n\n43\n00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:24.562\nYou might not be the only one and\n\n44\n00:02:24.562 --> 00:02:29.169\nyou can't have two machines with the same\nname, that's gonna cause a conflict,\n\n45\n00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.108\nright, especially if we're trying\nto access the Kali box remotely,\n\n46\n00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:36.320\nthen I really need to make\nsure that that name is unique.\n\n47\n00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.610\nSo let's start there, let's take a look at\nhow we go about changing our host name.\n\n48\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.750\nThere really are two places that we're\ngonna wanna change our host name in.\n\n49\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.415\nOne deals with local apps, and the other\none is going to be our actual DNS name,\n\n50\n00:02:50.415 --> 00:02:53.570\nright, our FQDN,\nour fully qualified domain name, and\n\n51\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.260\nthat's the one that would apply for\nremote clients trying to connect to it.\n\n52\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.680\nWe would wanna make sure there's a DNS\nentry for our machine on the DNS server\n\n53\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.250\nthat we're using on our network, things\nlike that, so let's take a look at it.\n\n54\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.000\nThe two places here, I am going to,\nhow's the best way to do this?\n\n55\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.970\nI'll use Leafpad again simply because it's\na little bit easier to show on screen,\n\n56\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.236\nif you're using Vi, or\nNano is my personal favorite,\n\n57\n00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:24.866\nbut Leafpad shows up best on screen here,\nmakes it a little bit easier for us.\n\n58\n00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:29.268\nI'm gonna do, it's Etsy/hostname,\nall right, and\n\n59\n00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:34.513\nthere it is [LAUGH] it's a very\ncomplex file as you can see, right?\n\n60\n00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:35.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah it's very complex.\n\n61\n00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:36.945\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully you can see that here,\n\n62\n00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:40.265\nI'll tell you what I'll even\nbump up the font a wee bit.\n\n63\n00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:41.235\n&gt;&gt; Too many words.\n\n64\n00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:43.620\n&gt;&gt; I know, it is crazy complex so\n\n65\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.177\nyou really don't wanna make any changes in\nhere unless you know what you're doing.\n\n66\n00:03:47.177 --> 00:03:51.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding, whatever you type here is\n\n67\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.810\ngonna be the name of your machine\nas far as local apps go, right,\n\n68\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.330\nS and B actually uses this name if\nyou're doing or something like that.\n\n69\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.890\nSo I don't know,\nwhat should we change it to,\n\n70\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.690\nwhat do you want the name\nof the machine to be?\n\n71\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Fuzzy ears.\n\n72\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.548\n&gt;&gt; How did I know that was coming?\n\n73\n00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:09.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n74\n00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.470\nwe'll do fuzzy ears for\nthe name of our machine there,\n\n75\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.680\nI'm gonna go ahead and type that in and\nthen simply save it and close it.\n\n76\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.468\nAnd let's see, now if we do host name,\nI really need to reboot\n\n77\n00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:26.367\nthis system after that,\nlet's reboot and see if that comes up.\n\n78\n00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:32.404\nSo I'm gonna reboot, we'll let this\nmachine reboot and see how that goes.\n\n79\n00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:33.492\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n80\n00:04:33.492 --> 00:04:34.817\n&gt;&gt; Reboot.\n\n81\n00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:37.722\nYou gotta remember everything\ngets loaded when you first boot,\n\n82\n00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:40.356\nit reads all those config files,\nloads everything up, so\n\n83\n00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:43.750\nif I'm gonna make a change to one I'm\ngoing to need to reboot the system.\n\n84\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.180\nSo we'll log back in as root\n\n85\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.550\nwith my new super secret password\nthat we set the other day.\n\n86\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.120\nI'm gonna log in,\ngo back into our shell and check that.\n\n87\n00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.370\nAnd again,\nthat's pretty straight forward there.\n\n88\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.600\nChanging that is simply,\nlet's do host name, and\n\n89\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.290\nthere I can see,\nkind of looks like fuzz years.\n\n90\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.360\nMaybe I should have made a capital\ne to start that second word there,\n\n91\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.650\nbut it looks like fuzz years.\n\n92\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.830\nBut anyway the point is,\nis it changed the host name,\n\n93\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.800\nright, but again that's only for\nour local applications.\n\n94\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.545\nAs far the network is concerned my DNS\nname, my fully qualified domain name,\n\n95\n00:05:24.545 --> 00:05:27.465\nis gonna be in a separate file,\nall right, and we're gonna need to\n\n96\n00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:32.205\nchange that as well and\nupdate our DNS records on our DNS server.\n\n97\n00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:38.094\nSo let's do this,\nlet's do Leafpad again and\n\n98\n00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:42.029\nthis one is Etsy switch hosts.\n\n99\n00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.241\nAnd you can see this one looks\na little bit different, right,\n\n100\n00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.696\nhere is where I'm mapping a name\nto an IP address, all right, and\n\n101\n00:05:50.696 --> 00:05:55.485\nthis is again where I would put my\nfully qualified domain name in here.\n\n102\n00:05:55.485 --> 00:06:00.901\nSo if we wanted to change this could be,\n\n103\n00:06:00.901 --> 00:06:05.170\nwell it would be something like\n\n104\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.432\nfuzzyears.itpro.tv, all right.\n\n105\n00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:12.803\nAnd then I could save that file, and\n\n106\n00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:18.115\nthen I would obviously wanna make sure\nthat I updated DNS with a pointer to that.\n\n107\n00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:23.259\nThis is mapping to 127.0.0.1,\nor in this case 127.0.1.1 which\n\n108\n00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.333\nis my loopback address, and I would want\nto update that with my actual IP address.\n\n109\n00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:32.308\nBut honestly from this side\nit's not that important, right,\n\n110\n00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:37.334\nthe important thing is that in the DNS\nrecords we have fuzzyears.itpro.tv and\n\n111\n00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:42.490\nwhatever my IP address is on this machine\nor one of my network adapters here.\n\n112\n00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.571\nSo that when people try\nto resolve that name, or\n\n113\n00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.955\nyou if you're somewhere else in your\nnetwork and you need to get back to your\n\n114\n00:06:47.955 --> 00:06:52.416\nKali box, when you type in fuzzy\nears then it can resolve that name,\n\n115\n00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:56.403\nwell then it knows what zone to look in,\nyou create that record in\n\n116\n00:06:56.403 --> 00:07:01.340\nthe itpro.tv zone it finds fuzzy ears and\nthen it can connect that way.\n\n117\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.760\nSo those are the two places we\nwill go to change our host name.\n\n118\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.484\nAs I said, not all that important\nif you're just using it in a test\n\n119\n00:07:10.484 --> 00:07:12.465\nenvironment, using it locally.\n\n120\n00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:14.637\nIf you're going to be using\nit as a daily driver and\n\n121\n00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:17.016\nyou need people to be able to\nconnect to it remotely, or\n\n122\n00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:20.616\nyou need to connect to it remotely, you\nneed to modify that host file, all right.\n\n123\n00:07:20.616 --> 00:07:24.562\nSo again, just to rehash,\nthe etsy hosts name file is for\n\n124\n00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:27.650\nlocal services, local applications.\n\n125\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.046\nThe etsy host file is\nwhere we do our FQDN,\n\n126\n00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:33.298\nour fully qualified domain name for\nthis machine.\n\n127\n00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:36.490\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of our host name.\n\n128\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.540\nNow the next thing I wanna take a look at\nis working with the bash shell itself and\n\n129\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.848\nmaking some changes here,\nlike changing your prompt for example.\n\n130\n00:07:46.848 --> 00:07:51.801\nThis really, it depends on how you wanna\nlook at it, right, I say it's fun,\n\n131\n00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.633\nit's great,\neverybody loves to customize their prompt.\n\n132\n00:07:55.633 --> 00:08:00.846\nAndn the end, while it might seem\nas just a superficial thing to do,\n\n133\n00:08:00.846 --> 00:08:05.785\nit's just affecting the way my\nprompt looks It can actually help\n\n134\n00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:08.365\nmake you a more productive user.\n\n135\n00:08:08.365 --> 00:08:11.874\nMake it a little bit easier to work with\nand heck if you are gonna be in here all\n\n136\n00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.840\nof the time, you might as well make\nit fun to look at or enjoy it, right?\n\n137\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.460\nThere is a few things you can do.\n\n138\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.160\nActually, there is a lot\nof things you can do.\n\n139\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.620\nIf you go out and\nGoogle bash prompt customization,\n\n140\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.360\nyou'll find dozens and\ndozens and dozens of\n\n141\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.360\npeople that have their idea of what is\nthe best way to customize your crap.\n\n142\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.630\nI'm not gonna tell you which is better or\n\n143\n00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.400\nworse it's really whether it's good for\nyou.\n\n144\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.550\nYeah but you can include things\nlike the current date and time,\n\n145\n00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.100\nworking directories,\nwho you're logged as, host names.\n\n146\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.560\nIn fact the problem that you're looking\nat here is not the default font\n\n147\n00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.440\nI've actually modified mine.\n\n148\n00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.440\nI kind of like my red, white and\n\n149\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.210\nblue color theme I got going on\nthere again just for giggles.\n\n150\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.550\nI take out the host name because I usually\nknow what host I'm sitting at and then I\n\n151\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.410\ncan always type host name and my biggest\ndeal is I like to keep the prompt short so\n\n152\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.400\nthat I have more room to work\nwithout wrapping in my show here.\n\n153\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.590\nBut again, it's really what's up to you.\n\n154\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.950\nI know several people that\nuse multi line prompts.\n\n155\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.780\nWhere the command prompt or the Shell\nprompt is actually it fits on two lines.\n\n156\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.670\nYou can put a return character in there\nand have it show up on two lines.\n\n157\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.670\nAll right, so let's take a look at, one,\n\n158\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.990\nhow we would go about modifying this,\nwhere we would do it and what we can do.\n\n159\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.058\nSo the actual file is gonna\nbe in a .bashrc file.\n\n160\n00:09:38.058 --> 00:09:41.550\nI'm actually gonna use an alias,\n\n161\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.249\nand I'll explain my aliases\nhere in just a minute.\n\n162\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.120\nIf I can even type today.\n\n163\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.790\nThere is my.\n\n164\n00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.550\nAll I've done is a list with a dash A.\n\n165\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.570\nIt happens to be the same as an LS dash A.\n\n166\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.000\nAnd I can see my .bashrc.\n\n167\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.060\nAnd this is in, notice my path.\n\n168\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.650\nI'm currently in my home directory for\nthe user I'm logged on as, route.\n\n169\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:12.130\nAnd there is my .bashrc,\nthis is my configuration file for bash.\n\n170\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.880\nAnd if I make changes to here,\n\n171\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.780\nit applies just to my user,\nwhoever I'm currently logged on as, right?\n\n172\n00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.320\nThere are ways you can modify\nthe systems .bashrc and\n\n173\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.830\nmake changes to all users and new users.\n\n174\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.570\nYeah, again, it depends.\n\n175\n00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.140\nIf you create a lot of users on there and\n\n176\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.960\nyou want them to have the same prompt,\ntypically we don't do a lot to the system\n\n177\n00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.700\nbash rc because each user should be able\nto modify the prompt the way they want.\n\n178\n00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.840\nBut if you make a change\nin the system rc and\n\n179\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.250\nthen they can change their local bash\nrc file to kind of override that.\n\n180\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.800\nWorks out well.\n\n181\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.560\nSo let's see how we can go about\nmaking some changes to this.\n\n182\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.420\nI am going to leaf pad it for\ndisplay purposes.\n\n183\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.550\nAnd I'll do a little,\njust to be technically correct,\n\n184\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.000\nit's in the same node.\n\n185\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.160\nBut if I wasn't in that directory.\n\n186\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.050\nI would just say tilde which represents\nyour home directory /.bashRC that way I\n\n187\n00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.700\ncan do it from wherever I am.\n\n188\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.260\nAnd here's the file.\n\n189\n00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.490\nAnd there's a lot of information in here\njust wanna be careful when you're making\n\n190\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.760\nchange on this you can goof\nthings up if you're not careful.\n\n191\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.200\nBut I'm gonna scroll down\nuntil I find this area here.\n\n192\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.370\nWhere I can see this .PS1, all right.\n\n193\n00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.930\nThere are several different\nprompts that you can set.\n\n194\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.340\nThere's a PS1 2 3 and\n4 if I'm not mistaken.\n\n195\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.160\nPS1 is gonna be your main prompt,\nand this line right, oops.\n\n196\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.310\nClick and drag and change things around,\nso I gotta be careful, right.\n\n197\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.180\n&gt;&gt; You gotta be careful.\n\n198\n00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this line right\nhere is defining my prompt.\n\n199\n00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.940\nWas telling it what to put at\nthe beginning of that line, all right.\n\n200\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.140\nIn fact, this one is commented out.\n\n201\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.310\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna uncomment this because that\n\n202\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.790\nis the default prompt.\n\n203\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.490\nAnd I'm gonna comment these other two\nlines out, and I'll come back and\n\n204\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.229\nexplain those in just a minute.\n\n205\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:12.980\nSo the pound symbol is my comment I'm\ngonna save this, gonna close this,\n\n206\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:19.770\ngonna relaunch my terminal, and you see\nthat prompt looks a lot different now.\n\n207\n00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.320\nRight?\n\n208\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.070\nI've got root, that's who I'm currently\nlogged on as at Fuzzy ears the name of m\n\n209\n00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:32.110\ncomputer the host name basically and then\nthere's a colon and then this little tilde\n\n210\n00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:38.140\nis representing my current working\ndirectory where we are at right now.\n\n211\n00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.780\nAnd then this pound symbol will change.\n\n212\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.970\nIf you're logged on as root,\nyou get the pound.\n\n213\n00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.610\nIf you're logged on as a normal user,\ngosh, what is it?\n\n214\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.820\nI've rarely logged on as a normal user.\n\n215\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.510\nI wanna say it's a, yeah,\nI don't wanna guess.\n\n216\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.570\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n217\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.130\nIt's a different symbol.\n\n218\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.840\nAnd so from the prompt you can\ntell what your host name is,\n\n219\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.180\nyour current working directory and again,\n\n220\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.570\na little pound symbol kinda indicating\nthat you're running with root credentials.\n\n221\n00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.890\n&gt;&gt; So in any menu that we looked at,\n\n222\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.540\nwe're not gonna see we're\ngonna see is that right?\n\n223\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\ncuz that's our host name cuz we change\n\n224\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.000\nit earlier\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n225\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.200\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; But the deal, well,\n\n226\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.650\nwhat's a good way to say this?\n\n227\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.850\nLet's take a look at what's gonna happen.\n\n228\n00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.720\nSo, let's say I do a,\nlet's see what we got in here.\n\n229\n00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.340\nLet's navigate back out to my root.\n\n230\n00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.310\nAnd I just wanna get\ninto a long directory, so\n\n231\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.295\nI'm gonna cd, let's go into user.\n\n232\n00:13:34.295 --> 00:13:39.814\nAnd then\n\n233\n00:13:39.814 --> 00:13:47.070\ncd var, cd sniffjoke, cd generic.\n\n234\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.360\nSo, you can see as I navigate deeper and\ndeeper into the file structure,\n\n235\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.120\nnested folder is a nested folder,\nthey are all listed here,\n\n236\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.300\nmy prop is giving linger and longer.\n\n237\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.370\nHere I was initially,\nright, which is root.\n\n238\n00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.110\nThen I'm into root/user.\n\n239\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:09.259\nThen I'm in /user/var\nthen user/var/sniffjoke,\n\n240\n00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:13.847\nthen user/var/sniffjoke/generic.\n\n241\n00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:18.220\nAnd so the deeper I go the longer\nmy working directory becomes, and\n\n242\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.965\nthe less room I have over here\nto kind of type my commands,\n\n243\n00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:25.260\nit's gonna start wrapping earlier,\nall right.\n\n244\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.940\nSo some people like that,\nthey wanna see that entire path.\n\n245\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.630\nMe personally, I kinda like\nshortening that up a little bit, and\n\n246\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.970\nI'll show you a little trick\nwe can do to keep that short.\n\n247\n00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.240\nAgain, the other thing that I can\ndo to shorten mine up is get rid of\n\n248\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.550\nthis at fuzzy ears.\n\n249\n00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:43.474\nI don't need to see my host name in my\nprompt, in my personal opinion, all right?\n\n250\n00:14:43.474 --> 00:14:44.420\nUh-huh?\n\n251\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.710\n&gt;&gt; Now you'd mentioned before,\nwe're gonna look at Metasploit?\n\n252\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, much later though.\n\n253\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.000\n&gt;&gt; That's coming down the road?\n\n254\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000\n&gt;&gt; That's much later.\n\n255\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.735\n&gt;&gt; Down the road.\n\n256\n00:14:51.735 --> 00:14:55.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's get back into actually,\n\n257\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.700\nlet me do a couple things here.\n\n258\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.310\nFirst let me go into our root.\n\n259\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.314\nOr I guess I'll go home.\n\n260\n00:15:01.314 --> 00:15:02.432\n&gt;&gt; It's a good little tease then.\n\n261\n00:15:02.432 --> 00:15:05.594\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n262\n00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:10.828\nthen let's do our little\nleaf pad with our bash RC.\n\n263\n00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:13.840\nAll right, so\n\n264\n00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:20.130\nwhat I recommend that you do is do like\nI did comment out the default prompt.\n\n265\n00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:20.880\nLeave it there.\n\n266\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.360\nI use it as a reference.\n\n267\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.090\nSo that I can build my own.\n\n268\n00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.800\nOr if I ever need to roll back or\nI goof things up with my own prompt,\n\n269\n00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.130\nI know I've got the one that came,\nthe way it was designed is right there.\n\n270\n00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.710\nSo I'm just gonna comment that out.\n\n271\n00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.000\nRather than delete it.\n\n272\n00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.340\nAnd just because I'm a little OCD,\nI'm gonna line that back up, all right?\n\n273\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.510\nAnd then below that is where\nI've done my custom prompt.\n\n274\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.291\nNow this line right here,\nall I did was take this line, copy it,\n\n275\n00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:49.231\npaste it, and then make changes to it.\n\n276\n00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:55.617\nThis first part is basically some how,\nwhat's a good way to say it.\n\n277\n00:15:55.617 --> 00:15:58.347\nStructure that needs to be there.\n\n278\n00:15:58.347 --> 00:16:00.733\nThe rest of this, this is all.\n\n279\n00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:02.245\nThe actual prompt.\n\n280\n00:16:02.245 --> 00:16:06.037\nIn fact if we go back up to\nthe default this one right here,\n\n281\n00:16:06.037 --> 00:16:07.780\nwe can learn to read this.\n\n282\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.940\nFirst of all characters,\ncertain characters need to be escapes.\n\n283\n00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.050\nSo you'll see that there's this backslash.\n\n284\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.977\nThere's a backslash and\nthen there's a what did I just do?\n\n285\n00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:19.640\nI got, there we go.\n\n286\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.261\nSorry, I made a change I didn't want to.\n\n287\n00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:27.948\nThere's a backslash and\nthen a open bracket right that square, and\n\n288\n00:16:27.948 --> 00:16:35.576\nthen there's a backslash\n033(01;31M\\) that's a lot of stuff,\n\n289\n00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:41.942\nall of this right here,\nthis is a color code this is a color code.\n\n290\n00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:47.440\nThe 033 is, well the backslash is saying\nhey, don't interpret these, don't\n\n291\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.840\nprint these on the screen these are some\ncontrol characters that are following.\n\n292\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.150\nSo process them, don't print them\non screen, don't echo them out.\n\n293\n00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.490\nThat's what that initial slash is doing,\nsaying hey,\n\n294\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:03.500\nall of this you need to actually\nprocess not just display on screen.\n\n295\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.932\nIn between this first bracket and\n\n296\n00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:12.333\nthis last bracket here is my color code,\nall right.\n\n297\n00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:14.670\nThese 033 could also be an E.\n\n298\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.440\nYou could do a backslash E or\na backslash 033.\n\n299\n00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.350\nDifferent people they do\nthe exact same thing.\n\n300\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.040\nSome people prefer the E because,\nit looks a little bit neater.\n\n301\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.770\nBy default this is 033 but\nit's which ever one you wanna use.\n\n302\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:33.150\nThen within after the second open bracket\nyou've got a two digit number and\n\n303\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:39.590\nthat two digit number zero is normal,\none is old,\n\n304\n00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.720\nI think two is I have to go\nlook those up again, gosh.\n\n305\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.730\nWe can go look those up in a second,\ngo out and again do a Google, but\n\n306\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:52.920\nthat's basically saying hey, I want\nbold and then there's 31m is the color.\n\n307\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.670\nIn fact that's the color red, right?\n\n308\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:01.000\nWhich is why we saw my username\nat Fuzziers was in red,\n\n309\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.510\nbecause you're saying okay.\n\n310\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.910\nI want to change the color to red,\nand then I want you to do a slash u.\n\n311\n00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.910\nSlash lowercase u is user, so\nit prints out whoever you're logged on as.\n\n312\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.400\nIn this case, root.\n\n313\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.650\nThen there's the @ symbol, right?\n\n314\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.572\nAnd that's just saying,\nhey, print an @ symbol.\n\n315\n00:18:18.572 --> 00:18:24.480\nSo root@ and then -h, well,\nthat's the symbol for host name.\n\n316\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.900\nSo I'd say, hey, printeruser@hostname and\ndo it all in red, all right?\n\n317\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.580\nThen after the host name,\nyou'll see this 03300m\n\n318\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:42.000\nand what that is doing is it's re-setting\nthe color because we changed it to red,\n\n319\n00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.850\neverything after that is\nactually gonna print out in red.\n\n320\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.930\nThen what they've done is\nthey've done the 00 to\n\n321\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.000\nset is back to the default color\nwhich in our case is white.\n\n322\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.120\nIf we look at our prompt,\nyou see the column is in white, right.\n\n323\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.930\nSo I said hey do all this in red,\nthen switch back to the default color.\n\n324\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.790\nWhere we at?\n\n325\n00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.540\nAnd print a colon.\n\n326\n00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.900\nSo that's why we have that\nwhite colon sitting there.\n\n327\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.406\nAnd if we keep going down this line,\nhere's another color code.\n\n328\n00:19:11.406 --> 00:19:16.046\nThis one, 0134 is bold blue, right.\n\n329\n00:19:16.046 --> 00:19:18.790\nYeah, blue sorry for.\n\n330\n00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:23.720\nAnd it's saying so now, switch to blue,\nso after the colon, switch to blue and\n\n331\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.947\nprint the working directory.\n\n332\n00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:31.260\nSlash w little lower w,\nis the entire path your working directory.\n\n333\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.280\nThen we're gonna change the color\nback to the default again right,\n\n334\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.119\nwith that 00m and then there's a /$.\n\n335\n00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:43.980\nAnd the /$ is a special\ncharacter that says, hey,\n\n336\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.560\nchange the prompt based on whether or\nnot you're root or a standard user.\n\n337\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.740\nSo that way we get that # symbol for\n\n338\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.480\nour root users if we have\nthe root permissions, all right?\n\n339\n00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.950\nSo that's the default prompt.\n\n340\n00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay now, that we've seen this.\n\n341\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.670\nIt's very exciting and wonderful.\n\n342\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:05.680\nBut how do you customize\nyours now as we go forward?\n\n343\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.750\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's take a look.\n\n344\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.780\nAgain, I've commented.\n\n345\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.790\nLet me un-comment this one\nbefore I forget to do that.\n\n346\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.290\nSo here is my prompt that I like to use.\n\n347\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.720\nI've got the default.\n\n348\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.120\nDebbie end code that needs to be\nthere at beginning of my prompts.\n\n349\n00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.601\nAnd then I have, this is red,\nand I've got my username.\n\n350\n00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:27.490\nAnd then I switch it back to a default\ncolor and I've got my colon.\n\n351\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.420\nNotice I took out the @ and the /h.\n\n352\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.610\nSo no more host name.\n\n353\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.410\nInstead of root@fuzzyears,\nnow it's just root.\n\n354\n00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.270\nThen we're gonna put the colon\nin there in the default color.\n\n355\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.770\nAnd then I'm gonna switch to color up.\n\n356\n00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.120\nAnd I know I just told you see\nthe color code here for blue.\n\n357\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.607\nOkay I'm little geeky, and it's not my\nfavorite blue I wanted a different blue.\n\n358\n00:20:51.607 --> 00:20:54.287\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So instead of using the standard\n\n359\n00:20:54.287 --> 00:20:58.760\neight colors, you can go up to 256\ncolors in most modern terminals.\n\n360\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.130\n&gt;&gt; You like it it's baby blue.\n\n361\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Baby blue.\n\n362\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.000\n&gt;&gt; Those support 256 colors really have\nto denote it a little bit differently\n\n363\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.030\nit's actually again this just tell\nus there is a color code coming\n\n364\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:15.300\nup and honestly I have not\nexactly this is telling me\n\n365\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.903\n&gt;&gt; Foreground, that 38.\n\n366\n00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:21.204\nDid I just change that on that?\n\n367\n00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:22.004\nThere we go.\n\n368\n00:21:22.004 --> 00:21:23.980\nThat 38 is saying foreground\nversus background.\n\n369\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.480\nBecause you can also change\nthe background color.\n\n370\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.540\nYou could have white text on blue\nbackground if you wanted that for\n\n371\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.550\nyour prompt, right?\n\n372\n00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.980\nYou can underline it as well, but\n38 is saying foreground color.\n\n373\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.423\nFive in my case, I wanna say is bold.\n\n374\n00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:41.437\nAnd then 33 is just\na different shade of m.\n\n375\n00:21:41.437 --> 00:21:42.560\nI'll show you here in a minute.\n\n376\n00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.940\nYou can find a chart.\n\n377\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.180\nYou take the column number and\nthe row number, where they intersect for\n\n378\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.000\nthat color.\n\n379\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.880\nYou add them up, and you put that\nnumber there and that's what you get.\n\n380\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.230\nSo, it's just a slightly different\nshade of blue than the normal 34m.\n\n381\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.340\nAnd then after that I've got\nmy working directory, and\n\n382\n00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.810\nthen I've added a little\ngreater than symbol.\n\n383\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.070\nYeah, I come from a Windows world.\n\n384\n00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.080\nI don't know what it is,\n\n385\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.010\nbut I'm comfortable with that greater than\nsymbol sitting there at the end of my\n\n386\n00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.160\nprompt showing the beginning of\nwhere I'm gonna start typing.\n\n387\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.570\nWhich is me, I just like that.\n\n388\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.200\nThen I switch back to\nthe default color and\n\n389\n00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.820\nI also have a space and then my end quote.\n\n390\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.580\nAnd that space is gonna make sure\nthat if you can match my prompt here,\n\n391\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.150\nwell we don't have to imagine\nwe have it visible here.\n\n392\n00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n393\n00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.600\n&gt;&gt; When I type I want this space\nright there between my prompt\n\n394\n00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.060\nin the beginning of what I'm typing.\n\n395\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.320\nIf I didn't include that space\nin my definition for my prompt,\n\n396\n00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.890\nthe leafpad would have bumped right across\nthe beginning of that prompt there and\n\n397\n00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.530\nit kind of looks weird to me.\n\n398\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.960\nAgain, it's a very personal thing.\n\n399\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.250\nIt's whatever you want to do,\nit's completely customizable and\n\n400\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.680\nit's kinda fun to goof\naround with your prompt.\n\n401\n00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Or you can just leave it the way it is,\nas you get is, as you install it.\n\n402\n00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.370\nYeah?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n403\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.530\nAll right, so\n\n404\n00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.220\nlet's see how this looks now that I've\ngotten all this straight not now.\n\n405\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.140\nYou might think it's odd that at\nthe end of my prompt where I got my\n\n406\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.190\nworking directory, my greater than\nsymbol and then I reset the color but\n\n407\n00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.110\nthere's nothing coming after that,\nso why did I do that?\n\n408\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.110\nLet me show what would\nhappen if I didn't do that.\n\n409\n00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:23.070\nI'm gonna take that out and\nwe're gonna save this file go bashrc and\n\n410\n00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.810\nwe'll restart bash and there's my prompt.\n\n411\n00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.580\nAll right.\n\n412\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.080\nAnd let me zoom in a little bit.\n\n413\n00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.275\nSo, you can see it's just\nusername:working directory and\n\n414\n00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:35.225\nmy greater than symbol and my space.\n\n415\n00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:39.770\nAnd now I'm gonna start typing and\nlook at what color my text is.\n\n416\n00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.230\nIt's all blue, because the last\ncolor code I had that it read.\n\n417\n00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.270\nWas blue and so now I'm no longer\ngetting the nice color coding for\n\n418\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.140\ndifferent commands,\n\n419\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.650\ndirectories, things like that because I\nbasically said I want everything in blue.\n\n420\n00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:55.201\nNow you can see that.\n\n421\n00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:56.859\nThat's the cool blue that I like.\n\n422\n00:23:56.859 --> 00:23:58.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n423\n00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.828\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go fix that.\n\n424\n00:24:02.828 --> 00:24:06.560\nAnd put that back so\neverything on my screen is not blue.\n\n425\n00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.805\nSo I'm gonna kind of cheat and\ncopy this color code down, if that resets.\n\n426\n00:24:16.143 --> 00:24:19.177\nMake sure it's before my space, all right.\n\n427\n00:24:19.177 --> 00:24:21.094\nAnd now I will save this.\n\n428\n00:24:23.478 --> 00:24:25.300\nClose it.\n\n429\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.250\nWe go back over and relaunch our shell.\n\n430\n00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.720\nAnd now, Everything is back to normal.\n\n431\n00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.610\nI've got my prompt the way I want it.\n\n432\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.040\nI've got my text showing up\nas normal after my prompt.\n\n433\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.653\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's try this.\n\n434\n00:24:41.653 --> 00:24:43.789\nLet's go into that long path again.\n\n435\n00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:48.810\nThat was what, usr/var, what was it,\n\n436\n00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:54.330\nsniffjoke, and then generic, right?\n\n437\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:58.880\nAnd there you can see, it's printing\nout the entire working directory.\n\n438\n00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.698\nWhich is fine, if that's what you want.\n\n439\n00:25:02.698 --> 00:25:06.230\nBut as that gets longer and longer, and\nif you do a lot of nesting of folders,\n\n440\n00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.920\nthis can get really long and\ntake up the good majority of your screen.\n\n441\n00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.480\nSo there's one more trick that I found,\nthat I'm gonna show you guys,\n\n442\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.200\nthat I like to do.\n\n443\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.854\nLet's pull up Leafpad again.\n\n444\n00:25:14.854 --> 00:25:17.170\n&gt;&gt; This will shorten the command lines?\n\n445\n00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it'll make that\nprompt a little bit shorter.\n\n446\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.738\nSo what I do,\nhere's the command right here,\n\n447\n00:25:24.738 --> 00:25:28.691\nPROMPT_DIRTRIM=2.\n\n448\n00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:32.730\nAnd you can set that number\nto whatever you want.\n\n449\n00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:38.800\nThat's telling it how many levels you\nwant to show in your working directory,\n\n450\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.760\nstarting from the current folder, back.\n\n451\n00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.213\nSo let's see how that changes my prompt.\n\n452\n00:25:45.213 --> 00:25:47.897\nLet me uncomment that, save it.\n\n453\n00:25:47.897 --> 00:25:49.973\nFile &gt; Save.\n\n454\n00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:52.140\nWe'll close that, relaunch our shell.\n\n455\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.289\nAnd I'll go back into that same directory.\n\n456\n00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.090\nAnd now, notice what the prompt is doing.\n\n457\n00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.710\nSo I'm in generic,\nwhich is inside stiffjoke,\n\n458\n00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.928\nand then it just has dot, dot, dot.\n\n459\n00:26:06.928 --> 00:26:08.430\nIt says yes, you are deeper than that.\n\n460\n00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.760\nThere are folders above you, but\nI'm not gonna gonna bother showing them.\n\n461\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.990\nI'm just gonna show you the last two\ndirectories in that working path, right?\n\n462\n00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.352\nPretty cool.\nIf I were to put 3,\n\n463\n00:26:18.352 --> 00:26:22.116\nthen it would have showed dot,\ndot, dot, var/sniffjoke/generic.\n\n464\n00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:24.978\nIf I would have said DIRTRIM 4,\nthen it would have showed in this\n\n465\n00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:28.480\ncase the entire path, cuz there's only\nfour levels to this particular path.\n\n466\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.570\nSo you can control how much of\nthat working directory it shows\n\n467\n00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:37.830\nwith that PROMPT_DIRTRIM= and\nthen whatever number you set.\n\n468\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.520\nAll right.\n\n469\n00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n470\n00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, fantastic.\n\n471\n00:26:40.675 --> 00:26:45.360\nOkay, so now I've got my prompt that\nI like, it's comfortable for me.\n\n472\n00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.610\nI'm gonna jump back out to\nmy home directory here.\n\n473\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.300\nAnd I know we are a little\nbit short on time.\n\n474\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.090\nBut there is one more\nthing I do wanna show.\n\n475\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:57.740\nSo we'll run this one over\njust a little bit there, Zach.\n\n476\n00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.760\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n477\n00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.990\n&gt;&gt; And the other one that I want to take\na look at is something known as aliases.\n\n478\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.340\nColorizing my prompt,\nsetting it up to where it shows\n\n479\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.350\nthe information that I want,\nthat's helpful to me.\n\n480\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.420\nAnd it's kind of fun.\n\n481\n00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.520\nAliases are another thing that I can,\ndo that I really like to do.\n\n482\n00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:21.370\nBecause it makes it easier, especially\nbecause I'm a Windows guy primarily.\n\n483\n00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.640\nThat's where I spent decades working,\nwas in Windows.\n\n484\n00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.490\nAnd so aliases allow me to create aliases,\nright?\n\n485\n00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.028\n&gt;&gt; So you mean like calling\nyourself Snappy Pete or something?\n\n486\n00:27:32.028 --> 00:27:33.074\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n487\n00:27:33.074 --> 00:27:35.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even if you've got that fancy nickname\n\n488\n00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.889\nthat you want to us.\n\n489\n00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:40.710\nIn that same file .bashrc,\n\n490\n00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:45.647\nthere are some aliases already set,\n\n491\n00:27:45.647 --> 00:27:50.760\nlike alias ls=ls --color=auto.\n\n492\n00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.260\nNormally without this alias,\n\n493\n00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.000\nyour ls command, which is your list\nof directories, is not colorized.\n\n494\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.910\nFolders versus files, versus what have\nyou, are not in different colors.\n\n495\n00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.450\nWell, they've decided that\nthat's a good thing, and\n\n496\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:07.010\nthey've already aliased it for you.\n\n497\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:15.006\nThey say anytime you type ls, what you're\nactually gonna execute is ls --color=auto.\n\n498\n00:28:15.006 --> 00:28:16.910\nSo that's simply an alias.\n\n499\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.805\nThere are some more down\nhere that I really like.\n\n500\n00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:22.957\nYou can see ll is one.\n\n501\n00:28:22.957 --> 00:28:27.180\nInstead of doing an ls -l,\nI can just type ll.\n\n502\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.490\nInstead of doing an ls -a,\nI can just type la, right?\n\n503\n00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.210\nNow these are all commented out, which\nmeans they're not currently available.\n\n504\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.090\nRight below here, it tells me that you\ncould have additional aliases if you want.\n\n505\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.207\nYou can make up anything you want for\nan alias.\n\n506\n00:28:46.207 --> 00:28:49.497\nIf you've got some long command\nthat you always type and\n\n507\n00:28:49.497 --> 00:28:53.837\nyou wanna be able to execute that\ncommand just by hitting, I don't know,\n\n508\n00:28:53.837 --> 00:28:56.920\nany key combination you want,\nrt, or run this.\n\n509\n00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.540\n&gt;&gt; Rat.\n\n510\n00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can put an alias in that.\n\n511\n00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.640\nAnd it'll execute that command,\nassuming that alias isn't already used for\n\n512\n00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.590\nsomething else.\n\n513\n00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.184\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n514\n00:29:05.184 --> 00:29:09.188\nit also tells you that putting them\nhere might not be the best idea.\n\n515\n00:29:09.188 --> 00:29:14.761\nIt suggests that you create\na file called .bash_aliases.\n\n516\n00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:18.560\nIt's gonna be located in your\npersonal directory, so it's tilde.\n\n517\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.470\nThat's a hidden file, starts with the dot.\n\n518\n00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.040\nAnd that's where you can\nstore all of your aliases.\n\n519\n00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.357\nSo rather than uncomment these,\nI would then create my .bash_ alias.\n\n520\n00:29:28.357 --> 00:29:31.700\nAnd I put these and\nsome additional ones that I like to use.\n\n521\n00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.880\nLet's go take a look at it real quick.\n\n522\n00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:40.190\nI'll do a little bash_aliases.\n\n523\n00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.260\nAnd here's what I like to do,\nyou see the ones that came from that file?\n\n524\n00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.770\nI just copied them over here,\nthey are not commented out.\n\n525\n00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.210\nAnd then I've got a few that, again,\n\n526\n00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.600\nyou'll see my Windows background here,\nright?\n\n527\n00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.640\nAlias cls is going to be clear.\n\n528\n00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.111\nIn Windows, cls clears your prompt, right?\n\n529\n00:29:58.111 --> 00:30:00.200\nIt gets you back to\nthe top of your prompt.\n\n530\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.510\nIn Linux, it's clear.\n\n531\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.100\nI, out of habit, always type cls.\n\n532\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.800\nAnd so I went ahead and made an alias.\n\n533\n00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.977\nAnytime I type cls,\nwhat I really mean is clear, fantastic.\n\n534\n00:30:14.977 --> 00:30:16.277\ncd space dot dot,\n\n535\n00:30:16.277 --> 00:30:22.030\ntakes you back up one level when\nyou're browsing through the directory.\n\n536\n00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.785\nWell, I always miss the space.\n\n537\n00:30:23.785 --> 00:30:26.398\ncd.., I don't do, cd space dot dot.\n\n538\n00:30:26.398 --> 00:30:28.062\nAnd then it says command not found.\n\n539\n00:30:28.062 --> 00:30:30.781\nThen I have to go back and\ntype, cd space dot dot.\n\n540\n00:30:30.781 --> 00:30:31.970\nSo I just simply made an alias.\n\n541\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.059\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] I said\nrather than change my habits,\n\n542\n00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:38.159\nhow about I just fix my system\nto do it the way I want it.\n\n543\n00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:42.140\nSo cd dot dot, is indeed cd space dot dot.\n\n544\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.475\nSame thing with my tilde.\n\n545\n00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:49.100\ncd tilde is actually gonna execute,\ncd space tilde.\n\n546\n00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.549\nYou could do something like alias\n\n547\n00:30:54.549 --> 00:31:00.900\nipconfig actually equals ifconfig.\n\n548\n00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.390\nCuz in Windows it's ipconfig,\nand here it's ifconfig.\n\n549\n00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.580\nNow I don't know,\nI typically don't do that one.\n\n550\n00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.620\nSo most of you have probably\nwatched Don's shows.\n\n551\n00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.100\nHe's a Linux guru, and\nI was actually hosting one of his shows.\n\n552\n00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.110\nAnd when he was talking about\nthis I was like, I do that.\n\n553\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; He was like,\n\n554\n00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.860\ndon't use aliases to cheat yourself.\n\n555\n00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.923\nLearn the right way to do it, rather than-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n556\n00:31:25.923 --> 00:31:26.791\n&gt;&gt; Make an alias and\n\n557\n00:31:26.791 --> 00:31:28.470\ncontinue to do it the wrong way.\n\n558\n00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.970\n&gt;&gt; But you can make an alias,\nwhich is cool.\n\n559\n00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, Don.\n\n560\n00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.250\nI understand that, it's true.\n\n561\n00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:38.320\nAnd so I don't do things like ifconfig for\nipconfig or for anything like that.\n\n562\n00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.304\nBut there are some,\nlike I said, that I just love.\n\n563\n00:31:40.304 --> 00:31:44.410\ncls is so much easier to type,\nand it just makes sense to me.\n\n564\n00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.140\nSo, do what you will with your aliases.\n\n565\n00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.840\nYou can create all you want,\nsave it out in a little file like this.\n\n566\n00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.930\nAnd then when you're in your,\nyou would restart.\n\n567\n00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.130\nI didn't make any changes,\nbut you would restart.\n\n568\n00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.450\nAnd now if I do cls, which normally\nwould be a command not found,\n\n569\n00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:02.000\nit actually clears my screen.\n\n570\n00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.768\nIf I do an la,\nI get the same results as typing, ls -a.\n\n571\n00:32:08.768 --> 00:32:12.785\nActually it's an ls A,\nI think is what the alias is.\n\n572\n00:32:12.785 --> 00:32:15.938\nSo we could do ls -A, that way.\n\n573\n00:32:15.938 --> 00:32:18.516\nAnd there my results\nlook exactly the same.\n\n574\n00:32:18.516 --> 00:32:23.020\nSo that's how you can use aliases to make\nyour life a little bit easier when working\n\n575\n00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.862\nin Bash.\n\n576\n00:32:23.862 --> 00:32:26.655\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, well,\nwe're gonna have to do a part three.\n\n577\n00:32:26.655 --> 00:32:30.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A Post Installation Configuration part\n\n578\n00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.100\nthree, Kali Linux.\n\n579\n00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.102\nAnd part two, of course,\nthat's what we were just doing here.\n\n580\n00:32:35.102 --> 00:32:36.550\nAnd there's a part one.\n\n581\n00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:39.420\nSo you wanna make sure you watch\nall the videos in this series.\n\n582\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.990\nMike, any last words before we go?\n\n583\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.009\n&gt;&gt; When we come back, we'll take a look\nat actually setting up a couple of\n\n584\n00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:46.550\nservices that we might want\nto start automatically.\n\n585\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.291\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV.\n\n586\n00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:52.810\nAnd remember,\na good IT pro is always learning.\n\n587\n00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:53.610\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n588\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.400\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.272\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.272 --> 00:00:13.919\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.436\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:21.551\nMy name is Zach Memos and I am your host\nas we continue on with Kali Linux and\n\n7\n00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.971\nlove me some Kali Linux.\n\n8\n00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.984\nAnd today we're talking\nabout network configuration.\n\n9\n00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.858\nPerson bringing us all that information\nis our IT Pro resident Kali expert,\n\n10\n00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:31.260\nMike Rodrick right there.\n\n11\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.507\nHey Mick good morning to you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:34.701\n&gt;&gt; Hey good morning Zach\ngood to be here and\n\n13\n00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:39.554\nglad to have everybody out there watching,\nand yes we've gone through in our previous\n\n14\n00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.411\nepisodes We've looked at different\nways to install Kali get it up and\n\n15\n00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.754\nrunning, like off of a USB drive,\neven with persistence.\n\n16\n00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:49.990\nWhat we haven't talked about yet\nis networking this guy.\n\n17\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.440\nObviously we're gonna use Kali to perform\npenetration tests, to scan machines.\n\n18\n00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.370\nNeeds to be connected to our network,\nand so we need to take a look at some of\n\n19\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.310\nthe options we can use\nto configure networking.\n\n20\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.480\nObviously we've been talking about\nDHCP and doing it statically.\n\n21\n00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.260\nAnd this is really pertinent if you're\nrunning it either in persistent mode,\n\n22\n00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.393\nwhere I can actually save configurations.\n\n23\n00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:13.987\nRemember, if I'm running it off of a CD or\noff of a USB just live, no persistence,\n\n24\n00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:17.000\nnone of my configuration\nchanges are gonna be there.\n\n25\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.590\nNow that's not to say you can't do them.\n\n26\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.995\nYou might plug in your live thumb drive,\ndo some configuration so\n\n27\n00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:23.690\nit can connect to the current network.\n\n28\n00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.060\nBut all those are gonna go away\nwhen you shut it down right.\n\n29\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.850\nThe next time you plug that thumb dive\ninto a machine, you'll have to reset those\n\n30\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.070\nor pick up the appropriate settings\nfrom whatever network, and that's fine.\n\n31\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.736\nBut if you are doing a, so I'll show\nyou how to configure those IP settings.\n\n32\n00:01:37.736 --> 00:01:43.342\nAnd I also wanna show you how to add\na second network adapter to Kali Linux.\n\n33\n00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:47.545\nWhen you're using the offensive\nsecurity VMs, those pre-built VMs.\n\n34\n00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:51.240\nBecause I think a lot of you are gonna be\nprobably taking advantage of those as you\n\n35\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.200\nlearn Kali.\n\n36\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.814\nAs you practice with the different tools,\n\n37\n00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:59.618\nyou're gonna want to connect to vulnerable\nmachines, like what we use here.\n\n38\n00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.293\nEither two,\n\n39\n00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:08.292\nyou might be looking at\nthe Darn Vulnerable Web Application DVWA.\n\n40\n00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:13.160\nThings from the wonderful people out\nthere at that set-up vulnerable virtual\n\n41\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.359\nmachines and these are what we want to\npractice these tools as we learn about\n\n42\n00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.642\nthese different security tools,\nwe need to try them out.\n\n43\n00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:24.706\nWe need to get good at them,\nunderstand their different options,\n\n44\n00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:29.250\nlook at the output that we get from\nthose tools, understand that output.\n\n45\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.010\nAnd if I am only scanning\nmachines that are not vulnerable,\n\n46\n00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.500\nand hopefully that's what\nthe machines are on my network,\n\n47\n00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.810\nthen I'm not gonna see a lot\nback from these tools.\n\n48\n00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.850\nSo I don't really get a good idea of what\nI would see if there was a vulnerability.\n\n49\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.443\nSo that's why practicing with pre-built,\nvulnerable machines is very important.\n\n50\n00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:50.928\nIt gives us the ability to see\nwhat it would look like if we did\n\n51\n00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:52.980\ndiscover vulnerabilities.\n\n52\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.100\nAnd then even how to take advantage\nof those vulnerabilities.\n\n53\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.150\nAnd then, ultimately, how to patch\nagainst those vulnerabilities and\n\n54\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.660\nprotect our network from them.\n\n55\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.170\nSo we are gonna be running some machines\nthat are intentionally vulnerable\n\n56\n00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.090\nas we learn and play with Kali Linux.\n\n57\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.197\nWith that being said these machines\nare intentionally vulnerable.\n\n58\n00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:12.229\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It means they've got tons of weaknesses\n\n59\n00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.222\nbuilt into them.\n\n60\n00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:16.561\nAnd if you attach them to a network\nthat’s exposed to the public network for\n\n61\n00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:19.741\nexample they're going to be found\nthey're going to be compromised and\n\n62\n00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:22.180\nthat’s now the doorway into\nthe rest of your network.\n\n63\n00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.720\nYou've just compromised your entire\nnetwork which is not what we\n\n64\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.420\nwant to do right.\n\n65\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.210\nWe don't want to be the one,\nthat brought the bad guys in.\n\n66\n00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.690\nSo we wanna be really careful\nwith exposing those guys,\n\n67\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.400\neven exposing them to our internal\nnetwork can be a little risky.\n\n68\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.997\nIf you've got other people on your\nnetwork that are maybe experimenting and\n\n69\n00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:42.764\nthey find one of those and\nthey try to take advantage of it.\n\n70\n00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.326\nThere's just too many things\nthat can go wrong, so\n\n71\n00:03:45.326 --> 00:03:49.730\ntypically we isolate those virtual\nmachines from the rest of our network.\n\n72\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.610\nTo make sure that nothing bad happens.\n\n73\n00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.933\nBut now I've gotta get my kalibox to\nbe able to hit that isolated network.\n\n74\n00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:59.810\nAnd hopefully at the same\ntime still hit the Internet.\n\n75\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.440\nBecause I need to go out and do research.\n\n76\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.080\nOr I need to take a look at a website\nto get some instructions on a tool.\n\n77\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.600\nOr go out to bug track, or find some\ninformation on a vulnerability from one\n\n78\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.390\nfor those vulnerability databases, maybe\nyou need to go out to offensive security.\n\n79\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.113\nAnd I can switch my\nnetwork settings back and\n\n80\n00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:22.574\nforth in my Kali box okay I'm gonna\nconnect it to my internal only network.\n\n81\n00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:25.617\nAnd now I need to go out and find some\ninformation so I'm gonna you know,\n\n82\n00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:28.633\nreconfigure it to connect to the normal\nLAN and go out to the Internet.\n\n83\n00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:32.832\nAnd then when I need to hit those machines\nagain, I gotta reconfigure it and\n\n84\n00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:33.910\nthat can be a pain.\n\n85\n00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.610\nAnd one of the things I found with\nthe offensive security pre-bulit VMs\n\n86\n00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.680\nis that I can only enable one\nnetwork adaptor at a time.\n\n87\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.030\nYou turn one on, the other one turns\noff and it gets a little frustrating.\n\n88\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.670\nSo I'm gonna show you a way that\nwe can get our Kali machine\n\n89\n00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.410\nto be able to talk to the Internet or at\nleast the LAN and then whatever else you\n\n90\n00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.410\nwant it to talk to as well as our\nisolated network with our vulnerable VMs.\n\n91\n00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.302\nSo that's the goal for\nthis particular episode.\n\n92\n00:04:59.302 --> 00:05:03.737\n&gt;&gt; So then, the next question would be,\nwe've got Kali loaded from offensive\n\n93\n00:05:03.737 --> 00:05:07.710\nsecurity, so how do we get the Kali\nbox connected to the network?\n\n94\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.180\n&gt;&gt; That's a great place to start.\n\n95\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.402\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n96\n00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:14.072\nOut of the box Kali is going to\nbe set up to be a DHCP client,\n\n97\n00:05:14.072 --> 00:05:17.591\nmeaning I plug it in,\nit's got a network adaptor, and\n\n98\n00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:21.512\nas long as there's DHTP on my\nnetwork we should be good to go.\n\n99\n00:05:21.512 --> 00:05:25.953\nI will say that a lot of this is going to\ndepend on your virtualization software,\n\n100\n00:05:25.953 --> 00:05:27.892\nwe've talked about that before.\n\n101\n00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:32.860\n&gt;&gt; If you're using via Workstation or\nPlayer or VirtualBox or Hyper-V or\n\n102\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.246\nwhat have you, the actual steps\nmight be a little different but\n\n103\n00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:40.090\nthe concept is going to remain the same.\n\n104\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.660\nSo that's what we're here to learn and\nthen you'll have to kind of tweak it\n\n105\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.740\na little bit for\nyour particular virtualization.\n\n106\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.490\nSo the first thing I'm gonna\nlook at when you load up,\n\n107\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.270\nagain this is just a pre-built\nKali Linux box that I've downloaded from\n\n108\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.140\nOffensive Security for our VM workstation,\nwhich is the platform that I'm using.\n\n109\n00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.309\nI have done all of my updates,\nmy apt-get update to update my catalog and\n\n110\n00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:05.883\nmy apt-get disk upgrade\nto get all of my updates.\n\n111\n00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:09.060\nAnd then I've saved my machines,\nand I'm gone from there.\n\n112\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.650\nSo this is an updated,\n\n113\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.190\ncurrent, running version of\nKali Linux from Offensive Security.\n\n114\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.110\nNow, if we take a look,\nif I open up a terminal,\n\n115\n00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.033\nwe can from the terminal we can\ndetermine what our IP settings are.\n\n116\n00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:26.090\nWe can do our IF Config Now hit enter.\n\n117\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.222\nAnd it shows me that I've\ngot one network adapter.\n\n118\n00:06:28.222 --> 00:06:30.900\nEth0 is gonna be my code for that one.\n\n119\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.203\nAnd I can see that I have picked\nup an Internet address, or\n\n120\n00:06:35.203 --> 00:06:39.882\nan IP address, 1010814,\nwith my subnet mask there.\n\n121\n00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:42.211\nSo it's showing me that\nI have connectivity.\n\n122\n00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:47.333\nIn my virtualization software,\nlet me drop this down a little bit.\n\n123\n00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.760\nLet me put it out of full screen there.\n\n124\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.094\nIf we take a look at the settings for\nthis particular vm.\n\n125\n00:06:53.094 --> 00:06:57.198\nI look at my network adapter, and again,\nthis is where it'll differ at little bit\n\n126\n00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:59.996\ndepending on what your\nvirtualization technology is,\n\n127\n00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:03.820\nI can see this guy is connected to nat,\nused to share the host's IP address.\n\n128\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.980\nWe're doing network address translation\nbetween this virtual machine and\n\n129\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.680\nthe physical network that my laptop\nthat the virtual machine is running on\n\n130\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.220\nthat we're doing NAT in between those.\n\n131\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.740\nSo my laptop is getting an IP address from\nthe local area network that it's connected\n\n132\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.970\nto and my Kali Linux box is getting\nan IP address from virtual machine or\n\n133\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.350\nVM workstation.\n\n134\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.920\nAnd then im NATing in between those two.\n\n135\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:32.780\nSo at this point I should have\nInternet access for this machine,\n\n136\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.750\nif we ping something like\ngoogle.com I get replies, right.\n\n137\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.550\nIt's able to reach out, talk to DNS,\nresolve that name into an IP address,\n\n138\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.325\nreturn that IP address\nback to my command and\n\n139\n00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:49.921\nthen start doing our ICMP echo requests\nand everything is working good.\n\n140\n00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:53.706\nSo, we do have Internet\naccess on this machine.\n\n141\n00:07:53.706 --> 00:07:58.268\nOkay, so I've got my IP address,\nget Internet access, everything is good.\n\n142\n00:07:58.268 --> 00:08:01.408\nNow, I've got my vulnerable machines, and\n\n143\n00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:07.283\nthese again could be from somebody like or\ncapture to the flag type machine.\n\n144\n00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:13.001\nThis is the DVWA,\nthe Darn Vulnerable web application and I\n\n145\n00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:15.504\n&gt;&gt; That darn vulnerable web application.\n\n146\n00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:16.480\nDarn it.\n\n147\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Darn thing.\n\n148\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.200\nIf we look at the settings for this, this\nis one of those vulnerable machines, and\n\n149\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.060\nso when I fire these up and\nlet me find my settings.\n\n150\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.640\nHere we go.\n\n151\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.260\nTalking and clicking at the same\ntime can be challenging.\n\n152\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.890\nI see that this guy is connected\nto a host only network.\n\n153\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.350\nAlmost every virtualization software\nhas this ability to say hey,\n\n154\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.650\nI want to network that's private.\n\n155\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:42.592\nJust to the VMs themselves, it can't reach\nout and talk to the internal network or\n\n156\n00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:46.480\nto the LAN or to the WAN or\nanything like that.\n\n157\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.130\nAgain, because it's specifically\ndesigned to be vulnerable and\n\n158\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.500\nI don't want to expose it.\n\n159\n00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.290\nSo it's set to a host only, and if we were\nto take a look at the settings from we'd\n\n160\n00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.320\nsee the same thing, I go into settings and\nI've got it connected to host only.\n\n161\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.031\nSo if we look at the IP address,\nif I can get this guy up,\n\n162\n00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:08.969\nI get some focus going on here.\n\n163\n00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:12.894\nDo a little ifconfig,\nI don't think I can zoom into this guy for\n\n164\n00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:15.931\nyou I cannot zoom into\nthese virtual machines but\n\n165\n00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.690\nthe IP address is 10.10.1.136 so\nhe's not on the same network.\n\n166\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:27.352\nRemember Kali is on that NAT network\n10.10.8, they're on different networks.\n\n167\n00:09:27.352 --> 00:09:28.613\nIf I look at DVWA.\n\n168\n00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:33.414\nHe's on 10.10.1.127.\n\n169\n00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:36.910\nSo both of my vulnerable machines\nare on that host only network.\n\n170\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.590\nSo what I'd like to do is be able to\nconfigure Kali to be able to connect\n\n171\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.960\nto that network, as well as the Internet,\nat the same time.\n\n172\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.070\nSo I don't have to flip back and forth.\n\n173\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.941\nNow before we get there.\n\n174\n00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.411\nLet's just talk about some general\ncommands working with Kali,\n\n175\n00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.024\nI know we've got this in some other shows,\njust like Linux Basics.\n\n176\n00:09:55.024 --> 00:09:57.934\nWe're going to go over in\nthose shows in detail how\n\n177\n00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:01.053\nto configure your TCP/IP\nsettings in a Kali box, but\n\n178\n00:10:01.053 --> 00:10:04.892\nwe'll do a little refresher here so\nwe can all be on the same page.\n\n179\n00:10:04.892 --> 00:10:07.686\nIf I want to set my network\nadapter settings in Kali,\n\n180\n00:10:07.686 --> 00:10:10.731\nthere's a couple of ways I can do this,\nI can go to my GUI,\n\n181\n00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:13.604\nI can go up to my little power\nbutton up here in the top.\n\n182\n00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:16.236\nAnd let me blow this up for you so\nyou can see a little better.\n\n183\n00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:20.432\nI can go up here, and\nI can go to wired connection, and\n\n184\n00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:22.588\nI can go to wired settings.\n\n185\n00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:27.580\nAnd here is my wired network and I can\nsee current IP address, default routes,\n\n186\n00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.208\nand if I click on the little\ngear icon I'll actually see,\n\n187\n00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:35.550\nI can go down to IPv4 and\nI can see that it's set automatic DHCP.\n\n188\n00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.970\nSo it's calling out,\nfinding a DHCP server,\n\n189\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.770\nmy virtualization software's\nproviding IP addresses for\n\n190\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.790\nthis network, this particular network,\nthe NAT network, all right.\n\n191\n00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.160\nSo it's doing it automatically.\n\n192\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.130\nYou might or\nmight not have DHCP available, so\n\n193\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.230\nyou might need to statically map\nyour network adapter on Kali.\n\n194\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.920\nSo let's look at how to do that.\n\n195\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.040\nAgain, I could do it from here.\n\n196\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.240\nI could go into my gear, go to IPV4.\n\n197\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.330\nAnd change this from automatic to manual.\n\n198\n00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:10.305\nAnd then I can type in the IP address\nthat I wanted to use 10 let's\n\n199\n00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:14.571\ncheck that num lock there,\nwe'll go 10.10.8.\n\n200\n00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:17.964\nI don't know 150, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:22.620\nSet my network mask, set my gateway.\n\n202\n00:11:24.065 --> 00:11:29.137\nYou would need to know this information\nfor your particular network and\n\n203\n00:11:29.137 --> 00:11:33.968\nset my DNS server address we'll just\ngo with a public one out there.\n\n204\n00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:35.325\nWhat else do I wanna configure?\n\n205\n00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:37.709\nAnd my gateway.\n\n206\n00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.718\nI think we'll just,\nI got my gateway configured.\n\n207\n00:11:39.718 --> 00:11:42.660\nThere, we are good,\nI don't need to add any additional routes.\n\n208\n00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.221\nSo I'll go ahead and click apply.\n\n209\n00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:51.470\nAnd I will turn this guy off and\nthen turn that network back on.\n\n210\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.089\nAnd now I can see my new IP\naddress that has been set.\n\n211\n00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:57.998\nIf I go over to my shell, I have config,\n\n212\n00:11:57.998 --> 00:12:03.925\nthere's my IP address that we just set\nstatically now instead of through DHCP.\n\n213\n00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:04.960\nWe try to ping Google.\n\n214\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.690\nEverything's still good,\n\n215\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.720\nI'm able to get out there,\nfind Google's IP address and ping it.\n\n216\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.010\nAll right, but\n\n217\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.150\nas I said, [COUGH] or at least now I\nknow how I can set those IP addresses.\n\n218\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:22.300\nLet's take a look at the,\nhow to configure from the command line.\n\n219\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.400\nThe command here is going\nto be ifconfig again.\n\n220\n00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.200\nSo if, oops I can't spell, ifconfig.\n\n221\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.130\nIf I take a look,\nthere is my new network address.\n\n222\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.220\nIf I want to set that, I need to tell it\nwhat network adapter I'm working with,\n\n223\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.830\nwhat IP address I wanna set,\nwhat network mask I wanna set, and\n\n224\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.790\nI need to my default gateway to that.\n\n225\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:51.846\nSo we could do, ifconfig, eth0,\nwhich is the name of my network adapter,\n\n226\n00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:55.459\nwe saw that from doing\nthe IP config earlier.\n\n227\n00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:58.670\nAnd then the IP address I wanna set,\n10.10, let's do 8.\n\n228\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.889\nWhat'd I do last time, 150,\nso let's do 151, all right.\n\n229\n00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:08.354\nAnd then we're gonna do netMask,\nand that's gonna be 255,\n\n230\n00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:12.170\n255, 255, 0 and\nI'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n231\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.020\nNow if we do another ifconfig,\n\n232\n00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.770\nI'll see that my new IP address\nhas come in and it's now set.\n\n233\n00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.752\nIf you needed to restart that network\nadapter for some reason you can do\n\n234\n00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:31.334\nifconfig eth0 down to turn it just we like\nwe hit that little switch on the GUI.\n\n235\n00:13:31.334 --> 00:13:32.095\n&gt;&gt; On off.\n\n236\n00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so that's turning it off,\nand then up would turn it back on.\n\n237\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.945\nSo sometimes you gotta kick the network\nadapter to get your new setting to take\n\n238\n00:13:41.945 --> 00:13:44.503\nplace, just turn it off and\nturn it back on.\n\n239\n00:13:44.503 --> 00:13:47.930\nAll right we could also\ncheck our route information,\n\n240\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.360\nthe command route will show\nme my routing information.\n\n241\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.023\nI can see that my default gateway is set.\n\n242\n00:13:55.023 --> 00:13:59.304\nThis UG says the interface is up,\nand that is my default gateway.\n\n243\n00:13:59.304 --> 00:14:00.770\nThe g is for gateway, u for up.\n\n244\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:06.800\nYou can actually get a little better\ninformation from doing a route.\n\n245\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.624\nA -n N says don't bother resolving it or\ntrying to use any names,\n\n246\n00:14:11.624 --> 00:14:15.320\njust show me the IP addresses,\nthe numbers.\n\n247\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.650\nAnd now I can see there is my default.\n\n248\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.625\nEarlier it just said default, now it shows\nme, okay, there is my default route.\n\n249\n00:14:21.625 --> 00:14:25.678\nOkay, remember 0000 is your hey,\nif I don't have a route for\n\n250\n00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:28.050\nit, this is where I'm gonna send it.\n\n251\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.120\nAnd I can see that 10 10 82 is my gateway,\nand\n\n252\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.860\nit's got a generic mask there,\nagain, up in gateway.\n\n253\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.540\nAll right, so now we've played around\nwith our actual network adapter settings,\n\n254\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.340\nwe got it configured to\nconnect to the Internet.\n\n255\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.569\nI tell you what I'm gonna do, well no\nwe'll leave it, that's fine, right?\n\n256\n00:14:46.569 --> 00:14:49.312\nCuz right now we've got a statically\nconfigured IP address for\n\n257\n00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:52.329\nthe local area network, I should be\nable to ping things like Google.\n\n258\n00:14:52.329 --> 00:14:56.109\nGoogle just verify that Mike didn't change\nanything, oops you spell that right,\n\n259\n00:14:56.109 --> 00:14:57.729\nit'll ping it a little bit better.\n\n260\n00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.972\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n261\n00:14:59.972 --> 00:15:02.134\nAll right, so, long way around and\n\n262\n00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:06.546\nnow we've got our network adapter\nconfigured for our virtual machine.\n\n263\n00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.335\nIt can connect to our local area\nnetwork and get Internet access,\n\n264\n00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:12.170\nwe can do all of our updates,\nwe're good to go there.\n\n265\n00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.929\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike, at this point how are we\ngoing to get Kali to communicate with\n\n266\n00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:17.505\nthese vulnerable machines?\n\n267\n00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:18.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.\n\n268\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.674\nWhat we're gonna do is,\n\n269\n00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:22.549\nwe're gonna add a second network\nadapter to our Kali Linux box.\n\n270\n00:15:22.549 --> 00:15:26.732\nAnd then, it'll have one network adaptor\nthat's gonna be router to the WAN and\n\n271\n00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:31.104\nhave Internet access of a second network\nadapter that's gonna be connected to that\n\n272\n00:15:31.104 --> 00:15:32.807\ninternal or host only network.\n\n273\n00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:36.772\nThat I can use to communicate with those\nvulnerable machines as we add more and\n\n274\n00:15:36.772 --> 00:15:38.299\nmore and practice our tools.\n\n275\n00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:40.170\nAll right, so,\nlet's see how we can do that.\n\n276\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.827\nAgain, It'll be a little bit different how\nyou go about adding the physical network\n\n277\n00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:46.266\nadapter to your machine\ndepending on your technology.\n\n278\n00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:48.650\nI'm gonna power off my VM.\n\n279\n00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.663\nBecause most virtualization software you\ncannot add remove hardware if it is up and\n\n280\n00:15:53.663 --> 00:15:54.313\nrunning.\n\n281\n00:15:54.313 --> 00:15:57.779\nAlthough, we could, but\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n282\n00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:00.407\nCuz like I said,\nI want to make this work for\n\n283\n00:16:00.407 --> 00:16:03.259\nmost I can say that\nvirtualization software.\n\n284\n00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:04.096\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n285\n00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.498\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nedit my virtual machine settings,\n\n286\n00:16:07.498 --> 00:16:09.280\nand I'm gonna add a piece of hardware.\n\n287\n00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.810\nWe'll say yes, we want to allow that.\n\n288\n00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.440\nWe're gonna do network adapter and\nclick Next.\n\n289\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.580\nAnd for this one, I'm gonna do host\nonly because I've already got one that's\n\n290\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.060\nconnected to the NAT network to\ngo outside to the real world.\n\n291\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.690\nThis one I wanna connect to the host\nonly to my vulnerable machines\n\n292\n00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.650\nthat we'll be testing.\n\n293\n00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.750\nSo now I've got a second network adapter\nthat's listed as host only, I'll click,\n\n294\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.210\nOK, and I'll power this virtual machine\nback up, we'll boot it back up.\n\n295\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.090\nNow, again, some of this virtualization\nwill allow you to add and\n\n296\n00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.960\nremove certain bits of hardware,\neven while it's running.\n\n297\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.070\nBut we shut it down just to be-\n&gt;&gt; Safe.\n\n298\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.655\n&gt;&gt; Safe, yeah, I like that.\n\n299\n00:16:48.655 --> 00:16:49.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n300\n00:16:49.436 --> 00:16:51.170\nwe get this guy booted back up.\n\n301\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.300\nGet logged in.\n\n302\n00:16:57.992 --> 00:16:59.180\nAnd get back to our desktop.\n\n303\n00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.950\nAll right, so here we are back in Kali\nafter adding that second network adapter.\n\n304\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.320\nLet's see what we've got\nwhen we do an IF config.\n\n305\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.200\nWe'll see that I have eth20.\n\n306\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.490\nThat's my first network adapter and\n\n307\n00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.630\nit's picking up an IP\naddress from that network.\n\n308\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.510\nThat's routed out to the real world,\nbeneath one does not have an IP address.\n\n309\n00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:30.990\nNow I know there is dhcp on that host\nonly, because my DBWA and that splittable\n\n310\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.690\nare both picking up IP addresses, but\nthis one did not pick up an IP address.\n\n311\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.290\nSomething's up with that.\n\n312\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.080\nSo if we took a look at our settings,\nand I'm gonna choose the GUI for this.\n\n313\n00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:46.880\nIf I go into eth1, the adapter\nthat I just added, the host only.\n\n314\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.430\nAnd I'm going to go into my wired\nsettings, and we'll turn it on.\n\n315\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.300\nI'm gonna say, okay,\nlet's turn that guy on.\n\n316\n00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.120\nAnd we'll go ahead and close that.\n\n317\n00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.250\nAnd now let's take a look at what we have.\n\n318\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.030\nIf-config, and I can say, there we go,\n\n319\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.630\neth1 is now picking up an IP address\nthat's on that host-only network.\n\n320\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.580\nThat's the 10.10.1 network, perfect.\n\n321\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.440\nBut, no,\nnow eth0 does not have an IP address.\n\n322\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:14.960\nWait a second.\n\n323\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.390\nAnd if I look here, I see [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; This is going gone there.\n\n324\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.260\n&gt;&gt; It's turned off, wait a second,\nwhat's up with that?\n\n325\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.970\nAll right, that doesn't make sense.\n\n326\n00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.960\nSo let's turn that eth0 back on\nthis time we'll use the shell.\n\n327\n00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.129\nI'm gonna say ifconfigethoup,\nnow we've got it.\n\n328\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.400\nI have config, and let's see.\n\n329\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.210\nNothing, nothing there.\n\n330\n00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.112\nAll right, let's go back in the GUI.\n\n331\n00:18:44.112 --> 00:18:45.380\nAnd it's still turned off.\n\n332\n00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.330\nEven though I said on,\nit did say up, right?\n\n333\n00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.530\nYeah, I didn't actually turn it on.\n\n334\n00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.815\nSo we're gonna go back in the GUI and\nturn it on.\n\n335\n00:18:53.815 --> 00:18:56.460\nEth0, wire settings,\n\n336\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.930\nlet's power that guy back up, and\nwe'll go ahead and close that.\n\n337\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.970\nAll right, I can see I'm getting\nan IP address, looking good.\n\n338\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:10.540\nIF config and now eth0 is up,\ngot an IP address, eth1 is down.\n\n339\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.840\nSo this is what I was trying to show you.\n\n340\n00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.260\nWith these pre-built VMs\nfrom fences security\n\n341\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.600\n&gt;&gt; Gets a little tricky trying to add\n\n342\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.110\na second, third network adapter in\nthere to connect to multiple networks.\n\n343\n00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:26.550\nSo, rather than try to add that second\none and tell it to get an IP address\n\n344\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:31.470\nlike normal, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna use profiles instead, all right.\n\n345\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.845\n&gt;&gt; What is profiles,\nhe asked knowing he would find out soon.\n\n346\n00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:38.482\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right, so\nlet's go back here to our settings and\n\n347\n00:19:38.482 --> 00:19:41.464\nI'm gonna go down to\neth1 which is current up.\n\n348\n00:19:41.464 --> 00:19:45.770\nSo I've got eth0 connected\nto the NAT network.\n\n349\n00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.140\nIt's getting an IP address,\nit has internet access.\n\n350\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.560\nThat adaptor is up and running and\n\n351\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.170\neverything's working,\neth1 is currently off.\n\n352\n00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.579\nI'm gonna go into my wired settings for\neth1.\n\n353\n00:19:56.579 --> 00:20:00.090\nThat second network adaptor that\nwe wanna connect to host only.\n\n354\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.800\nAnd rather than turn it on, or\n\n355\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.150\nrather than hit my gear icon or use my\nif config to set a new network address.\n\n356\n00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.664\nI'm gonna click add profile, and\n\n357\n00:20:11.664 --> 00:20:17.116\nin my new profile window I'm\ngonna go down to IPv4 and\n\n358\n00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:21.132\nI'll leave it as DHCP, that's fine.\n\n359\n00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:24.825\nBut I'm gonna scroll down and I could\nstatically map it to a particular address,\n\n360\n00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:28.029\nI'm gonna scroll down, and\nthere's a little check mark down here for\n\n361\n00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:29.170\nthis profile.\n\n362\n00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.410\nUse this connection only for\nresources on this network.\n\n363\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.010\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nselect that and click Add.\n\n364\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.000\nNow you'll notice as soon as I\ndo that eth1 actually turned on.\n\n365\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.640\nIt's now up and running.\n\n366\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.176\nIt's got an IP address that's valid.\n\n367\n00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:52.620\nOn that host-only network everything is\nlooking good there if I look over at eth0,\n\n368\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.160\nit's still up and running.\n\n369\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.665\nAnd it's got an IP address\nthat's found on 10, 10, 8, 14.\n\n370\n00:20:57.665 --> 00:20:58.940\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n371\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.720\nnow we should be able to\nconnect to both networks.\n\n372\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.810\nIf I close that down,\n\n373\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.940\nlet's see what happens we'll ping\ngoogle.com I'm good to go there.\n\n374\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.330\nI'm still getting my name resolution.\n\n375\n00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.903\nLet's ping 1010, oops, check that numlock.\n\n376\n00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:19.526\n10101, what is 127, I think it was DBMA,\n\n377\n00:21:19.526 --> 00:21:22.760\nthere we go, we able ping that one.\n\n378\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.490\nAnd I can also ping 10101,\n\n379\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.540\nI think it was 136 and\nso I'm pinging that one.\n\n380\n00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.450\nSo now I've got both network\nadapters up and running.\n\n381\n00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.180\nI'm able to connect to the Internet\nif I want to do some research or\n\n382\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.340\nupdate a tool, or go out and\n\n383\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.270\nfind a new exploit that I'm trying to\nuse against these vulnerable machines.\n\n384\n00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.870\nSo I've got that connection.\n\n385\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.180\nAnd I still have a connection over\nto the actual virtual machines\n\n386\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.240\nthat are on a network that's\nisolated from everything else.\n\n387\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.050\nSo now we've got a really good\nsetup that we can use to practice\n\n388\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.250\nour security techniques.\n\n389\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:03.100\nWe've got a tool,\nKali with the 600 plus tools in there.\n\n390\n00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.690\nWe've got access to the internet,\nand I've got a nice,\n\n391\n00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.430\nsafe network that I can run my\nvulnerable machines on, and\n\n392\n00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.870\nwe can start playing with things like the\nDVWA, the Darn Vulnerable Web Application.\n\n393\n00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:14.810\n&gt;&gt; That darn one.\n\n394\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got Metasploitable 2,\nthat's got dozens of exploits or\n\n395\n00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.210\nvulnerability setup in there.\n\n396\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.920\nWe can start going out to\nplaces like Vuln Hub and\n\n397\n00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.730\ndownloading some of these CTF,\ncapture the flag type vulnerable machines\n\n398\n00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.620\nthat we can use to\npractice our techniques.\n\n399\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.290\nAnd test out the different tools\nall in a nice, safe network,\n\n400\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:37.949\nkeeping anything else that we're connected\nto from picking up anything bad,\n\n401\n00:22:37.949 --> 00:22:40.491\nand protecting the vulnerable machines,\n\n402\n00:22:40.491 --> 00:22:44.391\nthemselves from somebody else\nfinding them, exploiting them.\n\n403\n00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:47.850\nAnd turning them into a stepping\nstone into the rest of our networks.\n\n404\n00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.508\nSo that is how we're gonna setup Kali to\ngo through the rest of the episodes as we\n\n405\n00:22:52.508 --> 00:22:54.000\nprogress to the series.\n\n406\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n407\n00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.380\nI can't wait so episodes coming up.\n\n408\n00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.760\nWe're gonna actually put this in the we're\ngonna do some Full forensics, right.\n\n409\n00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n410\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.040\nWell, we're gonna do some recognizants,\nwe'll go through discovering the machines,\n\n411\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.760\ndoing our recognizants,\nwe'll look at exploiting those.\n\n412\n00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.220\nBut yeah, we'll walk through all\nthe different tools that we use in Kali.\n\n413\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.505\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\ncan't wait network configuration.\n\n414\n00:23:16.505 --> 00:23:20.340\nKali Linux and there's a whole\nbunch of video's in this series.\n\n415\n00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.130\nMake sure you watch every\nsingle one of them.\n\n416\n00:23:22.130 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.540\nWelcome to ITProTV, I'm your host,\nDon Pezet [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.000\n[MUSIC]\n\n3\n00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.907\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:17.090\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for watching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.460\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Kali Linux.\n\n6\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.268\nAnd right now it's navigating\nKali Linux with our Linux\n\n7\n00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:29.960\nprofessional expert wizard,\nMike Rodrick, right here.\n\n8\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.610\nHey, Mike.\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing, Zach?\n\n9\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.080\nI don't know about all that, but\n\n10\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.238\nyeah, let's take a look at what we can\ndo in Linux, or in Kali I should say.\n\n11\n00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:39.180\nAll right, so this episode is just kinda\n\n12\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.890\ngetting our feet wet as far as\njust working our way around Kali.\n\n13\n00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.110\nJust a couple of little things that I\nwanted to point out to you that will\n\n14\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.130\nmake it easier as we go through\nsome of our future episodes and\n\n15\n00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.710\nstart working with the tools, cuz that's\nreally what it's all about, right?\n\n16\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.340\nWe want to get in here and\nplay with the tools.\n\n17\n00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.650\nThat's why we run Kali, isn't it?\n\n18\n00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.660\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Because it has 600 plus tools built\n\n19\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.370\ninto it But if we can't find them,\nif we can't get to them, it's no fun.\n\n20\n00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.620\nSo let's do a little bit of\nkind of foundation work there.\n\n21\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.170\nWe've got some other great courses in\nthe library where we really go into\n\n22\n00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.600\nbasic Linux commands, and working from\nthe terminal and things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.300\nSo make sure you check those out if\nyou're newer to Linux, in general.\n\n24\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.280\nAs far as Kali goes,\nit's, one of the things\n\n25\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.800\nthat's a good thing about Kali is the fact\nthat there's 600 plus tools built in.\n\n26\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.335\nOne of the downsides of that, though,\nis where are they, how do I find them?\n\n27\n00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:35.885\nWhat are all these crazy tools and\nwhat the heck do they do?\n\n28\n00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:36.805\n&gt;&gt; I do have a question for you.\n\n29\n00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.375\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; What are all these crazy tools and\n\n30\n00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:39.335\nwhat the heck do they do?\n\n31\n00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:41.585\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nI'm glad you asked.\n\n32\n00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.045\nLet's take a look at it, right?\n\n33\n00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:46.845\nOne of the things that I love that they've\ndone, if you go up here to the top and\n\n34\n00:01:46.845 --> 00:01:48.565\ntake a look at my screen, sorry, Megan.\n\n35\n00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:52.700\nAnd we look at the very\ntop left-hand corner,\n\n36\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.475\nI have to remember my right\nfrom my left for a second.\n\n37\n00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:55.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Your other right.\n\n38\n00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nmy other right, military right.\n\n39\n00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.570\nI've got my Applications menu, and\nfrom here, I've got Categories, right?\n\n40\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.730\nYou've got Favorites,\nwhich you can kind of pin and\n\n41\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.324\nunpin things from, which is great.\n\n42\n00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:11.340\nSo things that you use\noften you can put there.\n\n43\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.600\nIf you're still showing\nyour dash to dock or\n\n44\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.920\ndock to dash thing,\nyou can also pin applications down there.\n\n45\n00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.190\nBut below that,\nwe have these categories, right?\n\n46\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.070\nKind of Windows-esque, if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.320\nI know most of you Linux people are going,\ndid he just say that.\n\n48\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.178\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, he did.\nWindows-esque.\n\n49\n00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:33.800\n&gt;&gt; But it does,\nit reminds me a little bit of that.\n\n50\n00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.650\nBut it's categorized.\n\n51\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.380\nSo this first category is\ninformation gathering.\n\n52\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.240\nAnd when I hover over that,\nI get a slide out menu over here.\n\n53\n00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.770\nAnd these are the different tools that I\ncan use for information gathering, right?\n\n54\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.930\nNow, any of these that have a little\ntriangle out to the side of them,\n\n55\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.270\nI can actually click on and\nit will expand it out even further.\n\n56\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.450\nSo these are just some of the most\ncommon information gathering.\n\n57\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.710\nBut if I expand this out,\nI want to do DNS analysis.\n\n58\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.310\nThere's a bunch of DNS\ntools that I can work with.\n\n59\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.020\nWe want to do SMB analysis.\n\n60\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.280\nWell, here's some tools\nthat work with SBM or SMTP.\n\n61\n00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.510\nAnd the idea is,\nI don't know what Squawks is.\n\n62\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.640\nIf they give me a list of tools that I\ncould use, and I wanted to do some SMTP\n\n63\n00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.155\nanalysis, I might not know that Squawks\nis a tool that will work with SMTP.\n\n64\n00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:32.875\nBut I do now because\nit's under SMTP Analysis.\n\n65\n00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:37.295\nSo great way to organize these tools\nin the menu that they developed here\n\n66\n00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:38.795\nby these categories.\n\n67\n00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:40.505\nAnd they did it for that very reason.\n\n68\n00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:41.235\nBecause there's so\n\n69\n00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:45.660\nmany tools, this is a really good way to\nshow them in a small amount of space.\n\n70\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.660\nAnd many of these tools you\nmight not be familiar with.\n\n71\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.610\nAnd so you'll know that if I go\nunder wireless attacks in Bluetooth,\n\n72\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.480\nthat Red Fang is a Bluetooth\nwireless tool that I can use.\n\n73\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.814\nJust simply from where\nit's located on the menu.\n\n74\n00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:04.303\nSo love that feature, it's very,\nvery handy when we're first getting\n\n75\n00:04:04.303 --> 00:04:07.690\nour feet wet with all of\nthese tools in Kali Linux.\n\n76\n00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.800\nSo that's the way the menu is laid out.\n\n77\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.280\nYou simply click on one obviously, and\nit would launch that tool, all right?\n\n78\n00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.400\nAnd then you've got your systems\nservices and your usual applications,\n\n79\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.300\naccessories, Internet.\n\n80\n00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.930\nSome of your standard applications\nthat you get with most\n\n81\n00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.210\noperating systems are included as well.\n\n82\n00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.390\nSo lots and lots and lots of tools there.\n\n83\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.245\nIt always makes me laugh cuz\npeople go there's not that many.\n\n84\n00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:33.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Until you realize that each one of\n\n85\n00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.330\nthose expandable and has subcategories.\n\n86\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.340\nAnd some of those have\nscroll bars on them.\n\n87\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.320\nThere are a lot of tools.\n\n88\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.760\n&gt;&gt; Are the dependencies here too, or no?\n\n89\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.520\n&gt;&gt; Not so much.\n\n90\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670\nYou just find the tool,\nclick on it, launch it.\n\n91\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.540\nSome of them are going\nto have a GUI interface.\n\n92\n00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.590\nSome of them will just open up a terminal\nwith that command started there.\n\n93\n00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.020\nWhich brings us to another point.\n\n94\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.220\nYou can always, like I can go, let's\nsay I want to do some scanning, right?\n\n95\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.660\nI wanna run Nmap.\n\n96\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.910\nI don't know where it is on here.\n\n97\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.970\nSo we could do sniffing and\nspoofing, probably, or\n\n98\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.890\ninformation gathering, would be one.\n\n99\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.191\nYeah, and there's Nmap.\n\n100\n00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:12.800\nSo I can click it, and\nI can launch Nmap, right?\n\n101\n00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.875\nIt gives me the help.\n\n102\n00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:18.690\nCuz it's basically like typing\nNmap with no parameters in there.\n\n103\n00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.030\nOr if I know the name of the tool I want,\nthen I can simply come in here and\n\n104\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.270\ntype in Nmap.\n\n105\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.290\nAnd we could launch it that way as well.\n\n106\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.534\nSo either way, you wanna go to the menu,\nyou want us to open up the terminal,\n\n107\n00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:32.010\ntype in if you already\nknow the name of the tool.\n\n108\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.420\nUsually the menu's a great place to start,\nand then once you're familiar with\n\n109\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.780\nthe tools that you like, you can just\nlaunch them up there from the terminal.\n\n110\n00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.940\nYou can also go into\nyour show applications.\n\n111\n00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.510\nIf you have this little\ndock still on your screen,\n\n112\n00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.230\nI know some people might have hidden\nit permanently, taken it off.\n\n113\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.436\nI think we talked about\nthat in another episode-\n\n114\n00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:52.522\n&gt;&gt; Right, right customizable.\n\n115\n00:05:52.522 --> 00:05:57.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou can click show applications Maybe.\n\n116\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.650\nThere we go.\n\n117\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.930\nAnd it takes me to this screen here.\n\n118\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.660\nAnd it starts on frequent, and these are\nthe things that I've used recently, right?\n\n119\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.330\nOr I can switch to All, and\nit shows me those same categories, and\n\n120\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.420\nI can navigate through there.\n\n121\n00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.310\nBut I can also just type Nmap, right?\n\n122\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.810\nAnd it shows me, look I've got Nmap, I've\ngot Zenmap, and I've got Zenmap as root.\n\n123\n00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.045\nSo a few different ways you can go\nabout launching the applications.\n\n124\n00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:25.850\nYou'll see there's several screens here,\n\n125\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.160\nyou can see this little dots as\nI scroll and go through those.\n\n126\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.790\nAll right, so that is how we can\ngo about finding our applications,\n\n127\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.080\neither through the menu or\nthrough your show applications, or\n\n128\n00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.795\nsimply typing the name\nin the terminal there.\n\n129\n00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.490\nAll right,\n\n130\n00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.260\nnow the next thing I wanna talk about is\nhow we can find things in the file system.\n\n131\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\nhow do we locate them?\n\n132\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.690\nI mean, if we wanna do it quickly.\n\n133\n00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.396\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's a few\ndifferent commands that Kali has or\n\n134\n00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:56.780\nLinux in general has, actually,\nit's not just a Kali thing.\n\n135\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.650\nThe three big commands that we'll use,\nlocate, which, and find.\n\n136\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.320\nEach one has a specific use and purpose,\ndoes things a little bit differently.\n\n137\n00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:13.660\nLocate is a command I can use to search\nthrough all of the files on my system.\n\n138\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.702\nRemember, in Linux,\neverything is really a file.\n\n139\n00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.511\nAnd Locate is how I can\nfind where is a file is.\n\n140\n00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:24.690\nIf I need the path to that file,\nI can use the Locate command.\n\n141\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.930\nBut locate relies on a database.\n\n142\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.870\nIt's a locally stored\ndatabase of all your files.\n\n143\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.580\nAnd so you need to update that\ndatabase periodically, typically,\n\n144\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.650\nevery time you use,\nthey say run it every time you use Locate.\n\n145\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.930\nIf you haven't added a lot of files,\nthere's really no point in updating it.\n\n146\n00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.600\nBut it doesn't take that long.\n\n147\n00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.509\nLet me just show you what I mean here.\n\n148\n00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:47.212\nLet me open up a show.\n\n149\n00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:52.740\nAnd let's update the database first.\n\n150\n00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.466\nSo we'll do update DB.\n\n151\n00:07:55.466 --> 00:07:56.093\nAnd that's it.\n\n152\n00:07:56.093 --> 00:07:57.446\nIt's just update DB.\n\n153\n00:07:57.446 --> 00:07:58.084\nYou run it.\n\n154\n00:07:58.084 --> 00:07:58.952\nIt takes a minute.\n\n155\n00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:02.734\nAnd it's indexing the system It's\nadding entries into the database and\n\n156\n00:08:02.734 --> 00:08:04.970\nit's gonna make everything searchable.\n\n157\n00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.135\nSo now if I wanna find something,\nlike let's locate fasttrack.\n\n158\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.380\n&gt;&gt; That's fast crack?\n\n159\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.454\n&gt;&gt; That's fasttrack.\n\n160\n00:08:14.454 --> 00:08:14.973\n&gt;&gt; Fasttrack [LAUGH].\n\n161\n00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:16.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's just, right?\n\n162\n00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:19.578\nAnd there it is, so\nyou type and locate fasttrack.\n\n163\n00:08:19.578 --> 00:08:23.158\nThe text which is actually a wordlist,\nthat I use with some of the password\n\n164\n00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:26.010\ncrackers and things like that,\nand there is my path to it.\n\n165\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.860\nSo now I know where on\nthe system that file is.\n\n166\n00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.794\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n167\n00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:34.836\n&gt;&gt; So if I needed to type it in,\nin a command when I'm running, John or\n\n168\n00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:39.088\nsomething like that, And\nthen the command is I've got my input for\n\n169\n00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:42.130\nmy parameter for\nwordlist that wanna load up.\n\n170\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.773\nWell, I need to type in the path\nto that wordlist, down my note.\n\n171\n00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:47.770\nIn fact, I can just copy it from there and\nI don't even have to type it, right?\n\n172\n00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.400\nWell, that's one thing we could do.\n\n173\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.120\nBut like I said,\nyou do need to update that database.\n\n174\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.240\nLet's see if we can test that theory out.\n\n175\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.730\nLet me make a file and I'm gonna call it,\njust for zachfuzzyears.txt.\n\n176\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.772\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n177\n00:09:02.772 --> 00:09:03.720\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n178\n00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.485\nAnd then we'll see,\nwe'll see where to locate this.\n\n179\n00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:12.477\nFuzzyears.txt.\n\n180\n00:09:12.477 --> 00:09:14.730\nAnd notice I got no results.\n\n181\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.000\nWait a second, I just created that file.\n\n182\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.580\nIf I do an LS,\nthere is the file right there in the same\n\n183\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.140\ndirectory that I'm currently at, and\nyou're telling me Locate can't find it?\n\n184\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.650\nBecause remember,\nLocate is not searching the file system,\n\n185\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.330\nit's looking in the database.\n\n186\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.790\nAnd I created this file after\nI've updated the database.\n\n187\n00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.560\nSo that's what I was trying to say\nearlier, is when you run this command,\n\n188\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.840\nit's a good idea to update\nthe database first.\n\n189\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.780\nLet's try it, update Db and now,\n\n190\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.080\nLocate fuzzyears.txt.\n\n191\n00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.924\nAnd notice it finds it,\njust fine, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:54.924 --> 00:09:59.279\nSo Locate, great command to use to find\nthe location of a file but it is dependent\n\n193\n00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:03.740\non the database and if you haven't\nupdated database, you won't find it.\n\n194\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.144\nI know, when I first started playing\naround with this, I was like,\n\n195\n00:10:07.144 --> 00:10:08.470\nI just wrote that script.\n\n196\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.049\nI know it's there somewhere,\nwhere the heck is it?\n\n197\n00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:14.840\nAnd the reason I couldn't find it was,\ncuz I did not update the database first.\n\n198\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.152\nUpdate Db and then Locate.\n\n199\n00:10:17.152 --> 00:10:22.200\nAll right, so that's great for finding\na particular file on the system, but\n\n200\n00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.580\nit is based on that database.\n\n201\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.470\nThe next command I wanna show\nyou is the Which command.\n\n202\n00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.470\nAnd the Which command is\na little bit limited.\n\n203\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.919\nIt's showing you, it will search\nthrough your environment variable,\n\n204\n00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:35.529\nyour path environment\nvariable I should say, right?\n\n205\n00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:40.755\nSo the only place that it's going to look.\n\n206\n00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:45.132\nAnd when I talk about your path,\nenvironment variable,\n\n207\n00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:50.154\nPath environment variable,\nwe say echo $ path There is my path.\n\n208\n00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:55.481\nSo /user/local/bin,\n/user/local/sbin, sorry,\n\n209\n00:10:55.481 --> 00:11:01.123\nwas the first one,\n/user/local/bin was the second entry,\n\n210\n00:11:01.123 --> 00:11:06.720\n/user/sbin, /user/bin,\nand /sbin on it's own.\n\n211\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.080\nAnd /bin on its own.\n\n212\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.050\nSo if it's located in one of those places,\nWhich will find it.\n\n213\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.869\nLet's see.\nWhich If i did fuzzyears,\n\n214\n00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:21.669\nI can't type today.\n\n215\n00:11:21.669 --> 00:11:25.660\nIt's not gonna find it\nbecause it's not in my path.\n\n216\n00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.290\nIt's not searching the entire system.\n\n217\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.910\nIt's not searching a database.\n\n218\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.690\nIt's only looking in those locations.\n\n219\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.429\nSo which is one?\n\n220\n00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:37.789\nAnd typically, if we're looking for\nexecutables and scripts,\n\n221\n00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:42.090\nwe usually put them in one of\nthese locations, sbin or bin.\n\n222\n00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.760\nEither under my local user,\nunder the global bin or sbin.\n\n223\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.560\nSo I could use Which to find it that way.\n\n224\n00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.762\nLike I should be able to\ntype in Which in Map, right?\n\n225\n00:11:53.762 --> 00:11:56.910\nAnd there's User bin and Map.\n\n226\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.748\nCuz it was in one of the locations\nthat it knows to check.\n\n227\n00:12:01.748 --> 00:12:04.530\nOne of the locations that's in my path.\n\n228\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.780\nSo Which only searches your\npath environment variable.\n\n229\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.060\nYou can customize your path, right?\n\n230\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.050\nIf you wanna make a folder, separate,\nthat you keep certain things in.\n\n231\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.470\nAnd you want Which to\nbe able to search that,\n\n232\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.740\nthen add to your environment\nvariable that location.\n\n233\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.580\nAnd now the which command will\nsearch that particular location.\n\n234\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.050\nAll right.\n\n235\n00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.612\nAnd then the last one I\nwanna show you is Find.\n\n236\n00:12:29.612 --> 00:12:34.109\nAnd Find is probably,\nit is the most aggressive,\n\n237\n00:12:34.109 --> 00:12:38.940\nmight be a good word to use for\nit, or interrogative.\n\n238\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.270\nI don't even know if that's a proper\nword but it really does a deep search.\n\n239\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.170\nIt's not searching\nthe database like Locate does.\n\n240\n00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.750\nThis is actually going-\n&gt;&gt; Tenacious.\n\n241\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.630\n&gt;&gt; Tenacious, there we go.\n\n242\n00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.320\n&gt;&gt; That's it, it's tenacious.\n\n243\n00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.490\n&gt;&gt; So this one is searching\nthrough the file system\n\n244\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.560\nbased on the path that you give it, and\n\n245\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.830\nit can also search recursively\nwithin that path that you give it.\n\n246\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:07.700\nFor example, well let's do that\nsame file fasttrack.txt, right.\n\n247\n00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:15.900\nIf I just do, Find fasttrack I think\nit was a text file, .txt, all right?\n\n248\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.030\nNo such file or directory.\n\n249\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.510\nSo it can't find fasttrack.\n\n250\n00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.130\nBecause it's looking in\nmy current directory.\n\n251\n00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.410\nI just try fasttrack without it,\nsays, No such file or directory.\n\n252\n00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.784\nWhat if I do this, though?\n\n253\n00:13:29.784 --> 00:13:33.494\nFind, you know what, I need to do\na dash name, I almost forgot that.\n\n254\n00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:36.950\nLet's do -name Fasttrack, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.770\nThere we go,\nthat's the result I'm looking for.\n\n256\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.180\nThis was telling me,\nI typed the command incorrectly.\n\n257\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.332\nCuz with Find, you really have three\nparameters that you should provide it.\n\n258\n00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:48.381\nTwo parameters.\n\n259\n00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:52.476\nFind is the command and then where you\nwanna start the search, what level in\n\n260\n00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:56.612\nthe directory you wanna start the search,\nAnd then what you're searching for.\n\n261\n00:13:56.612 --> 00:14:00.140\nSo if I leave out the start\nlocation of the search,\n\n262\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.190\nit's gonna use my current location,\nwhich I'm in my home directory.\n\n263\n00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.712\nAnd there's nothing in my home\ndirectory named fasttrack.\n\n264\n00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:14.259\nI wanna search the entire drive though,\nI could add the path root, right?\n\n265\n00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:15.830\nIs that fine?\n\n266\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.420\nStarted the root at the very\ntop of the file structure and\n\n267\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.200\nlook for something named fasttrack,\nall right?\n\n268\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.790\nAnd here we go.\n\n269\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.300\nAnd if you noticed, it's taken to\nthe second because it is recursive.\n\n270\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.202\nIt's going through folders and\nsubfolders looking for the file,\n\n271\n00:14:32.202 --> 00:14:34.470\nand sure enough, it found it.\n\n272\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.990\nBut what's interesting here is,\n\n273\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.380\nthat's not actually what I\nwas looking for, all right?\n\n274\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.950\nThe one thing about Find\nis it's very specific.\n\n275\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.300\nI said find something called fasttrack?\n\n276\n00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.088\nAnd it found something called fasttrack,\nnot fasttrack.txt.\n\n277\n00:14:51.088 --> 00:14:55.470\nI didn't tell it to look for\nfasttrack.txt, I said, just fasttrack.\n\n278\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.220\nSo fasttrack.txt does not come back.\n\n279\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.080\nWhat I would need to do is dump in a\nwildcard, if I didn't know the extension.\n\n280\n00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.312\nIt's either a .lst or .txt,\nI know it's a wordlist, but\n\n281\n00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:09.100\nI can't remember what\nthe actual extension is.\n\n282\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.670\nI can throw a wildcard on\nthe end of there, fasttrack*.\n\n283\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.030\nSo fasttrack and\nthen anything else after that.\n\n284\n00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.600\nLet's see what my results look like now.\n\n285\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.710\nLook at that.\n\n286\n00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.110\nStill have the original fasttrack\nwith nothing after it, but\n\n287\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.930\nnow I've got the fasttrack.txt\nwhich is in my wordlist directory,\n\n288\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.035\nWhich was the one i was looking for.\n\n289\n00:15:27.035 --> 00:15:30.946\nBut I also have fasttrack.pie, .pyc,\n\n290\n00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:35.550\n_httpserverpyc, and a few others there.\n\n291\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.408\nSo with the Find, you're gonna\ngive it a starting directory, and\n\n292\n00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:44.534\nthen the name of the file,\n-name, name of the file, And\n\n293\n00:15:44.534 --> 00:15:48.470\nyou can use wildcards like your asterisk,\nbefore or after the name.\n\n294\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.820\nLet's say,\nI know it's in that wordlist folder,\n\n295\n00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:59.115\nI think it should be in wordlist and\nI think it's called fast something.\n\n296\n00:15:59.115 --> 00:16:02.838\nNo, there's a rock u something in there,\nthat's an even bigger wordlist, but\n\n297\n00:16:02.838 --> 00:16:06.809\nI can't remember exactly what it's called,\nAnd I wanna use it with John the Ripper.\n\n298\n00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:08.261\nSo what I can do is something like this.\n\n299\n00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.480\nFind, oops,\nyou've got to spell that right.\n\n300\n00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.610\nAnd then given my path.\n\n301\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:19.714\nI know it's in user switch share,\nswitch word list, oops.\n\n302\n00:16:22.738 --> 00:16:25.910\nAll right, so\nthere's my path to start the search.\n\n303\n00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.230\nAnd look for something named.\n\n304\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.635\nIt's rock something or other.\n\n305\n00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.102\nAnd there we go, all right?\n\n306\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.120\nI'm not sure why these\nother ones actually came.\n\n307\n00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.180\nRock asterisk.\n\n308\n00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:38.800\nThat's interesting.\n\n309\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.880\nI'm not sure why that one popped up.\n\n310\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.320\nThere is rock q dot tex dot gz.\n\n311\n00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.750\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it really is tenacious.\n\n312\n00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.820\n&gt;&gt; That's the one I was\nactually looking for.\n\n313\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.980\nThe only thing I configure is within\nthat file there might be something\n\n314\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.000\nthat says rock.\n\n315\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.736\nThat's kinda interesting.\n\n316\n00:16:59.167 --> 00:16:59.915\nYou know what?\n\n317\n00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:01.250\nNo, I did that wrong.\n\n318\n00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.790\nSo there's an example of Mike not\nfollowing his own instructions.\n\n319\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.878\nYou know what I've left off?\n\n320\n00:17:05.878 --> 00:17:07.690\nWas the .name.\n\n321\n00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.360\nSo it actually returned\neverything in that directory.\n\n322\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.031\nThat makes a little more sense-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n323\n00:17:13.031 --> 00:17:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Than why it returned\nderb when I search rock.\n\n324\n00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.880\nSo let's do that command correctly.\n\n325\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.598\nLet's clear my screen.\n\n326\n00:17:19.598 --> 00:17:21.395\nRun that command again.\n\n327\n00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:25.279\nLet's do a -name rock.\n\n328\n00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:26.160\nThat should give us\nsome different results.\n\n329\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:28.940\nThere we go.\n\n330\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.437\nSee what happens when you\nuse the command correctly?\n\n331\n00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:33.110\nI like it.\n\n332\n00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.250\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n333\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.870\nUse your wild cards to use that.\n\n334\n00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:42.270\nSo, three different commands I can use\nto locate things on my file system.\n\n335\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.180\nLocate, which relies on that\ndatabase which you need to update\n\n336\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.720\nto make sure you've included\nall latest added files.\n\n337\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.870\nWhich, that only looks through your\nenvironment variable dollar sign path.\n\n338\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:01.430\nAnd then Locate, which requires a start\nsearch and then a dash name parameter.\n\n339\n00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.420\nAnd you can use wild cards in there.\n\n340\n00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.690\nAnd it does a recursive search through\nwhatever directory you started at.\n\n341\n00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.370\n&gt;&gt; What about history?\n\n342\n00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.352\nCan we look at that?\n\n343\n00:18:10.352 --> 00:18:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you've probably seen me\nuse it several times throughout these\n\n344\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.220\nepisodes that we've been shooting here.\n\n345\n00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.610\nIf I use my up arrow to bring\nthat last command back,\n\n346\n00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.770\nI'm actually using my history.\n\n347\n00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.920\nBash maintains history.\n\n348\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And what I mean by that is it's\n\n349\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.410\nremembering all the different\ncommands that I've typed.\n\n350\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.800\nAnd I can use my up and\n\n351\n00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.740\ndown arrows to navigate through\nall of those different commands.\n\n352\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.040\nI could go back to commands\nthat we did on our last show.\n\n353\n00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.290\nIn fact,\nthere's my CTL start Apache2, right?\n\n354\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.010\n&gt;&gt; There it is, yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.460\n&gt;&gt; That was in a different episode,\nnot even this episode.\n\n356\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.980\nSo this is unlike Windows,\nalthough Window is changing,\n\n357\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:58.025\nwhere your history was only\nmaintained while that shell was open.\n\n358\n00:18:58.025 --> 00:19:00.550\nLinux keeps it in a file.\n\n359\n00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.570\nAnd that way, it'll survive closing and\nthen reopening the shell.\n\n360\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.690\nIt'll survive reboots.\n\n361\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.080\nYou can always go back and\nget to your history.\n\n362\n00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.210\nYou can view your history by simply\ntyping history, if I can spell that.\n\n363\n00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.280\n&gt;&gt; History.\n\n364\n00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.600\n&gt;&gt; And there's all the commands that I\nhave typed since I cleared my history,\n\n365\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.502\nwhich I'm gonna show you how\nto do in a second, all right?\n\n366\n00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:23.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was my next question,\n\n367\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.295\nis how do you clear the history?\n\n368\n00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:28.620\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And it's something that I know I did\n\n369\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.766\nsome research on when I first started\nplaying around with Kali and Linux,\n\n370\n00:19:33.766 --> 00:19:38.839\nin general, because as a newbie you\ntype a lot of commands incorrectly.\n\n371\n00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:41.917\nAnd so\nmy history was full of incorrect commands,\n\n372\n00:19:41.917 --> 00:19:44.830\ncommands that wouldn't actually run.\n\n373\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.850\nAnd so I definitely did some research,\nhow do I get rid of those entries?\n\n374\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.880\nBut for now, let's say that we\nwanna use history, all right?\n\n375\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.590\nSo again,\nhistory is the command to see it.\n\n376\n00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.370\nNow, notice that they've got\na number out next to them.\n\n377\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.830\nThat number is just the order\nin that history file.\n\n378\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.820\nSo this is line 42 in that\nhistory file and it's a CD.\n\n379\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.430\nLet's do one that's a little\nmore exciting here.\n\n380\n00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.870\nLeaf pad bash rc.\n\n381\n00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.460\nNotice that's number 44.\n\n382\n00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:22.680\nSo if I wanna execute that command again,\nI could up-arrow until I see the command.\n\n383\n00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.230\nI could just go all the through,\n\n384\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:29.070\nstarting at 119, working my way up,\nuntil I get to that command.\n\n385\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.201\nOr I could type in,\nbang, let's say 44, 44.\n\n386\n00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:35.820\n&gt;&gt; 44\n&gt;&gt; And look,\n\n387\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.870\nit ran the command,\nwhich was to leave pad, bash rc.\n\n388\n00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.030\nAnd sure enough, ran the command,\nand opened up bash rc, all right?\n\n389\n00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.678\nSo to view your history,\njust type history, and\n\n390\n00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:51.568\nyou're gonna see a list of all\nthe commands that are stored in history.\n\n391\n00:20:51.568 --> 00:20:53.911\nIf you have a particular one\nthat you want to execute,\n\n392\n00:20:53.911 --> 00:20:57.120\nyou can use the exclamation point,\nand then a line number.\n\n393\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.520\nExclamation, exclamation\npoint runs the last command.\n\n394\n00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.683\n&gt;&gt; Just the very last one?\n\n395\n00:21:03.683 --> 00:21:07.940\n&gt;&gt; Just the very, whichever one\nwas the last command that you ran.\n\n396\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.610\nThat's an interesting one to me.\n\n397\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.150\nI'm sure there's some logic behind it.\n\n398\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.390\nI can simply use my up arrow once and pull\nthe last command I typed back as well.\n\n399\n00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.600\n&gt;&gt; They give you options.\n\n400\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, options are always good, right?\n\n401\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.900\nSo I'm not going to run\nthat command again.\n\n402\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.230\nI don't want leaf pad to open up.\n\n403\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.200\nSo bang, or exclamation point,\n\n404\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.440\nnumber, executes a particular command\n&gt;&gt; Exclamation point,\n\n405\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:35.380\nexclamation point is going to execute\nthe very last command that you issued.\n\n406\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.562\nLast thing that I wanna show\nyou here is how to clear-\n\n407\n00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.872\n&gt;&gt; Get rid of that darn history once you\n\n408\n00:21:39.872 --> 00:21:40.567\nfound it.\n\n409\n00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:43.032\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nbecause once you get more comfortable, and\n\n410\n00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:47.780\nyou're typing your commands correctly,\nyou might wanna flush the old ones out.\n\n411\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.470\nOr I'll tell you another reason to clear\nyour history is let's say your making\n\n412\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.550\na MySQL connection.\n\n413\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:59.400\nWell, you type in MySQL,\nthe IP address, and you connect.\n\n414\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.330\nAnd what's it gonna do?\n\n415\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.480\nIt's gonna prompt you for a password,\nwhich you're promptly gonna type in.\n\n416\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.610\nGuess what's gonna show up\nin your history, right?\n\n417\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.800\nThat command that you just typed,\nyour password included.\n\n418\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.330\nSo there are gonna be times,\n\n419\n00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.260\nespecially if it's a multi-user system,\nthat you'd wanna clear that history out.\n\n420\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:22.340\nSo history-c will clear my history out.\n\n421\n00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.360\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.\n\n422\n00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.940\nThat's way too easy.\n\n423\n00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.618\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n424\n00:22:25.618 --> 00:22:27.640\n-c for clear.\n\n425\n00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.635\nRemember, you can always do a man-history,\n\n426\n00:22:29.635 --> 00:22:32.008\ncuz there's a lot more things\nyou can do with history.\n\n427\n00:22:32.008 --> 00:22:37.370\nI know we go over a lot of this\nstuff in our basic LINUX show.\n\n428\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.730\nThere's refer to my number.\n\n429\n00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.580\nOne less than that number.\n\n430\n00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.930\nThere's all kinds of parameters\nthat you can do with history.\n\n431\n00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.550\nI'm just showing you a couple\nof the most commonly used ones.\n\n432\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.336\nSo now that I have cleared my history,\nbut then I did type man history,\n\n433\n00:22:54.336 --> 00:22:56.466\nlet's see what my history looks like.\n\n434\n00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:02.039\nIt looks likes I've only got two\nentries in there, man-history and\n\n435\n00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:04.386\nthe command I just typed, history, right?\n\n436\n00:23:04.386 --> 00:23:07.070\nSo history -c to clear your history.\n\n437\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.020\n&gt;&gt; Like it never even happened.\n\n438\n00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.970\nSo Kali Linux, and\nthis is navigating Kali.\n\n439\n00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.400\nAnd wonderful information.\n\n440\n00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.735\nAnything else you want to leave\nus with before we say goodbye?\n\n441\n00:23:18.735 --> 00:23:22.653\n&gt;&gt; As we progress I'm sure we'll throw\nsome more things in there about navigating\n\n442\n00:23:22.653 --> 00:23:23.774\nand things like that.\n\n443\n00:23:23.774 --> 00:23:26.630\nBut it's about time to start\nplaying with some tools\n\n444\n00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun.\n\n445\n00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.150\nSo, Kali Linux.\n\n446\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.800\nLot of video in this series.\n\n447\n00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.710\nMake sure you see all the videos,\nyou'll be very glad you did.\n\n448\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.166\nMike, excellent job.\n\n449\n00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:37.133\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n450\n00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:40.116\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n451\n00:23:40.116 --> 00:23:41.382\nI am Zach

ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.108\nyou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:19.890\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.980\nAnd today, we're gonna be diving into\nsome of the fundamental tools that you\n\n9\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.070\nneed to know about.\n\n10\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.120\nSpecifically, the idea\nof some Net Cat basics.\n\n11\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.260\nAnd here to help us out, of course is,\nwell, Mr. Security, himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.680\nMike, welcome to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.390\nHow are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great, Ronnie,\nthanks for having me.\n\n15\n00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.750\nAnd yeah, I'm kind of excited.\n\n16\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.560\nCuz today we are gonna start getting\ninto some of the tools that we\n\n17\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.250\nreally wanted to use, right,\nwhen we started learning about Kali Linux.\n\n18\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.570\nWe've done a lot of episodes setting up,\ngetting it installed, getting some initial\n\n19\n00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.700\nconfiguration, post installation\nconfiguration done, things like that.\n\n20\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.425\nAnd now we want to start looking at\nthe 600 plus tools that are in Kali Linux,\n\n21\n00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.485\nso sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.\n\n22\n00:00:58.485 --> 00:00:59.155\nNo, just kidding.\n\n23\n00:00:59.155 --> 00:01:00.860\nWe won't do all 600 in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.585\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n25\n00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:06.621\nMike, it kind of makes sense that we\nneed to understand some of these tools.\n\n26\n00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:08.987\nSo why did you choose Netcat?\n\n27\n00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:12.017\nWhat is it about Netcat that makes\nit special, what does it do?\n\n28\n00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.057\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Ronnie.\n\n29\n00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:15.647\nYou know, there's a few tools that\nI would say that are apart of\n\n30\n00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:19.987\nthe Kali Linux Distribution, or really,\nwhen you're doing pen testing in general,\n\n31\n00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:22.687\nthat you really need to have\na good understanding of.\n\n32\n00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:27.200\nThey're kind of like your basic tools,\nlike every person,\n\n33\n00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.930\nor mechanic would probably have a hammer,\na flat head, and\n\n34\n00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660\na Phillips screwdriver and\na pair of pliers, right.\n\n35\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.830\nThose would be considered basic tools.\n\n36\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.360\nAnd then depending on what else you do,\nyou might have specialized tools.\n\n37\n00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.450\nLike I do a lot of wood work, so I have\na jigsaw, or I have a drill press or\n\n38\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.300\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n39\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.870\nSo there's a lot more tools, but\n\n40\n00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.920\nthere are some basic tools\nthat just everything uses.\n\n41\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.580\nAnd that's really what I wanted to focus\nin on first with some of your basics,\n\n42\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.230\nlike Netcat, like the one\nwe're getting ready to do now.\n\n43\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.630\nAnd Netcat is a tool that allows me\nto create TCP in UDP connections.\n\n44\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.370\nThat's really one of its main functions,\nif you will.\n\n45\n00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.259\nIt's been around since,\nI wanna say it was released in 2007 by\n\n46\n00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.028\na guy named only known or\na guy only known as Hobbit.\n\n47\n00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:16.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not the hobbit but just Hobbit.\n\n48\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.450\nA brilliant gentleman, or\nwoman, don't really know.\n\n49\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.170\nBut the developer's name was Hobbit.\n\n50\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.820\nAnd he wrote this code, and he released\nit without any type of licensing.\n\n51\n00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.270\nHe said I don't want to mess with GNU,\n\n52\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.460\nI don't want to mess with any\nof this other stuff, this is.\n\n53\n00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.670\nUse it as it's free.\n\n54\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.170\nAnybody can have the source code.\n\n55\n00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.050\nDo whatever you want with it\ncommercial free, doesn't matter.\n\n56\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.940\nI don't care.\n\n57\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.410\nHere it is for the world to enjoy.\n\n58\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.970\nSo kudos to Hobbit for\nwriting such a great program, and\n\n59\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.790\nthen making it available like that.\n\n60\n00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200\nBut it has become known as basically\nthe Swiss Army knife of hacking tools,\n\n61\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.740\nbecause it does a lot.\n\n62\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.670\nAnd it's very basic.\n\n63\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.010\nIt's very small, and\nit does a great job of what it does.\n\n64\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.080\nSome of the things we might use it for,\nyou know, besides opening up a TCP and\n\n65\n00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.070\nUDP connection, or\nUDP connection between two machines.\n\n66\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.540\nI think, well, why?\n\n67\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.600\nSo we can do all kinds of things.\n\n68\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.610\nCould be just a simple chat between two\nmachines, could be moving files back and\n\n69\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.720\nforth, lot's of stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.600\nThat we'll kinda expand on as we go.\n\n71\n00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.890\nIt does do port scanning.\n\n72\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.040\nAlthough it's not really\nthe tool to do that with.\n\n73\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.230\nIt can do some basic port scanning.\n\n74\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.660\nWe have some other tools that are much\nbetter than that, or better at it\n\n75\n00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.680\nthan that, but in a bind and all you\ncan get out of your victim machine, or\n\n76\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.900\nthe machine you're trying to pen\ntest is a Netcat, we can use that.\n\n77\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.870\nIt's a lot smaller than say,\nEndMap, well, maybe not that much.\n\n78\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.180\nPort forwarding, you can do port\nforwarding It can work as a proxy,\n\n79\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.820\nit´s just very very flexible.\n\n80\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.190\nIt can be a simple web server and\nserve up a one page website.\n\n81\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.900\nFantastic, use this all\nthe time when I need to\n\n82\n00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.060\nget something from one machine to another.\n\n83\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.580\nYou just browse to this website,\nand you can grab this file.\n\n84\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.300\nAnd it makes a great back door.\n\n85\n00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.060\nIt´s a very common utility\nto get a reverse shell, or\n\n86\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.800\nto bind a shell to a port and\nget that shell capability, or\n\n87\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.410\nact as a backdoor back into\na machine that's been compromised.\n\n88\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.190\nSo it's a very very powerful tool.\n\n89\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.303\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Mike, before we start,\n\n90\n00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:28.581\nbecause we're gonna take a look\nat how this tool works here.\n\n91\n00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:33.001\nNot so much the background, but kind of\ngive me a scenario on just if I wanted to\n\n92\n00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:37.421\npick a tool to use, when would I go, all\nright, [SOUND] Netcat is kind of the one\n\n93\n00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.587\nthat I go, all right, I need to jump\nto Netcat to do something like this.\n\n94\n00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:42.840\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n95\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.780\nDuring the initial phases,\nif we talk about penetration testing,\n\n96\n00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.620\nwe talk about the phases,\nin that early phase, the very first one,\n\n97\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.130\nreconnaissance Netcat is gonna be a go-to\ntool, because it does the banner grabbing.\n\n98\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.270\nAnd again, there are other tools that\nwe can do this with, but sometimes you\n\n99\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.220\nwanna have more than one choice, and\nthis one's a very very simple one to do.\n\n100\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.690\nWe'll take a look at banner\ngrabbing here first.\n\n101\n00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.870\nSo banner grabbing would be one of\nthe big reasons that it's a go-to guy for\n\n102\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.880\nme, and then just getting a reverse shell.\n\n103\n00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.230\nAfter, when we started getting into\nthe exploit phase of a penetration test.\n\n104\n00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.680\nIf I need a reverse shell,\nNetcat is a very common one to go to.\n\n105\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.890\nBecause it's small, it's easy to\npackage up, get over to the other side.\n\n106\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.129\nAnd for transferring files,\nif I need to get.\n\n107\n00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.000\nLet's say I'm attacking a Windows machine,\nI want to get Wget or\n\n108\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.410\nsome other program over there.\n\n109\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.280\nNetcat's a very easy way\nto get that over there.\n\n110\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.360\nYou'll find that once you get familiar\nwith Netcat, it's a go to tool.\n\n111\n00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.470\nIt really is.\n\n112\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.210\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Mike, let's go ahead and\n\n113\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.980\ntake a look at what you\nwere talking about.\n\n114\n00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.240\nWe wanna start off with that\nidea of banner grabbing?\n\n115\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.750\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n116\n00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.530\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand\n\n117\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.470\nI've just got my Kali Linux box opened up.\n\n118\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.870\nI've also got meta exploitable running,\nand I think that's where we'll take a look\n\n119\n00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.800\nat so if I If I wanna do, well first\nlet's just do Netcat and a little -h.\n\n120\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.490\nAlright?\n\n121\n00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.350\nAnd this is something you should do with\nany tool that you start working with.\n\n122\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.730\nYou should also look at the manpage\nthat's associated with it.\n\n123\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.390\nYou'll get much more detailed\ninformation and some examples.\n\n124\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.326\nBut here the -h gives me some simple help.\n\n125\n00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:20.851\nAnd I can see, connect to somewhere.\n\n126\n00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:25.046\nNC for Netcat,\nyou can actually type netcat or NC.\n\n127\n00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:28.733\nUsually most Linux just distros there is\nactually a couple different versions of\n\n128\n00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:31.890\nNetcat, there is the original\nnetcat written by Hobbit.\n\n129\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.690\nthere is a GNU license netcat There's\nan OpenBSD version of Netcat.\n\n130\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.800\nAnd then Nmap, the organization that\ncreated Nmap also created their Ncat,\n\n131\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.290\nwhich is a new and\nimproved version as well.\n\n132\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.460\nWe'll take a look at that.\n\n133\n00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.430\nA lot of it depends on\nthe distro that you're using.\n\n134\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.580\nAnd in the end, It doesn't matter so\n\n135\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.330\nmuch as far as Netcat versus open VSD,\nthe switches might be a little different,\n\n136\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.482\nbut if you do your help,\nit should showyou.\n\n137\n00:06:56.482 --> 00:07:00.310\nThe NCAT, the one from Nmap is\ndefinitely a little bit different on\n\n138\n00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.170\nthe way the switches work, but\nthe N Cat and C pretty much are the same.\n\n139\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.405\nLike in Kali, it's just alias to\nwhether you type N cat or not,\n\n140\n00:07:08.405 --> 00:07:14.150\nhere' I can show you if I type man NC,\nI get the man page for NC, right?\n\n141\n00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.600\nThe TCPIP Swiss army knife.\n\n142\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.820\nIf I quit out of that, and I do man\nnetcat, you see I get the same man page.\n\n143\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.720\nSo it's not two different\ntools in this case,\n\n144\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.230\nit's just the same links\npointing one to the other.\n\n145\n00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.870\nSome of the switches I\ndo want to point out.\n\n146\n00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.390\nThere are a lot of them, but\nthe ones that we'll use primarily,\n\n147\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.010\nare gonna be, I like the nswitch,\nnumeral only IP addresses no DNS.\n\n148\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.325\nIt removes any issues I might\nhave with name resolution,\n\n149\n00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:47.495\nI love the v switch, the verbose,\nbecause I like to see information.\n\n150\n00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:50.211\nDon't hide anything,\nshow me what's going on.\n\n151\n00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:53.665\nThe l switch is for listen mode.\n\n152\n00:07:53.665 --> 00:07:57.507\nNetcat works as both the client And\nthe sever, all right?\n\n153\n00:07:57.507 --> 00:07:59.291\nYou're going to establish a connection,\n\n154\n00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.520\nyou got the server end of things that's\ngonna be listening for a connection.\n\n155\n00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.810\nIt opens up a port, it's actively\nlistening for a connection attempt.\n\n156\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.080\nThe client side of things would\nbe what connects to the server.\n\n157\n00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.820\nNow it could be on either end, right?\n\n158\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.860\nI might be connecting,\nI might be running the client locally,\n\n159\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.350\nconnecting to a server on\na compromised machine.\n\n160\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.710\nOr it could be the other way around,\nwhere I'm running a server.\n\n161\n00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.660\nI've compromised a machine and\nI connected back to my server.\n\n162\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.850\nSo, there's no the server's always on this\nend, the client's always on that end, or\n\n163\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.840\nanything like that, but\nit can flip back and forth.\n\n164\n00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.560\nAnd the L is what puts me\nin that server mode, right?\n\n165\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.600\nThis is, listen,\nI'm gonna establish a port number and\n\n166\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.050\nI'm gonna listen for\ninbound connections on that.\n\n167\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.240\nSo N, V, L, and\n\n168\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.630\nthen P to specify the actual port number\nthat you're gonna listen on, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.565\nSo, those are the biggest ones,\nE is another one we'll end up using today.\n\n170\n00:08:49.565 --> 00:08:55.730\nA program to execute after connect,\nyou notice it says dangerous, and it is.\n\n171\n00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.349\nThat's how we do our shells,\nour BI shells and our reverse shells.\n\n172\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.500\nAll right, so a few of the basic switches.\n\n173\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.380\nNow, Ronnie, I think we can get into\nactually doing some banner grabbing.\n\n174\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.122\nSo NC, Netcat or NC,\neither one would work,\n\n175\n00:09:09.122 --> 00:09:12.473\nNC a little bit shorter, and then -NV.\n\n176\n00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:15.393\nWe just talked about that,\nN being my No DNS, or\n\n177\n00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:20.299\nnumbers only, whichever way you wanna\nremember it, and then V being verbose.\n\n178\n00:09:20.299 --> 00:09:22.000\nAll right, so -NV.\n\n179\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.918\nYou can do these separately\nlike I can do it nc -n -v.\n\n180\n00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:30.920\nBut you could also combine them\njust a -nv makes it a lot easier\n\n181\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.400\nto type the IP address that\nyou're trying to connect to.\n\n182\n00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.420\nAnd this is gonna be 1.136.\n\n183\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.830\nAnd then the port number that I\nwanna do the banner grabbing on.\n\n184\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.890\nAll right, and there we go.\n\n185\n00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.860\nAnd if you can that,\nI can see that I've connected,\n\n186\n00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.200\nthat's gonna fail the connections\nactually not going to be established.\n\n187\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.420\nBut that's not what I'm trying to do,\nI am successfully connecting to that port.\n\n188\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.090\nThat tells me that port is open.\n\n189\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.020\nProbably already knew this because we\nran in map of some of the port scanning\n\n190\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.970\nto determine that port was open,\nbut maybe I didn't.\n\n191\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.160\nMaybe I was just doing a shot\nin the dark with netcap.\n\n192\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.080\nSo it does tell me hey, the port is open.\n\n193\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.350\nIt tells me that it thinks it's\nrunning that SSH service and\n\n194\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.030\nit shows me The banner,\nI should say thing.\n\n195\n00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.590\nSo it knows,\n\n196\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:20.950\nit sees the information that that SSH\nserver on that machine is spitting out.\n\n197\n00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.190\nSo we get a couple things out of this.\n\n198\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.140\nSo even though it doesn't actually\nconnect, we see the ports open and\n\n199\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.630\nwe see what services are running on there.\n\n200\n00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.750\nAnd we get a lot of version information.\n\n201\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:36.060\nI can see that it's SSH 2.0, open SSH,\n4.7 PL, W and 8 go into one.\n\n202\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.900\nWhat good does that do me?\n\n203\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.480\nWell, in our next phase as we\ngo through our penetration test,\n\n204\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.725\nI can now look for\nexploits specific to that version of SSH.\n\n205\n00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:50.655\nRight?\nIt's an older version, and\n\n206\n00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:53.605\nthere have been security patches and\nfixes applied to that.\n\n207\n00:10:53.605 --> 00:10:56.955\nWhich means the old versions were\nbroken and had security flaws.\n\n208\n00:10:56.955 --> 00:10:59.345\nAnd there are most\nlikely exploits written.\n\n209\n00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:02.145\nOr I can write my own exploits\nto take advantage of that.\n\n210\n00:11:02.145 --> 00:11:05.265\nSo getting that version\ninformation on a service is\n\n211\n00:11:05.265 --> 00:11:09.585\nextremely important when we're doing\npenetration testing, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.690\nNow let me knock myself out of there.\n\n213\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.490\nDo that one more time.\n\n214\n00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.810\nIf I actually hit enter a couple of times,\nand I'll do it a little slower this time.\n\n215\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.900\nWhen I type in that command and\nI hit enter it just shows me that banner\n\n216\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.100\nthat's sent back and\nit just sits there and flashes at me.\n\n217\n00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.705\nIf you hit enter a couple more A couple\nmore times basically saying keep talking.\n\n218\n00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:32.085\nWe'll see that the servers\nthat it doesn't connect.\n\n219\n00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:34.585\nIt says,\nhey protocol mismatch in this case.\n\n220\n00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:35.675\nAnd I get to my prompt.\n\n221\n00:11:35.675 --> 00:11:38.275\nSo it's a little bit awkward there.\n\n222\n00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:41.780\nYou look at that blinking prompt and\nnot know exactly what's going on\n\n223\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.650\nHit enter a few times and\neither it will close the connection, or\n\n224\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.800\nsometimes it'll spit\nout boring information.\n\n225\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.130\nBut basically it was waiting for\ncommands right?\n\n226\n00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.580\nIt was sitting there talking\nto that SSH service.\n\n227\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.050\nAll right, so, let's try another one.\n\n228\n00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.500\nLet's do NC dash, in fact I'll\njust bring my last command back.\n\n229\n00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.180\nLet's change that to Port 80.\n\n230\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.080\nA common web port And\n\n231\n00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.720\nI can see eighty http open, and\nit's just sitting there blinking at me.\n\n232\n00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.810\nNow what I want to do is i am going to\nfire a command at it, let's say http git.\n\n233\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.320\nAnd there go, let me blow this up and\n\n234\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.100\nyou see there it actually did an http git,\nand returned the web page!\n\n235\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.030\nThat is the actual index page, or\nhome page for that web server.\n\n236\n00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.380\nIt's not pretty,\nit's not formatted, right?\n\n237\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.970\nIt's not actually applying the HTML\ntags or anything like that.\n\n238\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.080\nIt's just spitting them out, but\nI can see what is on their webpage.\n\n239\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.750\nLet's do it again.\n\n240\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.160\nCause getting the webpage might be good,\n\n241\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.990\nthere might be some information on there\nabout the company or maybe there are some\n\n242\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.430\ncomments in that webpage where I might\nfind IP addressed of other servers that\n\n243\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.490\nthe web server connects to,\ncould be a lot of information in there.\n\n244\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.980\nI'd also like to know what version\nof a web server they are running.\n\n245\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.431\nSo in this same context\nwe can type in the head,\n\n246\n00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:11.740\nhttp 1.0, and this is just some syntax\nthat goes on behind the scenes,\n\n247\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.590\nyour browser and web server that\nis hosting Google or Facebook or\n\n248\n00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.870\nwhat have you is doing this\nstuff in the background alright!\n\n249\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.660\nThis is something you don't normally see\nunless you are capturing raw packets but\n\n250\n00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:29.807\nhead space forward slash\nspace http slash 1.0.\n\n251\n00:13:29.807 --> 00:13:34.190\nI hit enter and it should return\nthe header information and\n\n252\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.330\ninformation about the server.\n\n253\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.400\nIt's thinking about it.\n\n254\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.490\nThinking about it, there we go,\n\n255\n00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.970\nI hit enter one more time,\nagain if it doesn't respond,\n\n256\n00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.900\nhit enter a couple time and see And this\ntime, it did spit out the webpage itself.\n\n257\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.140\nLook at this extra information I got here.\n\n258\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.930\nI can see there's their server.\n\n259\n00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.980\nThey're running Apache 2.2.8.\n\n260\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:02.440\nAgain, great information to have as\nthe bad guy or the penetration tester,\n\n261\n00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.470\nbecause now I can hone in on that version\nand see what exploits are available.\n\n262\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.340\nIt's running PHP 5.2.4,\nthat's probably good to know as well.\n\n263\n00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.820\nPHP, known to have some exploits\nin some older versions.\n\n264\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.590\nSo here's,\nthis is just showing the power of.\n\n265\n00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.910\nWe can just sit there and\ngo through ports, one after one after one.\n\n266\n00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.450\nI probably have My NMAP output.\n\n267\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.240\nI don't know, you know?\n\n268\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.070\nIt's kind of funny because if\nI say I have my NMAP output,\n\n269\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.800\nNMAP does great banner grabbing as well.\n\n270\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.220\nSo maybe I don't go back to NetCat.\n\n271\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.280\nBut I might be in a scenario where,\nyou know, NetCat's available.\n\n272\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.270\nIt's what I've got.\n\n273\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.170\nAnd I want to do some banner grabbing.\n\n274\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.620\nAnd there's other options.\n\n275\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.940\nYou can actually go through and\nfind, you can do Ranges and\n\n276\n00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:50.790\nsay I wanna do banner grabbing\nacross multiple IPs as well.\n\n277\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:57.240\nAll right so, banner grabbing\nis our first use for Netcat.\n\n278\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.410\n&gt;&gt; All right so,\n\n279\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.300\nMike you'd also mentioned earlier in that\nlist of different things that we could do\n\n280\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.030\nyou'd mentioned the idea of being able to\ntake a look at the TCP connections too?\n\n281\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see how we can do that, so\n&gt;&gt; You know, with the banner grabbing\n\n282\n00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.760\nwe're letting that cat talk to\nthat port and retrieve whatever\n\n283\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.210\ninformation that service is offering when\nsomebody tries to connect to that port.\n\n284\n00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:19.730\nWe're talking about TCP connections,\n\n285\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.570\nnow we're talking about connecting to\ncomputers via TCP or we could do it UDP.\n\n286\n00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.720\nWe'll stick with TCP for this one.\n\n287\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.170\nAnd the process is setting up the server.\n\n288\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.950\n&gt;&gt; And then getting a client and\nconnecting to that server.\n\n289\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.500\nThat's our basic mental\npicture we should have.\n\n290\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.780\nSo I want to set up a server.\n\n291\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.260\nSo let's do NC for\nnet cat and then dash NDLP.\n\n292\n00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.230\nThis is just my personal thing.\n\n293\n00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.130\nI always do NDLP.\n\n294\n00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.830\nYou might or might not.\n\n295\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.750\nUse those same ones.\n\n296\n00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.099\nThe L you need to use because L is listen.\n\n297\n00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:53.514\nThat´s what turns on your server.\n\n298\n00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:54.705\nSo you have to use that one.\n\n299\n00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:58.465\nYou need to do the P because you´re\ngoing to tell it what port to listen on.\n\n300\n00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:00.764\nThe end, if you want to use DNS names, or\n\n301\n00:16:00.764 --> 00:16:05.150\nthe v if you don't want the verbose\noutput, you can leave those off.\n\n302\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.616\nBut I understand I have it,\nof always typing in v, and\n\n303\n00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:11.397\nthen LP if I'm setting up the server side.\n\n304\n00:16:11.397 --> 00:16:14.797\nAll right, so we'll do NVLP,\nand give it a port number.\n\n305\n00:16:14.797 --> 00:16:18.460\nI'll use 9999, that's something\nI know is not in use currently.\n\n306\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.318\nI'll hit Enter.\n\n307\n00:16:19.318 --> 00:16:22.415\nAnd there we go, listening on any,\n\n308\n00:16:22.415 --> 00:16:27.283\nthat means any TCPIP address,\nand then port 9999.\n\n309\n00:16:27.283 --> 00:16:28.817\nSo now I've got a server.\n\n310\n00:16:28.817 --> 00:16:34.007\nIn fact if we were to\nopen up a new terminal,\n\n311\n00:16:34.007 --> 00:16:41.088\nbump that font size up one and\nlet's do a net stat, right?\n\n312\n00:16:41.088 --> 00:16:45.833\nWe should see right there, oops.\n\n313\n00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.450\nLet me just start there.\n\n314\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.570\nNetcat is listening on port 9999.\n\n315\n00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.859\nIf I blow that up,\nthe formatting will be a little better.\n\n316\n00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:58.230\nThere, you can see TCP Port\n9999 listening, Netcat.\n\n317\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.590\nSo our server is up and running.\n\n318\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.260\nIt is ready to go and\nI locked up my Linux box.\n\n319\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.512\nThere we go.\n\n320\n00:17:05.512 --> 00:17:07.490\nAll right, so I've got a server.\n\n321\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.960\nHow do I connect to that server?\n\n322\n00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.929\nWell, let's go over to\nmy good old WIN10 box.\n\n323\n00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:18.681\nNow Windows,\nthere is a version of Netcat for Windows.\n\n324\n00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:22.163\nI went ahead and took the liberty\nof getting it and installing it,\n\n325\n00:17:22.163 --> 00:17:26.485\nyou can get it from GitHub, there's a few\ndifferent places that you can find it.\n\n326\n00:17:26.485 --> 00:17:29.005\nJust do a Google for\nNetcat for Windows, and\n\n327\n00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:31.333\nyou should be able to find the binaries.\n\n328\n00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.156\nThere's actually one in Kali, and\n\n329\n00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:37.240\nI'll show you how to transfer that over\nto Windows in just a minute, all right?\n\n330\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.350\nBut let me pop open a shell here.\n\n331\n00:17:41.329 --> 00:17:46.270\nAnd let's bump that font up so\nyou guys can see that a little bit better.\n\n332\n00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:52.091\nAnd we'll make that a little bit wider,\nand a little bit yeah,\n\n333\n00:17:52.091 --> 00:17:53.040\nthat should be good.\n\n334\n00:17:56.643 --> 00:17:58.319\n[SOUND].\n\n335\n00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:01.924\nSorry, let me just get it fine tuned so\nwe can fit it all on the screen there, and\n\n336\n00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:02.810\nmake it look good.\n\n337\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.210\nAll right, there we go.\n\n338\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.960\nAll right, so on my Windows machines,\n\n339\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.567\nI've already got something\nlistening on port 9999.\n\n340\n00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:13.490\nNow I need to know the IP address\nof that server to connect.\n\n341\n00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:17.370\nI need a protocol, and an IP address,\nand a port number, all right?\n\n342\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.830\nSo we're gonna do Netcat.\n\n343\n00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:25.587\nWe're just gonna use TCP and\n-nv for no dns verbose output.\n\n344\n00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:29.977\nAnd then the IP address\nwhich is 10.10.8.14,\n\n345\n00:18:29.977 --> 00:18:33.368\nI hope, and then the port number 9999.\n\n346\n00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:40.391\nAnd I get this unknown\n(10.10.8.14) 9999 (?) open.\n\n347\n00:18:40.391 --> 00:18:45.490\nAnd then it just blinks at me, now I\nthink, well that was exciting, wasn't it?\n\n348\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.490\nAll right, let's switch over to Linux and\nsee what we've got.\n\n349\n00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:53.078\nConnect to 10.10.8.14\nfrom unknown 10.10.8.10.\n\n350\n00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:57.467\n10.10.8.10 is my Windows box, and\nit's actually coming in from port 1964.\n\n351\n00:18:57.467 --> 00:19:00.003\nSo at this point, we have a connection.\n\n352\n00:19:00.003 --> 00:19:01.889\nDo we?\n\n353\n00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:05.330\nHey, Windows box.\n\n354\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.239\nAnd there we go to Windows, and look.\n\n355\n00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:12.992\nHey, Windows box.\n\n356\n00:19:12.992 --> 00:19:17.598\nHello, Mr. Linux, right?\n\n357\n00:19:17.598 --> 00:19:20.130\nAgain, it's a glorified chat room,\nall right.\n\n358\n00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.490\nHello Mr. Linux shows up there.\n\n359\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.518\nIt's not really the point of Netcat.\n\n360\n00:19:24.518 --> 00:19:31.064\nYou can see how easy it is to establish a\nTCP connection between these two machines.\n\n361\n00:19:31.064 --> 00:19:35.240\nAnd again, this was really one of\nthe initial purposes of this tool,\n\n362\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.860\nwas to be able to establish TCP or\nUTP connections easily.\n\n363\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.514\nIf you go through and read some of\nthe the man page, not the man page,\n\n364\n00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:45.271\nbut the read me from the original guy,\nHobbit, and\n\n365\n00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:48.633\nhe'll talk about why he developed this and\nthings like that.\n\n366\n00:19:48.633 --> 00:19:53.493\nAnd it was just a very simple easy\nway to create a session across TCP or\n\n367\n00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:56.210\ncreate that connection.\n\n368\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.840\nAll right, so with this maybe you\nwant to talk to your buddy or\n\n369\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.610\nyou want to talk to the person you're\ntrying to hack into, I don't know.\n\n370\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.940\nBut this forms the basis of\nthe other stuff that we can do.\n\n371\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.530\nThat ability to create that TCP\nconnection then turns into, well, wait.\n\n372\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.470\nIf I can make that connection that easy,\nwhat else can I do?\n\n373\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.520\nCan I start moving files back and forth?\n\n374\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.380\nCan I start establishing\nshells between those machines?\n\n375\n00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.240\nAnd, in fact, we can.\n\n376\n00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.291\nAll right, to get out of this,\nwell let me say one more thing.\n\n377\n00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:33.776\nIt is important if you understand\nthe difference between the server and\n\n378\n00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:35.770\nthe client site effects, right?\n\n379\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.510\nThe server is the one that's doing the\nlistening, the one that has the open port\n\n380\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.910\nthat is bound to Netcat and is actually\nlistening for the inbound connection.\n\n381\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.980\nThe client is over here on Win 10, right?\n\n382\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.009\nAnd when we did this we're initializing\nthe client side of Netcat,\n\n383\n00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:56.050\nbecause we didn't put the L,\nwe didn't put the listener in there.\n\n384\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.840\nAll right,\nI'll Ctrl+C to kill that connection.\n\n385\n00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.352\nThere we go, and\nwe'll be good to go there.\n\n386\n00:21:05.352 --> 00:21:09.806\nAnd then if I go back over to Kali we'll\nsee that my connection is closed over here\n\n387\n00:21:09.806 --> 00:21:10.950\nas well.\n\n388\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.600\nNow, interesting, let's see netstat -antp.\n\n389\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.784\nNotice it is no longer\nlistening on that port.\n\n390\n00:21:19.784 --> 00:21:24.018\nIt listens, somebody makes a connection,\nthe connection closes,\n\n391\n00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:25.777\nit tears down the listener.\n\n392\n00:21:25.777 --> 00:21:30.220\nAnd the listener is not going t sit\nthere and wait for the next connection.\n\n393\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.740\nThere are ways to make that permanent.\n\n394\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.460\nWe can do a capital L.\n\n395\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.870\nI know in Windows, I think in Linux,\nit's the same thing.\n\n396\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.438\nLet's just check.\n\n397\n00:21:38.438 --> 00:21:43.310\nNetcat -h,\nsee if they give us that option in Linux.\n\n398\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.215\nI don't see it in Linux,\n\n399\n00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:46.599\nI want to say in Windows,\nit's capital L to make that permanent.\n\n400\n00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:50.403\n&gt;&gt; All right now Mike, that's\na great example of what can be done.\n\n401\n00:21:50.403 --> 00:21:54.089\nYou said that we can build upon this,\nwhat would we actually want to try and\n\n402\n00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:54.810\ndo next then?\n\n403\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.048\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably one of the most\ncommon things to do with this is\n\n404\n00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:03.470\nto create what we call bind shells or\nreverse shells.\n\n405\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.790\nAnd what we're really doing is we're,\nin the case of a bind shell,\n\n406\n00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:12.830\nwe're gonna bind our terminal,\nour bash shell in the case of Linux,\n\n407\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.440\ntypically your bash shell,\nto a port to a listener.\n\n408\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.380\nAnd then, whoever connects to\nthat port will be presented\n\n409\n00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.030\nwith that bind shell and they can\nrun commands on your system, right?\n\n410\n00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:31.468\nIf it's from a Windows machine\nwe'd be binding cmd.exe, right?\n\n411\n00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:35.200\nOur shell on Windows,\nwe'd be binding that to a listening port.\n\n412\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.629\nAnd then anybody that connects to that\nport would then be able to run commands\n\n413\n00:22:39.629 --> 00:22:43.310\nin that shell, or in that cmd,\nor that DOS prompt, all right?\n\n414\n00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.430\nThat's really what we\nmean by a bind shell.\n\n415\n00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.460\nBind shells work great internally.\n\n416\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.145\nThe things is, you've got to be\nable to connect to the IP address.\n\n417\n00:22:53.145 --> 00:22:57.473\nSo if Ronnie, for example, says,\nhey, I bound CMD to port 9999,\n\n418\n00:22:57.473 --> 00:23:02.380\nif you want to connect to it and help me\nout, I need some help fixing this machine,\n\n419\n00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.231\nif he's got an internal private\nIP address, [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n420\n00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:09.382\nAnd I'm on the same network as Ronnie,\nshouldn't be a problem, right?\n\n421\n00:23:09.382 --> 00:23:12.801\nBut what if there's firewalls in a way\nin our public infrastructure between us.\n\n422\n00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:15.354\nIt's a non-routable IP address.\n\n423\n00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:19.140\nI'm not gonna be able to type his\ninternal private IP address and\n\n424\n00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.900\nexpect to reach across the Internet and\nconnect to his machine.\n\n425\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.285\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n426\n00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:26.910\nThat's where reverse shells come in.\n\n427\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:32.990\nSo instead of Ronnie,\nlet's say I need Ronnie's help.\n\n428\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.670\nBut I can't bind my shell to\nmy private IP address and\n\n429\n00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.130\nexpect Ronnie to connect to it.\n\n430\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.592\nWhat I can do is have Ronnie\nset up a listener and\n\n431\n00:23:42.592 --> 00:23:46.696\nI can send my shell to Ronnie, to his\nlistener, and then the return traffic of\n\n432\n00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:50.768\ncourse it's gonna be net to net,\neverything is going to work out just fine.\n\n433\n00:23:50.768 --> 00:23:54.498\nThat's what's called a reverse shell,\nand I know that's a tricky concept to\n\n434\n00:23:54.498 --> 00:23:56.659\nunderstand, so\nI did make up some drawings.\n\n435\n00:23:56.659 --> 00:24:01.395\nThat we'll take a look at before we\nactually get into trying to set this\n\n436\n00:24:01.395 --> 00:24:02.127\nthing up.\n\n437\n00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:06.730\nSo here's an example of a buying\nshell between a couple of machines.\n\n438\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.310\nI've got Alice and Bob,\ngood old A and B, right?\n\n439\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.090\nAlice and Bob,\nI made Alice a Linux machine.\n\n440\n00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:17.580\nI've got Bob on a Windows machine\n[COUGH] and let's say that Bob you know,\n\n441\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.900\nwants Alice to connect to\nhis machine to help him out.\n\n442\n00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.590\nWell we'll use good, or white hat,\n\n443\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.660\nscenarios as we talk about this,\nall right.\n\n444\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.680\nSo what Bob is gonna do is say hey Alice,\n\n445\n00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.690\nI need your help,\ncan you connect to my machine?\n\n446\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.544\nI'm gonna set up listener, he'll write\nMcat NVLP, right there's my listener,\n\n447\n00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:38.767\nmy port number 9999.\n\n448\n00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:43.689\nAnd he's gonna use that dash e,\nremember when we looked at\n\n449\n00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:48.562\nthat help file the dash e was\nexecuted program CMD.exc.\n\n450\n00:24:48.562 --> 00:24:50.100\nSo basically what he's doing is saying,\n\n451\n00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:54.065\nhey machine I want you to\nlisten on port 9999, and\n\n452\n00:24:54.065 --> 00:24:57.419\nwhen somebody connects I want you to\npresent them with a command problem.\n\n453\n00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.640\nAlice then, from her machine,\nis able to type in NC -nv,\n\n454\n00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.740\nBob's IP address, and the port number.\n\n455\n00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.580\nAnd it should send her\nover a command prompt.\n\n456\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.530\nShe'll be sitting there staring at C:.\n\n457\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.132\nOn her Linux machine,\nshe will have a C:, right?\n\n458\n00:25:14.132 --> 00:25:15.180\nAnd I'll show you.\n\n459\n00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.050\nWe'll do this here in a minute.\n\n460\n00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.850\nThe opposite would just be\ninstead of binding cmd.exe,\n\n461\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.990\nyou'd be binding your shell,\nin this case, bin bash.\n\n462\n00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.020\nSo she runs the same command.\n\n463\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.020\nAnd let's say again, reverse the scenario.\n\n464\n00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.540\nAlice wants Bob to connect remotely\nto her machine to help her out.\n\n465\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.210\nSo she's gonna run net cat NVLP\n999 dash e slash bin slash bash.\n\n466\n00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.050\nI hope then Bob runs his net cat, the\nclient end connects to her IP address port\n\n467\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:49.200\nnumber and it's gonna present her with\na shell, with a bash shell, right?\n\n468\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.410\nSo in this case these\nare both what's called\n\n469\n00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.560\nbinding a shell cuz you're\nbinding a shell to.\n\n470\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.400\nAnd let me see if Ronnie.\n\n471\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.632\nI'm gonna try the handy\ndandy presentation mode.\n\n472\n00:26:01.632 --> 00:26:03.970\nAnd I didn't get my pencil.\n\n473\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.810\nStill new at the presentation\nmode on our drawing tools.\n\n474\n00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:10.150\nSo let's kill that.\n\n475\n00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.580\nSo where was I going with that.\n\n476\n00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.560\nSo in this case,\nBob is binding cmd.exe to a port number.\n\n477\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.990\nBut that address has to be reachable,\nright?\n\n478\n00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.820\nAlice has to connect to that IP address.\n\n479\n00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.190\nIn this case they're on the same network.\n\n480\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.880\nSame thing with Alice the other way.\n\n481\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.650\nBob's connecting to an internal private\naddress everything works just fine.\n\n482\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.540\nIf Bob was denied,\nlet's pretend Bob had a public IP address.\n\n483\n00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.550\nSo I couldn't just have Bob\nconnect to my machine, actually,\n\n484\n00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.200\nit's this one over here.\n\n485\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.420\nI can't just have Bob bind a shell.\n\n486\n00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:50.225\nSo, what I'm going to do,\nis have Alice set up the listener, right?\n\n487\n00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:55.200\nCuz if Bob needs help, I want Alice to\nhave a command prompt on Bob's machine,\n\n488\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.890\nInstead of starting with Bob and\n\n489\n00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.150\nsetting up a server,\ncuz Bob´s the one that needs help, right?\n\n490\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.398\nIn this scenario, Bob needed help,\nBob ran the server.\n\n491\n00:27:03.398 --> 00:27:08.998\nFor the reverse shell Bob needs help,\nAlice is, I´m sorry, did I do that right?\n\n492\n00:27:08.998 --> 00:27:10.310\nI hit the wrong tab..\n\n493\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.390\nAlice is gonna set up the server,\nNC NvLP 999.\n\n494\n00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:19.610\nAnd then Bob is going to forward his\ncommand prompt to that listener.\n\n495\n00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.340\nSo in the end, kind of the same thing, but\n\n496\n00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.690\nwe're going about it in a different\ndirection, hence the name reverse shell.\n\n497\n00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.560\nRather than have Bob bind a shell to\na port number that we connect to,\n\n498\n00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.470\nwe're gonna have Bob send the shell\nto a port number we're listening on.\n\n499\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.140\nAll right and\nthis is the most common attack scenario.\n\n500\n00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.550\nThis is what the bad guys are doing.\n\n501\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:47.000\nThis is what we're doing as pin testers,\nis we're doing something like this.\n\n502\n00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.930\nThe machine I wanna compromise is\nBob's Window's Machine, all right.\n\n503\n00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.310\nSo what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna set\nup a listener on my attack machine.\n\n504\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.080\nAnd then I'm gonna package up some code,\n\n505\n00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.140\ntake advantage of some exploit on his\nsystem that I found he's running an old\n\n506\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:08.110\nversion of some application as a buffer\noverflow issue or something like that and\n\n507\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:14.210\nI'm gonna package all the net cat\nreverse shell code in that exploit.\n\n508\n00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:18.980\nAnd so when I exploit Bob's\nmachine It executes this command\n\n509\n00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.070\nwhich connects back to my attack\nmachine and presents me with a shell.\n\n510\n00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.310\nTypically running at system\nwith system level access.\n\n511\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.660\nThat's the whole idea\nbehind a reverse shell.\n\n512\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.560\nI can't get them to set\nup a bind to bind their\n\n513\n00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.500\nshell to a port that I can connect to.\n\n514\n00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.130\nBut I can take advantage of an exploit,\n\n515\n00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:40.590\nhave it send a shell back\nto my listening port.\n\n516\n00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.590\nAnd the reverse would be\ntrue if we wanted to do it.\n\n517\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:48.160\nIf we were either Bob,\nAlice needed help, right?\n\n518\n00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.544\nWe could say, all right,\nBob set up a listener on port 9999.\n\n519\n00:28:51.544 --> 00:28:53.190\nAll right, Alice.\n\n520\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:58.270\nI've got a listener set up on port 9999,\nsend me your shell She can run\n\n521\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:04.540\nN get NV port number E bin bash, which\nwill then push that shell out to Bob.\n\n522\n00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.860\nIn the attack scenario, now we're\nattacking from the windows box, and\n\n523\n00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.200\nwe're trying to compromise the Calley box.\n\n524\n00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.260\nSo we set up a listener on port 9999.\n\n525\n00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.480\nI package up some code that's gonna\ntake advantage of an exploit.\n\n526\n00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.340\nI run that on Alice's\nmachine In that exploit,\n\n527\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.260\nit executes this reverse shell, and\nsends a shell back to me, the attacker.\n\n528\n00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.760\nAnd i now have system\naccess to that machine.\n\n529\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.740\nSo there's the concept behind both\na bind shell and a reverse shell.\n\n530\n00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n531\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.800\nThis actually is very exciting because\nit actually does show the power of what\n\n532\n00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.130\nMcat or Netcat can do for us.\n\n533\n00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.850\nBut we do also want to see it in action\nbut we're going to save that for\n\n534\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.270\na part 2 one he netcap basics.\n\n535\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:49.520\nSo remember what you actually saw here\nof course are some of the basic tools\n\n536\n00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.770\nthat we can also or\n\n537\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.510\nsome of the basic exploits that we\ncan actually carry out with netcap.\n\n538\n00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:57.370\nBut there is more to come,\nso stay tuned right here.\n\n539\n00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.730\nLet's go ahead and sign off then.\n\n540\n00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.900\nFor ITProTV, I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n541\n00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.820\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n542\n00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux

00:00:08.327\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:12.061\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:14.690\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.720\nYou're watching the Kali Linux Show.\n\n7\n00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.330\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and\n\n8\n00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.340\ntoday we're actually taking\na look at some Wireshark basics.\n\n9\n00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.924\nAnd here to help guide us through\nthis is going to be well Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:28.330\nSecurity himself, Mr. Mike Roderick.\n\n11\n00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.350\nMike welcome to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie thanks I don't know about\nall that but I am glad to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.310\nToday we are continuing on.\n\n14\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.460\nWe've been looking at some of\nthe fundamental, or basic,\n\n15\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.080\ntools that we need to be familiar with\nas we get our feet wet with Kali Linux.\n\n16\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.590\nAnd we prepare our selves\nto do security work,\n\n17\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.520\npenetration testing,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n18\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.960\nSo far, I think we've looked at Netcat,\n\n19\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.450\nwhich is a tool we used\nto create those TCP and\n\n20\n00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.255\nUDP connections fundamental foundational\nknowledge that we have to have.\n\n21\n00:00:57.255 --> 00:01:01.480\nCuz as we get more advanced and\nas we progress into these other tools, and\n\n22\n00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.320\nwe start to actually perform a task or\nexploits against machines.\n\n23\n00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.860\nThese basic tools are what we\nneed to make all that work.\n\n24\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.370\nI need to establish a connection and\ntry to get a file over there,\n\n25\n00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.400\nI found a port that's open and writable.\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.840\nHow do you find that port?\n\n27\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.900\nYou're using NMAP and,\nyou're using things like packet capture.\n\n28\n00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.330\nSo again,\nhitting these foundational tools first.\n\n29\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.230\nAnd, the one we're gonna\nlook at today is Wireshark.\n\n30\n00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.720\nWireshark is what we call\na packet capture utility.\n\n31\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.360\nIt captures packets, right?\n\n32\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.140\nLittle packets that are travelling across\nthe wire but it captures the raw package.\n\n33\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.090\nIt allows me to monitor the traffic\nthat's going across the wire.\n\n34\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.040\nAnd you might hear it like a packet\ncapture utility, a network sniffer.\n\n35\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.980\nRonnie, I think you had said,\nwhat'd you say they were?\n\n36\n00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.880\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll also hear\nthe term protocol analyzer as well.\n\n37\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.750\nAll these tools really do\nhelp us essentially to, well,\n\n38\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.070\nget the packets that we really\nwant to be able to see it do.\n\n39\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.800\nNow Mike when we talk about\nespecially like Wireshark.\n\n40\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.430\nWireshark's versatility is kind of a big\none, and its popularity as well, right?\n\n41\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.630\n&gt;&gt; It is, Wireshark has been around for\na while it used to be known as Ethereal or\n\n42\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.430\nEthereal depending on how\npeople wanted to say that.\n\n43\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.060\nThey had a split in the company and\nthis that and the other.\n\n44\n00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.700\nBut we are left with Wireshark,\nsame program, different name.\n\n45\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.225\nSo it's been around for a long time and\nthat means the kinks have been worked out,\n\n46\n00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:29.760\nit's a very polished,\npowerful program to do packet capture.\n\n47\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.280\nNow there's others out there, but\n\n48\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.110\nwe are focusing here on\nwhat we have here in Kali.\n\n49\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.020\nWireshark is probably the premier\npacket capture utility.\n\n50\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.070\nAnd with this we can again,\n\n51\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.050\nwe can look at traffic we can see what's\nhappening as we do our ping sweeps.\n\n52\n00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.670\nOr as we try to brute force a port or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n53\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.850\nOr like Ronnie said you're also\nknown as protocol analyzers.\n\n54\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.450\nWanna see what protocols\nare traveling across my network,\n\n55\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.800\nsee what kind of information\nI can get out of there.\n\n56\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.150\nRemember, if they're using\nplain text protocols,\n\n57\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.110\neverything that's in that packet,\npayload wise, header wis.\n\n58\n00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.500\nAll of that is gonna be visible within\nWireshark, cuz it's not encrypted right?\n\n59\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.550\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike as you say that and\nwe get started here.\n\n60\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.880\nOne of the things if you're really new\nat working with something like Wireshark\n\n61\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.290\nis this thinking that you're just gonna\nturn it on and it's just going to work.\n\n62\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.840\nRight out of the box, it's gonna capture\nevery bit of graphic on your network.\n\n63\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.490\nBut because we're on a switch network,\n\n64\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.450\nMike, is there some setting I need\nto actually think about having on?\n\n65\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.420\n&gt;&gt; There is but it's not so much, I mean\nWireshark will turn your network adapter\n\n66\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.220\ninto what's known as promiscuous\nmode if it's available.\n\n67\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.580\nIf your network adapter supports that,\nmost modern network adapters\n\n68\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.430\ndepending on the chips that\nare gonna support promiscuous mode.\n\n69\n00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.560\nBecause we know normally the way your PC\nworks is that it has an IP address and\n\n70\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.460\na MAC address associated with it.\n\n71\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.050\nAnd as it sees traffic going across the\nnetwork, if that's not it's MAC address.\n\n72\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.260\nIf it's not my own MAC address,\n\n73\n00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.530\nif I was the network adapter,\nI would ignore those, right?\n\n74\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.310\nWell we want to see more than just\nthe traffic that's just in our computer.\n\n75\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.790\nI want to see that server\ntalking to Ronnie's client.\n\n76\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.990\nBut that traffic's not destined for me, so\n\n77\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.800\nmy network therefore would\nnormally drop that stuff.\n\n78\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.444\nWireshark will kick you over into\npromiscuous mode which just capture all\n\n79\n00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:12.100\nthe traffic that's travelling\nacross the network.\n\n80\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.893\nNow that doesn't solve the problem with\nswitched Ethernet which most modern\n\n81\n00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:18.124\nnetworks are going to\nbe switched Ethernet.\n\n82\n00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.920\nWhere you have a point to point\nconnection between you and the switch.\n\n83\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.040\nThe switch is only allowing traffic out\nthat port that's destined for your node.\n\n84\n00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.030\nThat's out there on the end of that port,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.240\nSo even if I'm in promiscuous mode,\nI'm saying capture everything.\n\n86\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.560\nI'm still only seeing because what\nthe switch is doing in front of me,\n\n87\n00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.340\nI'm still not seeing all that traffic.\n\n88\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.430\nSo if you want to monitor\ntraffic on the network,\n\n89\n00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.870\nyou need to get into a place where you\ncan actually see that traffic going by.\n\n90\n00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.530\nAnd our little test environments,\nwe're on a small virtual network and\n\n91\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.830\nwe can practice and\nplay with these tools and it works great.\n\n92\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.300\nIn the real world,\nyour switch might have a monitor port, or\n\n93\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.370\nwhat do they call it a mirror port or\nsomething like that.\n\n94\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.800\nRonnie's my switch guy.\n\n95\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's either gonna be port mirroring,\n\n96\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.860\nspan is sometimes how you hear this idea.\n\n97\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.960\nPort mirroring of some sort or\n\n98\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.110\nif you have a network tap a little\nbit more expensive of a device.\n\n99\n00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.130\nBut those are devices that really do\nallow you to capture everything that's\n\n100\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.080\ngoing across it.\n\n101\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.060\nWhereas the port marin just says take\nall of the traffic from the ports\n\n102\n00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.930\nyou want to see.\n\n103\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.230\nSend me this one port,\nthe one that I'm running Wireshark on,\n\n104\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.820\nand that's normally how we also\ncan get the other traffic.\n\n105\n00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, that's something\nthat if it's your network and\n\n106\n00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.770\nyou're part of the security\nteam you can find out.\n\n107\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.750\nIs there a port that we can\nmonitor all traffic on,\n\n108\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.790\nis there a way I can get all that\ntraffic routed out to my port?\n\n109\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.660\nIf you're doing a pen test then that\nbecomes part of the challenge, right?\n\n110\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.780\nI've gotta be able to get in there.\n\n111\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.660\nAnd this is why we\ncompromise a machine and\n\n112\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.010\nthen we load tools on that machine to\nthen further investigate the network.\n\n113\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.880\nTo see what nodes that it's talking to,\nthings like that.\n\n114\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.530\nSo keep that in mind as you're\nworking with Wireshark.\n\n115\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.630\nYou're like,\nwhy am I not seeing all the traffic?\n\n116\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.050\nIt very well could be that you're\nin a switched Ethernet environment.\n\n117\n00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.120\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at Wireshark.\n\n118\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.310\nCouple of things, Wireshark runs on\nWindows, Linux, Mac, it runs on anything.\n\n119\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.510\nYou will need certain libraries.\n\n120\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.820\nThere's a WinPcap for Windows.\n\n121\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.089\nFor Kali, for Linux, it's Libpcap.\n\n122\n00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.550\nTypically when you install WirsShark,\nit's going to prompt you to download that.\n\n123\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.860\nAnd that's what lets your operating\nsystem work with the raw packets.\n\n124\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.620\nBecause remember, these packets,\nwhat we're seeing,\n\n125\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.320\nthey're going down the good OSI model.\n\n126\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.190\nAnd they're getting packaged up and\nformatted to be transmitted on the wire or\n\n127\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.140\nwireless.\n\n128\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.920\nAnd now they're being transmitted,\nand you're capturing them.\n\n129\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.680\nThey're not going back up the OSI model\nto be interpreted, pulled back apart, and\n\n130\n00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.050\nbroken into.\n\n131\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.723\nHuman readable, or application readable,\nanything like that,\n\n132\n00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:41.167\nyou're looking at the wrong data.\n\n133\n00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.750\nSo, there's libpcap, and for Windows,\n\n134\n00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.210\nWinPcap is what allows me to\nwork with those raw packets.\n\n135\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.450\nSo let's fire up Wireshark and Kali\nyou can go either go to a terminal and\n\n136\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.140\ntype Wireshark or you could go down\nto like stiffing and spoofing.\n\n137\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.938\nYou guys know you can go many different\nways to get to the application.\n\n138\n00:06:58.938 --> 00:07:01.800\nBut here's Wireshark,\nnow the first time you fire it up,\n\n139\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.560\nif you're logged on as root,\nyou'll probably get this error.\n\n140\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.525\nIn fact, every time you fire it up.\n\n141\n00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll get this error, and\n\n142\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.910\nthis is because Lua is\nWireshark's scripting language.\n\n143\n00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.090\nAnd with that language you\ncan really do some damage.\n\n144\n00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.890\nAnd if you're running as root the damage\ncould be to your system, could be bad.\n\n145\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.360\nSo they're saying, hey, we're gonna block\nthis since we see you're logged on as\n\n146\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.040\nthe root or as you're super user.\n\n147\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.110\nJust click OK, unless you need scripts,\nyou have created a separate account\n\n148\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.440\nthat's not root and then you can\nwork with the scripting language.\n\n149\n00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.680\nThere are ways you can disable that and\nallow those scripts to work\n\n150\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.060\neven when you're logged in as root,\nthat's a risk you take, right?\n\n151\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.640\nAs long as you know what you\nare doing you should be good,\n\n152\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.460\nit's just kind of trying to\nprotect us from ourselves.\n\n153\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.474\nYou can also comment out that\nmessage in the config file.\n\n154\n00:07:48.474 --> 00:07:51.840\nSo you log on as root but you don't\ncare because you never run scripts.\n\n155\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.630\nYou just get tired of seeing that message.\n\n156\n00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.376\nGo comment that out in the config file.\n\n157\n00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:58.044\nHere's Wireshark, and\n\n158\n00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:03.216\nthe first thing we have to do is to tell\nit what interface we want to capture on.\n\n159\n00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.412\nI've got several network, I have two.\n\n160\n00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:07.125\nNetwork adapters in here.\n\n161\n00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:11.804\nIt also sees things like my loop back,\nif I had a USB network adapters they\n\n162\n00:08:11.804 --> 00:08:16.880\nwould show up in here, Bluetooth\nnetwork adapters would show up in here.\n\n163\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.890\nSo this will show you the different\nadapters you have available.\n\n164\n00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.620\nAnd this little bar,\nthis little kind of spark line or\n\n165\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.610\nmini line graph here,\nis showing me the activity.\n\n166\n00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.100\nSo it's saying, hey,\nthere is activity on this.\n\n167\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.014\nThis one, there is no activity.\n\n168\n00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:36.330\nProbably not a good one to choose, if I am\ntrying to figure out what network adapter.\n\n169\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.140\nI am going to go ahead.\n\n170\n00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.155\nFirst, I am gonna grab my eth0, and\n\n171\n00:08:39.155 --> 00:08:43.511\nI'm just gonna click this blue shark-fin\nup here to start capturing packets.\n\n172\n00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:47.108\nSo we will just let it go for\na second and see what happens.\n\n173\n00:08:47.108 --> 00:08:48.350\nIt is very exciting.\n\n174\n00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.208\nIt's funny how Dropbox\nis almost always first.\n\n175\n00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:53.564\nThat thing is going all the time.\n\n176\n00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:54.456\nGive it a minute.\n\n177\n00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:59.113\nI'll try to generate it some\nadditional traffic here.\n\n178\n00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:02.850\nI'm kind of surprised that more\nhasn't popped up just yet.\n\n179\n00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:06.457\nSo I don't know.\n\n180\n00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:08.417\nWe'll go to a couple\ndifferent webpages here.\n\n181\n00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:10.442\nWe'll close that browser down.\n\n182\n00:09:10.442 --> 00:09:12.596\nThen we'll come back over here, and\n\n183\n00:09:12.596 --> 00:09:16.425\nwe'll see that I have indeed\ncaptured some traffic, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:21.690\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nstop the capture and we look at the scroll\n\n185\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.700\nbar over here and look how many\npackets I captured, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.429\nThat is a lot of data, all right?\n\n187\n00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:33.260\nIt was going for what, 30 seconds at\nthe most, so one of the things you're\n\n188\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.170\ngonna find when you start working with\nany packet capture utility is there's\n\n189\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.549\na lot of information, and\nbeing able to find what you're looking for\n\n190\n00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:45.522\nbecomes the real art of\nusing a tool like this.\n\n191\n00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:49.010\nAnd Wireshark has built\nin abilities to do that,\n\n192\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.480\nto help us get down to what\nwe're really looking for.\n\n193\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.749\nAnd those are known as filters, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:59.720\nBecause we end up with a lot of,\nwhat I like to call, background noise.\n\n195\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.190\nThere's always ARP requests.\n\n196\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.140\nLike here, I can see a couple\nARP requests right there.\n\n197\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.750\nARP is constantly broadcasting in\nthe background as nodes are talking to\n\n198\n00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.400\neach other.\n\n199\n00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.827\nDNS queries going on and\nmaybe I don't want to see those, right?\n\n200\n00:10:13.827 --> 00:10:19.103\nI'm looking for SMTP traffic or\nHTTP traffic or something like that.\n\n201\n00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:23.035\nSo, being able to get rid of that\nbackground noise is where our filters\n\n202\n00:10:23.035 --> 00:10:23.577\ncome in.\n\n203\n00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:27.598\nNow, we have two different set of\nfilters we can use within Wireshark.\n\n204\n00:10:27.598 --> 00:10:32.250\nWe have what's know as capture filters,\nand then we have display filters.\n\n205\n00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.320\nAnd let's just talk about how these\nfit into the overall picture.\n\n206\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.840\nIf we think about the data being\nout there on the wire, right, and\n\n207\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.040\nwe're firing up Wireshark, and\nWireshark's listening to that network.\n\n208\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.220\nWell, that traffic,\nas it comes in to our network adapter,\n\n209\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.420\nit's first gonna be processed by any\ncapture filters that we have in place.\n\n210\n00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:58.130\nCapture filters define what data I want or\ndon't want to capture.\n\n211\n00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.510\nSo it's saying, here's a packet\nthat's coming in, it's TCP.\n\n212\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.470\nThe filter says grab all TCP,\nI'm going to let that in.\n\n213\n00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.030\nIf it is DNS,\nthat is not on my capture filter.\n\n214\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.987\nI am gonna block that.\n\n215\n00:11:08.987 --> 00:11:10.635\nI'm gonna not allow that in.\n\n216\n00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:16.070\nAll the filters, the capture filters,\nget applied first before the data gets\n\n217\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.160\npassed into the capture engine,\nWireshark itself.\n\n218\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.130\nIt's ability to grab those packets and\nput them in a list, break them down,\n\n219\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.380\nand color code them.\n\n220\n00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.584\nSo, data comes in,\nit goes through the capture filters and\n\n221\n00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:31.403\nthen it goes into the capture\nengine in Wireshark and\n\n222\n00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:34.561\nthen it passes through whats\ncalled the display filters.\n\n223\n00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:38.452\nThis is between the capture engine,\nWireshark in the background,\n\n224\n00:11:38.452 --> 00:11:42.500\nthe underlying code, and\nthe GUI that I see here on my desktop.\n\n225\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.074\nThe display filters kind of\nsit in between those two.\n\n226\n00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:49.490\nSo the capture has all this data based\non what our capture filters were set to.\n\n227\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.970\nAnd then it's pushing it out to the GUI\nbut as it goes to the GUI the display\n\n228\n00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.410\nfilter says you know what he only wants\nto see traffic that was source port 80,\n\n229\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.000\nright?\n\n230\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.954\nOr source IP address 1011215, right?\n\n231\n00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:09.652\nAnd so the slate filter filters what data\nis actually gonna be shown in my GUI.\n\n232\n00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:14.344\nThe key to remember here is the capture\nfilters are applied before the capture, or\n\n233\n00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:16.310\nduring the capture, right?\n\n234\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.200\nSo they will limit\nthe size of the capture.\n\n235\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.630\nThey can reduce the overall size\ncuz you're saying hey just ignore\n\n236\n00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.760\nall this ARP stuff and all this SMTP\nstuff or whatever the case may be.\n\n237\n00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.432\nEverything else make it\npart of the capture.\n\n238\n00:12:28.432 --> 00:12:31.483\nThe display filters do not\nmodify the capture file,\n\n239\n00:12:31.483 --> 00:12:36.570\nthey are just filtering what you're seeing\nand you can change those on the fly.\n\n240\n00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.400\nIf I decide, you know what?\n\n241\n00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.600\nI want to look at TCP I can create\na display filter that just shows TCP.\n\n242\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.002\nIf I say, you know what,\nI need to see the UDP.\n\n243\n00:12:44.002 --> 00:12:48.273\nI can change my filter to UDP and I says\nalright now I'm going to hide the TCP and\n\n244\n00:12:48.273 --> 00:12:49.940\nI'll show you UDP.\n\n245\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.440\nBut all the packets remain as part of\nthe capture because the display filters\n\n246\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.890\nare after the capture.\n\n247\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.840\nThey do affect your capture size,\nyou can change them on the fly.\n\n248\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.167\nCapture filters can't change on the fly.\n\n249\n00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:03.410\nOnce I set them and\nstart the capture, well,\n\n250\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.494\nthat's what's going to be used\nto create that capture file.\n\n251\n00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:10.524\nIf I want to change that I have to stop\nmy capture, create a new filter, and\n\n252\n00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:12.089\nstart the capture all over.\n\n253\n00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:13.149\nAll right?\n\n254\n00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:16.683\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, let's make sure, because\nyou just said a lot of stuff there, so\n\n255\n00:13:16.683 --> 00:13:18.800\nlet's make sure that we understand.\n\n256\n00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.010\nWith the capture filters,\nI hope I'm explaining this right Mike.\n\n257\n00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.400\nWhat Mike is saying is if you choose to,\n\n258\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.020\njust like what he said,\nI don't want to see DNS, right?\n\n259\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.260\nAnd you do that with a capture filter, and\nthen you decide later on to go back and\n\n260\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.290\nlook for DNS.\n\n261\n00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.270\nMike, is it right what you're saying?\n\n262\n00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.136\nCapture filter's saying I don't see\nDNS cuz you already filtered it out.\n\n263\n00:13:40.136 --> 00:13:41.289\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n264\n00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.268\nBut with the display filter though,\nyou're saying it captures it and\n\n265\n00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:48.090\nthen you can say I didn't wanna see\nDNS but it's actually still there.\n\n266\n00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.300\nBut then you're just filtering it out but\nyou still have the data.\n\n267\n00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.567\nSo if you choose to change your mind-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n268\n00:13:52.567 --> 00:13:53.840\n&gt;&gt; Then you can actually display it.\n\n269\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.914\n&gt;&gt; You're free to change your mind.\n\n270\n00:13:54.914 --> 00:13:55.741\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n271\n00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:56.804\nCuz it's all still there.\n\n272\n00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:59.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and so\nthe neat part about this, right?\n\n273\n00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:02.876\nIs that you have that power and\nthat ability to do so.\n\n274\n00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:05.788\nWireshark makes it easier for\nyou to do this.\n\n275\n00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:09.989\nAnd the reason why I say it's easier is\nbecause there's other tools out there,\n\n276\n00:14:09.989 --> 00:14:13.062\nthat Mike as mentioning,\nthat don't make it that easy for\n\n277\n00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:16.658\nyou to be able to do this and\nto kinda know exactly what you have to do.\n\n278\n00:14:16.658 --> 00:14:20.876\nBut because of the way that Wireshark\nhas been developed over time and\n\n279\n00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:23.940\nwithin the community,\nit really is a nifty tool.\n\n280\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.913\nIt's probably one of the neatest\ntools that you'll have access to,\n\n281\n00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:29.900\nto be able to do things, like what\nMike is talking about, on the fly.\n\n282\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.652\nIt's really worth your time and\neffort and to take a look at.\n\n283\n00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:33.250\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n284\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.504\nLike I said at the beginning,\n\n285\n00:14:34.504 --> 00:14:37.170\nthis is one of the fundamental\ntools that you just must master.\n\n286\n00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.360\nYou can pick another one,\nit doesn't have to be Wireshark,\n\n287\n00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.820\nbut packet capture in general\nyou need to understand.\n\n288\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.587\nSo we've talked about the display filters,\nthe capture filters.\n\n289\n00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:50.869\nOne other thing, and\nI'll go out to Wireshark here and\n\n290\n00:14:50.869 --> 00:14:52.563\nwe'll take a look at some of the syntax.\n\n291\n00:14:52.563 --> 00:14:57.199\nCapture filters,\nthey're not quite as robust.\n\n292\n00:14:57.199 --> 00:15:03.585\nThere's not as many of them,\nthey're not used as much, right?\n\n293\n00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:08.400\nAnd when I say that, I wanna say that\nthey are not use, that's not probably\n\n294\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.470\na good way to put it but again we\ntypically wanna capture as much as we can.\n\n295\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.310\nAnd then be able to filtered it using\ndisplay filters change our view, but\n\n296\n00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.790\nwe still have the data.\n\n297\n00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:23.130\nRemember capture filter like Ronnie just\nsaid, you can't go back and get more info.\n\n298\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.080\nWhen you've put a capture filter on there,\nif you blocked it during the capture\n\n299\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.240\nit will never be there because\nyou did not capture it.\n\n300\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.560\nSo use your capture\nfilters in a limited way.\n\n301\n00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.870\nReally capture filters, you are not\ntrying to decide what I want to look for,\n\n302\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.470\nI'm looking for\na particular, not normally.\n\n303\n00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.725\nNormally we use capture filters to\nget rid of the background noise.\n\n304\n00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:44.851\nLike, I know there's ARP request going and\n\n305\n00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:48.542\nif I'm not dealing with ARP attacks\nright now, maybe I wanna get rid of ARP.\n\n306\n00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:53.847\nThere's a lot of active directory traffic,\nWindows network that we can filter out,\n\n307\n00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:56.881\nand just keep it out of\nthe capture all together.\n\n308\n00:15:56.881 --> 00:15:59.670\nJust to keep the file size\na little bore manageable.\n\n309\n00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.230\nBut really be careful because like I said,\nyou use, you can't go back.\n\n310\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.011\nSo, I would much really use\na display filter after the fact and\n\n311\n00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:07.254\njust capture everything.\n\n312\n00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:11.507\nI rarely use capture filters, I'll be\nhonest with you, because of that fact.\n\n313\n00:16:11.507 --> 00:16:15.930\nBecause I want all the data And I'm not\nreally worried about the file size that\n\n314\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.756\nmuch and so I'll capture everything and\nthen filter it out later.\n\n315\n00:16:19.756 --> 00:16:23.119\nAll right, this is Wireshark's page\nhere and I'll zoom in a little bit so\n\n316\n00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:24.486\nwe can see it a little better.\n\n317\n00:16:24.486 --> 00:16:28.742\nThis is their capture filters and I just\nwanted to show you a few of the different\n\n318\n00:16:28.742 --> 00:16:31.339\nexamples that they give\non their website here.\n\n319\n00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:34.910\nIf I was wanting to see traffic\njust from a particular host.\n\n320\n00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.729\nAnd I'll show you where to do this\nin Wireshark in just a second.\n\n321\n00:16:37.729 --> 00:16:40.870\nThe keyword host and then the IP address.\n\n322\n00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.460\nOr I could do an entire network\nif we've got multiple subnets and\n\n323\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.030\nI'm on a mirrored port that's\nshowing me more than one.\n\n324\n00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.410\nI just wanna see a particular network.\n\n325\n00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.464\nOr I've got a class, think about this.\n\n326\n00:16:53.464 --> 00:16:57.116\nI could take that class B,\nwhich has a lot of hosts and\n\n327\n00:16:57.116 --> 00:17:02.096\neven though it's not the subnet address\nI could use this to effectively\n\n328\n00:17:02.096 --> 00:17:07.020\nonly capture a part or a sub-portion\nof that class B network, right?\n\n329\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.110\nYou can type it out in the site or\nnotation.\n\n330\n00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:14.756\nYou can type it out with a actual\nmask if you use the keyword net and\n\n331\n00:17:14.756 --> 00:17:16.146\nthe keyword mask.\n\n332\n00:17:16.146 --> 00:17:23.040\nThe host will get inbound and outbound\ntraffic from that particular IP address.\n\n333\n00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.050\nNet will get inbound and\noutbound traffic from that range.\n\n334\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.740\nOr we can prepend with the word source.\n\n335\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.607\nIf I say source net,\nnow it's only traffic from, not to, right?\n\n336\n00:17:35.607 --> 00:17:40.670\nOnly from, and you can still use the net\nmask, or you can use destination or\n\n337\n00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:45.580\nDST for only traffic inbound\nto that particular network.\n\n338\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:51.899\nSo those are good ones to know, host,\nnet, source net, destination net.\n\n339\n00:17:51.899 --> 00:17:53.510\nYou can do a particular port number.\n\n340\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:58.110\nOnly looking for DNS traffic,\nI can put a capture filter on there 453.\n\n341\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.570\nAnd then I should only have\nDNS traffic in my results.\n\n342\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:07.310\nHere they're starting to use the word and\nto combine multiple filters.\n\n343\n00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.869\nYou can use and, you can use ors.\n\n344\n00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.680\nDo think about your order of operation,\nright?\n\n345\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.310\nThis goes back to the old PEMDAS,\nparentheses are going to be first.\n\n346\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.407\nAnd so they're do a not port 80 or\nport 25.\n\n347\n00:18:21.407 --> 00:18:24.900\nThey're negating both of\nthose either 80 or 25, but\n\n348\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.569\nthey're saying it has to be from here but\nit can't be port 80 or port 25.\n\n349\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.900\nHere they're just doing\nit in a more complex way.\n\n350\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.910\nAnd I'm not gonna go\nthrough each one of these.\n\n351\n00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.080\nYou guys can take your time and\ngo through these filters.\n\n352\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.820\nI wanted to show you some basic ones.\n\n353\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.330\nYou can see they can get rather complex.\n\n354\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.080\nHere, what they're actually\ndoing with that syntax\n\n355\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.360\nis they're breaking\ndown the header itself.\n\n356\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.483\nThey're saying skip the first two bytes of\nthe header and read the second two where\n\n357\n00:18:50.483 --> 00:18:54.739\nthe port number is and see if it's less\nthan or in this case greater than 1,500.\n\n358\n00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:59.980\nAll right, what else did I wanna show you?\n\n359\n00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.860\nHere's one that's simple and\n\n360\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.114\nnot broadcast,\nnot multicast that can eliminate.\n\n361\n00:19:04.114 --> 00:19:08.610\nSo a lot of you are not looking for that\ntype of traffic, eliminate a lot of that.\n\n362\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.599\nHere's one that they've written\nthat actually looks for\n\n363\n00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:13.008\nthe Welchia worm, right?\n\n364\n00:19:13.008 --> 00:19:16.763\nBecause they know the signature because\nwe can find the signature of the worm.\n\n365\n00:19:16.763 --> 00:19:21.228\nAnd they know that if you skip the header,\nthe next four bytes or\n\n366\n00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:23.010\nis it bytes or bits?\n\n367\n00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:29.140\nNext four bytes start with eight a's or\nfour bytes of a's I should say.\n\n368\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.398\nThat was a signature of Welchia.\n\n369\n00:19:30.398 --> 00:19:36.190\nSo you can actually use Wireshark to\ndetect if this worm is on your network.\n\n370\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.257\nPretty crazy, right?\n\n371\n00:19:37.257 --> 00:19:40.720\nHere is a pretty complex\none to find heart bleed.\n\n372\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.525\nAlso has some default capture filters.\n\n373\n00:19:42.525 --> 00:19:47.420\nWireshark is smart enough to know when it\nis running on a virtualized host, and so\n\n374\n00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.230\nit will not capture a lot of\nthe virtual or remote desktop.\n\n375\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:57.270\nIf it's running remotely, it won't\ncapture the remote desktop information.\n\n376\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.040\nSo good stuff there.\n\n377\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.488\nWhat else do I wanna show you?\n\n378\n00:20:00.488 --> 00:20:04.030\nSo while we're here, let's go ahead and\nlook at the display filters.\n\n379\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.920\nAgain, much more powerful, many,\n\n380\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.410\nmany, many more options\nthat I can do with display.\n\n381\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:13.297\nThings like tcp.port = 25 or ICMP.\n\n382\n00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:19.530\nSo it's looking for my SMTP traffic or my\ninternet control message protocol traffic.\n\n383\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.070\nThere's the equal, equal.\n\n384\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.250\nNotice you can use English or\nthe C like code within your filters.\n\n385\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.070\nYou can do either one.\n\n386\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.750\nAnd I'll show you,\nrather than go through each one of these,\n\n387\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.100\nyou can go out and Google this.\n\n388\n00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.930\nThis one happens to come\nfrom packetlife.net.\n\n389\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.697\nThere are several people out there that\nhave Wireshark display filter cheat\n\n390\n00:20:43.697 --> 00:20:44.640\nsheets.\n\n391\n00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.841\nAnd you can see it's a pretty impressive\nlist of things that we can filter for.\n\n392\n00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:54.090\nAll right, and\nthis comes from packetlife.net.\n\n393\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.980\nJeremy Stretch wrote this up,\ngreat job there.\n\n394\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.620\nUse your favorite search engine, and\n\n395\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.220\nyou will find several options for\ncheat sheets.\n\n396\n00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.820\nAll right, let's get back over here and\nsee why my virtualization is freaking out.\n\n397\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.882\nI think my Windows machine just shut down.\n\n398\n00:21:08.882 --> 00:21:11.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, where do we wanna go next?\n\n399\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:16.440\nWe've talked about our capture filters,\nour display filters.\n\n400\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.985\nShould we actually look at capturing\nsome more traffic, Ronnie?\n\n401\n00:21:18.985 --> 00:21:20.012\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a good idea.\n\n402\n00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:27.170\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when we go to start a new\ncapture, I have a capture currently.\n\n403\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:31.730\nIf I click start, for a start a new\ncapture, it's gonna ask me do I wanna\n\n404\n00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.228\nsave this data or\ndo I want to continue without saving.\n\n405\n00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:38.340\nIn the real world,\nmost likely you'd wanna save it.\n\n406\n00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:44.280\nA lot of time we wanna save these dumps or\ncaptures for later analysis or for\n\n407\n00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.442\ncomparison to what we've done currently.\n\n408\n00:21:46.442 --> 00:21:51.349\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsay continue without saving.\n\n409\n00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:53.490\nAnd actually I'm gonna stop that one.\n\n410\n00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.440\nNo packets captured.\n\n411\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.817\nWe're gonna change ethernet adapters.\n\n412\n00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:58.734\nAll right, so I'm gonna flip over to eth1,\n\n413\n00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.150\nwhich is connected to my\nlittle test lab here.\n\n414\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.550\nAnd we'll try a couple of different\nthings and then we'll apply some filters.\n\n415\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.678\nNow speaking of filters,\n\n416\n00:22:06.678 --> 00:22:09.609\ncapture filters are applied before\nyou start the capture, right?\n\n417\n00:22:09.609 --> 00:22:12.130\nOnce you start it, you can't change it.\n\n418\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.310\nThis is where you put your capture filter,\nright here.\n\n419\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.210\nThere's a little green flag that you\ncan click on to manage your saved\n\n420\n00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.390\ncapture filters.\n\n421\n00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:25.081\nAnd there's a bunch of prebuilt filters\nin here that came with Wireshark,\n\n422\n00:22:25.081 --> 00:22:26.550\nwhich is great.\n\n423\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.390\nYou wanna create your own you can\ngo to manage capture filters, and\n\n424\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.760\nthis will bring you to this dialogue\nbox where I can indeed create my own\n\n425\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.350\ncapture filters and\nthen save them for future use.\n\n426\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.830\nSo let's take a look at\nhow we would do that.\n\n427\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.510\nLittle plus sign here down in\nthe bottom plus and minus.\n\n428\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.240\nYou can also take an existing one and\nclick the copy option and\n\n429\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.950\nit will start a new one then you can\nkinda tweak it to fit your needs.\n\n430\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:59.247\nIf click the plus sign, that will\nlet me create a new capture filter,\n\n431\n00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:06.852\nand I could do something like source,\nhost and I don't know, 10.10.1.\n\n432\n00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:12.293\nGosh, if I can remember his IP\naddress now 101, I believe.\n\n433\n00:23:12.293 --> 00:23:14.358\nAnd I can click okay, right?\n\n434\n00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:15.440\nSo now, oops,\n\n435\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.720\nI created a new filter, now I need to make\nsure that set grabs it, cuz it did not.\n\n436\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.224\nAnd there is my filter.\n\n437\n00:23:22.224 --> 00:23:22.925\nIt turns green.\n\n438\n00:23:22.925 --> 00:23:26.830\nThat lets me know my syntax is correct and\nit can apply that filter.\n\n439\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.350\nI checked this.\n\n440\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.510\nNow, I will give you a word of warning.\n\n441\n00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.520\nI have seen where people are trying\nto figure out why I can't enter\n\n442\n00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.040\na capture filter.\n\n443\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.160\nAnd when you first launch this,\nlet me close it and launch it again.\n\n444\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.840\nSometimes there is no\nnetwork adapter selected.\n\n445\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.177\nAnd you go to add.\n\n446\n00:23:45.177 --> 00:23:47.070\nRight now,\nthere is no network adapter selected.\n\n447\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.730\nSo I'm gonna go up here, and\nI'm gonna choose, I don't know, not ARP.\n\n448\n00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.550\nNotice it turns red.\n\n449\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.590\nWait a second.\nThat's a pre-built filter.\n\n450\n00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.840\nIt really should be working.\n\n451\n00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.120\nIt should be the right syntax.\n\n452\n00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.780\nAnd that's because it doesn't know what\nnetwork adapter you're gonna use, so\n\n453\n00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.950\nit can't test it or\nfigure out if that filter is gonna work.\n\n454\n00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.070\nAs soon as I select something, and\n\n455\n00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:08.080\nthen I choose one of my filters,\nwe should be good to go.\n\n456\n00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.670\nOr if I choose that same filter, not ARP\njust to show you, now it turns green.\n\n457\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.235\nAll right, so there's your capture\nfilters, how you create them.\n\n458\n00:24:16.235 --> 00:24:20.030\nAgain, I'm actually not\ngonna use one right now.\n\n459\n00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.480\nWell, just because we wanna\nget into our display filters,\n\n460\n00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.540\npretty straightforward there again.\n\n461\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:31.160\nIf this is gonna affect the size and what\npackets are part of the overall capture.\n\n462\n00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.190\nAll right, so as you can see, there's\na lot we can do with Wireshark in our\n\n463\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.377\nfilters, both before the capture and\nafter the capture.\n\n464\n00:24:38.377 --> 00:24:41.770\nAnd we wanna take a look at how we can\nactually do these rather than just talk\n\n465\n00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.920\nabout them, but Ronnie's over there\nkinda giving me the evil eye.\n\n466\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.280\nI think we might be a little low on time.\n\n467\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.470\nYes, Mike, we definitely are a little\nbit low on time and we want to see how,\n\n468\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.860\nof course, Wireshark can be used and\ngenerate some traffic and\n\n469\n00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.460\nget the capture going, cuz that's probably\nwhat we all want to be able to do and\n\n470\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.900\nthat way Mike can also show us well,\nwhat it actually is doing.\n\n471\n00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.640\nSo it's a great place for us to just\nsign off and we'll come back for\n\n472\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.120\na part two when Mike\nshows us how to do this.\n\n473\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.890\nSo, signing off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n474\n00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:12.810\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n475\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows!\n\n476\n00:25:15.240 -->

another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.978 --> 00:00:18.020\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n8\n00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.640\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.010\ntoday we're gonna be taking a look at\nanother type of packet-capturing utility.\n\n10\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.210\nOne called tcpdump and\nwe're learning about the basics.\n\n11\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.590\nAnd who better to help us out than Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick?\n\n12\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.428\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:33.916\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI can think of a few better people but no.\n\n14\n00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:35.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n15\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.390\nAll right now, Mike.\n\n16\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.114\n&gt;&gt; When we start to talk about this idea.\n\n17\n00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:45.590\nWe've already went through Wireshark,\nso Mike why tcpdump?\n\n18\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.780\n&gt;&gt; Really it's just when you need a small\ncommand line driven type of capture.\n\n19\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.585\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n20\n00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:56.975\n&gt;&gt; You know, actually Wireshark\ncan be run from the command line.\n\n21\n00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:59.921\nBut tcpdump is command line only,\nthere's no GUI interface for it.\n\n22\n00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:05.585\nIt's an easy one, typically,\nto get installed and run.\n\n23\n00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:08.525\nAnd then we can do most of the same things\nthat we do with Wireshark we've got our\n\n24\n00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:13.375\nfiltering capabilities, we can write out\nto a file, we can read existing files.\n\n25\n00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:19.940\nAnd it puts it out in a format that other,\nlike Wireshark for example, can also read.\n\n26\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.930\nWhich is typically what I end\nup doing because as you'll see,\n\n27\n00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.100\nworking with tcpdump\nis a little different.\n\n28\n00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.190\nIt's not as user friendly I think\nis probably a politically correct\n\n29\n00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.480\nway to say it.\n\n30\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.680\nLets look at it.\n\n31\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.740\nWe'll kind of go through the different\noptions, we'll fire it up.\n\n32\n00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.490\nWe'll generate some traffic, we'll capture\nsome traffic we'll save the capture file\n\n33\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.620\nwe'll open it up, we'll filter it we'll\nopen it up with Wireshark as well.\n\n34\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.180\nWhat the heck, let's do it all.\n\n35\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.590\nAll right, so let start off by\ntaking a look like my screen here.\n\n36\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.710\nI'm on my Kali Linux box of course.\n\n37\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.095\nAnd the first thing we're gonna do\nis just a little man tcpdump if I\n\n38\n00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:56.740\ncan spell that\n&gt;&gt; That's quite the name of a file\n\n39\n00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.387\nisn't it?\n\n40\n00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:58.318\n&gt;&gt; It is right?\n\n41\n00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.403\n&gt;&gt; Executable.\n\n42\n00:01:59.403 --> 00:02:00.987\n&gt;&gt; Creative.\n\n43\n00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:05.268\nGreat man page, but there are some of the\nswitches that we should be familiar with,\n\n44\n00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:06.790\nsome of the options.\n\n45\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.460\nYou basically got your options and\nyour expressions, there are several that,\n\n46\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.005\nlet's see, the best way to\nshow you some of these are.\n\n47\n00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.410\n[COUGH] excuse me.\n\n48\n00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.160\nAs I go down here, this is one of the\nfirst ones you might wanna use as the -d.\n\n49\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.440\nThis gives you a list of interfaces.\n\n50\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.620\nJust like we did with our\nother packet caps utilities,\n\n51\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.610\nwe have to tell it what\ninterface we want to listen on.\n\n52\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.650\nNow if you just run TCP dump and you\ndon't tell it It'll typically pick your\n\n53\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.140\nfirst network adaptor and\nthe list of adaptors that you have.\n\n54\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.730\nWhich might or might not be the one you're\nexpecting, so usually easier to, hey,\n\n55\n00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.440\nlet me take a look at the list and\nthen specify.\n\n56\n00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.825\nSo in the -i is what we're going to\nuse [COUGH] to specify the interface.\n\n57\n00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:53.374\nSo -i eth0, eth1.\n\n58\n00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:57.780\nYou can also do a -any, or\n-i any, and it'll listen on all.\n\n59\n00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.320\nAnd you can list more than\none interfaces as well.\n\n60\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.930\nLet's see what else I wanted\nto point out for sure.\n\n61\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.236\nSo we talked about the dash d,\nthe -l, dash lower case n,\n\n62\n00:03:08.236 --> 00:03:11.222\ndon't resolve your host names,\nalways a good one.\n\n63\n00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:16.430\nI could scroll through here and\nfind it but it's kind of a pain,\n\n64\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.358\nat least on screen here, but\nyour dash lower case n is your.\n\n65\n00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:27.770\nSkipping the DNS name resolution, which\nsometimes may slow it down a little bit.\n\n66\n00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.621\nAlso typically, makes for\na cleaner output.\n\n67\n00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.130\nWe're usually worried about\nthe IP address not the DNS name.\n\n68\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.008\nAnother one I wanna make sure we\ntalk about is the -v that is for\n\n69\n00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:41.150\nverbose that is typically a good one\nto use just get you more information.\n\n70\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.110\nA -X, this one will show you the hex\noutput and the ASCII output.\n\n71\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.610\nIf you do dash capital X, capital X.\n\n72\n00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.558\nSo double X,\nyou can actually get the link header and\n\n73\n00:03:53.558 --> 00:03:56.172\nthe frame header for that as well.\n\n74\n00:03:56.172 --> 00:04:01.408\nLooks very similar to the output you\nwould see in the bottom of Wireshark\n\n75\n00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:06.830\nwhere you saw the hexdump as well as\nthe ASCII conversion right next to it.\n\n76\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.360\nSo we'll see that.\n\n77\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.485\nThe other thing,\n\n78\n00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:14.140\nit only captures they've just recently\nchanged the defaults, I think.\n\n79\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.600\nI wanna say it's 90\nbytes out of the packet.\n\n80\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.466\nIt didn't capture the entire packet, so\n\n81\n00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:25.280\nif you want the entire packet\nyou can specify the size.\n\n82\n00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.468\nOr you can do an as 0,\nwhat they call a snap length as a -S.\n\n83\n00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:34.530\nYou can do -S 0, and\nit actually captures the entire packet.\n\n84\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.485\nWhich is usually what I try to do,\n-e will add your Ethernet header,\n\n85\n00:04:39.485 --> 00:04:43.600\n-W gives you the ability to write\nto a file, to take the output,\n\n86\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.800\ninstead of going to your standard\nout in your terminal, out to a file.\n\n87\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.230\nAnd then -r will allow you\nto open up an existing file.\n\n88\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.740\nSo a few of the options we wanna be\nfamiliar with when we're running tcpdump,\n\n89\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.960\nsome of the expressions we would use\nsimilar to other packet capture utilities,\n\n90\n00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.720\nwe've got things like host, net, port.\n\n91\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.554\nSo we could do tcpdump host 10.10.1\n\n92\n00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:15.132\nwhat is my IP 101 something like that and\n\n93\n00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:19.965\nthat's gonna tell it\nhey I'm gonna listen or\n\n94\n00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:24.819\nlook for traffic to or\nfrom host is to or from.\n\n95\n00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.373\nI'm just gonna kill that cuz I didn't\ntell it an Ethernet adapter is listening\n\n96\n00:05:29.373 --> 00:05:33.090\non my first one which doesn't\nhave any traffic on it right now.\n\n97\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.330\nYou can specify a network,\nwe can use citer notation.\n\n98\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.978\nYou can also specify a port number.\n\n99\n00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:41.309\nWe could do tcpdump port and\na particular port number, only looking for\n\n100\n00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:42.762\ntraffic on a particular port.\n\n101\n00:05:42.762 --> 00:05:46.926\nYou've got your destination switches so\ninstead of host,\n\n102\n00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.780\nI could say tcpdump source 10,10,1,101.\n\n103\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.740\nMaybe traffic leaving, originating from.\n\n104\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.920\nI could do destination,\nDST be traffic coming back.\n\n105\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.560\nAnd we can also do protocols.\n\n106\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.650\nWe can just type in, TCP for\n\n107\n00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.240\nexample or ICMP to filter for\na particular protocol.\n\n108\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.930\nSo let's kick this thing in the tires,\nlight the fires and\n\n109\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.240\nsee what the heck tcpdump is all about.\n\n110\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.160\nSo let's start off with actually\nclearing the screen up a little bit,\n\n111\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.290\ndropping the shell back down.\n\n112\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.460\nSo what I wanna do is let's start with\na tcpdump and let's do a cash capital D.\n\n113\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.780\nThere we can see the different\nEthernet adapters or\n\n114\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.290\nthe network adapters I should\nsay that I have in here.\n\n115\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.765\nGive me a list of those so\nI can quickly identify them eth0,\n\n116\n00:06:36.765 --> 00:06:38.786\neth1 being the ones I wanna use.\n\n117\n00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:43.270\nBut a quick easy way to see what it\nsees or as your network adapters.\n\n118\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.460\nSo that was that -D.\n\n119\n00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.760\nNow if we wanna start capturing traffic,\nlet's do tcpdump.\n\n120\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.970\nAnd I'm gonna specify interface eth1,\nfor this one.\n\n121\n00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.790\nAnd then let's use a few switches,\nthat we've learned about.\n\n122\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.610\nYou can string these switches together, as\nwith most programs, so a single hyphen and\n\n123\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.210\nthen all of my different options.\n\n124\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.730\nI'm gonna do a -N, for no name resolution.\n\n125\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.460\nAlso gonna throw a V for verbose.\n\n126\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.330\nWe can do a couple of these, to get some\nextra verbosity, but it'll go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.870\nleave it on that single one there.\n\n128\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.170\nAnother one that I didn't mention that\nif I'm doing this, especially to start\n\n129\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.180\ncorrelating logs, dumps across different,\nmaybe during an attack situation.\n\n130\n00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.230\nThe timestamp info, there's a -t where\nyou can use human-readable time output,\n\n131\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.980\nand that can be a very handy one.\n\n132\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.920\nI'm gonna do the XX,\nI wanna grab the header information,\n\n133\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.943\nand I want to see the X and\nthe ASCII information, and then I'm gonna\n\n134\n00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:52.670\ndo an S0 to let it know I want to\ncapture the entire packet, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.490\nAnd if I just hit enter,\nit tells me hey, I'm listening.\n\n136\n00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.550\nAnd we can see a little\nbit of traffic going by.\n\n137\n00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.830\nLet's generate some additional traffic.\n\n138\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.980\nI'm gonna open up another terminal.\n\n139\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.200\nAnd just ping one of my\nneighbors here 10.10.1.103.\n\n140\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.410\nGonna let that go, and\n\n141\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.790\nas that's going you can see those\npackets rolling by in my other terminal.\n\n142\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.750\nI'll go ahead and stop that ping.\n\n143\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.700\nAnd lets take a look let\nme bring- maximize this and\n\n144\n00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.680\nhere we can see the output\nfrom tcpdump alright, and\n\n145\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.280\nwhat you're seeing is each\none of these is a packet.\n\n146\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.921\nSo that's a single packet that\njust went by its IP protocol,\n\n147\n00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:38.108\nyou can see protocol ICMP right over\nhere and then I've got my source\n\n148\n00:08:38.108 --> 00:08:45.116\n10.10.1.101 heading to 10.10.1.103 and\nthat is my echo request.\n\n149\n00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:51.308\nI can see my sequence numbers and\nthen my hex dump and the ASCII conversion.\n\n150\n00:08:51.308 --> 00:08:54.622\nNext packet down looks\nlike it's the reply.\n\n151\n00:08:54.622 --> 00:09:00.039\nSo it's coming from 103 heading\nback to 10.10.1.101 and\n\n152\n00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:02.710\nthis is my ICMP echo reply, right?\n\n153\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.769\nSo, pretty straight forward there\njust doing a simple start it up and\n\n154\n00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:11.969\ncapture any traffic that you\nsee going by on the network.\n\n155\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.700\nAll right, now let's take a look, let me\nactually I forgot to stop my capture.\n\n156\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.119\nIt does tell you when you do stop\nit I just did a control C to quit.\n\n157\n00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:24.430\nAnd I ASCII 31 packets captured,\n\n158\n00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:30.050\n31 packets received by filter\nzero packets dropped by kernel.\n\n159\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.815\nAnd what that's saying is hey 31 packets\ncame by all of which matched your filters,\n\n160\n00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:40.716\ncuz I have no filters so it actually\ngrabbed all of that traffic alright.\n\n161\n00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:42.923\nNow if we want to start filtering traffic,\n\n162\n00:09:42.923 --> 00:09:45.820\nlet's take a look at doing\nsomething like that.\n\n163\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:52.700\nWe'll bring that last command back and\nlet's say not ICMP, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.660\nSo it says it's listening.\n\n165\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.540\nAnd let's fire up our ping again.\n\n166\n00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:04.070\nAnd you'll notice is there's no packets\nscrolling by in the other window.\n\n167\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.720\nThere are a few packets now and\nagain and some other traffic,\n\n168\n00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.350\nsome ARP requests going on.\n\n169\n00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.970\nBut none of these ping packets\nare making it into my capture.\n\n170\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.018\nSo when we use a filter like\nthat launching at tcpdump,\n\n171\n00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:21.260\nbasically what we're doing is\nsetting capture filters, right?\n\n172\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.750\nThese are controlling what packets\nare saved in the first place.\n\n173\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.683\nLet's kill that and\nlet's stop our capture.\n\n174\n00:10:29.683 --> 00:10:36.240\nAnd now I can see 16 packets capture and\n16 packets that received by filter.\n\n175\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.890\nIt's not showing me how many are actually\ndropped or ignored in this case.\n\n176\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.920\nI thought it was going to.\n\n177\n00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.740\nBut as we look through here,\nnone of these are ICMP packets, right?\n\n178\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.110\nAnd you'll just have to take my word for\nit,\n\n179\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.720\nright, as I scroll down\nthrough this screen.\n\n180\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.340\nAgain, it's a little bit\ndifficult working with tcpdump.\n\n181\n00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.436\nWe're looking at the output\nhere in the window.\n\n182\n00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:02.090\nIt's easy to get tcpdump started and\nget these packets captured.\n\n183\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.513\nBut manipulating and working with them\nafterwards, we can still use tcpdump,\n\n184\n00:11:08.513 --> 00:11:13.184\nbut we could also use things like\nWireshark, and we'll do both here.\n\n185\n00:11:13.184 --> 00:11:15.559\nAll right, so\nlet me clear that screen for us.\n\n186\n00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.220\nAnd let's try another one,\nlet's see if we can.\n\n187\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.900\nWhat should we do now, Ronnie?\n\n188\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.250\nLet's, so we did not ICMP,\nthat was a good one.\n\n189\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.670\nLet's do something like this, let's\nwrite these out to a file, all right.\n\n190\n00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.830\nSo same filter that I'm using and we\nhave the, like I said we have the source\n\n191\n00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.310\noption, the destination option\ndepending on how wanted to filter this.\n\n192\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.818\nI'm gonna write this out\nto a file with a -W.\n\n193\n00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:46.080\nThat's how we dump the file,\nor dump the data into a file.\n\n194\n00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.510\nAnd I'm just gonna call it tcpump test,\n\n195\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.940\nsomething like that, and\nwe'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n196\n00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.200\nAnd again, it is listening.\n\n197\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.200\nSo we'll go generate a little\nbit of traffic here.\n\n198\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.690\nGet a couple ping packets in there.\n\n199\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.740\nHeck, what else should we do?\n\n200\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.920\nLet's do a little telnet.\n\n201\n00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:18.746\nWhat was that guy, 10.10.1.103?\n\n202\n00:12:20.992 --> 00:12:24.750\nJust generating some traffic so\nwe have something captured in our file.\n\n203\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.746\nYou give me second to prompt me for\nthe password and\n\n204\n00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:29.994\nonce you have captured this file.\n\n205\n00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:37.860\nWell, take a look at how\nwe can go back and read it.\n\n206\n00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.868\nAll right, now I'm gonna jump\nback over here to tcpdump and\n\n207\n00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:44.610\nI will stop my capture, right?\n\n208\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.772\nBut notice I had no output\ncome into the screen.\n\n209\n00:12:46.772 --> 00:12:48.706\nAnd says, did I capture anything?\n\n210\n00:12:48.706 --> 00:12:54.650\nAnd I can see I got 80 packets captured\nand received by filter, all right?\n\n211\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.930\nBut it's all being stored in a file.\n\n212\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:03.100\nAnd here is my file tcpdump test,\nall right?\n\n213\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.625\nSo if we wanna view that file that's where\nthe -R switch comes into play tcpdump\n\n214\n00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:13.550\n-R and then the name of my file.\n\n215\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:19.804\nAnd it's going to spit it out\nback into my screen all right?\n\n216\n00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:25.963\nNow the cool thing about this so\nwe saw how we could do capture filters in\n\n217\n00:13:25.963 --> 00:13:28.840\nthe command where we\nactually launched tcpdump.\n\n218\n00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.550\nWe said not ICMP.\n\n219\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.540\nThat was a capture filter.\n\n220\n00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.020\nThis time I didn't put any there,\ncaptured all the traffic.\n\n221\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.810\nWhat if I wanna filter this traffic now?\n\n222\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.100\nCan we do that, like we saw with some\nof the other packet capture utilities?\n\n223\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.970\nAnd the answer is yes,\n\n224\n00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.380\nyou just simply include your same filters,\nwhen you use your read switch.\n\n225\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.980\nSo let's take a look,\nif I do tcpdump, actually let me.\n\n226\n00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.282\nClear my screen get back up to the top so\neverybody can see this,\n\n227\n00:13:55.282 --> 00:14:00.385\nwe'll do the tcpdump -R,\nname of the file that we created or\n\n228\n00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:05.710\nsomebody sent to us for analysis and\nwe're gonna say not ICMP.\n\n229\n00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.836\nAlright, and\nif we look not the easiest to see but\n\n230\n00:14:08.836 --> 00:14:12.571\nif you had a bunch of telnet's,\nwhat I don't see in here or\n\n231\n00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:17.300\nany ICMP there's some ARP packets right,\nsome more ARP packets there and\n\n232\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.910\nthis is the beginning this is\nwhere we ran that command.\n\n233\n00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.850\nSo what we're seeing\nis my filter did work,\n\n234\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.426\nwhen we ran a read command\nwe can use the same filters\n\n235\n00:14:29.426 --> 00:14:34.130\nwe used when we set our capture filters,\nall right.\n\n236\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.140\nAll right, so we're so\n\n237\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.640\nfar we're seeing the tcpdump, which just\nlike our other packet capture utilities.\n\n238\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.444\nWe just have to, we can set our source,\nour destination, we've got our options.\n\n239\n00:14:45.444 --> 00:14:48.908\nLet's take a look at how we\ncould use Wireshark to open this\n\n240\n00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:51.550\nup as well because well this is handy.\n\n241\n00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.790\nAnd I can definitely use tcpdump\nto work with these packets.\n\n242\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.880\nYou can write complex filters in here.\n\n243\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.710\nWe've got our comparisons, our logical\noperators, our and's, our or's.\n\n244\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.270\nSo we can get as complex as\nwe want with our filter but\n\n245\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.440\nstill working in that shell.\n\n246\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.220\nIf we want to get a little bit of\ngraphically user interface going,\n\n247\n00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.210\nwe can fire up Wireshark, all right?\n\n248\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.280\nSo go back out here.\n\n249\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.490\nLet's open up Wireshark.\n\n250\n00:15:22.156 --> 00:15:23.644\nAnd ignore our Lua Error.\n\n251\n00:15:23.644 --> 00:15:27.710\nI'm gonna do file open and\nwe'll find tcpdump test that\n\n252\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:33.270\nwe created just a minute ago with\ntcpdump and I'll click open.\n\n253\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.810\nAnd notice that Wireshark is\nnot only able to open it up but\n\n254\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.850\ninterpret everything that's in there.\n\n255\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.120\nIt's able to fill it in,\nput it in the right places.\n\n256\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.430\nI see the time, the source,\nthe destination.\n\n257\n00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.290\nMy color coding is still working.\n\n258\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.840\nMy ICMP, my yellow from my ARP.\n\n259\n00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.080\nEverything is still working just fine.\n\n260\n00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.452\nLet's see if we can follow that stream.\n\n261\n00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:56.360\nRight-click, follow stream,\nand there we go.\n\n262\n00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.760\nSo even if we capture\nthe information using tcpdump,\n\n263\n00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.550\ndoesn't mean we have to\nmanipulate the data with tcpdump.\n\n264\n00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.250\nI can then take it into another\nutility like Wireshark.\n\n265\n00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:15.620\nAnd use my custom filters that I've built,\nmy display filters and use that graph.\n\n266\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.320\nWe'll take advantage of the ease of\nworking in that graphical user interface.\n\n267\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.040\nSo in the end another packet capture\nutility, mostly the same features.\n\n268\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.712\nJust have to learn a little bit of new\nsyntax when we're applying those filters.\n\n269\n00:16:28.712 --> 00:16:30.960\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nMike well thank you again for\n\n270\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.550\nhelping us at least get our feet\nwet here with using tcpdump.\n\n271\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.130\nIt is a powerful utility,\nsomething that you can always depend on.\n\n272\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.590\nAnd usually, a Linux distribution a lot\nof times when you start doing this.\n\n273\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.540\nBut it does help to at least see the raw\npackets whereas Wireshark can go ahead and\n\n274\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.920\nfilter out a few things.\n\n275\n00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.360\nAnd Mike was right about the idea of the\namount of traffic it captures by default\n\n276\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.750\nwhich is gonna be the 96 bytes here.\n\n277\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.690\nBut with him using that -S0?\n\n278\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.470\n&gt;&gt; S0.\n\n279\n00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.760\n&gt;&gt; That actually gives\nthe whole packet itself.\n\n280\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.100\n&gt;&gt; And you can cuz like if\nyou wanted more than 96, but\n\n281\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.290\nnot the whole thing, you can say -S 1,000,\nright, or something like that.\n\n282\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.630\nBut the S0 just says all right,\ngrab everything.\n\n283\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.600\n&gt;&gt; And that's actually very important,\nespecially if you're looking for specific\n\n284\n00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.860\ntypes of information that you're trying\nto find within a packet, it's gonna help.\n\n285\n00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.660\nTcp does give you a lot\nof other filters that\n\n286\n00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.640\nwe don't have to go through right now,\nbecause that's actually more advanced, but\n\n287\n00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.470\nat least gets you started here.\n\n288\n00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.260\nWell, this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n289\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.708\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n290\n00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:34.418\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n291\n00:17:34.418 --> 00:17:36.466\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows.\n\n292\n00:17:36.466 -->

00:00:12.090\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.731\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n6\n00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.800\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're diving into Nmap Basics.\n\n7\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.440\nAnd who better to help us to\nunderstand Nmap better, well than Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.250\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.069\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.020\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks, Ronnie,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.780\nAnd yeah, excited,\n\n12\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.680\ncuz today we are playing with another\none of my favorite tools, good old Nmap.\n\n13\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.580\nNow as we go through some\nour foundational tools or\n\n14\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.410\nour tools we just really have to have in\nour toolkit, Nmap has to be one of them.\n\n15\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460\nWe were talking about some\nof the de facto tools.\n\n16\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.770\nWe talked about how Netcat, or NC, or Ncat\nnow, for the new version from the same\n\n17\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.410\npeople that made Nmap, are your go to\ntool for creating connection, CCP UDP.\n\n18\n00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.245\nWe show how Wireshark is kind of like\nthe de facto standard for packet captures.\n\n19\n00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:08.130\nNmap is probably the de facto standard for\ndoing port scans, right.\n\n20\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880\nIt is a fantastic tool,\nan extremely powerful tool,\n\n21\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.210\nit does a lot more than\njust doing port scans.\n\n22\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.800\nBut that's where we'll start, right,\nwe wanna kinda learn our basics,\n\n23\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.248\nget our feet wet, and\nplaying with a tool like this.\n\n24\n00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:26.760\nSo, Nmap, again,\nis a port scanner and when we\n\n25\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.370\ntalk about a port scanner we have to think\nback to our TCP/IP and the way that works.\n\n26\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.220\nAnd when we look at a system,\n\n27\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.170\nwe've got network adapters that\nget assigned an IP address.\n\n28\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.570\nAnd, [COUGH] that's how we connect to it,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.620\nThat's it's address.\n\n30\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.400\nThat's how it sends and receives data.\n\n31\n00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.400\nThat's how it's unique on the network.\n\n32\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.380\nBut computers can multitask.\n\n33\n00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710\nWe can have more than one thing\ngoing on at the same time.\n\n34\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.250\nSo when that traffic is coming in you\nmight have your browser opened up.\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.040\nYou might have your\nemail client opened up.\n\n36\n00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.190\nWhat else might you be doing?\n\n37\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.310\nYou're doing a terminal session somewhere.\n\n38\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.240\nAll these different applications\nare sending data across the network.\n\n39\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.716\nHow does it know when those packets\nare coming in, that it should go to your\n\n40\n00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:08.648\nbrowser or this packet should\ngo to your email client, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:13.512\nAnd that port number, that's gonna\ntell us that we have 65,000 run,\n\n42\n00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:14.762\n535-\n&gt;&gt; Six.\n\n43\n00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:15.424\n&gt;&gt; 36.\n\n44\n00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:21.930\n65,536 port numbers which you can\nthink of as sub-addresses, right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300\nTake your IP address [COUGH] just for\nexample, 10.10.1.2,\n\n46\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.928\nthat's your IP address colon and\nthen say 80, right, or\n\n47\n00:02:31.928 --> 00:02:36.393\n21, or 22, or 3396,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n48\n00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:41.193\nEach one of those is an attachment point\nor a way that I can generate a socket,\n\n49\n00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.450\nI guess would be a good way to say it.\n\n50\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.290\nCuz when we talk about a socket,\n\n51\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.560\na connection between two computers,\nit's three things we need.\n\n52\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.380\nWe need the protocol that we're gonna use.\n\n53\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.640\nThe IP address.\n\n54\n00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.670\nAnd the port number,\nthat we're gonna connect to, all right?\n\n55\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.677\nSo when we talk about computer security,\n\n56\n00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.260\nwe've got 65,500 [INAUDIBLE]\nyada yada ports.\n\n57\n00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.990\nWe wanna close all those down.\n\n58\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.770\nWe use firewalls to close those up and\n\n59\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.140\nthen as we run more services,\nwe need to open some of those up.\n\n60\n00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.810\nLike when you run DNS.\n\n61\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.430\nPort 53 gets opened up.\n\n62\n00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.770\nWhen you run a web server,\nwe typically open up, say, port 80 or\n\n63\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.740\nif it's secure it's 443, right?\n\n64\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.540\nSo we have to make those\nholes in those firewalls.\n\n65\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.210\nWell, if we can look at a machine and\n\n66\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.920\nsee what ports are open,\nwe get a few things out of that.\n\n67\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.340\nWe can, one,\n\n68\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.910\nprobably determine what services\nare running on that machine, right?\n\n69\n00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.870\nIf I see port 53 open, there's a good\nchance that that machine is running\n\n70\n00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.070\nthe DNS Server service and\nwe can interrogate that port and\n\n71\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.540\nget a little more information\nabout that service.\n\n72\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.560\nWe can use that information as\nwell the way it responds when we\n\n73\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.420\ndo try to communicate with a port.\n\n74\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.330\nIf the port's closed it responds one way,\nif the port's open it responds another\n\n75\n00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.110\nway, and different operating systems\nrespond differently to open versus closed.\n\n76\n00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.390\nAnd so we can even use this information\nto start trying to figure out maybe\n\n77\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.610\nwhat operating system is running.\n\n78\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.500\nSo a lot of information can be\ngleaned by doing port scans.\n\n79\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.720\nAnd the bad guys, they're looking for\ndoorways in, right?\n\n80\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.580\nAnd so they're looking for open ports.\n\n81\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.670\nThey're looking to see what\nservices you're running.\n\n82\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.520\nAnd they're hoping they can\ncompromise some of those services.\n\n83\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, I really don't know if\nI've actually addressed this before but\n\n84\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.820\nlet's talk about this just for\na moment before running in Nmap,\n\n85\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.570\nlet's just say that somebody has\njust tuned into this show and\n\n86\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.720\neven though they might\nnot have a lot knowledge,\n\n87\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.460\nthey're probably saying all\nright I wanna start using Nmap.\n\n88\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.440\nDo they need to be on the same physical\nnetwork as the machine that they're\n\n89\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.650\ntaking look at, or it this certain\nthat they can do just from their home?\n\n90\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.920\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nyou do have to be able to make in a,\n\n91\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.030\nyou gonna be sending packets\nto each one of those ports,\n\n92\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.830\nwhich ever port we choose to scan, so you\ndo have that connectivity, and have you\n\n93\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.905\ngot routing between there if it's a public\nIP address which you're trying to scan,\n\n94\n00:04:54.905 --> 00:05:00.155\nI can sit at home and I can scan,\nsay Microsoft servers or ITProTV servers.\n\n95\n00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:02.495\nBecause they have a public IP address and\nthey have to, right?\n\n96\n00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:05.155\nThey want the public to\ncome to their website.\n\n97\n00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:08.815\nSo from my home inside,\nI can scan those machines.\n\n98\n00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:13.425\nNow, my ISP might have a problem with that\nbecause they can see that kind of traffic\n\n99\n00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:17.310\nand they see packets coming out port,\nport, port, port, port.\n\n100\n00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.810\nThey know what's going on.\n\n101\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.791\nThey can see that traffic and\nthen like,hey guys,\n\n102\n00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:22.060\nthe guy is doing port scanning.\n\n103\n00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.370\nAnd if you keep doing enough of them to\nespecially the people that you shouldn't\n\n104\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.950\nbe scanning.\n\n105\n00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.130\nCuz you don't own them or have permission.\n\n106\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.097\nYour ISP could send you a nastygram.\n\n107\n00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:30.990\nMicrosoft's gonna talk to them,\n\n108\n00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.940\nthey're gonna talk to you and\nyou might get the nastygram in the mail.\n\n109\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.120\nAll right.\nSo yes, you can scan across the internet.\n\n110\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.610\nAssuming the other end again is reachable.\n\n111\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.490\nIf I'm internal,\nI can scan Ronnie's machine.\n\n112\n00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.140\nHe's got a private IP address but\nI'm on the same network as him, right?\n\n113\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.500\nOr if he's on a different subnet,\n\n114\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.920\nI probably have routing going\non in my internal network.\n\n115\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.180\nSo as long as we can route the packets\nthere, sure we can do those scans.\n\n116\n00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.120\nBut that traffic can be blocked, too.\n\n117\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.780\n&gt;&gt; And Mike,\nI just wanted to make that point.\n\n118\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.340\nSometimes people do tune\ninto these shows and\n\n119\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.860\neven though they might not\nbe the hacker in order.\n\n120\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.380\nMike that sounds like a great tool,\nI'm gonna use this.\n\n121\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.690\nLet me just start scanning\nright out from my home and,\n\n122\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.110\nthe ISP is not gonna mind\nif I start doing this.\n\n123\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.750\nSo you've gotta be a little\nbit careful sometimes.\n\n124\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.803\nSo don't do this unless you have\npermission, is what I would say at least,\n\n125\n00:06:18.803 --> 00:06:19.977\nfrom your home, practice.\n\n126\n00:06:19.977 --> 00:06:23.101\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, this is one of those areas,\n\n127\n00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:26.861\nand I don't wanna get too far off\ntrack with laws and things like that,\n\n128\n00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:30.492\nbecause it varies from state to state,\nfrom country to country, so\n\n129\n00:06:30.492 --> 00:06:33.510\nyour laws where you live\nare gonna be different from me.\n\n130\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.800\nAnd it's all very new, so sometimes\nthe laws take a little while to catch up.\n\n131\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.880\nSo this is little bit of a gray area.\n\n132\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.190\nI used to use an analogy where,\n\n133\n00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.090\nlets say your walking down\na strip mall that was closed.\n\n134\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.725\nYou know, strip malls here in the US,\n\n135\n00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:53.390\nwhere all the stores have their\nown store front on the outside.\n\n136\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.040\nLet's say your just walking down, or\nan apartment complex or something, and\n\n137\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.140\nyour just walking along and\ntugging on each one of the doors.\n\n138\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.083\nAnd they're all locked and\na police officer comes up and says, hey,\n\n139\n00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:02.957\nwhat are you doing?\n\n140\n00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:05.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Can you get in trouble for doing that?\n\n141\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.360\nNot taking into consideration trespassing\nor anything like that, right, but as far\n\n142\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.270\nas the pulling on the doors well, you\ndidn't get in, right, the door was locked.\n\n143\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.470\nSo you really didn't break any laws\nat this point and even if the door\n\n144\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.800\nwas open and you open it and\nthen closed it, did you really break in.\n\n145\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.395\nAnd that is where that gray area comes\nin because we can't prosecute on intent.\n\n146\n00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:37.125\nWe all know that if you find that door\nopen, you're probably gonna go in and\n\n147\n00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:37.965\ntake something.\n\n148\n00:07:37.965 --> 00:07:41.812\nBut, since you haven't done that yet,\nI can't really charge you.\n\n149\n00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:45.400\nIt's the same way with port scanning, when\nyou're doing port scanning against public\n\n150\n00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.516\nentities or stuff that you don't own,\nthere's a reason you're doing it.\n\n151\n00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:52.180\nYou're not doing it for just fun,\nyou're trying to find an open port and\n\n152\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.025\nmaybe you can take advantage of that but\nthe problem is the port scan itself,\n\n153\n00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:58.276\nyou haven't really crossed that line yet.\n\n154\n00:07:58.276 --> 00:08:02.822\nSo legally maybe maybe not can\nyou get in trouble for it.\n\n155\n00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:04.790\nBut can your ISP get you in trouble?\n\n156\n00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.860\nAbsolutely.\n\n157\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.376\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's their network and\n\n158\n00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:10.430\nif they don't want you doing port scans\nacross their network they can tell you no.\n\n159\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.110\nSo listen to what Ronnie is saying.\n\n160\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.080\n&gt;&gt; Ask for permissions.\n\n161\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.666\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do this in places that\nyou have written permission or\n\n162\n00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:22.481\nyou own the systems and\nyou can give yourself that permission.\n\n163\n00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:26.723\nBut then you've gotta think about the\nnetworks that you're crossing too because\n\n164\n00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:31.330\nwe can end up generating a lot of traffic,\nand even though I might own that system.\n\n165\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.463\nI could be bogging down the network\nthat's effecting other people, right.\n\n166\n00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:38.470\nIf we're talking about cloud based\nsystems and things like that.\n\n167\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.279\nI start doing heavy port scans\nacross lots of machines and\n\n168\n00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:45.316\nall of the sudden other customers that\nare paying this company for their service,\n\n169\n00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.608\nthey can't meet their SLA because\nI'm taking all the bandwidth.\n\n170\n00:08:48.608 --> 00:08:50.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now they're gonna be upset with me,\n\n171\n00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:53.229\nthey're gonna say what the heck are you\ndoing you can't be doing these port scan.\n\n172\n00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:58.082\nSo legally I don't know but\nyou really wanna be careful with it.\n\n173\n00:08:58.082 --> 00:09:01.845\nAll right so now let's talk about N Map\nand let's see what we've got here.\n\n174\n00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:06.596\nN Map will run on just about anything,\nthey've got a port for\n\n175\n00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:10.425\nit for Kali, for Linux,\nfor Windows, for Mac.\n\n176\n00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.740\nAnd there's two versions.\n\n177\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.380\nThere's the shell version,\nthe command line version.\n\n178\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.543\nAnd there's also a GUI\nversion known as Zenmap.\n\n179\n00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:22.986\nYou can go out to nmap.org and you can\ndownload the Linux binary and in Kali,\n\n180\n00:09:22.986 --> 00:09:24.941\nof course, it comes installed.\n\n181\n00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:28.959\nBoth of them, the command line and\nthe GUI version.\n\n182\n00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:31.210\nWell we'll play with\nthe command line version.\n\n183\n00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.190\nI do wanna show you the GUI.\n\n184\n00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.030\nBecause it's a great way\nto learn how to use nmap.\n\n185\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.670\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nlet's talk about some of the options.\n\n186\n00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.020\nWhat I'm gonna do is just type in nmap and\n\n187\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.740\nI'll do a -h and\nwe'll get their basic help.\n\n188\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.180\nYou could also do a man nmap and\nget the manual pages and get\n\n189\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.740\na lot more examples and a lot more help\nwith this, but this'll get us started.\n\n190\n00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.040\nWhen we look at this there's a few things\nwere going to want to pay attention to.\n\n191\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.675\nFirst of all is the usage.\n\n192\n00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:03.040\nnmap your scan type or types,\n\n193\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.700\nany options that you want to include and\nthen your target specifications.\n\n194\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.020\nSo when we run nmap, there's really\nthree things we gotta think about.\n\n195\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.980\nWhat type of scan do I wanna do and we'll\ntalk about the different ones here in\n\n196\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.840\na minute, what options do I want to go\nalong with that scan, like speed and\n\n197\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.480\nsome other things and we'll show you.\n\n198\n00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.090\nAnd then who am I scanning?\n\n199\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.810\nWhat is my target or targets,\ncuz we can scan multiple machines.\n\n200\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.700\nWhen it comes to target specification,\nyou can do it in any number of ways.\n\n201\n00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.933\nI can use host names.\n\n202\n00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:35.700\nThis is gonna rely on DNS to resolve so\nthat's something you got to think about,\n\n203\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.020\nif you don't have name resolution for\nthe network you're scanning,\n\n204\n00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.060\nbetter off going with maybe IP addresses.\n\n205\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.370\nWhich you can also use networks if you\nwanna scan entire ranges of IP addresses.\n\n206\n00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.236\nSo you could see different examples\nhere whether you using DNS names,\n\n207\n00:10:50.236 --> 00:10:52.804\nhere they're doing Microsoft.com/24.\n\n208\n00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:57.650\nThat's something you don't see that often\na DNS name with a cite or notation on it.\n\n209\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.690\nOr you can do single IP addresses, or\nnotice here they're actually doing a range\n\n210\n00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.760\nof IP addresses and\nthis is actually an interesting one.\n\n211\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:11.428\nLook closely at that,\nfirst octet is 10, second octet is 0,\n\n212\n00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:16.996\nthird octet 0-255 fourth octet, 1-254.\n\n213\n00:11:16.996 --> 00:11:21.609\nWhat this is gonna do is it's\ngonna scan all addresses in this\n\n214\n00:11:21.609 --> 00:11:23.604\nrange within this octet.\n\n215\n00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:25.690\nIt'll go from 0 to 255.\n\n216\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.930\nThis one only 1 to 254.\n\n217\n00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.936\nWhich means I won't be scanning\nanything that ends in a 0, or\n\n218\n00:11:30.936 --> 00:11:33.411\nanything that ends in a 255 right?\n\n219\n00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:36.967\nThat's pretty cool the way you can use\na range within an octet like that,\n\n220\n00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:39.122\ncuz we know that 0 is\nour network address and\n\n221\n00:11:39.122 --> 00:11:43.560\n255 is gonna be our broadcast address,\ntypically don't wanna scan those.\n\n222\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.517\nWe can also use a list.\n\n223\n00:11:44.517 --> 00:11:48.269\nThis is one of my faves, the -iL.\n\n224\n00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:50.579\nAnd then the name of the file.\n\n225\n00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:54.842\nOnce you have a list of IP addresses just\na single IP address on each line, or\n\n226\n00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.140\nit could be networks.\n\n227\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.680\nYou could have subnets on each line.\n\n228\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.770\nBut you import that list and\nmap and let it go.\n\n229\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:05.588\nIt's great when you have to scan the same\nnetworks as a part of a process you do on\n\n230\n00:12:05.588 --> 00:12:06.837\na repeating basis.\n\n231\n00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:11.671\nI'll also show you a cool way to generate\nthat list from some of your first\n\n232\n00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:16.370\nscans that you can turn around and\nfeed right back into nmap all right.\n\n233\n00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:21.020\nYou can do random targets, I've never\ndone that one but you can say iR 20 and\n\n234\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.240\nit will just grab 20 random\ntargets on that network.\n\n235\n00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.918\nThere's also exclude which is kinda nice,\n\n236\n00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:31.589\nsometimes you might have maybe\nyou're doing an entire subnet.\n\n237\n00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:35.690\nBut there's one machine you do not\nwanna scan cuz it causes problems or\n\n238\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.999\nI get, not supposed to scan it, so\nyou can actually do excludes as well and\n\n239\n00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:41.548\nyou can do exclude files.\n\n240\n00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:44.348\nWhen it comes to these scan types,\n\n241\n00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:48.420\nwe have a few different\nones that we wanna look at.\n\n242\n00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.190\nThere's host discovery and\nthen scan techniques.\n\n243\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.850\nWhen we look at Nmap we have to understand\nthat it basically operates in two phases.\n\n244\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.850\nIt does a discovery phase and\nthen a scan phase.\n\n245\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:06.939\nIf I give it a subnet address, a network\naddress, to scan, let's say its a C 255.\n\n246\n00:13:06.939 --> 00:13:11.247\nWell first it does a discovery phase where\nit tries to talk to each one of those IP\n\n247\n00:13:11.247 --> 00:13:14.396\naddress, sends out a ping,\nand see which ones are live.\n\n248\n00:13:14.396 --> 00:13:18.668\nAnd then once it has determined\nwhich IP addresses out of that\n\n249\n00:13:18.668 --> 00:13:23.545\nentire subnet are live or responding,\nit's only gonna scan those.\n\n250\n00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:27.436\nWhy waste your time scanning IP\naddresses that are not turned on or\n\n251\n00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:29.570\nnot assigned to anything, right.\n\n252\n00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:35.060\nSo that's the way Mmap works by default,\nis it does a discovery phase.\n\n253\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.210\nAnd then it goes through the scan phase.\n\n254\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.819\nYou can do a, [COUGH] The one I wanna\nshow you here, there's a ping scan.\n\n255\n00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:47.525\nIt's little s little n, right.\n\n256\n00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:50.861\nAnd this one allows me,\nit disables that second phase.\n\n257\n00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.402\nSo with this one, I'm just pinging.\n\n258\n00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:56.840\nAnd I just wanna see which ones are up\ndon't worry about doing a port scan.\n\n259\n00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:02.774\nYou can also do the opposite, capital P\nlittle n, where you force it to scan each\n\n260\n00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:09.050\nIP address that you've specified as\na target and skip the host discovery.\n\n261\n00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.790\nYou might have a scenario where you've got\nsome machines that don't respond to pings,\n\n262\n00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.230\nor don't respond to the way Mmap is\nreaching out to see if it's alive.\n\n263\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.664\nBut you know for\na fact that those machines are there.\n\n264\n00:14:19.664 --> 00:14:21.816\nAnd you wanna see if any\nother ports are open,\n\n265\n00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:24.604\neven though it's not responding\nto its discovery phase.\n\n266\n00:14:24.604 --> 00:14:28.625\nSo you can do a Pn,\nsay scan every IP address I gave you,\n\n267\n00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:30.730\nwhether it responds or not.\n\n268\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.107\nDon't even worry about doing a discovery.\n\n269\n00:14:32.107 --> 00:14:36.347\n[COUGH]\nLet's see, some other ones that we'll find\n\n270\n00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:38.840\nvery useful when it comes\nto the scan types, right.\n\n271\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.762\nWe've got the, it's gonna start\nwith a s and then we can do a S,\n\n272\n00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:50.182\nT, A, M, W, U, N, F,\nX there's a lot right?\n\n273\n00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:53.580\nIn this one,\nwe're gonna stick with the simple scans.\n\n274\n00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.031\nThey're the ones that are straightforward,\nbut\n\n275\n00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:58.842\nthere are some really interesting\nscans in here as well.\n\n276\n00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:01.303\nYour sS is the default.\n\n277\n00:15:01.303 --> 00:15:05.587\nSo if I don't specify a scan type,\nwhen we go back up to help,\n\n278\n00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:10.770\nnotice scan type is in brackets,\noops which means it's optional.\n\n279\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:15.120\nI don't have to give it a scan type,\nand that's because it has a default.\n\n280\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.348\nAnd the default is sS.\n\n281\n00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:24.160\nWe used to call this the stealth scan,\nit's known as a syn scan.\n\n282\n00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.010\nAnd if we think back to\nthe way TCPIP works.\n\n283\n00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.202\nWhen you make a connection there's\nsomething known as a TCP 3 way hand shake\n\n284\n00:15:31.202 --> 00:15:35.198\nwhere you send out a send packet to\nwhoever you're trying to connect to,\n\n285\n00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:38.819\nthey respond to your send with an ACK\nas well as a send of their end.\n\n286\n00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:42.275\nSo they send back what's called\na SYN-ACK packet and then you respond\n\n287\n00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:46.330\nwith a final ack to their synchronization\nrequest, their send packet.\n\n288\n00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.690\nAnd that's the three packets\nthat form the handshake and\n\n289\n00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.288\nnow you have established a TCP connection.\n\n290\n00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:57.342\nA sS scan or a syn scan sends the syn,\nwaits to see if you get the SYN-ACK\n\n291\n00:15:57.342 --> 00:16:01.727\nback But then never responds\nwith its own acknowledgement.\n\n292\n00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:05.377\nNever fully establishes\nthe three way handshake and so\n\n293\n00:16:05.377 --> 00:16:08.400\nhopefully it's not\nlogged on the other end.\n\n294\n00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.870\nThat was the theory or\nthe working, I mean it did,\n\n295\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.680\nit would not usually it's\na good way to say it.\n\n296\n00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.940\nBack in the day we might of been\nable to get away with that right?\n\n297\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.410\nBut now everything's logged and\nit's not nearly as stealthy.\n\n298\n00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.570\nIn fact, you shouldn't use\nthe word stealth with it anymore.\n\n299\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.930\nIt is going to be seen because there were\nattacks we could do, the sinflood attacks\n\n300\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.905\nand things like that where people did this\nintentionally, long story another show.\n\n301\n00:16:35.905 --> 00:16:39.880\n[COUGH] But point is it's not stealthy.\n\n302\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.260\nSo don't think of the SYN connection or\nthe SYN scan as being stealthy.\n\n303\n00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.810\nIt's gonna be seen but it's quick and\nit's a pretty good scan.\n\n304\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.220\nAnd here's the default, sT or\n\n305\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.140\ncapital T would be my full\nTCP connect scan all right.\n\n306\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.630\nThis is where you finish the three-way\nhandshake with that port, and\n\n307\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.690\nthen you tear it down.\n\n308\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.422\nThere's some others, like an Act Scan,\nwhere you're sending an Act Packet.\n\n309\n00:17:05.422 --> 00:17:09.630\nThis would be a useful one, UDP, SU.\n\n310\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.475\nThis is something that people forget\nabout a lot of times, Ronnie.\n\n311\n00:17:13.475 --> 00:17:14.140\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n312\n00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.820\n&gt;&gt; Is that there are services\nthat listen on UDP.\n\n313\n00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.920\nAnd we can forget that those might be\na doorway in for the bad guy or for\n\n314\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:27.370\nus as a pen tester, a lot slower\nwhen it comes to scanning UDP.\n\n315\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.250\nNot quite as reliable either.\n\n316\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.660\nBecause remember,\nit's a connectionless protocol.\n\n317\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.230\nBut it is something that we wanna think\nabout and that we would want to do.\n\n318\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.920\nAnd then there's the few more.\n\n319\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.480\nI'm not gonna go into\nthe rest of them right now.\n\n320\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.000\nI will save those for\na more advanced show.\n\n321\n00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.012\nBecause those are really what\nwe'll probably stick with for\n\n322\n00:17:46.012 --> 00:17:51.327\nthe most part, the dash SS, ST,\nSU, and Sn to do our ping scan.\n\n323\n00:17:51.327 --> 00:17:53.110\nThose are really the big ones\nthat we're gonna be doing.\n\n324\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.955\nAnd then we've gotta specify\nports that we wanna scan.\n\n325\n00:17:57.955 --> 00:18:01.880\n[COUGH] We've got a few\ndifferent ways that we can\n\n326\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.510\nspecify ports that we wanna use.\n\n327\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.550\nThere's the dash P and then port range.\n\n328\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.370\nThis will scan whatever you tell it to.\n\n329\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.670\nIf I wanna scan ports one\nthrough 1024 I can do that,\n\n330\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.860\none dash 1024 and\nit will scan the first 1,024 ports, or\n\n331\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:23.360\nyou can do a single port, like here's\nan example where they're doing P122.\n\n332\n00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.854\nHere's an example where they' ve done\nthe entire range, P1 through 65535.\n\n333\n00:18:28.854 --> 00:18:33.120\nYou can mix and match.\n\n334\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.250\nHere they've done a port scan UDP53111 and\n137, TCP 21 through 25\n\n335\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.670\nseparated with commas,\nport 80, 139 and 80 80.\n\n336\n00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.600\nAnd then what is that,\n\n337\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.410\nthat's a not sure what they're doing\nright there I need to look that one up.\n\n338\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.360\nCapital S, colon 9 on a port\nspecification, have to check that one out.\n\n339\n00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.510\nThat's a good one on me.\n\n340\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.250\nSo many different ways you can go about\nspecifying what ports you want, if you\n\n341\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.970\ndon't specify what port you want N Map has\na built in default for that as well and\n\n342\n00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.940\nit'll scan, I wanna say it's the top 1,000\nports I'd have to double check on that.\n\n343\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.000\nThey've adjusted that\nnumber a couple of times.\n\n344\n00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.650\nAll right but\nthat brings me to this next option and\n\n345\n00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.889\nI absolutely love this one\nhere dash dash top dash ports.\n\n346\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.830\nWhen we're running these scans usually\nwe'll do an initial scan that's pretty\n\n347\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.810\nlight and doesn't take a long time and\nis not super thorough,\n\n348\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:37.020\njust wanna get an idea of what's going\non in the machine with a basic scan.\n\n349\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.810\nReally quick I can see major\nports like FTP is open or\n\n350\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.930\nhey DNS is open,\nthere's a DNS server sitting there,\n\n351\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.150\nthere's my active directory ports,\nthis is a domain controller.\n\n352\n00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.650\nI just do on a quick scan,\nonce I find my target that I\n\n353\n00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.250\nwanna focus in on then I'll go back and\nscan all the ports.\n\n354\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.750\nThey might have some service\nthat they've installed and\n\n355\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:03.600\nit's running on some high level port\ntrying to kinda it or something like that.\n\n356\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.610\nSo, I'll go back and do a complete scan.\n\n357\n00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:12.260\nBut interesting thing is the guys out\nthere in map if I say that name right,\n\n358\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.290\nI never get that right.\n\n359\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.510\nDid some research, they say scanning\nthe internet, but they hae scanned a good\n\n360\n00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.420\nportion of what's out there over the\nyears, as they've worked with this tool.\n\n361\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.915\nAnd they did some research, and\nthey found that with the, they\n\n362\n00:20:27.915 --> 00:20:33.930\nlooked at what ports were most commonly\nopen on machines around the world.\n\n363\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.810\nThey said, let's figure out\na way that e can minimize, not\n\n364\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.130\nhave to scan 65,535 ports but\nstill get the most commonly used ports.\n\n365\n00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:48.044\nAnd they did that, and\nthey used this top -ports, or\n\n366\n00:20:48.044 --> 00:20:51.460\nit's --top -ports and then a number.\n\n367\n00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.895\nSo you can say --top -ports.\n\n368\n00:20:53.895 --> 00:21:00.320\n1,000 or dash s top dash towards 500 and\nbased on their research,\n\n369\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.390\nyou're scanning the top 500 for\nexample, most commonly used ports,\n\n370\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.420\nand here's what is interesting about it\nand this is right from their webpage.\n\n371\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:14.680\nFor both TCP and UDP,\nthe tope ten ports get you roughly half.\n\n372\n00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.470\nSo that means by scanning only to top ten\nports I can get half of the open ports.\n\n373\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.580\nWhich is pretty good especially if I just\nwant to do something really quick and\n\n374\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.930\ndirty and I've got a big long\nlist of addresses to scan.\n\n375\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:32.119\nIf you do the top 1,000 ports\nout of the 65,000 ports roughly\n\n376\n00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:37.560\n93% of the open TCP ports and\n95% of the open UDP ports.\n\n377\n00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.790\nThose are numbers I can live with.\n\n378\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:45.540\nIf I can get 93% of the ports and only\nscan 1,000 versus 65,000, that's great.\n\n379\n00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:48.750\nWhen I'm doing lots of scans,\nthat's what I want to do.\n\n380\n00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.740\nAgain, when I go into a specific target,\nI've narrowed it down to one machine.\n\n381\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.350\nI will most likely scan every single port\non that machine, just to see what's there.\n\n382\n00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:02.320\nBut as you're narrowing your target list\ndown, that top port is a fantastic option.\n\n383\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.820\nAll right, now let's talk about\na few of the options as well.\n\n384\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.630\nYou have this, this one I love, and\n\n385\n00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.850\nwe'll be using this one in here as\nwe get into actually using Nmap.\n\n386\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.140\nAnd that's the little s and\ncapital V so -sV.\n\n387\n00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.500\nAnd this probes open but\nports to determine service version info.\n\n388\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.780\nWhen we run these scans we see\nthat we get some information,\n\n389\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.950\nlike it'll say port 21ftp,\nwe add a v on there and\n\n390\n00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:34.920\nit'll say, hey,\nthis is ftpvStb vSftp Version 2.3.4.\n\n391\n00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.060\nSomething like that,\nit'll actually Interrogate that port,\n\n392\n00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.930\nget the header information because\nit's doing banner grabbing.\n\n393\n00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.564\nGetting that header information\nfrom those ports and display that.\n\n394\n00:22:43.564 --> 00:22:48.410\nAnd that is gonna be key as we\nprogress through penetration testing.\n\n395\n00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:53.630\nBecause by knowing what version\nof services I can look for\n\n396\n00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.550\nexploits that are geared towards that,\nright?\n\n397\n00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:01.490\nHey, that version of IIS had a backdoor\nissue or a buffer overflow issue.\n\n398\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.060\nLet me go see if there's\nan exploit out there.\n\n399\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.260\nIf they haven't patched it I'm gonna\ntake that machine over, right?\n\n400\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.430\nSo getting that version information\nis extremely valuable and\n\n401\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.970\nthat's what the sV does, capital V.\n\n402\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.220\nScripts, we'll save that for another.\n\n403\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.394\nWe're actually using some of them in here.\n\n404\n00:23:18.394 --> 00:23:25.010\nWe're not gonna get into super deep into\nthe scripts, but that's a great thing.\n\n405\n00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:30.280\nNMAP has the NSE or,\nNMAP Scripting Engine.\n\n406\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.050\nAnd you can write scripts and\n\n407\n00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.290\nwhat's called Lua is their\nlanguage that their using.\n\n408\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:40.440\nAnd these scripts are automated scans and\nthey can look for particular things and\n\n409\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:46.120\nthere are dozens and dozens of prebuilt\nscripts that come with Mmap and\n\n410\n00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.020\nthey are fantastic.\n\n411\n00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.661\nI will show you some of those as well.\n\n412\n00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:52.889\nAgain, we're not going to write any but\nwe'll definitely see how to run those.\n\n413\n00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.329\nA few more, Ronnie,\nwe've got OS detection.\n\n414\n00:23:57.329 --> 00:24:00.641\nRemember I said that by\ninterrogating those ports and\n\n415\n00:24:00.641 --> 00:24:03.302\nseeing how it responds\nwhen a port is open.\n\n416\n00:24:03.302 --> 00:24:07.351\nVersus how a machine responds\nwhen the port is closed,\n\n417\n00:24:07.351 --> 00:24:11.410\nwe can determine roughly\nwhat operating system it is.\n\n418\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.150\nAnd Nmap is really good at it.\n\n419\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.730\nIt's pretty impressive.\n\n420\n00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:18.530\nBut that's a capital O,\nnot a zero but the letter O.\n\n421\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.390\nTiming and performance.\n\n422\n00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:25.500\nOne that we'll pay attention to here\nis the -T, and that's a capital T.\n\n423\n00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.530\nThese are case sensitive.\n\n424\n00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.630\nThere are lots of switches.\n\n425\n00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.860\nThey ran out of letters.\n\n426\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.130\nSo the case matters when it comes\nto the switches here in Nmap.\n\n427\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:36.140\nAnd you have an option zero through five,\nfive being the fastest.\n\n428\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:42.100\nAnd this is how fast am I spitting out\nthese port requests or these port probes.\n\n429\n00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.010\nFive would be extremely fast.\n\n430\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.300\nVery little pause, if any,\n\n431\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.850\nbetween these port scans as it's\nscanning each individual port.\n\n432\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.550\nSo it's gonna get\naccomplished much quicker.\n\n433\n00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.010\nBut it's also a lot noisier.\n\n434\n00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.511\nYou get an IDS IPS on that network.\n\n435\n00:25:00.511 --> 00:25:01.670\nThey're gonna see that.\n\n436\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.740\nIt's going to set off alarms.\n\n437\n00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:09.000\nSo the idea is if we need to be stealthy,\nwe can try to drop that speed down.\n\n438\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.204\nIt's going to make your\nscan take a lot longer.\n\n439\n00:25:11.204 --> 00:25:15.132\nIf you drop it down to two or one or\nzero, it will take a long time.\n\n440\n00:25:15.132 --> 00:25:16.961\nI don't know exactly what the timing is.\n\n441\n00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:18.493\nIt's dropping off milliseconds.\n\n442\n00:25:18.493 --> 00:25:21.980\nI don't think it's in seconds,\nbut to a computer, it's slow.\n\n443\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:27.810\nBut the idea is hopefully, we might\nbe able to not trigger that IDS IPS.\n\n444\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:33.615\nIt doesn't see it as a barrage of\nconnect request to every single port.\n\n445\n00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:39.501\n[SOUND] It's a request here,\na request there, could be normal traffic.\n\n446\n00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:40.769\nThat's the idea, anyway.\n\n447\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.050\nThere are ways to spoof source\naddresses and things like that.\n\n448\n00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.260\nCuz in the end, I'll tell you,\nthey're gonna figure it out.\n\n449\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.610\nThey're gonna see where,\nhey, this IP address has\n\n450\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.800\nsent 65,535 requests to this\nserver over the last two hours.\n\n451\n00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.398\nAnd interestingly enough,\neach one is to a different port.\n\n452\n00:26:01.398 --> 00:26:04.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hm, I wonder what's going on there.\n\n453\n00:26:04.794 --> 00:26:09.870\nSo [LAUGH] again, don't think you're\ngonna avoid detection altogether.\n\n454\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.370\nThat's where that decoy comes in.\n\n455\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.070\nMaybe we'll do that in one\nof our more advanced shows.\n\n456\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.090\nWhat else do we need to talk about here,\nRonnie?\n\n457\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.519\nThe last little section,\nI believe, is our output.\n\n458\n00:26:20.519 --> 00:26:26.920\nAnd the output is another\ngreat little option here.\n\n459\n00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.460\nWith the output,\nnormally when you run Nmap,\n\n460\n00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.870\nit's gonna output to standard outcome and\nright there to your terminal.\n\n461\n00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.336\nA lot of times, I wanna save\nthat either for documentation.\n\n462\n00:26:36.336 --> 00:26:39.533\nBecause I'm doing a penetration test and\nI need this for\n\n463\n00:26:39.533 --> 00:26:43.150\nmy report at the end of this test or\nfor me for future reference.\n\n464\n00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.086\nI don't want to scan that machine\nevery time I come back to it,\n\n465\n00:26:46.086 --> 00:26:48.467\nI'm trying to work on\ngetting into that machine.\n\n466\n00:26:48.467 --> 00:26:52.410\nSo we can output the scan\nresults into a file.\n\n467\n00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.980\nAlso some tools,\nNmap is again a very popular tool.\n\n468\n00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.865\nAnd there's several other tools.\n\n469\n00:26:57.865 --> 00:27:02.070\nNikto being one,\na web application vulnerability scanner.\n\n470\n00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.804\nI can actually take the Nmap output and\n\n471\n00:27:04.804 --> 00:27:08.236\nI can feed it right into\nNikto with one command.\n\n472\n00:27:08.236 --> 00:27:12.905\nI can do a scan of an entire network\nsearching for port 80 and 443.\n\n473\n00:27:12.905 --> 00:27:16.638\nAny IP addresses that have those ports\nopen, you dump right into Nikto.\n\n474\n00:27:16.638 --> 00:27:22.373\nAnd it immediately begins doing\na vulnerability scan on those web servers.\n\n475\n00:27:22.373 --> 00:27:24.911\nSo being able to output this is fantastic.\n\n476\n00:27:24.911 --> 00:27:26.539\nAnd again, outputting it to files.\n\n477\n00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:30.360\nThere's normal, there's XML.\n\n478\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.760\nI will tell you, Ronnie,\nthat I was excited about his.\n\n479\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.070\nI wasn't aware of the script\nkiddie output the OS.\n\n480\n00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.410\nFor a long time, I've tried it and\nI have not been successful.\n\n481\n00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:41.650\nIt's supposed to put it out in leet speak,\n\n482\n00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.920\njust a little joke that he\nadded to the code there.\n\n483\n00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.500\nI haven't got it to work.\n\n484\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.570\nIf anybody out there has any suggestions,\nlet me know.\n\n485\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:51.230\nI haven't spent a lot of time on it,\nbut it would be cool to see.\n\n486\n00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.750\nMy favorite one is the grepable one.\n\n487\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.016\nThat's gonna put me out\nin grepable format.\n\n488\n00:27:56.016 --> 00:27:57.455\nThat's fun to say.\n\n489\n00:27:57.455 --> 00:27:58.280\n&gt;&gt; Grepable.\n\n490\n00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I can use grep with it.\n\n491\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.750\nIt aligns everything in columns so\nI can grep it and cut it.\n\n492\n00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.294\nAnd I'll show you a great technique for\n\n493\n00:28:08.294 --> 00:28:13.240\ngenerating a list that I can then turn\naround and bring right back into Nmap.\n\n494\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:19.950\nAnd then two more, I think,\nv, lowercase v for verbosity.\n\n495\n00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.890\nThis is just gonna give\nyou more information,\n\n496\n00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.870\nwhich is typically what we want.\n\n497\n00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:29.168\nYou can use a double v for\neven more verbosity.\n\n498\n00:28:29.168 --> 00:28:32.230\nThe reason why I don't use that\noften because usually, it's gonna\n\n499\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:36.120\ntell me anyway, but displays the reason\na port is in a particular state.\n\n500\n00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.150\nWhether it didn't respond or\nit thinks it's filtered.\n\n501\n00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.880\nAnd then this one is cool, too.\n\n502\n00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.260\nThis is a fun one to play around with,\nespecially as you're learning and\n\n503\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.335\ngetting familiar with it.\n\n504\n00:28:45.335 --> 00:28:49.780\n--packet-trace show all packets sent and\nreceived.\n\n505\n00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.517\nSo I can actually see what\nNmap is sending out and\n\n506\n00:28:52.517 --> 00:28:55.260\nwhat that target is sending\nback as a response.\n\n507\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.370\nAnd I can capture that in a file and\ngo back and analyze it.\n\n508\n00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.560\nPretty cool there.\n\n509\n00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.730\nAnd I believe that is all of the syntax\n\n510\n00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.050\nthat we are going to at least\nuse in these next Nmap episodes.\n\n511\n00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.180\nBut Ronnie's giving me the signal.\n\n512\n00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.540\nAnd it looks like I have taken an entire\nepisode just to go through the options.\n\n513\n00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well, thank you again\nfor helping us at least to be able to\n\n514\n00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.010\nsee all the options that we\nhave available inside of Nmap.\n\n515\n00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.080\nIt is one of the fundamental tools that\nwe'll tend to actually be able to use\n\n516\n00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.450\nto help us especially in getting started.\n\n517\n00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.000\nAnd don't think that this\nis all that there is to it.\n\n518\n00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.070\nMike has really only\nscratched the surface.\n\n519\n00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.980\nI know it sounds strange.\n\n520\n00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.300\nHe went through the entire list of syntax.\n\n521\n00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.690\nBut there's actually more that you can do\nonce you understand the combinations of\n\n522\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.280\nthings that can end up happening here.\n\n523\n00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.992\nSo that means that we'll\nhave another show.\n\n524\n00:29:45.992 --> 00:29:47.804\nAnd Mike will show us, of course,\n\n525\n00:29:47.804 --> 00:29:50.753\nhow to actually get some of\nthese tools working in Nmap.\n\n526\n00:29:50.753 --> 00:29:53.200\nAnd that way,\nwe'll actually see how it actually works.\n\n527\n00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.710\nBut that's for another episode.\n\n528\n00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.820\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n529\n00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

00:00:16.836\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.912\nI'm your host, what would have been\nRonnie Wong, but I'm filling in for\n\n8\n00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:22.107\nthe Rongster today.\n\n9\n00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:25.959\nI am your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nwe're having a good time here at IT Pro TV\n\n10\n00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:29.575\nbecause today we're coming at you\nmore with our Kali Linux series.\n\n11\n00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.409\nAnd it's been a lot of fun,\nI know Mike and\n\n12\n00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.940\nall the other hosts that have been\nsitting in on it have had a great time.\n\n13\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.280\nI'm really excited to be here today, today\nwe're continuing in on our Nmap basics.\n\n14\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.154\nObviously joining me in the studio,\nthe master himself, Mr.\n\n15\n00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:44.950\nMicheal Roderick, Mike how's it going sir?\n\n16\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.746\n&gt;&gt; Wait wait wait,\nif you can be somebody else can't I be?\n\n17\n00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.818\nI wannabe Don Pezet.\n\n18\n00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.720\n&gt;&gt; You can if you want,\nyeah, sweet, he's smart.\n\n19\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.579\n&gt;&gt; Hey, can I get a raise?\n\n20\n00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.935\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks for\n\n21\n00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.870\nhaving me back Daniel, glad to be here.\n\n22\n00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.010\nThank you for hosting,\nfilling in for Ronnie today.\n\n23\n00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no problem, no problem.\n\n24\n00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.380\n&gt;&gt; And, yeah, in our previous episode,\nhopefully you watched that already.\n\n25\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.900\nWe went through Nmap and we took a look\nat the man page and the help file.\n\n26\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420\nAnd we just talked about a lot\nof the different options and\n\n27\n00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.190\nswitches that are available,\nright, there was a lot to it.\n\n28\n00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.820\nIf we just scratch the surface,\nthere's many,\n\n29\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.090\nmany more parameter or\nswitches that we can use with it.\n\n30\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.010\nYou can start combining them in creative\nways and really get some meat out.\n\n31\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.100\nBut for now, we're just again,\nwe're gonna stick with the basics.\n\n32\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.920\nSo, now that we've talked about all that\nand we understand what those options are.\n\n33\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.890\nLet's take a look at actually\nusing them and compare the output,\n\n34\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.701\nsee what kind of information\nwe're going to be getting back.\n\n35\n00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.423\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\n\n36\n00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:40.730\nwe will just start off by doing a simple\nscan and let's test Nmaps defaults.\n\n37\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.093\nAll right, l'm just gonna type nmap and\n\n38\n00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:48.940\nthen 10.10.103 the IP address that l\nwant to scan, so single lP address.\n\n39\n00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.460\nNo options, no switches, no nothing,\nNmap target specification, all right.\n\n40\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.835\nSo we'll let this go for a minute, and\nyou'll see that it's pretty darn quick,\n\n41\n00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:02.458\n8.2 seconds it took to scan this machine,\nall right.\n\n42\n00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:06.650\nNow what we'll wanna pay attention to,\nbesides all the open ports and\n\n43\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.435\nall the good stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:10.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is this is right here,\n\n45\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.630\n977 closed ports.\n\n46\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.743\nThere's about, well not about,\nthere are 33 open ports.\n\n47\n00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:19.451\nYeah, I counted them before\njust top verify that.\n\n48\n00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.381\nSo 977 plus 33 Daniel?\n\n49\n00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.275\n&gt;&gt; Equals 1,000.\n\n50\n00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.576\n&gt;&gt; Equals 1,000, right?\n\n51\n00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.388\nDid I do that math right?\n\n52\n00:02:24.388 --> 00:02:25.520\n&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, I think so, and\nso, remember we talked about,\n\n54\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.712\nwell, you don't remember\ncuz you weren't here.\n\n55\n00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:31.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we've talked about,\n\n56\n00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.890\nwe've talked about it before.\n\n57\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.976\n&gt;&gt; We have.\n&gt;&gt; The whole top ports option, and\n\n58\n00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:36.475\nthat is a default in Nmap.\n\n59\n00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:39.581\nRemember I said if you do\nthe dash dash top dash ports,\n\n60\n00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.383\nyou can specify a port number.\n\n61\n00:02:41.383 --> 00:02:45.545\nBut by default it does\nthe 1,000 top ports and\n\n62\n00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:49.550\nthat gets 93% of TCP 95% of UDP ports.\n\n63\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.742\nSo it's really efficient, it's quick and\nit gets over 90% of the ports.\n\n64\n00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:59.440\nIf we look at this time though,\n8 seconds to do that, and\n\n65\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.607\nwe start doing our math, right.\n\n66\n00:03:01.607 --> 00:03:05.580\nWhat if I wanna do all 65,000 ports,\nlet's average it out.\n\n67\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.910\nWe'll say it took 10 seconds to do 1,000.\n\n68\n00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.744\nSo then I've gotta multiply that\n10 seconds by 65 because there's\n\n69\n00:03:13.744 --> 00:03:15.670\n65,000 ports.\n\n70\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.028\nAnd so that comes out to-\n&gt;&gt; Two plus two is chicken.\n\n71\n00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:19.962\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n72\n00:03:19.962 --> 00:03:21.605\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot.\n&gt;&gt; It ends up taking 20,\n\n73\n00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:26.450\n30 minutes to scan all 65,000 ports and\nthis is why we don't normally,\n\n74\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.018\nat least in the beginning,\nscan all 65,000 ports.\n\n75\n00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:33.100\nThere are gonna be times we need\nto do that and we just let it run.\n\n76\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.260\nBut your initial scans\nare usually exploratory, right.\n\n77\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.124\nWe're doing our initial reconnaissance,\n\n78\n00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:42.220\nwanna see what's out there,\nfind our juicy targets if you will.\n\n79\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.780\nAnd then we can focus in on those and\n\n80\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.480\ndo some of those more intensive,\ndeeper scans.\n\n81\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.970\nSo default scan is gonna do, remember it\ndoes the little s big S, the dash sS,\n\n82\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.570\nif you're running as administrator or\nin our case root in our Linux systems.\n\n83\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.440\nBecause we've talked about\nthe dash s capital S and\n\n84\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.710\nthat's a syn scan where it's\nsending out a syn packet.\n\n85\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.600\nIt gets a packet back that has the syn and\nthe ACK flag raised but\n\n86\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.140\nit does not respond with the final ACK.\n\n87\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.715\nTo do that,\nyou're actually rewriting package.\n\n88\n00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:18.080\nYou're kinda breaking the rules a little\nbit not doing what it normally does and\n\n89\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.900\nfor that to do custom package\nyou need root permissions.\n\n90\n00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.204\nIf you're to run Nmap as a standard user,\nthen just type Nmap and a IP address,\n\n91\n00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:28.630\nit would actually do little s and\ncapital T.\n\n92\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.080\nIt would do the full three way handshake,\nall right.\n\n93\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.820\nResults would be the same most likely,\na little bit noisier on the network.\n\n94\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.240\nMight take a little bit longer\ncuz you're waiting for that or\n\n95\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.795\nyou're sending that final acknowledgment,\nall right.\n\n96\n00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:44.050\nSo that's our basic default scan,\n\n97\n00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.360\nnow we get great information here, it's\nshowing me what parts are open, all right.\n\n98\n00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.673\nI can see TCP 20 and 21 and\nall the way down the list there.\n\n99\n00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:57.280\nAnd then out next to that it's telling me\nwhat service is on those ports, all right.\n\n100\n00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.276\nSo port 21 is ftp, port 80 is running htp,\n\n101\n00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:05.690\n2049 nfs, got vnc way down there on 5900.\n\n102\n00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.160\nSo we can see some basic\nservice information.\n\n103\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.100\nHey, there's vnc running on this port.\n\n104\n00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.030\nDoesn't give me a lot of\nadditional information though.\n\n105\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.510\nAnd one of the great things about Nmap is\nit can do a deeper interrogation on those\n\n106\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.230\nports to figure out some\nversion information or\n\n107\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.880\nattempt to give me some\nversion information.\n\n108\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.010\nAnd with that version information,\n\n109\n00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.980\nnow we're in business cuz\nwe can start looking for\n\n110\n00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.099\nknown exploits for that particular version\nof a service that's running on a port.\n\n111\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.079\nAnd if we remember from our previous\nepisode, let me clear that screen up\n\n112\n00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:42.178\na little bit ,we're gonna do\na dash little s, upper case V.\n\n113\n00:05:42.178 --> 00:05:49.410\nSo let's do nmap- sV and then our IP\naddress again, and see what happens.\n\n114\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.220\nNow this one will take\na little bit longer,\n\n115\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.797\nI probably should've ran it first and\nthen talked about it.\n\n116\n00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:55.679\n[LAUGH] Because it is\ndoing an interrogation.\n\n117\n00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:59.700\nIF I remember right, this one on this\nparticular machine with 33 open ports,\n\n118\n00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.610\nit's doing a lot of interrogation.\n\n119\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.850\nSo it ends up being about a minute,\nminute and a half I think.\n\n120\n00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.750\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite little\ncheats to help speed this up,\n\n121\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.608\nespecially when you're on a local network,\nis to do the dash n feature.\n\n122\n00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:14.650\nWhich tells it don't do any DNS\nresolution, just go after that and\n\n123\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.410\nit really speeds things up.\n\n124\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.300\n&gt;&gt; It does, it does, all right,\nso we'll let this finish and\n\n125\n00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.400\nthen we'll compare it with our\nresults from our previous scan.\n\n126\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.923\nAll right, so let's see here, again just\nstalling, waiting for it to finish here.\n\n127\n00:06:32.923 --> 00:06:35.678\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So Mike, how's the wife?\n\n128\n00:06:35.678 --> 00:06:39.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But it'll finish up in\njust a second, we'll keep moving.\n\n129\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.350\nSo we'll take a look at this version and\nwhat we'll see is, like I said earlier,\n\n130\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.770\nit's going to give me a lot more\ninformation about the service itself,\n\n131\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.390\nthat's on those ports.\n\n132\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.100\nAnd then we wanna take a look at how\nwe can get our operating system,\n\n133\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.410\ntry to do some fingerprinting on there.\n\n134\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.820\nLet's pop quiz Daniel while we're waiting,\nwe'll put him on the spot.\n\n135\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.630\nDo remember the switch, for\noperating system interrogation?\n\n136\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.840\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty, is it dash capital O,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n137\n00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.210\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\ndash capital O to try to do\n\n138\n00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.360\nOS guessing I guess is\nthe way I should say that so.\n\n139\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.164\n&gt;&gt; Really interesting the way they do\nthe operating system thing where sometimes\n\n140\n00:07:18.164 --> 00:07:20.590\nNmap doesn't know what\nthe operating system is.\n\n141\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.710\nIt gives you the best guess based off of\nthe metrics that they have available.\n\n142\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.210\nBut when it doesn't know what it is,\nit asks you,\n\n143\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.360\nhey, could you send this back to\nthe people at Nmap so we can add this?\n\n144\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.020\nEspecially if you know what\nit is that you're scanning so\n\n145\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.710\nthat we can add that to the repository.\n\n146\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.750\nSo that other people when they scan it's\nthe same set OS that we don't know what it\n\n147\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.310\nis right now, then they'll be able to\nenumerate that so it's a really cool.\n\n148\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.767\nI love the open source community and how\nthey just feed back into each other and\n\n149\n00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:54.036\nhelp build the tools and make them more\nrobust and better and safer to use.\n\n150\n00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.005\nAnd Nmap is no exception to that rule.\n\n151\n00:07:56.005 --> 00:07:59.043\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nit's a great point because we can.\n\n152\n00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:02.746\nHelp them make the product better by\nsaying, hey, this is a test environment.\n\n153\n00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:06.500\nYour program had a little bit of\ndifficulty figuring out this OS.\n\n154\n00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.645\nHere, I'll tell you what the OS is.\n\n155\n00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:11.032\nYou can look at what Nmap found,\ndiscovered and\n\n156\n00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:15.379\nmaybe that can help make it\na better guess next time, right?\n\n157\n00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:19.642\nAll right, well, Daniel, I tell you,\nit is taking its sweet time here.\n\n158\n00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:22.160\nSo why don't we do this,\nwe'll take a little time out.\n\n159\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.690\nWhen it finishes, we'lll come right back.\n\n160\n00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:25.910\nAll right, there we go.\n\n161\n00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.454\nNot too bad, that took about 163 seconds.\n\n162\n00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:33.210\nDo the math, figure out, a little over\ntwo minutes, almost three, I guess.\n\n163\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.610\nAnd let's do, well, first,\nlet's look at the results.\n\n164\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:40.430\nSo with the first one,\nwe got open ports and we got services.\n\n165\n00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.008\nThe second one with the -sV,\ntake a look at what we're getting.\n\n166\n00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:47.130\nSame information here, right?\n\n167\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.903\nBut then I've got this version column.\n\n168\n00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:53.769\nAnd it's telling me, hey, I'm port 21,\nit's FTP but specifically,\n\n169\n00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:56.099\nit's vsftpd version 2.3.4.\n\n170\n00:08:56.099 --> 00:09:00.170\nAnd that is gonna be good\ninformation later on.\n\n171\n00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\ntime to hit Exploit-DB after that and\n\n172\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.435\nsee if we can't find any\nwonderful fun things to do.\n\n173\n00:09:05.435 --> 00:09:07.019\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, all right, so\n\n174\n00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:07.995\nnow let's do this.\n\n175\n00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:10.530\nLet's test Daniel's theory out there.\n\n176\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.067\nNot really a theory, but-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:14.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's test that out.\n\n178\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.520\nShow you the difference here.\n\n179\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.340\nWe'll add a little -n.\n\n180\n00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.350\nI should be able to tag that in there,\nright, Daniel?\n\n181\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I typically do it after it.\n\n182\n00:09:20.996 --> 00:09:22.010\nYou can't put it in there like that now.\n\n183\n00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.842\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna like that?\n\n184\n00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:23.923\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n&gt;&gt; Come on,\n\n185\n00:09:23.923 --> 00:09:26.630\nI can chain them together if I want to.\n\n186\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.956\n&gt;&gt; I typically space them out so\nthat I know exactly what it is.\n\n187\n00:09:28.956 --> 00:09:29.972\n&gt;&gt; It makes it more easier to work with.\n\n188\n00:09:29.972 --> 00:09:32.434\n&gt;&gt; Makes it more readable.\n\n189\n00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:36.480\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll do the same\ncommand, we'll add the -n which should\n\n190\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.930\neliminate any type of name resolution\nthat it's trying to do in the background\n\n191\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.900\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see if that speeds things up.\n\n192\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.941\nSo let this run.\n\n193\n00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.850\nWe'll come back as soon as it finishes.\n\n194\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.700\nAll right, and there we go.\nWe can see this one only took 45 seconds.\n\n195\n00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.864\nSo roughly a third of the time by\neliminating that name resolution.\n\n196\n00:09:52.864 --> 00:09:54.729\nAnd when you think about it,\n\n197\n00:09:54.729 --> 00:09:59.770\nthere's really no name resolution\nin my output that I find useful.\n\n198\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.112\nSo heck, why not-\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's no purpose in it.\n\n199\n00:10:01.112 --> 00:10:02.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n200\n00:10:02.085 --> 00:10:04.430\nAll right, but\nother than that results are the same.\n\n201\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.721\nAll right, now the other thing I wanted\nto point out about the sv is it does do\n\n202\n00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:10.846\na little bit of OS guessing, right?\n\n203\n00:10:10.846 --> 00:10:13.106\nIt's really not doing OS guessing.\n\n204\n00:10:13.106 --> 00:10:17.890\nWhat it's looking at is based on\nthose services, and talking to SMB.\n\n205\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.934\nAnd services that output some information\nabout the machine, its name and\n\n206\n00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.300\nthings like that.\n\n207\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.690\nI can see metasploitable.localdomain.\n\n208\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.090\nOver here it saying it's probably Unix,\nLinux, something to that effect.\n\n209\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.280\nIt's a Linux kernel that it's seeing,\nbut it's not doing much more than that.\n\n210\n00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.512\nSo as we progress, when we're looking for\nexploits, when we're trying to find\n\n211\n00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:43.760\nvulnerabilities, the operating system\ninformation can be important as well.\n\n212\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.050\nSo we can get that with,\nas Daniel pointed out, our -o switch.\n\n213\n00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.210\nOops, that is not an O that is a space,\nand that is a capital O.\n\n214\n00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.510\n10 10 1 103 and let's do our -n.\n\n215\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.830\nWe'll keep that as short as possible.\n\n216\n00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:04.407\nSo we'll let this run, and we'll-\n&gt;&gt; Let it run.\n\n217\n00:11:04.407 --> 00:11:09.802\n[LAUGH] 3.75 seconds, Mike,\nyou really sped things up there.\n\n218\n00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.800\n&gt;&gt; That flied through it, didn't it?\n\n219\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.851\nI remember when we did it\nthe first time without the n and\n\n220\n00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:15.916\nwithout the OS detection,\nit was like eight seconds.\n\n221\n00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:16.469\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:16.469 --> 00:11:18.920\n&gt;&gt; This was three and did OS detection.\n\n223\n00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.070\nWell, I like that n switch,\nDaniel, thank you very much.\n\n224\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.070\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n225\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.410\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthere we see again same information.\n\n226\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.530\nNote, the OS detection\nstill does a port scan.\n\n227\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.439\nBut now if we look down here at\nthe bottom, we can see a little bit more\n\n228\n00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:34.814\ninformation about the operating\nsystem than just Linux.\n\n229\n00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:41.396\nLinux kernel 2.6 OS details,\nLinux 2.6.9 through 2.6.33.\n\n230\n00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:46.092\nSo again, it's doing a little deeper\ninterrogation of what it thinks\n\n231\n00:11:46.092 --> 00:11:48.210\nthat operating system is.\n\n232\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.990\nKeep in mind it's not a guarantee.\n\n233\n00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.770\nIt's basing it, as Daniel was saying and\nwe said yesterday, on\n\n234\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.450\nthe way it responds to open ports versus\nthe way it responds to closed ports,\n\n235\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.110\nsome of the information that it's\ngetting back and a few other things.\n\n236\n00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.190\nBut it's doing its best guess or\n\n237\n00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.670\nbest attempt at trying to determine\nwhat that operating system is.\n\n238\n00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.380\n&gt;&gt; And\nits guesses are usually pretty good, so.\n\n239\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, they are.\n\n240\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.440\n&gt;&gt; All right, last basic one I\nwanna show you is gonna be a -A.\n\n241\n00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.260\nWe talked about this in\nour previous episode.\n\n242\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.320\nLet me start it up, let it run.\n\n243\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.356\nThis will be another a little\nbit lengthy because a -A is all,\n\n244\n00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:30.010\nnot really all, but it does a lot.\n\n245\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.200\nBasically it's going to do our port scan.\n\n246\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.160\nIt's also going to do\nversioning on our ports.\n\n247\n00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.980\nIt's also going to do OS guessing.\n\n248\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.170\nAnd it's also gonna do some scripting.\n\n249\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:48.140\nIt's gonna run certain scripts based\non what it found in that port scan.\n\n250\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.810\nLike if it sees FTP open,\nwell there's a script that it can use for\n\n251\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.280\nFTP to do a little more deeper digging,\nor SMB and things like that.\n\n252\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.859\nSo it's a good set of results.\n\n253\n00:12:58.859 --> 00:13:01.630\nThis is one that I hit typically.\n\n254\n00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.616\nI might throw some verbosity\nin there with a -v.\n\n255\n00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:08.721\nIt'll take a little bit longer but once\nI've narrowed down, this is the machine I\n\n256\n00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:13.062\nwanna focus on now for the next phase\nof our penetration test or our attack.\n\n257\n00:13:13.062 --> 00:13:16.840\nNow I wanna get some in depth,\nas much detail as I can and\n\n258\n00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.950\nI'm not so\nworried about how long it takes.\n\n259\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.570\nAnd that's when I'll\nthrow in the -A there.\n\n260\n00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.659\nSo we'll let this run and as soon as\nit finishes, we'll come right back.\n\n261\n00:13:26.002 --> 00:13:29.970\nAll right, there we go, about 89,\n90 seconds there it took to run this.\n\n262\n00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.620\nAnd I'm gonna scroll back up and\nyou'll see, you can already tell,\n\n263\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.730\nthere's a lot more information.\n\n264\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.190\nSo there's where we\ninitially ran the scan,\n\n265\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.780\nstill only scanned 1,000 ports, right?\n\n266\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.420\nIt's doing the top ports by default\nunless I specify differently.\n\n267\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:42.950\nBut let's look.\n\n268\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:50.120\nHere we got 21/tcp open ftp and\nthen vsftpd 2.3.4, which we saw already.\n\n269\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:56.200\nBut look at below that, ftp-anon,\nanonymous FTP login allowed, FTP code 230.\n\n270\n00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.766\nSo there you can see an example of it\nrunning a script and testing a few things,\n\n271\n00:14:00.766 --> 00:14:03.941\nkinda poking at it and\nseeing what it's gonna allow.\n\n272\n00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.160\nOn the SSH it found some\nof our SSH host keys.\n\n273\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.140\nFor SMTP there's a script,\nSMTP commands, that it ran.\n\n274\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.762\nAnd it's showing you that hey,\nit'll accept things like verify size,\n\n275\n00:14:16.762 --> 00:14:17.686\npipelining.\n\n276\n00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:20.960\nThose are some commands\nthat that SMTP has set up.\n\n277\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.760\nAnd some of those commands\nhave vulnerabilities,\n\n278\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.480\nor there are avenues of attack, or things\nthat we could use against that machine.\n\n279\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.080\nAs David Bean pointed out in our chatroom,\n\n280\n00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.630\nit is a little bit old on\nthe bind version, 9.4.2 Apache.\n\n281\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:41.660\nNow this is metasploitable, so\nit is designed to be vulnerable.\n\n282\n00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.520\nSo we are running some older stuff here.\n\n283\n00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.330\nThere's no fun scanning a machine\nthat has no vulnerabilities.\n\n284\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.590\nRPC information, again,\n\n285\n00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.810\na lot more information that we're gonna\nbe able to use as we go through here.\n\n286\n00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.324\nPostgres, it ran some ssl.cert, found\nsome certification information, right?\n\n287\n00:15:01.324 --> 00:15:05.280\nSo I pulled back that ssl.cert and\nit's showing me that information.\n\n288\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.290\nAgain, that's a script that's using LUA,\n\n289\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.400\nthe language at the NSE or\nNmap scripting engine.\n\n290\n00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.280\nAgain, we keep going down,\nwe can see all kinds of good information.\n\n291\n00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.700\nAll right, what else?\n\n292\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.100\nAnything else good in there?\n\n293\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.230\nProbably not.\n\n294\n00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:29.140\nAlthough it's funny if you look at this\nOS, it says Unix Samba 3.0.2 0 -Debian.\n\n295\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.403\nWait, doesn't it already know\nfrom what we saw earlier, Kali,\n\n296\n00:15:34.403 --> 00:15:41.206\nbut this is using a script, so the results\nare gonna come out a little bit different.\n\n297\n00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:42.080\nAll right, so good for that.\n\n298\n00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.412\nThat is our basic stuff.\n\n299\n00:15:43.412 --> 00:15:47.617\nLast thing as we get closer\nto the end of this episode,\n\n300\n00:15:47.617 --> 00:15:52.301\nlet's take a look at how we might\nuse Nmap in an actual scan.\n\n301\n00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:56.982\nLet's say we've been asked or\ntasked To do a little work on our network,\n\n302\n00:15:56.982 --> 00:16:01.206\nwe're penetration testers or\nwe are security professionals and\n\n303\n00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:04.730\nwe've just been given\naccess to the network.\n\n304\n00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.480\nWhat's our first step?\n\n305\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:10.780\nWell typically the first step is\ngoing to be, find your host right,\n\n306\n00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.750\nfind all the nodes out there,\nthis is black box, grey box,\n\n307\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.560\nyou might not have that information yet.\n\n308\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.890\nIt's a white box, you might spread\nwith all the IP addresses and\n\n309\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.850\nthe computer names and things like that.\n\n310\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.100\nBut if we need to discover it,\nNmap is a tool that we can do that with.\n\n311\n00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.310\nRemember we saw yesterday or\nin our previous episode that we can do our\n\n312\n00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:35.270\nping sweep, a –sn where we tell\nit not to do any port scanning.\n\n313\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:40.253\nJust do the discovery phase,\ndon't do the actual scanning phase.\n\n314\n00:16:40.253 --> 00:16:46.580\nWe'll do -sn, and we'll do 10.10.1.0/24.\n\n315\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.525\nSo we don't know what's\ngoing on out there.\n\n316\n00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.716\nAnd I'm gonna run this scan,\nit shouldn't take it very long at all.\n\n317\n00:16:52.716 --> 00:16:56.133\nIt's just basically reaching out pinging,\nin our case, /24.\n\n318\n00:16:56.133 --> 00:17:01.770\nSo, 255 IP addresses that it's gonna run\nthrough, looking to see who is responding.\n\n319\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.740\nAnd there we go.\n\n320\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:10.330\nWe can see several IP addresses are up and\nresponding to our ping sweep.\n\n321\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.980\nThat's giving us an idea of what we got\nout there, now we can kind of move on.\n\n322\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.570\nNow, I will tell you, for me,\nI really like taking this information and\n\n323\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.710\nsaving it so that I can use it as\ninput for other tools, input for nmap.\n\n324\n00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.560\nWe talked about the different versions,\nyou can do the XML, you can do\n\n325\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.990\nthe standard, you can do the grepable\nformat, and that's what I like to do.\n\n326\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:38.670\nSo I'll show you a little thing, and\nagain that is just me and my techniques.\n\n327\n00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:43.070\nWhat I like to do is kind of start\nwith a folder for the network.\n\n328\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.372\nI'm gonna call it itprotv, all right, and\n\n329\n00:17:46.372 --> 00:17:49.750\nthen I'm gonna switch\nover into that directory.\n\n330\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.020\nAnd so now I've gotta place to\nkind of organize and save and\n\n331\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.790\nwork with information on this network.\n\n332\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:02.810\nDocumentation is gonna end up being a key\npart of doing any penetration test and\n\n333\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.940\neven internally as\na security professional,\n\n334\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.120\nyou have to be able to turn\nthings in it at the end.\n\n335\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.390\nShow the bosses or\n\n336\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.360\nthe CEO levels in what you found,\nwhat they need to spend money on.\n\n337\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.685\nReporting is a very important\npart of this process.\n\n338\n00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:17.627\nSo, I'm gone make a folder there and\nI'm gonna end map.\n\n339\n00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:22.158\nBasically I'm gonna run that same command\nagain, that pin sweep, because hey,\n\n340\n00:18:22.158 --> 00:18:25.387\nthis is my network, IT Pro tv,\nthis is what I'm testing.\n\n341\n00:18:25.387 --> 00:18:31.711\nAnd instead of just letting the results\ncome out to screen, I'm gonna do an oG and\n\n342\n00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:36.640\nI'll cal it pingSweep,\nsomething creative like that right?\n\n343\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.540\nSo it's gonna be the exact same thing but\n\n344\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.110\nthis time it's gonna save my results in\na file that I can turn around and use for\n\n345\n00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.070\ndocumentation purposes and\nfor input to other tools.\n\n346\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.671\nSo I'll let this run, just about done, and\n\n347\n00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:59.930\nnow if we take a look at ping sweep\nthere we can see the grepable output.\n\n348\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.074\nSo you see how it's gonna be\na lot easier to work with.\n\n349\n00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:02.802\n&gt;&gt; Lot neater.\n\n350\n00:19:02.802 --> 00:19:05.380\nYeah, I mean everything is delimited,\nright?\n\n351\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.490\nI've got these nice columns and that's\nintentional so that we can go in and\n\n352\n00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.811\nuse our cut commands and break this up and\nget the information out that we want.\n\n353\n00:19:13.811 --> 00:19:16.612\nOr use grep to find certain\nlines in there, an IP address or\n\n354\n00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:17.881\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n355\n00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:21.560\n&gt;&gt; Plus a lot of times you're doing this\nstuff for, to give a report to somebody.\n\n356\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.536\nYour boss, the CIO or something like that.\n\n357\n00:19:25.536 --> 00:19:29.670\nAnd they just want a real quick and dirty\nlist of what we even have in our network?\n\n358\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.070\nBoom, you pop this out,\n\n359\n00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.510\nyou got a nice something that's\nalready in a kind of a report format.\n\n360\n00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.770\nAnd you just hand that and here you go,\n\n361\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.550\nthere's a printed out paper of how many\nmachines we have and what they are.\n\n362\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz depending on what I'm trying to do,\n\n363\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.040\ndo I need the MAC address\nin this particular report?\n\n364\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.020\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n365\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.170\nDo I need host is up?\n\n366\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.151\nLatency is a negative\npoint -.1 second latency.\n\n367\n00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:51.463\nOur packets went back in time.\n\n368\n00:19:51.463 --> 00:19:53.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n369\n00:19:53.446 --> 00:19:58.066\nAll right, so yeah, that information is\nprobably not patent to the sea levels when\n\n370\n00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.990\nwe were doing those reports.\n\n371\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.760\nIt's one of the things that we\nlearn when we talk about when\n\n372\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.830\nwe're talking about penetration testing.\n\n373\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.321\nTool output is typically not something.\n\n374\n00:20:06.321 --> 00:20:11.596\nIt's in the report but it's back in the\nappendix or it's back in another section.\n\n375\n00:20:11.596 --> 00:20:16.208\nWe don't just pull out the tool reports\nand send them in and say hey pay me.\n\n376\n00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:16.978\nAll right,\n\n377\n00:20:16.978 --> 00:20:21.678\nso now we've got a file that has just\nthe live IP addresses on my network.\n\n378\n00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:26.181\nSo the next thing I'm gonna do is kinda\ntidy this up because I wanna use this but\n\n379\n00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:28.480\nreally all I need are the IP addresses.\n\n380\n00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:33.330\nI don't need the host colon, the open\nclose parenthesis, the status colon up or\n\n381\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.450\nany of that information.\n\n382\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.000\nI just want the IP addresses.\n\n383\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.414\nAnd we can use our CAT command or\nour CAT to read the file.\n\n384\n00:20:40.665 --> 00:20:46.665\nWe're gonna pipe that out into grep and\nI'm gonna grep for the word Up.\n\n385\n00:20:46.665 --> 00:20:47.935\nRemember, that's case sensitive.\n\n386\n00:20:47.935 --> 00:20:50.515\nIf there's spaces you're gonna\nneed quotes around that.\n\n387\n00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:53.115\nAnd the reason I'm doing\nthat is this first line.\n\n388\n00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:57.265\nI don't need that in my command, right?\n\n389\n00:20:57.265 --> 00:21:01.278\nAnd I've seen some people try the grep for\nIP addresses, but notice there is an IP\n\n390\n00:21:01.278 --> 00:21:04.421\naddress over here in that line so\nit can get a little bit tricky.\n\n391\n00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:07.877\nSo I'm just gonna grep from the word Up\nbecause all the lines that have Up on it\n\n392\n00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:09.877\nalso have an IP address\nthat I wanna look at.\n\n393\n00:21:09.877 --> 00:21:14.260\nSo I'm gonna grep for Up and\nthen we're gonna take that and\n\n394\n00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.502\npipe it into our cut command.\n\n395\n00:21:16.502 --> 00:21:21.032\nAnd the cut uses a -d for the delimiter.\n\n396\n00:21:21.032 --> 00:21:23.580\nOops, [SOUND].\n\n397\n00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.630\nAnd our delimiter is a space in this case.\n\n398\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.620\nThere's a space between the columns,\nright?\n\n399\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.120\nSo that's how I can tell where one\nfield ends and the next field begins.\n\n400\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.450\nAnd then I gotta tell it what field I want\nwhich is a -f, and it's gonna be field 2.\n\n401\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.828\nHost colon would be the first field,\nIP address would be my second field.\n\n402\n00:21:42.828 --> 00:21:45.531\nSo cut -d, that is a \" space \".\n\n403\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.500\nI need that empty space in between there\nto signify I'm looking for a space.\n\n404\n00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.860\nDon't put just quote, quote.\n\n405\n00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.420\nThat is not gonna work for you.\n\n406\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:02.648\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe this\nout to a file called Livehosts.\n\n407\n00:22:02.648 --> 00:22:03.575\nLet that run.\n\n408\n00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:07.160\nAnd now let's cat livehosts,\nand there we go.\n\n409\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:14.388\nWe have a nice tidy file of just\nthe livehost on this ITProTV network and\n\n410\n00:22:14.388 --> 00:22:19.178\nthat's something we can turn around and\nuse.\n\n411\n00:22:19.178 --> 00:22:23.552\nNow, something else that I'm gonna\ndo in here, just mainly to show\n\n412\n00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:27.850\nyou this command is, remember we\nhad the dash dash exclude list and\n\n413\n00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.253\nthen we could tell it to\nexclude these IP addresses?\n\n414\n00:22:31.253 --> 00:22:35.343\nYou can do a dash dash exclude and just\ntype in IP addresses separated by commas,\n\n415\n00:22:35.343 --> 00:22:37.184\nyou can do a dash dash exclude list.\n\n416\n00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:42.175\nAnd when I'm looking at this list\nI see .1.1, that's my gateway.\n\n417\n00:22:42.175 --> 00:22:46.607\nI really don't wanna scan that in this\nscenario so I'm gonna exclude that.\n\n418\n00:22:46.607 --> 00:22:50.557\nI also don't wanna do, what is it,\n\n419\n00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:54.917\n101 I believe is my Kali box itself.\n\n420\n00:22:54.917 --> 00:23:00.310\nYeah, so I am 101 that is me here,\nI really don't wanna do that one either.\n\n421\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.880\nLet's clear this up Daniel,\nget back up to the top of the screen here.\n\n422\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.910\nAll right, now there's other\nways I could do this, right?\n\n423\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:13.400\nI could nano this file and just remove\nthose IP addresses altogether and\n\n424\n00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.095\nbe done with it but then you wouldn't\nget to see the exclude command.\n\n425\n00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:19.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's what I want to show you.\n\n426\n00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Well it defeats the purpose there,\nMike?\n\n427\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does.\n\n428\n00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.595\nAnd there might be times\nwhen you want to scan those.\n\n429\n00:23:24.595 --> 00:23:27.362\nSo I don't wanna remove those\nfrom the list permanently,\n\n430\n00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:30.650\nI just wanna exclude them from this\nparticular scan that I'm doing.\n\n431\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.163\nSo let's do this, let's nano, and\n\n432\n00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:37.308\nwe'll call it exclude since\nI'm feeling really creative.\n\n433\n00:23:37.308 --> 00:23:41.139\nAnd I'm just gonna do simply\nIP address on each line.\n\n434\n00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:49.664\n10.10.1.101 I think I said,\nand I'll save that guy.\n\n435\n00:23:49.664 --> 00:23:56.265\nAll right, now if we take a look at\nexclude, where'd that space come from?\n\n436\n00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:58.510\nAll right, fingers are getting\nfaster than the brain there.\n\n437\n00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.349\nThere we go.\n\n438\n00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:03.200\nWe can see we've got just simply a list of\nIP addresses that we don't wanna include.\n\n439\n00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.210\nSo now when we run our scan, so\nat this point what have we got?\n\n440\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:06.955\nI gotta remember now.\n\n441\n00:24:06.955 --> 00:24:08.510\nWe've got a list of live hosts.\n\n442\n00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.680\nSo at this point what I would\nwanna do is initial scan, right,\n\n443\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.760\nsome basic information\nabout those machines.\n\n444\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.380\nAnd typically for\n\n445\n00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.450\nmy first scan of the machines on\nthe network, I use the default.\n\n446\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:21.530\nI just let it do the top 1,000, SS scan,\n\n447\n00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:25.080\nrelatively quick,\npainless general information.\n\n448\n00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.119\nSo I might be doing something, or\nI would be doing something like this.\n\n449\n00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:31.860\nWe'll do the nmap- iL.\n\n450\n00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.674\nAnd that is a capital L.\n\n451\n00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:34.390\nIf you don't do a capital L it won't work.\n\n452\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.315\nAnd the name of that file was what,\nlive hosts?\n\n453\n00:24:38.315 --> 00:24:39.860\n&gt;&gt; Or love hosts.\n\n454\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:40.540\n&gt;&gt; Or love hosts.\n\n455\n00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.630\nI really do love my hosts.\n\n456\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:47.076\nAnd then we'll do a --exclude list.\n\n457\n00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:51.340\nI'm pretty sure it's that.\n\n458\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.520\nAnd then exclude, and\nit's not finding that file for me.\n\n459\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.670\nLet me double check on my syntax\nthere because I did that wrong.\n\n460\n00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:05.954\nThere's an exclude and exclude list.\n\n461\n00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:08.283\nIt's exclude file, not exclude list.\n\n462\n00:25:08.283 --> 00:25:09.514\nSo my mistake there.\n\n463\n00:25:09.514 --> 00:25:14.027\nLet's run that again, all right?\n\n464\n00:25:15.804 --> 00:25:21.860\nAnd that is excludefile,\nAnd then exclude, right?\n\n465\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.916\nSo I'm not putting a target, but\nthe target's in my live host list, right?\n\n466\n00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:28.660\nSo what I have there is\nmy target specification.\n\n467\n00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.170\nI'm not putting any options in cuz\nI just wanna use the defaults,\n\n468\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.970\nthe top ports and the SS scans.\n\n469\n00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.290\nSo we'll let this run, you know what?\n\n470\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.120\nSorry, if we're doing real world, what I\nwould do is I would not show this screen,\n\n471\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.050\nthis would be going into\nsomething like an initial scan.\n\n472\n00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.580\nAll right, so let's that run.\n\n473\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.260\nAnd we'll say this cuz now what\nI'm gonna do is the next day or\n\n474\n00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.910\nlater that afternoon or what have you,\nI start looking at that initial scan and\n\n475\n00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.660\nI'm trying to see which\nmachines I really like.\n\n476\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.768\nAnd then I'll start going back and doing\nsome deeper interrogation on those guys.\n\n477\n00:26:04.768 --> 00:26:07.090\nSo we'll let this run for a minute.\n\n478\n00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.080\nIt is doing, I think we have five\ndifferent IP addresses in there.\n\n479\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.940\nSo it will take it a minute.\n\n480\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.520\nAs soon as it finishes, we'll come back.\n\n481\n00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.620\nAll right, there we go.\n\n482\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.520\nIt finished up and\nnow let's see what our results look like.\n\n483\n00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.450\nSo we'll take a peak at initial scan and\n\n484\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:25.590\nI'll scroll back up for\nus to where we ran that command.\n\n485\n00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.170\nAnd I can see we're looking\nat multiple hosts, right.\n\n486\n00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.637\nHere is a scanned report for 10.10.112.\n\n487\n00:26:32.637 --> 00:26:36.020\nAnd I can see what ports are open there.\n\n488\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.127\nMAC address, and\nthen right below that there is .100.\n\n489\n00:26:39.127 --> 00:26:40.623\nNot as many ports open.\n\n490\n00:26:40.623 --> 00:26:43.884\nGot some interesting ports open there.\n\n491\n00:26:43.884 --> 00:26:48.030\nAnd as we get down,\nthis guy is 103 and yikes!\n\n492\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.853\nWe got a lot of open ports there.\n\n493\n00:26:49.853 --> 00:26:51.618\nThat one is definitely\ngonna be interesting.\n\n494\n00:26:51.618 --> 00:26:53.765\n&gt;&gt; Blue shirt's got their work cut out for\nthem on that one.\n\n495\n00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:56.695\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] They're gonna be here all\n\n496\n00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:57.506\nnight long.\n\n497\n00:26:57.506 --> 00:26:58.305\nAnd you know what?\n\n498\n00:26:58.305 --> 00:27:00.315\nI got the red shirt on, and\nyou got the blue shirt.\n\n499\n00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:02.435\n&gt;&gt; I am wearing the blue shirt, argh!\n\n500\n00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:04.118\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna have fun.\n\n501\n00:27:04.118 --> 00:27:05.279\nDaniel's gonna be working all night.\n\n502\n00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:05.837\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll be working.\n\n503\n00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:07.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n504\n00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:12.373\nthen that last one 125 actually says\nscanned all 1000 ports, all are filtered.\n\n505\n00:27:12.373 --> 00:27:18.170\n&gt;&gt; Actually the first thing I would do\nwould be like IP tables, deny all traffic.\n\n506\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.233\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n507\n00:27:19.233 --> 00:27:20.841\nthen you could come have a beer with us,\nyeah.\n\n508\n00:27:20.841 --> 00:27:22.315\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll get back to it later.\n\n509\n00:27:22.315 --> 00:27:24.945\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\njust an example of how you want,\n\n510\n00:27:24.945 --> 00:27:27.110\nI can scan more than one host at a time.\n\n511\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:31.603\nWe got to see the list that I can\nuse as the source for Nmap scan.\n\n512\n00:27:31.603 --> 00:27:33.403\nWe also got to see the exclude.\n\n513\n00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:37.882\nNotice that there is no, there is no,\nthat's good English, I think.\n\n514\n00:27:37.882 --> 00:27:40.018\nEnglish is my second language.\n\n515\n00:27:40.018 --> 00:27:42.955\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Bad English is the first.\n\n516\n00:27:42.955 --> 00:27:45.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Bad English is my first,\nexactly.\n\n517\n00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.260\n&gt;&gt; 1.01, didn't show up on my list 1.1.\n\n518\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.710\nDidn't show up on my list, so\n\n519\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.690\nboth of the ones from the exclude file,\nnot the exclude list,\n\n520\n00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:00.010\nwe'll call it --exclude file, neither one\nof those, so that is working as well.\n\n521\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.612\nAll right, so then as I progress\nthrough our penetration test or\n\n522\n00:28:04.612 --> 00:28:07.740\nour security profile that\nwe're doing on our network,\n\n523\n00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.770\nwhat I would do is now start\nworking on individual machines.\n\n524\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.580\nAnd in our case,\nthe obvious choice, here's 103.\n\n525\n00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.936\nIt's either a really poorly configured\nmachine or it's a honeypot.\n\n526\n00:28:18.936 --> 00:28:19.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n527\n00:28:19.841 --> 00:28:22.215\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a trap set up to bring me in,\n\n528\n00:28:22.215 --> 00:28:22.930\nkeep me busy.\n\n529\n00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.914\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It's a trap!\n\n530\n00:28:24.914 --> 00:28:26.378\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n531\n00:28:26.378 --> 00:28:30.850\neither way that's probably where\nI am going to start, all right?\n\n532\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.010\nSo the way I do it, again,\nthis is just personal.\n\n533\n00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.620\nYou do it how you like.\n\n534\n00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.893\nI am gonna do or make a 10.1.1.103.\n\n535\n00:28:38.893 --> 00:28:41.830\nAnd then I'll change into that guy.\n\n536\n00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.890\nAnd now it'll start doing\nmy scans on that machine,\n\n537\n00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.780\noutputting them to this directory here so\nI can keep them organized.\n\n538\n00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.710\nBecause what's gonna happen is as I start\ngoing through those different ports,\n\n539\n00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.590\nI'm gonna run different tools.\n\n540\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.980\nAll those tools are gonna have output.\n\n541\n00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.380\nWe're gonna run NicTool on this guy.\n\n542\n00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.120\nWe're gonna do all kinds of things\nagainst each one of those ports.\n\n543\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.360\nWe might be writing custom scripts or\n\n544\n00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.940\nmodifying existing exploits to\nwork on this particular machine.\n\n545\n00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.705\nI like to keep them all in one location.\n\n546\n00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:12.962\nIt's like, all right,\nthis is all the stuff I've done on 1.103.\n\n547\n00:29:12.962 --> 00:29:16.202\nIt just makes it easier in\nthe end when it comes time for\n\n548\n00:29:16.202 --> 00:29:20.290\nthe documentation then reporting phase,\nIf I'm organized.\n\n549\n00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.930\nIf I don't,\nI just know the way my brain works.\n\n550\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.920\nI dump everything in the one folder,\nI won't remember what's what and\n\n551\n00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.690\nit'll be a mess in the end.\n\n552\n00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.472\nSo at this point,\nI would do a say an Nmap,\n\n553\n00:29:30.472 --> 00:29:36.559\nprobably -A on that IP address\nwould be a good place to start.\n\n554\n00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:44.803\nAnd I would just output that\nto I might call it aScan or\n\n555\n00:29:44.803 --> 00:29:49.336\nsomething like that, or nmapAscan.\n\n556\n00:29:49.336 --> 00:29:54.432\nRight, something along those lines,\nI would let this run.\n\n557\n00:29:54.432 --> 00:29:58.930\nYou guys have seen the output of the A,\nso yeah, I didn't put it out to a file.\n\n558\n00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.410\nThis would be saved into\na file then in that directory.\n\n559\n00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:05.220\nI'd work on it for a while and I'd bounce\nit over to one of the other machines.\n\n560\n00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.905\nI'd start doing some scans on those,\nmaking a separate directory for\n\n561\n00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:12.352\neach one underneath the root of\nthe network that I'm working on.\n\n562\n00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:15.115\nSo that is Nmap.\n\n563\n00:30:15.115 --> 00:30:17.925\nSo we got a good explanation\nof a lot of the switches and\n\n564\n00:30:17.925 --> 00:30:20.560\noptions that we can use\nin that previous episode.\n\n565\n00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.687\nAnd here you got to see firsthand\nhow to put Nmap to use.\n\n566\n00:30:23.687 --> 00:30:24.255\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n567\n00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:28.512\nAnd now you guys have a good idea of what\nto do when you're starting your initial\n\n568\n00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:31.172\nhost discovery and\ngetting into port scanning.\n\n569\n00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:33.070\nMaybe you're making an exclude file.\n\n570\n00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.470\nThese are the hosts that we know\nthat we don't want to mess with.\n\n571\n00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.840\nMaking an inclusion file, these are the\nhosts we do want to start scanning and\n\n572\n00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.290\nlooking for vulnerabilities.\n\n573\n00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:46.242\nCreating all of that into nicely organized\ndocumentation will help you as you\n\n574\n00:30:46.242 --> 00:30:49.454\ncontinue in your penetration\ntesting movement.\n\n575\n00:30:49.454 --> 00:30:51.590\nMike, anything else we need to cover?\n\n576\n00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did wanna mention, too,\nanother use for that exclude file.\n\n577\n00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.895\nYou made me think of it as you were\ntalking there is, as a penetration test,\n\n578\n00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:02.690\nsometimes you're told do not\ntouch these machines, right?\n\n579\n00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:03.960\nWe're hiring you to do this.\n\n580\n00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.701\nWe want you to test this, but\nthis is a mission-critical machine and\n\n581\n00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:10.036\nwe don't want you going anywhere near it.\n\n582\n00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:14.051\nThat would be another great use for\nthat exclude file to make sure I didn't\n\n583\n00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:17.140\naccidentally hit scan\nthat machine with Nmap.\n\n584\n00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good words of warning by Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n585\n00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.329\nYou don't wanna bring something in\nproduction crashing to a halt because they\n\n586\n00:31:23.329 --> 00:31:24.353\nget mad about that.\n\n587\n00:31:24.353 --> 00:31:25.050\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n588\n00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.328\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Might affect your paycheck.\n\n589\n00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:28.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Might very well do that.\n\n590\n00:31:28.189 --> 00:31:30.270\nSo good words of wisdom from Mr.\nMike Roderick.\n\n591\n00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:30.920\nYou listen to them.\n\n592\n00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.137\nYou heed them because they'll\nsave your bacon, that's for sure.\n\n593\n00:31:33.137 --> 00:31:35.430\nMike, it looks like we're out of time for\nthis episode, though.\n\n594\n00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.210\nJust in time for us to finish up Nmap.\n\n595\n00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.060\nIt was a lot of fun.\n\n596\n00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.480\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it as well.\n\n597\n00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.580\nBut it is time for us to sign off.\n\n598\n00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.830\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n599\n00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.617\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n600\n00:31:44.617 --> 00:31:45.197\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:31:45.197 --> 00:31:52.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n602\n00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.544\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.506\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.531\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.824\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:22.633\nAnd in today's episode we are still\ncontinuing our Kali Linux series it's been\n\n9\n00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.160\na lot of fun so far.\n\n10\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.631\nAnd joining us back in the studios to\nhave even more fun, our good friend, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.327\nMike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.480\nMike, glad to have you yet again,\nsir, and how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.073\n&gt;&gt; It's going great,\nDaniel, excited to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.542\nAnd we are gonna have a little bit of fun.\n\n15\n00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.110\nWe're gonna try to take some of\nthe concepts that we learned so far in our\n\n16\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.260\npast episodes and put it in use, and\nsee if we can't do some exploits, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.960\nSound like fun?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n18\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510\nsounds like a good time in my book.\n\n19\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, where do we start?\n\n20\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.550\nSo far again, in our previous episodes,\nwe've played with the few different tools.\n\n21\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.543\nWe've looked at like Netcat, we looked\nat Wireshark and we've looked at In-Map.\n\n22\n00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:59.275\nAnd you might think, you can't get\ntoo far with just those tools.\n\n23\n00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.650\nAnd most of the time,\nyou would probably be correct.\n\n24\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.620\nI mean, it's usually not\ngonna be quite that easy but\n\n25\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.110\nwe never wanna rule out anything.\n\n26\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.310\nWhen we're doing penetration testing,\nwhen we're doing security,\n\n27\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.450\nsecurity professional for organization.\n\n28\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.050\nWe wanna poke it everything,\n\n29\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.810\nwe want to test everything, leave no\ncorners unturned or no stones unturned.\n\n30\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.580\nTo see what we got cuz that's what the bad\nguys are gonna do, they're not going\n\n31\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.570\nto let me just skip that one,\nthere's no way they left that open, right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.428\nNow the machine we're using\nis intentionally vulnerable,\n\n33\n00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:33.724\nit's Metasploitable 2.\n\n34\n00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:38.149\nIt's something you all can go out and\ndownload, and run in a virtual\n\n35\n00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.651\nenvironment to give you something\nto test your tool usage against and\n\n36\n00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:45.150\nyour skills as a penetration tester.\n\n37\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.280\nSo I will give you that this\nis intentionally vulnerable.\n\n38\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.510\nSome of these that you see you\nprobably won't see in the wild.\n\n39\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.570\nThere's always a chance but\nit's also more about the concepts that\n\n40\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.170\nwe're using versus the actual\nattack that we're doing.\n\n41\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.610\nAnd I'll explain that kinda as I go.\n\n42\n00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.210\nAll right, so in our previous episode\nwe used Nmap to gather information.\n\n43\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.910\nWe did our initial reconnaissance,\nif you will, of the network, right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.140\nWe did a ping sweep, and we found\nall the live hosts on the network.\n\n45\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.323\nOnce we found all of our live hosts,\nwe turned around and\n\n46\n00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:22.320\nused Nmap again to do a port\nscan on those live hosts.\n\n47\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.890\nThat gives us our default scan to see\nwhat's out there, what those machines are.\n\n48\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.998\nAnd then we can turn around and do deeper\nscans on the machines we're focusing in on\n\n49\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.974\nas we're doing our penetration test or\nusing Kali as a security professional.\n\n50\n00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.924\nWe picked that 10.10.103, which again is\nmetasploitable got a lot of open ports and\n\n51\n00:02:41.924 --> 00:02:43.880\nI know there's some vulnerabilities there.\n\n52\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440\nSo what we would do is we\nwould just start looking.\n\n53\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.310\nWell we'd look at our,\nwhat do we got the A scan there.\n\n54\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.699\nLets do that,\nlets take a look at this nmapAscan,\n\n55\n00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.295\nwhich we ran in our previous episode.\n\n56\n00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:01.994\nI'll blow that up a wee bit, and\nthis is the detailed scan, right,\n\n57\n00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.969\nof that host, 10.10.1.103.\n\n58\n00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.710\nAnd honestly, what you start doing is,\nyou start going in and\n\n59\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.565\nlooking at what's going on, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:13.306\nOn 21, vsftpd, yeah, that's promising,\n\n61\n00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:16.850\nmost of these are actually-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ver promising [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.091\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make this exciting but\n\n63\n00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.138\nmost of these are really promising but,\nlet's take a look at one,\n\n64\n00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.480\nthe one that pops out to me\nfirst is this one right here.\n\n65\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.818\nThis is an oldy but a goody and\n\n66\n00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:34.285\nwe always want to try the simple\nbefore we try the complex, right?\n\n67\n00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Why put the cart before the horse.\n\n68\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.240\nWhy try to do the most difficult\nthing in your toolkit.\n\n69\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.755\nCool as it may be,\nwhy try to go that route first.\n\n70\n00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:44.165\nPersonally, had to do with\nsomething a whole lot easier.\n\n71\n00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nthey always go with the easy stuff first.\n\n72\n00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.010\nYou might not get what you want but\nyou might and\n\n73\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.727\nthen you can stop right there and\nyou don't have to go any further.\n\n74\n00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:52.617\n&gt;&gt; It's all about time saving.\n\n75\n00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you're doing this as\n\n76\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.045\na job, right?\n\n77\n00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.615\nI wanna root this box and\nI wanna get to the next box.\n\n78\n00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.658\nI wanna build my report,\nI've got to turn that in and\n\n79\n00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:01.339\nyou've got time constraints around you.\n\n80\n00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.045\nYou're gonna sleep sometime, right?\n\n81\n00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:05.980\nMaybe you have a family,\nthis is a job eventually.\n\n82\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.200\nSo you wanna be able to speed\nthings up as much as possible.\n\n83\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so lets take a look what\nI would do, is if I wasn't familiar\n\n84\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.560\nwith that already from other exercises and\ntest that we've done.\n\n85\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.398\nI'll break up my browser, right?\n\n86\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:22.740\nI'll say, okay, what the heck is this?\n\n87\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.807\nLooks interesting, so we're gonna say,\nlog in 513 was that port number there.\n\n88\n00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:30.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 513.\n\n89\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:35.817\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, if just add a little\nport 513, make sure we get,\n\n90\n00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:40.950\nokay, so I see a lot of results that\nhave to do with our rlogin, right?\n\n91\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.700\nI see rlogin, rlogin, what is a port scan,\nblah,blah, blah, there's a login protocol.\n\n92\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.433\nSo it sounds like it's rlogin, right?\n\n93\n00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.050\nSo let's take a look, here's a good one.\n\n94\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.450\nPenetration test labs,\nWikipedia, that's open source,\n\n95\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.240\nI don't have to worry about anybody,\n[LAUGH] on our shows.\n\n96\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.949\nI have to be careful about what\nI show because I don't wanna use\n\n97\n00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.784\nanybody's information commercially.\n\n98\n00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:07.920\nSo I'm gonna go with rlogin In\nthe real world I'd dive into forums.\n\n99\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.340\nI would dive into blogs and I would\ndo research on what the heck this is.\n\n100\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.295\nHere I can see rlogin is\na software utility for\n\n101\n00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:19.000\nUnix-like operating systems distributed\nas part of the, yada, yada, yada.\n\n102\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.383\nWe keep on reading-\n&gt;&gt; Security,\n\n103\n00:05:22.383 --> 00:05:23.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n104\n00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:27.840\nit says rlogin has several\nserious security issues.\n\n105\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.131\nAll information is unencrypted, all right,\n\n106\n00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.554\nthat's a bad that that means they\ncan sit there and monitor traffic.\n\n107\n00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:35.342\nAnd see if anybody's using that port and\n\n108\n00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:38.630\nif they've got that port open they're\nprobably using it for something.\n\n109\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.728\nSo I'm gonna set up some monitoring and\njust let it go to town and\n\n110\n00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:44.721\nhope I catch somebody submitting\ncredentials, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:48.169\nEasy to misuse allowing\nlogins without passwords.\n\n112\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.060\nInteresting and\nI'll save you the nitty gritty details.\n\n113\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.120\nYou would do your normal research and\nyou would find out that our login based,\n\n114\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.030\nall the security is done on\nthe client side of things.\n\n115\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.145\nTelling the service who it is and\nwhether or not it's authorized?\n\n116\n00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:05.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which, yeah.\n\n117\n00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:08.157\n&gt;&gt; Several serious security\nproblems with our login, Michael.\n\n118\n00:06:08.157 --> 00:06:09.983\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back in the day we could trust\n\n119\n00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:12.933\neverybody and\neverything that might have been fine, but-\n\n120\n00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.271\n&gt;&gt; With all 12 people that run\n\n121\n00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.062\nthe Internet back in the day, right?\n\n122\n00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:16.923\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n123\n00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:19.527\nwhen it was just our\nfanity our do whatever...\n\n124\n00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:23.194\nYeah, that might have worked,\njust by not gonna work anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:25.660\nWe cannot trust who is\nmaking that connection.\n\n126\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.650\nTo be honest, tell us who they are.\n\n127\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.590\nThey can fake the information and\nmake that connections.\n\n128\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.710\nSo the next I might do is\nI might try to look up or\n\n129\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.430\nlog in if I can type and\ntalk at the same time.\n\n130\n00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.463\nI might do an rlogin vulnerability,\n\n131\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.490\nAll right, to see what I can find and\nagain, probably gonna find some.\n\n132\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.470\nNormally, what I try to do is go back to\none of the exploit databases like CVE or\n\n133\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.140\nExploit DB or something like that,\nget some additional information.\n\n134\n00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.390\nThat's gonna be really key when you\nstart getting into the more complex\n\n135\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.720\nexploits that we wanna take advantage of.\n\n136\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.720\nOur login however is\nreally straight forward.\n\n137\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.340\nIt allows you to authenticate\nwithout a password, let's try it,\n\n138\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.468\nlet's see if we can hit rlogin.\n\n139\n00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.340\nSo I'm gonna come back\nover here to my prompt,\n\n140\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.820\nwe'll clear that screen up a little bit.\n\n141\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.850\nAnd I'm just gonna type in our login.\n\n142\n00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:27.910\nJust to see what we get.\n\n143\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.720\nAnd what I see is that Kali Linux\ndoes not have an rlogin client.\n\n144\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.090\nYou'll see that I get usage ssh,\nokay, that's not good.\n\n145\n00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.930\nSo we would go out,\n\n146\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.470\nwe would Google rlogin and\ntry to figure what package I can get in.\n\n147\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.696\nAnd I can go out of the repository,\n\n148\n00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:51.821\napt-get install and\nfind rlog on client, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.890\nBut what's going on with this,\n\n150\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.810\nthe Shoot I've lost my train of thought,\nlet me roll it back.\n\n151\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.300\nSo yes we would go out there and we would\nsee that r login was actually part of\n\n152\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.550\na package that we need to install\nit's not in here by default.\n\n153\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.690\nAnd what Kali is doing is saying hey\nwe didn't put r login on there because.\n\n154\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Because it's bad.\n\n155\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.570\n&gt;&gt; It is very bad and you should use SSH,\n\n156\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.610\nthis is why SSH actually comes up\n&gt;&gt; When you type in our login but\n\n157\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.110\nthat's not what we wanna use,\nwe wanna use r login.\n\n158\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.230\nSo let's try it we're gonna do an apt-get\n\n159\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.840\ninstall and it is actually an rsh-client.\n\n160\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.280\nAll right then we'll go ahead and\nrun that and let that install again.\n\n161\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.580\nA little bit of research on\nthe web trying to figure out why\n\n162\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.170\nr login doesn't come up\nwhen I type it in my prompt\n\n163\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.080\nwill key you into the fact that it's part\nof a package that you need to install.\n\n164\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.660\nInstall it and\nyou should have that command available.\n\n165\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.721\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing I like about when we\ndo these tech skills kinda shows is that\n\n166\n00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:53.255\nit really is like real life.\n\n167\n00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:55.865\nIn real life you're gonna in\nreal life go search the web and\n\n168\n00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:59.343\nfind interesting information about this\nif you were trying to exploit this.\n\n169\n00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:00.836\nNot like a certification\nwhere they're like,\n\n170\n00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:03.440\nwell you have to know the least\nadministrative effort and blah blah blah.\n\n171\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.650\nYou know in real life\nland I Google something,\n\n172\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.730\nin real life land I'm reading\na forum in real life land,\n\n173\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.190\nI'm reading a man page cuz I don't\nknow everything about everything.\n\n174\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.310\nAnd even if I could do that,\nI'm not gonna remember everything.\n\n175\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n176\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.080\n&gt;&gt; This is real life.\n\n177\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.680\n&gt;&gt; Preparation is where you\nspend most of your time.\n\n178\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.290\nIt's not as glamorous as they make\nit out to be sometimes, right?\n\n179\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.080\n&gt;&gt; No, it's a lot of work.\n\n180\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.790\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of work.\n\n181\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.520\nAll right, so\n\n182\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.256\nnow that I've got that installed, let's\nsee what happens when I type in r login.\n\n183\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.990\nThere we go I got my users r log in,\n\n184\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.700\ngot a few optional things,\nuser, user, port, host.\n\n185\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.020\nSounds pretty straightforward\nlet's see what happens,\n\n186\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.660\nr login-l\n&gt;&gt; Leguine?\n\n187\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.980\n&gt;&gt; And l for user and what's that?\n\n188\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.150\n&gt;&gt; It says R Leguine.\n\n189\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Does it thank you [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always\n\n190\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.030\nnice to have two sets of\neyes on the screen isn't it?\n\n191\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.770\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n192\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.676\n&gt;&gt; Our login to shell,\nheck let's try root,\n\n193\n00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:03.713\nright I know they've got a root\naccount on a Linux machine,\n\n194\n00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:08.343\n10.10.1.1.103, and\nthen we'll see what happens.\n\n195\n00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:09.165\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking about it.\n\n196\n00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:12.560\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking, it's reaching out\n&gt;&gt; Saying hello are you there?\n\n197\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Are you really root?\n\n198\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you are can you log in?\n\n199\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.450\n&gt;&gt; You say you are.\n\n200\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.805\n&gt;&gt; Badda bing if you take\na look at my prompt root.\n\n201\n00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:20.702\n&gt;&gt; It has changed.\n\n202\n00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:25.740\n&gt;&gt; At Metasploitable, this is the login\nthe message of the day on that\n\n203\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.310\nMetasploitable, that\nUbuntu system over there.\n\n204\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.890\nIf I do host name we could\nsee it's Metasploitable,\n\n205\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.510\nif I do who am I, we see it's root.\n\n206\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:41.420\nIf I do an ID I can see I'm root again\njust verifying all right where am I,\n\n207\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.980\nwho am I, what rights do I have?\n\n208\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.391\n&gt;&gt; That shadow right.\n\n209\n00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:45.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was gonna say so\n\n210\n00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:46.977\nat this point what's the first\nthing we're gonna do Daniel?\n\n211\n00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:51.547\n[LAUGH] It's shadow and\nthere is a nice file of\n\n212\n00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:55.878\npasswords that we can now start to crack.\n\n213\n00:10:55.878 --> 00:11:00.840\nSo at this point,\nwe'll do whatever we want.\n\n214\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.790\nWe are root, so\nit's limitless what you can do.\n\n215\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.200\nSo I don't think there's any\npoint of going on any further.\n\n216\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.540\nRoot is typically the end of the line.\n\n217\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now you're like,\n\n218\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.880\nokay, I'm at the top I'll\njust start taking files,\n\n219\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.890\ncracking passwords offline, doing whatever\nI want to this machine, I own it.\n\n220\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.830\nMost likely creating a backdoor\naccount that I can add to the root\n\n221\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.782\nto pseudo group it or something and keep\ngoing from there, hopefully unnoticed.\n\n222\n00:11:24.782 --> 00:11:27.475\nAll right, easy enough for\n\n223\n00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:32.070\nr login that one was almost too\neasy like I said, everybody knows\n\n224\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.280\nabout that most likely you're not gonna\nfind that on any systems out there.\n\n225\n00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.400\nBut hey if you do a port scan and\n\n226\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.571\nyou see 513 open and it says log on\nquestion mark next to it get excited.\n\n227\n00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n228\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.548\nnow you pretty much know\nyou own that machine.\n\n229\n00:11:45.548 --> 00:11:49.370\nAll right so let's pull up our scan\nwe did in a previous episode and\n\n230\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.960\nsee what else we can find on this machine.\n\n231\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.120\nLet me just verify I'm\nin the right place here.\n\n232\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:02.310\nWe're going to cat that nmap scan and\nwe'll take a look at what we've got.\n\n233\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.900\nAnother one that piques my interest.\n\n234\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.980\n&gt;&gt; They all pique your interest.\n\n235\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.328\n&gt;&gt; They do, they all pique my interest.\n\n236\n00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:12.760\nWhat you're gonna do as a penetration\ntester or a security professional\n\n237\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.020\nis look up each one and go, let me go\ntake a look at what this is by 9.4.2.\n\n238\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.210\nLet's take a look at this one,\nsee what this is.\n\n239\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.970\nAnd see which one, as we said earlier,\n\n240\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.720\nmight be the easiest way in cuz\nthat's really what we're looking for.\n\n241\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.960\nAnd after doing a little bit of research,\n\n242\n00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.404\nthis one will probably stick\nout at you vsftpd 2.3.4.\n\n243\n00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:42.176\nSo ftp on port 21 and in particular,\nit says vsftpd 2.3.4.\n\n244\n00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.370\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n245\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:44.870\nOkay, great.\n\n246\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.020\nWhat is that?\n\n247\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.810\nLet's find out.\n\n248\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.570\nLet's take that information.\n\n249\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.514\n&gt;&gt; We'll even n map says\nright there is saying,\n\n250\n00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:52.210\nwell there's some anonymous logins.\n\n251\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.300\nSo you could at least log in into\nthe server, you know that much about it.\n\n252\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.510\nAnonymously, you don't need a valid\nusername and password just username,\n\n253\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.470\nanonymous password,\nanonymous and you're in and\n\n254\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.140\nthen you can start at\nleast touching the system.\n\n255\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah maybe escalating your credentials,\ntrying to figure out where to go next.\n\n256\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.070\nLet's see if we can find\nanything juicy about this.\n\n257\n00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.290\nWell, wow how about that?\n\n258\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.397\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n259\n00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:23.540\n&gt;&gt; First one in the list: VSFTPD version\n2.3.4 back door command execution.\n\n260\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.140\nI like that.\n\n261\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.770\n&gt;&gt; That seems promising, Micheal.\n\n262\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n263\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.490\nA back door being a way to go\naround the front door, right?\n\n264\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.650\nAvoid the normal authentication and\nsee what we can get.\n\n265\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.710\nSome way to get into that system, there.\n\n266\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.710\nAll right now, while I'm not going to sit\nhere and do the research on screen or\n\n267\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.723\nanything like that, what you'll\nfind out is that back in the day,\n\n268\n00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:46.325\nvsfpd they had their\nsource code compromised.\n\n269\n00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.470\nSomebody got onto the place\nwhere they were, the repository,\n\n270\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.640\nwhere the were making\nthis code available and\n\n271\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.070\nthey inserted some malware as a back\ndoor a little bit of code in there.\n\n272\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.580\nAnd I think it lasts like three or\nfour days or\n\n273\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.450\nsomething like that before somebody\ndiscovered it and they removed it.\n\n274\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.300\nIt's a long story about did they do it and\nyou know, and\n\n275\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.059\nwe won't go into the details there but\nthe point is.\n\n276\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.060\nThis is your basic strategy, right?\n\n277\n00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.270\nYou're looking at that service, that\nversion information and now we're gonna go\n\n278\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.970\nand see what we can find out about that\nparticular version, this one sounds good.\n\n279\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:25.160\nAnd what it turns out to be is if\nyou put a smiley face, a colon,\n\n280\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.870\nif you actually look at the code you can\nsee the hex values that it's looking for.\n\n281\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.780\nAnd if you decode the hex values and\nit turns out to be a smiley face.\n\n282\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.770\nSo if you put a username,\nfollowed with no spaces.\n\n283\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:42.660\nYour username, colon,\nclose parenthesis make the smiley face and\n\n284\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.400\nthen it doesn't matter\nwhat password you type in.\n\n285\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.172\nIt would actually spawn a shell\non port 6,200 just waiting for\n\n286\n00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:55.070\nyou to connec and giving you system\naccess and so, let's try it.\n\n287\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.602\nLet's see if we can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n288\n00:14:56.602 --> 00:15:01.470\nAll right so I'm gonna up our shell on\nmy attack machine on our Kali box, and\n\n289\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.515\nI'm gonna telnet over\nthe port 10.10.1.103.21.\n\n290\n00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:10.208\nAnd it's gonna ask me to authenticate,\n\n291\n00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:15.590\nso I'm gonna put user, and then you can\nput anything you want any username,\n\n292\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.760\nput something and then colon close\nparenthesis, make your smiley face.\n\n293\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.590\nAnd then it's gonna\nspecify the password so\n\n294\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.490\nwe'll type in pass and then anything you\nwant asdf 1234 whatever the case may be.\n\n295\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.020\nAnd when you hit enter after the pass\nyou'll see that it just hangs there for\n\n296\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.150\na second or\nit doesn't look like it's doing anything.\n\n297\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.736\nDon't touch it,\nleave it right where it is.\n\n298\n00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:42.519\nOpen up a new shell because the\nvulnerability says once you log in with\n\n299\n00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:47.714\na smiley face semicolon in the username\nfield at the end of username field,\n\n300\n00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:52.332\nif you actually look at the code for\nthe malware that got injected,\n\n301\n00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:56.949\nthere's a line that says if you find\nthese two characters at the end\n\n302\n00:15:56.949 --> 00:16:00.284\nof the username Spawn\na shell on port 6200.\n\n303\n00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:01.700\nThis is the back door.\n\n304\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.790\nSo, we've hopefully spawned the shell\nby triggering it with the colon,\n\n305\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.188\nclose parenthesis.\n\n306\n00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:09.436\nSo, let's see if it connects.\n\n307\n00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:14.892\nAnd see 10.10.1.103 6200 is\nthe port it's supposed to spawn on,\n\n308\n00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:19.720\nand I hit enter, and it doesn't\nlook like anything is happening.\n\n309\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.820\nBut that's the way it is\nwith some reverse shells,\n\n310\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.560\nsometimes in shells they don't seem that\nresponsive, but if I type in host name,\n\n311\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.740\nyou'll see I am connected to\nMetasploitable on port 6200,\n\n312\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:37.200\nand if I do an ID, I am root, right,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n313\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.587\nAll right, so now that I am root on\nMetasploitable, what could we do?\n\n314\n00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:44.607\nWell, I tell you one thing I would like to\ndo is get a hold of their password file,\n\n315\n00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:47.967\nright, their shadow file,\nbecause I can take that back offline,\n\n316\n00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:52.167\ntry to crack passwords, see what other\naccounts I can compromise, maybe services\n\n317\n00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:56.010\nthat might be using the same password\non other machines, things like that.\n\n318\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the administrators of this\nmachine might just not roll out the update\n\n319\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.030\nfor this yet, and they and then they\ndo an update, and this entry is gone.\n\n320\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you need other ways to get in.\n\n321\n00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna try to use Netcat to set up\n\n322\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.210\na little one-page web server and host\ntheir own shadow file on their machine for\n\n323\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.530\nthem, or for us, I guess I should say.\n\n324\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.917\nSo that's gonna be, while true; do nc, and\n\n325\n00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:27.997\nwe're gonna setup a listener on port 9999,\nand\n\n326\n00:17:27.997 --> 00:17:33.654\nyou could pick whatever port\nthat wasn't in use, -q1,\n\n327\n00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:39.785\nwhich is supposed to limit how\nmany people can connect to this.\n\n328\n00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:41.235\nDoesn't seem to work all that well.\n\n329\n00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:45.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm gonna host the file,\n\n330\n00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:51.872\n/etc/shadow, which we know on a Linux\nsystem is where all passwords are stored.\n\n331\n00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:55.610\nAnd then I'll put ;,\nspace, done, hit Enter.\n\n332\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:01.400\nSo now I should have a web server running\non port 9999, hosting their shadow file.\n\n333\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.150\nSo I'm gonna grab another shell,\nso I wanna leave my terminal,\n\n334\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.090\nmy FTP connection, open, right?\n\n335\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:13.324\nLeaving this one open, open up another\nshell, and now I'm going to connect.\n\n336\n00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:18.770\nI'm just gonna use nc 10.10.1.103.\n\n337\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:24.110\nAnd we use port 9999, then hit Enter,\nand boom, there's their shadow file.\n\n338\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.510\nThey're serving up their\nown shadow file for me.\n\n339\n00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.170\nWell, I guess I did it for them.\n\n340\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.590\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's great,\n\n342\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.530\ndoesn't do me a lot of good.\n\n343\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.921\nLet's do that one more time,\nand pipe that out to shadow.\n\n344\n00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:43.570\nNow if we take a look,\nthere is a new file called shadow.\n\n345\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:49.360\nIf I cat shadow,\nif I could spell shadow, there it is.\n\n346\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.240\nSo now I've got there shadow file, I can\ntake this to my password crackers, and\n\n347\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.560\nI can go to town.\n\n348\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.696\nNow all because, remember,\nall we did, we started with Nmap,\n\n349\n00:18:57.696 --> 00:19:01.560\nwe found a port that was running\na service, we googled that service,\n\n350\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.760\nwe found that it had a known\nvulnerability, we did our research,\n\n351\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.390\nhow to take advantage of\nthe vulnerability, and we did it.\n\n352\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.560\nWe're in.\n\n353\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, Mike.\n\n354\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.560\nThis is a very simplistic example of it,\nbut\n\n355\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.890\na very good example when it comes to\nthe methodology that you're going to use\n\n356\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.177\nwhen it comes to trying some sort of\nsecurity testing, penetration testing.\n\n357\n00:19:20.177 --> 00:19:23.940\nFollowing that procedure, scanning,\nfinding the host, looking at the host,\n\n358\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.660\nwhat is available inside that host,\nlook, there's a known vulnerability for\n\n359\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.530\nthat host, researching that and\nthen moving into exploitation, and\n\n360\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.960\nfrom there, elevating privileges or\nwhat else you needed to do.\n\n361\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.870\nVery good stuff.\n\n362\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.910\nMike, anything else that we need to\nknow when it comes to using what you've\n\n363\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.970\ntaught us so far?\n\n364\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.318\n&gt;&gt; No, I think just maybe reiterating\nwhat you were saying there,\n\n365\n00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:47.232\nand what I want to make sure\nwe're taking advantage of,\n\n366\n00:19:47.232 --> 00:19:50.332\ncuz I know some of you sitting out there,\nthinking, well,\n\n367\n00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:55.045\nnobody out there is running VSFTPD 2.3.4,\nso what good does this really do us?\n\n368\n00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:58.685\nAnd that's not where, I'm not here to\nteach you how to take advantage of that\n\n369\n00:19:58.685 --> 00:20:00.397\nparticular vulnerability.\n\n370\n00:20:00.397 --> 00:20:04.087\nIt's that, as you said, the methodology\nthat we're learning, we're scanning\n\n371\n00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:08.917\nsystems where we don't know anything about\nthem, we're researching that service, and\n\n372\n00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:13.467\nif VSFTP wasn't there, or if it was some\nservice, or a patched version of it,\n\n373\n00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:16.107\nthen I would've moved on to the next\nservice, and I would've googled that.\n\n374\n00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:20.830\nSo, it's really about enumeration,\nfinding, researching, and\n\n375\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.170\nthen trying to exploit.\n\n376\n00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n377\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.080\nAll right, Mike, cool,\nvery cool stuff, right?\n\n378\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.460\nWe did get to see a box get rooted,\nwhich is always a fun, good time.\n\n379\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.720\nIt feels good inside to do a who am I and\nit says, who you, you are root.\n\n380\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.370\nYes, it does feel good for the soul.\n\n381\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.870\nSo we do thank you for showing us how\nwe use the methods of what you've been\n\n382\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.066\nshowing us to actually move through\nfrom discovery to exploitation.\n\n383\n00:20:43.066 --> 00:20:47.900\nSo use that, assimilate that, understand\nthat that's how this works, and you have\n\n384\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.290\nto be patient and as we always have been\nsaying, enumerate as much as possible.\n\n385\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.500\nIt's gonna help you In exploitation.\n\n386\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.500\nAll right, Mike, it look likes\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n387\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.890\nWe do thank you for dropping by, we thank\nour good audience out there for watching.\n\n388\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:00.750\nHope you've enjoyed it.\n\n389\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.890\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n390\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:04.550\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n391\n00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.710\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n392\n00:21:07.509 --> 00:21:13.336\n[MUSIC]\n\n393\n00:21:13.336 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:15.625\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.618\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n5\n00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:23.165\nwe're testing your skills, part two.\n\n6\n00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:26.907\nSo in Kali Linux, you've already\ngone through a couple of tools.\n\n7\n00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:29.847\nAnd you've been testing them out,\njust a few of them so far.\n\n8\n00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:32.011\nToday, we're actually continuing on\nwith Mr. Security himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n9\n00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.313\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:34.313 --> 00:00:35.913\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:35.913 --> 00:00:39.833\nI'm excited,\nbecause we are continuing to play and\n\n12\n00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.337\nsee what kind of damage we can do.\n\n13\n00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:47.399\nSo far, we've taken a look at a few simple\ntools like netcat, wireshark, and nmap.\n\n14\n00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.391\nAnd in our previous episode we actually\nused just those tools, ended up finding\n\n15\n00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:55.230\nsome vulnerabilities, and compromising\na machine and getting root on it.\n\n16\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.674\nAnd I wanna continue\nthat thought process on,\n\n17\n00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:00.442\nbefore we move into some\nof the more advanced tools.\n\n18\n00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:03.597\nSo to recap,\nlet's go back to our machine here, and\n\n19\n00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:06.020\nI'm just gonna do a real quick scan.\n\n20\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.573\nSo we can refresh ourselves of what\nports are open on that machine.\n\n21\n00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:14.975\nSo this is the -n with no verbosity,\nget us a nice quick result, and\n\n22\n00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.158\nremember last time,\nwe had looked at this port.\n\n23\n00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:21.060\nCuz we saw that it was running VSFTPD\n\n24\n00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.139\n2.3.4 which has some\nknown backdoors in it.\n\n25\n00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:31.620\nWe also took a look at remote login, or\nrlogin, which is just vulnerable as heck.\n\n26\n00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.680\nAnother one that might pique our interest\nwhen we look at this simple port scan\n\n27\n00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.070\nis this one right here, they're\nrunning NFS, or network file system.\n\n28\n00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.590\nNow, sometimes we're looking for\nparticular versions of services, and\n\n29\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.160\nwe're looking for vulnerabilities.\n\n30\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.070\nYou find an Apache web server that's\nrunning an old version, I can go out and\n\n31\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.360\nlook and see what vulnerabilities\nthat particular version has.\n\n32\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.190\nNFS has some vulnerabilities\nthat are associated with some of\n\n33\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.370\nthe older versions.\n\n34\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.230\nBut in this case,\nwhat I want to show you is,\n\n35\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.230\nit's not always a vulnerability\nin the software or the service.\n\n36\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.689\nSometimes, it's misconfiguration\non the administrative side\n\n37\n00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.695\nof things that leads to the vulnerability.\n\n38\n00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:21.740\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here,\nso we see nfs open on our nmap scan.\n\n39\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.540\nSo now we wanna get a little bit more\ninformation about what's going on\n\n40\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.280\nwith nfs.\n\n41\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.270\nWe would wanna check and see If there are\nPC services were up and they're listening.\n\n42\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.110\nAnd then we might wanna see if\nthey've got, what they have mounted.\n\n43\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.480\nBecause when they set up NFS,\nthey create mounts, and\n\n44\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.620\nthat's what we connect to,\nNFS, network file system.\n\n45\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.970\nThat's how you can connect across\nthe network to our remote file system.\n\n46\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.109\nSo they create mount points,\nwe connect to those mount points, and\n\n47\n00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.441\nthen I can access the files.\n\n48\n00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:52.038\nAnd depending on my permissions,\nmaybe write or\n\n49\n00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:54.330\nat least read from that remote directory.\n\n50\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.133\nNow, a couple of tools I would normally\nto use to interrogate this NFS and\n\n51\n00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.967\nsee what's going on are gonna be RPC info,\n\n52\n00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:06.485\nwhich is remote procedure call\ninformation, and then show mount.\n\n53\n00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:11.248\nBoth of these will let me kinda dig a\nlittle bit deeper into that NFS, and see,\n\n54\n00:03:11.248 --> 00:03:15.520\none, if it's up and running,\nif they're got the daemons running.\n\n55\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.870\nAnd what they have mounted,\nwhat is available to connect to.\n\n56\n00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.230\nSo let's test it out, what I wanna do is,\nI'm gonna do rpc info.\n\n57\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.716\nAnd we'll see we get bash\nRPC info command not found.\n\n58\n00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:33.540\nWell, that's not good, all right, what\nabout my other favorite one, show mount?\n\n59\n00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.920\nThat one's not there either, so\n\n60\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.430\nneither one of those commands\nI want to use are available.\n\n61\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.202\nIf I go out and do some research,\n\n62\n00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:45.020\nI will find that there is a package\nthat I can get, and I can download.\n\n63\n00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.700\nAnd I can install those commands,\nthose tools, and I can use them.\n\n64\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.730\nBut we have other tools at our\ndisposal that can do the same thing.\n\n65\n00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.244\nIn this case, nmap is gonna come\nto our rescue, because nmap,\n\n66\n00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:02.237\nbesides being the de facto port scanner.\n\n67\n00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:06.817\nWe've talked a little bit about it,\nit has its own scripting language,\n\n68\n00:04:06.817 --> 00:04:09.153\nthe nmap scripting engine, or NSE.\n\n69\n00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.911\nWe can write scripts in there, and\n\n70\n00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:15.410\nthere's a lot of pre-built scripts that we\ncan take advantage of, let's take a look.\n\n71\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.400\nIf we change over to, what is it,\n\n72\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.101\nuser/share/nmap/scripts/, all right.\n\n73\n00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.505\nSo under that directory, under nmap\nscripts, let me just do a little list, and\n\n74\n00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:31.960\nactually let's do a different list there.\n\n75\n00:04:33.892 --> 00:04:38.292\nAll right, and what you'll see is,\nthere's not one or two, but\n\n76\n00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:40.219\na lot of different scripts.\n\n77\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.410\nNow all these scripts have help files\nassociated with them, so you can\n\n78\n00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.920\nfigure out how to use them, or what\nthey're supposed to do, but there's a lot.\n\n79\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.688\nLet's take a closer look and\nsee if we can do a little grep\n\n80\n00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:59.470\naction to slim that list down,\nall right, there we go.\n\n81\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.982\nNow, were looking at\na little shorter list, and\n\n82\n00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:08.414\none that I see that strikes my fancy\nis this one right here, rpcinfo.nse.\n\n83\n00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:13.748\nHm, I was looking for a replacement for\nrpcinfo, and there we go.\n\n84\n00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:16.766\nSo let me clear this up,\nget back up to the top of my screen, and\n\n85\n00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:18.830\nlet's run that script.\n\n86\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.547\nIn order to run a script, well, first, let\nme show you how to get the help on there.\n\n87\n00:05:25.547 --> 00:05:33.099\nIf you do nmap --script-help,\nand then name of the script.\n\n88\n00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:36.483\nWe should get a little bit of help.\n\n89\n00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:41.239\nNow this one's not the most help here,\nbut it does give me a URL that I\n\n90\n00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:45.835\ncan go out to nmap's documents,\nand I can get a little more help.\n\n91\n00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:52.360\nFor us, though, really, all I need to\ndo is do nmap, is to run the script,\n\n92\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.630\nit's --script= and\nthen the name of the script you wanna run.\n\n93\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.857\nSo I'm gonna do rpcinfo and\nthen the target,\n\n94\n00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:08.767\nput the IP address of my target machine,\nand we'll let it run.\n\n95\n00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.681\nSo what nmap is gonna do is, it's gonna\ndo it's normal port scan using our,\n\n96\n00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.160\nbecause I didn't provide any options, so\nit's gonna use the default scan settings.\n\n97\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.541\nDoing an SS with the top 1000 ports,\nbut it's also gonna run that script.\n\n98\n00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:25.551\nAnd then I should see in my\nresults a little more information.\n\n99\n00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:31.470\nAnd sure enough, right now on this\nrpcbind port, I can see more information.\n\n100\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.587\nI can see all the daemons that I\nneed to work with RPC are there,\n\n101\n00:06:36.587 --> 00:06:38.859\nnlockmgr, mountd, nfs.\n\n102\n00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:42.311\nSo apparently they\nare definitely running NFS, and\n\n103\n00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:47.740\nthey've set it all up, so they have\nbasically a network share set up.\n\n104\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.610\nSo now the next thing I'd wanna do\nis try to figure out what's there.\n\n105\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.320\nHow can I figure out what they're sharing,\n\n106\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.520\nwhat have they mounted up,\nthat we can connect to?\n\n107\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.229\nShowmount -e would normally be the command\nthat I would run to work with NFS.\n\n108\n00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.333\nBut again, in our case if I do showmount,\n\n109\n00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:12.060\nI think I showed you this,\nshowmount, I gotta spell it right.\n\n110\n00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:18.947\nAnd it says command not found,\nbut let's check with nmap again.\n\n111\n00:07:18.947 --> 00:07:25.762\nLet's do an ls, and let's look for\nshowmount, it would help if you added the,\n\n112\n00:07:25.762 --> 00:07:31.789\nyou can't just tell it you're looking for\nsomething, it's crazy.\n\n113\n00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:34.543\nAnd sure enough, there's an nfs showmount,\n\n114\n00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:38.577\nas well as an Apple file protocol\nshowmount, so sounds promising.\n\n115\n00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:41.493\nWe're working with nfs,\nwe wanna see the mount points,\n\n116\n00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:43.752\nthere's a script called nfs-showmount.\n\n117\n00:07:43.752 --> 00:07:50.055\nI should do the right thing and\ngo get some help on that,\n\n118\n00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:54.590\nso let's do a little nfs-showmount.\n\n119\n00:07:56.495 --> 00:08:03.061\nAnd again, not a huge amount But it shows\nNFS export like the code shows amount -e.\n\n120\n00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:07.250\nSo it's telling me here's the same\nthing if you want to run how amount -e,\n\n121\n00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.480\nshow ,me the amount point.\n\n122\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.260\nSo let's do it.\n\n123\n00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.120\nLet's bring our scan back.\n\n124\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.800\nThis time let's change\nthat to Nfs-showamount and\n\n125\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.673\nthe same target and\nwe'll hit run or enter.\n\n126\n00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:29.340\nLet's see what it does.\n\n127\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.410\nLike I said, just some fantastic scripts,\nexplore that script directory.\n\n128\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.360\nTake a look at the help associated\nwith the different scripts and\n\n129\n00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.510\nwhat kind of fun stuff\nyou can find in there.\n\n130\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.525\nAnd there we go, so I see nfs-showamount\nthat's scripted run And look at that.\n\n131\n00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:44.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, I see.\n\n132\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.060\n&gt;&gt; Any idea what that means?\n\n133\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:46.715\n&gt;&gt; That is a root.\n\n134\n00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:48.372\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is the root.\n\n135\n00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:49.350\n[LAUGH] Right.\n\n136\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.480\nThat means some lazy admin decided\nrather than figure out what it was that\n\n137\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.510\nthey wanted to make available,\nand I shouldn't say this.\n\n138\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.990\nI'm making a few assumptions but, yeah,\nsomebody share that the root directory\n\n139\n00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.500\nwhich Yeah,\nI can't think of a good reason to.\n\n140\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.090\nUnless you don't know what you're doing,\nor you truly think you, I don't know.\n\n141\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.010\nI'm not even gonna guess there.\n\n142\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.230\nSo, that's not a good thing, right?\n\n143\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.800\nAt least for them, for the target,\nfor the victim it's not.\n\n144\n00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.780\nFor us, as the penetration tester,\nthe discreet professional,\n\n145\n00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.210\nit's something that we can definitely\ntake advantage of, all right?\n\n146\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.990\nSo let's see how we can do that.\n\n147\n00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.030\nSo now we know they are running NFS and\n\n148\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.450\nthey've mounted the root of the file\nsystem on that target machine.\n\n149\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.130\nI'm going to shorten up my\nprompt just a little bit\n\n150\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.940\nhere just to give me a little more space.\n\n151\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.210\nThe first thing I'm going to do\nis I'm going to make a directory.\n\n152\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.940\nI need somewhere to mount that\nremote file system on my system so\n\n153\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.250\nthat I can browse through there.\n\n154\n00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.000\nLet me just gonna do /temp/nfs,\nwe'll call it nfs.\n\n155\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.542\nSo, make a little folder\nin that temp directory.\n\n156\n00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.889\nAll right then,\nwe're going to attempt to mount.\n\n157\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.970\nThat root over there, so we'll do\nmount -0 and those are for my options.\n\n158\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.600\nI'm gonna say no lock,\nI don't wanna lock the system.\n\n159\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.360\nIf I'm trying to access I'm not\ngonna put any locks on the file.\n\n160\n00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.068\n-t or type, well it's NFS or\nnetwork file system,\n\n161\n00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:23.700\nand then my target, 10.10 1.103:/.\n\n162\n00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.340\nSo I'm saying wanna reach\nout to 10.10.1.103 and\n\n163\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.150\nI wanna mount the root\ndirectory over there.\n\n164\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.250\nAnd it is an NFS file type.\n\n165\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.970\nGonna tell it where I wanna mount it to.\n\n166\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.230\nSo that's space / and then I followed.\n\n167\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.220\nWe just created that directory, temp NFS.\n\n168\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.800\nAnd I hit enter.\n\n169\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.360\nAnd, no.\n\n170\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.830\n[INAUDIBLE] We've got a failure.\n\n171\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.940\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at what we did.\n\n172\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.230\nIt says wrong file system type,\nbad option,\n\n173\n00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.700\nbad superblock missing codepage or\nhelper program, or other.\n\n174\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.290\nFor several file systems, example nfs or\n\n175\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.070\ncifs, you might need an\n/sbin/mount.&lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt; Helper program.\n\n176\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.430\nAll right, SBIN mount.NFS is our type,\n\n177\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.890\nso maybe we're looking for\nsomething like that.\n\n178\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.780\nSo let's take a look.\n\n179\n00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.330\nWe'll do a little.\n\n180\n00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:22.800\nLet's change over that directory.\n\n181\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.070\nSBIN And\n\n182\n00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.510\nwe'll do a little listing here, right.\n\n183\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.260\nAnd that's not good.\n\n184\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.170\nLet's do something a little\nbit better than that.\n\n185\n00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.580\nLet's do an Ls and let's grep for amount.\n\n186\n00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.950\nYou know I keep forgetting the word grep,\nwe need a voice activation here.\n\n187\n00:11:46.983 --> 00:11:47.772\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:11:47.772 --> 00:11:53.910\nAnd once I do my LS grep mount I can\nsee several little helper programs.\n\n189\n00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.360\nOne for xfad.\n\n190\n00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.270\nOne for fuse.\n\n191\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.160\nOne for ntfs.\n\n192\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.340\nBut nothing for nfs, right?\n\n193\n00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.720\nThat is the issue.\n\n194\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.460\nAnd that error told me\nexactly what to look for.\n\n195\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.540\nI don't have a mount.nfs helper it\ndoesn't know how to read those files.\n\n196\n00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.600\nSo, Or it can access that NFS file system.\n\n197\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.160\nSo let's get that installed shall we?\n\n198\n00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.404\nWe are going to do an apt get\n\n199\n00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:23.500\ninstall and this just takes a little\nbit of search on the web to find\n\n200\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.550\nout hey how can I get an NFS helper file\nor mount.nfs onto my Kali Linux system.\n\n201\n00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.530\nIf you go out there you will find that\nthere is a package called NFS- common\n\n202\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.850\nthat we just need to install.\n\n203\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.230\nAll right, so I'll say,\n\n204\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.195\nyes I want to install that that\nwas app get install NFS -common.\n\n205\n00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.399\nWe'll let it run through and install that,\nit shouldn't take it too long.\n\n206\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.805\nAnd then once I have that we should\nhave the ability then to read and\n\n207\n00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:56.610\nunderstand that NFS file system.\n\n208\n00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.420\nAll right so that finished,\nI will clear up my screen.\n\n209\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.055\nI'm gonna do another,\nlet's do an ls switch s bin and\n\n210\n00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:08.052\nwe're going to go for grep mount.\n\n211\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.930\nAnd now, I see a couple new ones.\n\n212\n00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.420\nThey actually added show mount to my\ncommands there, too, interesting.\n\n213\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.390\nBut there is my NFS helpers.\n\n214\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.640\nThere is mount.NFS.\n\n215\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.880\nThat's really the one we're looking for.\n\n216\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.739\nSo now that we've got that installed,\nlet's try running that command again.\n\n217\n00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:33.090\nAnd Mike doesn't wanna type it again so\nhe's gonna cycle through here.\n\n218\n00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.260\nSo we'll just do the mount\n-O nothing different,\n\n219\n00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.290\nall we did was install that new helper,\nwe hit enter and\n\n220\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.940\nnow I get nothing right no error\nwhich is usually a good sign.\n\n221\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.490\nLet's see if we CD over to switch temp,\nswitch NFS.\n\n222\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.670\nFinding a little LS,\n\n223\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.450\nthat is the root of that file system\nover there on the target machine.\n\n224\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.100\nSo we are in [INAUDIBLE] they\ndid share the root directory.\n\n225\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.210\nUsing a couple of simple scripts,\nan M map, I'm able to\n\n226\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.950\ndetermine that they are running NFS,\nthat they've got the appropriate services.\n\n227\n00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.390\nUsing the show mouse script\nI was able to find the mouse\n\n228\n00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.300\npoint that they made available and\nthen by downloading that NFSH common,\n\n229\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.740\nI'm able to actually pretty mount that up,\nright?\n\n230\n00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:25.210\nSo at this point, what do we do, while\nwe're sitting here and staring at this,\n\n231\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.110\nI don't know, let's do a test.\n\n232\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.680\nInteresting.\n\n233\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.840\nSo now I can see that, where did it go?\n\n234\n00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.350\nIt's right there.\n\n235\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.310\nSo not only am I reading\nfrom this directory,\n\n236\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.980\nI'm writing to that directory as well.\n\n237\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.900\nWhich is not gonna be a good day for\nthe victim on there.\n\n238\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.090\nSo we can pretty much do Whatever\nwe want at this point right?\n\n239\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.900\nWe know it's a Linux system,\nwe could fire up Net Cat,\n\n240\n00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.760\nwe could set up listeners,\nwe could start moving files back and\n\n241\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.760\nforth cuz now I have a writable\ndirectory that I can go into.\n\n242\n00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.470\nI can copy tools over there, I can install\nthem, run them, whatever I need to do.\n\n243\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.620\nAnother thing we saw the Net Cat, so\n\n244\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.500\nI didn't wanna do that example again Where\nwe set up the one page web server and\n\n245\n00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.080\nwe got their shadow file\nback to our attack machine.\n\n246\n00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.840\nWith this one, I thought, we might\nset up a little bit of a back door.\n\n247\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.115\nSet it up so that we can get back\ninto this machine whenever we want.\n\n248\n00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:26.420\nMm-hm, all right.\n\n249\n00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.705\nSo, for that,\nwe're just going to set up an SSH key,\n\n250\n00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:36.517\nsince I got right access, how bout I\ncreat an SSH key, put it over there,\n\n251\n00:15:36.517 --> 00:15:43.126\nand then I'll be able to SSH in any time I\nwant and that is the goal here, all right.\n\n252\n00:15:43.126 --> 00:15:47.377\nFor that I am gonna need a key so\nI'm gonna say,\n\n253\n00:15:47.377 --> 00:15:53.372\nSSH -keygen If I could type,\nit's gonna generate my key pair for\n\n254\n00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:58.713\nme and I need to give it a file\nwhere I want it to save the key,\n\n255\n00:15:58.713 --> 00:16:04.927\nI'm just gonna use the default\nYou notice that it's root/.ssh,\n\n256\n00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:08.770\na little hidden directory, /id_rsa.\n\n257\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.650\nSo we'll go ahead and use that.\n\n258\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.700\nFor the passphrase, I'm just gonna leave\nit blank for now, for both of those.\n\n259\n00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.420\nAnd there we go.\n\n260\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.908\nWe have generated a new\nkey pair that we can use.\n\n261\n00:16:22.908 --> 00:16:30.120\nSo now I'm gonna try to write my\nkeys over to the victim machine.\n\n262\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.710\nSo we're simply gonna use cat.ssh\nswitch oops I can't type.\n\n263\n00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.980\nYou know what let me bump up\nto the top of the screen here.\n\n264\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.540\nWe'll see that a little bit better.\n\n265\n00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.590\nWe're gonna do, I'm gonna cat .ssh.\n\n266\n00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.160\nActually, let me get back\nout to the right directory.\n\n267\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.651\nMake it little bit easier\nto type this command.\n\n268\n00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:58.644\nOne more time, cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub.\n\n269\n00:16:58.644 --> 00:17:04.776\nSo that's my public key and\nwe're going to append that.\n\n270\n00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:08.310\nNotice, I've got two greater\nthan symbols there, not one.\n\n271\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.780\nI don't wanna overwrite what's\nalready on that machine, wanna to it.\n\n272\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.270\nThe idea is not to make any changes on\nthe system that are gonna cause attention.\n\n273\n00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.670\nIf all of the sudden the existing\nkeys no longer work on that machine,\n\n274\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.400\nsome admin's going to go,\nwhy can't I remote in there anymore?\n\n275\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.530\nThey start looking into it.\n\n276\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.610\nThey find your key that you've added,\nand end up taking your backdoor.\n\n277\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.970\nSo we don't want to wipe it out.\n\n278\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.142\nWe just want to add to it.\n\n279\n00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:37.431\nAnd we're going to go into temp switch\n\n280\n00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:43.228\nNFS /root/.ssh/authorize_keys.\n\n281\n00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:47.435\nSo again, I'm just taking my public\nkey that I just generated and\n\n282\n00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:50.878\nI'm putting it over there\non the victim's system and\n\n283\n00:17:50.878 --> 00:17:54.970\nthey're adding it to their\nlist of authorized keys.\n\n284\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.590\nIt's that easy.\n\n285\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.310\nSo we hit Enter all goes well,\nwe can unmount with a umount.\n\n286\n00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.550\nOops, did I not do that right?\n\n287\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.040\nI gotta tell it what to unmount, sorry.\n\n288\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.335\nUmount switch temp, switch NFS.\n\n289\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.490\nSo we're no longer connected\nto that share anymore.\n\n290\n00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.520\nWe're gonna try connect in with SSH.\n\n291\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.170\nSSH Root@\n\n292\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.567\n10.10.1.103.\n\n293\n00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:29.860\nAnd it says, hey,\nare you sure you wanna trust this machine?\n\n294\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.360\nYes, I do.\n\n295\n00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.430\nAnd then we wait for it.\n\n296\n00:18:40.534 --> 00:18:41.819\nCan we wait just a little bit longer?\n\n297\n00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:45.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And there we go.\n\n298\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.920\nI am in.\n\n299\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.520\nNotice my prompt down here,\nroot@metasploitable.\n\n300\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.248\nI'll do a little id,\nyou can see that I am in the root group.\n\n301\n00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo by simply finding that\nthey were running NFS and\n\n302\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.890\nthen exploring that a little bit further\nto see if any admin had potentially or\n\n303\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.955\npossibly misconfigured it.\n\n304\n00:19:02.955 --> 00:19:05.290\nWe're able to find\na major misconfiguration.\n\n305\n00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.301\nAnd using simple built in tools,\n\n306\n00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:13.470\nwe're able to get write access\nto their root directory.\n\n307\n00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.200\nAnd from there it's just\na matter of what do you wanna do?\n\n308\n00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.230\nHow do you wanna compromise the machine,\nright?\n\n309\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.870\nOr what else I should say do you want\nto do because you've really already\n\n310\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.552\ncompromised it.\n\n311\n00:19:21.552 --> 00:19:26.762\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike so let's, now that we\nunderstand how to at least take a look and\n\n312\n00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:29.584\nmake this vulnerability and exploit it.\n\n313\n00:19:29.584 --> 00:19:30.947\nLet's talk about prevention just for\na moment.\n\n314\n00:19:30.947 --> 00:19:33.370\nSo Mike what do we need to do here?\n\n315\n00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.261\n&gt;&gt; Really, it's just about\nsome kind of a common sense,\n\n316\n00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:38.060\nI won't say some common sense, but it is.\n\n317\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.750\nYou wanna make sure you're using\ngroups and adding permissions.\n\n318\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.725\nIf you're gonna make these mount points\navailable to your network because\n\n319\n00:19:46.725 --> 00:19:51.500\nyour users need to access certain\nresources, files, forms, tools,\n\n320\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.780\nsoftware, whatever it is.\n\n321\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:59.048\nCreate a directory for that purpose and\nthen assign access to that directory.\n\n322\n00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:01.430\nDon't just share-out the root.\n\n323\n00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.120\nUse your groups.\n\n324\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.860\nUse your permissions.\n\n325\n00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.110\nCreate the appropriate directories for\nthe files,\n\n326\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.678\nwhatever it is that you wanna share.\n\n327\n00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:12.692\nAnd by all whatever you do, don't share\nthe actual root of the directory.\n\n328\n00:20:12.692 --> 00:20:17.370\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike well that sounds\nlike a lot of common sense as we\n\n329\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.038\nstart to take a look.\n\n330\n00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:23.060\nJust using some of the simple tools and\nskills that we've learned about so far.\n\n331\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.470\nMike is showing us how we can actually\nrun that exploit, take a look and\n\n332\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.750\ngain root access at times.\n\n333\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.760\nRemember that this doesn't always work\nespecially if you haven't done what Mike\n\n334\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.690\njust talked about in\nterms of the prevention.\n\n335\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.170\nSetting up those groups correctly and\n\n336\n00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:39.220\nnot sharing out the actual root would\nactually help very much to prevent this.\n\n337\n00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.580\nAnd even just turning off some of those\nports that we're not really using that\n\n338\n00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.170\nhave a lot of vulnerabilities\nwould also help.\n\n339\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.390\nBut that is actually a great\nlittle demonstration for us, and\n\n340\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.150\nalso a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n341\n00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.900\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n342\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n343\n00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.388\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows.\n\n344\n00:21:00.388 -->

Kali Linux provides many tools and some of them are really designed to help us to find out more about our target in penetration testing, according to Mike.  He demonstrates the use of whois, netcraft, theharvester and a brief glimpse of recon-ng.  All of these tools are designed to help us to gather publicly available information without notifying the target.",

00:00:07.836\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:11.276\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.682\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.151\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n7\n00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:21.751\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and\ntoday we're jumping into, well,\n\n8\n00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.450\npassive information\ngathering on Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.690\nAnd here to help us understand\nwhat that means, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.350\nof course how to do this is gonna be, Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n11\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.770\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n12\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks, Ronnie,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.010\nExcited to be here as always.\n\n14\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.240\nAnd yeah, we're gonna start off these\nepisodes or this episode, talking\n\n15\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.235\na little bit about one what I mean, or\nwe mean by passive information gathering.\n\n16\n00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:45.940\n[COUGH] And\n\n17\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.930\ntake a look at a couple of different\ntools that we might use to do this.\n\n18\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.550\nAnd when we talk about doing a penetration\ntest or when we are looking,\n\n19\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.740\nas security professionals, we're trying\nto see what the bad guys are seeing.\n\n20\n00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.910\nWe have to understand that they spend\na lot of time in the reconisense phase,\n\n21\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.870\nthat very first phase of the attack.\n\n22\n00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.160\nEnumeration, enumeration, enumeration,\nreconnisense gathering information about\n\n23\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.830\ntheir target, in other words about us if\nwe're the victim of the intended target.\n\n24\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.810\nThey're trying to gather as\nmuch information as they can.\n\n25\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.310\nSo if we're a penetration\ntester that's a skill we need,\n\n26\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.630\nto be able to gather that information.\n\n27\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.640\nAnd if we're trying to protect our\norganization, then we might wanna get\n\n28\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.620\na grip or see what information that\nthe bad guys are able to get, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.170\nmaybe there's something\nwe can do about it.\n\n30\n00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.090\nWe can maybe try to minimize\nwhat information they can find.\n\n31\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.323\nSo we'll start of kinda talking, I said in\ngeneral we'll run a couple of tools, and\n\n32\n00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:42.127\nwe'll come back and\ntake a look a closer more in depth and\n\n33\n00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:45.190\nlocate some of these tools cuz\nthey are extremely powerful.\n\n34\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.038\nSo when we talk about passive\ninformation gathering, Ronnie.\n\n35\n00:01:47.038 --> 00:01:50.680\nWe're talking about also known as\nlike Open Source Intelligence.\n\n36\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.090\nYou might see the acronym OSINT.\n\n37\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.640\nWhat they mean by that is, we're gathering\ninformation that's publicly available.\n\n38\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.890\nWe're not hammering their servers.\n\n39\n00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.570\nWe're not trying to probe in and\n\n40\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.330\ntake advantage of some service, and\ntrying to get into the systems.\n\n41\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.290\nPassive information gathering is all\nabout going out to public resources,\n\n42\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.640\ngetting publicly available information.\n\n43\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000\nAnd it might seem like,\n\n44\n00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.690\nwell, what good is that gonna do me if\nit's publicly available information?\n\n45\n00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.890\nAnd it'll do you a lot of good.\n\n46\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.120\nJust getting names of people that\nwork in the company is a big step,\n\n47\n00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.301\ncuz we can go over, once we get started\ntalking about social engineering,\n\n48\n00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.960\nand doing phishing scams, and\nspear phishing, and things like that.\n\n49\n00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.660\nIf we can drop names in there,\nwe can make it look realistic and\n\n50\n00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.190\npeople start to trust it.\n\n51\n00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.158\nSo just as simple as just getting names\nfrom people that actually work in\n\n52\n00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:54.920\nthe organization, getting email\naddresses cuz half the time your\n\n53\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.730\nemail address is also your login name\nin your organization or can be used.\n\n54\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.110\nSo a lot of good information\nout there that the bad guys and\n\n55\n00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.750\nus as penetration testers\nshould be able to obtain.\n\n56\n00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.850\nso where do we start?\n\n57\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.690\nWell one place we can start,\nRonnie is the good old who is database.\n\n58\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.530\nThat one's an oldie but a goodie right?\n\n59\n00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.950\nBeen out there for a while.\n\n60\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n61\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.700\n&gt;&gt; It has, the whois database is\nbasically the registrars keeping track\n\n62\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.020\nof who has registered names, or\n\n63\n00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.930\nportions of the name space I guess\nwould be a better way to say it.\n\n64\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.620\nLike here, we have ITPRO.TV, well that's\nsomething that we had to register.\n\n65\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.130\nWe had to go and\nclaim that name, register it.\n\n66\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.510\nWe'd pay a fee in order to keep that name,\nDNS server's out there.\n\n67\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.630\nPublic DNS servers are updated with\nthe information pointing to our website.\n\n68\n00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.460\nSo you can guys can come to our\nwebsite and find our information.\n\n69\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.396\nBut we can query those\nregistrar databases,\n\n70\n00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:51.380\ndoing what's known as a whois look up.\n\n71\n00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.712\nAnd it will return, it should query\nthose registration databases and\n\n72\n00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:58.450\nit will return the information\nassociated with that registration.\n\n73\n00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.475\nSo let's take a look at how whois works,\nand we just type in whois.\n\n74\n00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.940\nWe'll get a little bit of a man page or\n\n75\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.400\nsome help associated with that,\nthere's a few different options, but\n\n76\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.910\nbasically you're just going to tell it\nwho it is that you want to look up.\n\n77\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.860\nThat's at the most basic level.\n\n78\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.270\nSo let's try it, let's do whois itpro.tv.\n\n79\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.640\nNow what it does is it reaches out,\n\n80\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.750\ntries to determine based\non the top level domain,\n\n81\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.540\nthe TLD It's gonna know which registrar\nto connect to, which database to scan.\n\n82\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.300\nAnd here we can see the information\nthat it's pulling back.\n\n83\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.210\nIt's got my domain name, who the whois\nserver is, when it was created.\n\n84\n00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.210\nLast time that information was updated.\n\n85\n00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.830\nAs we go down through here,\nwhat other good information can we get?\n\n86\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.470\nAnd this is a good one right here.\n\n87\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.822\nThese named servers.\n\n88\n00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:55.858\nThat's definitely something I wanna keep\ntrack of if we're going to attempt any\n\n89\n00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:59.372\nattacks or redirection attacks,\nwe have to modify DNS information.\n\n90\n00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:02.700\nIt's good to know who is hosting\nthis organization's DNS information.\n\n91\n00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.910\nAnd the rest of it as we go down\nthrough there's a big long disclaimer\n\n92\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.210\nabout terms of use.\n\n93\n00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.140\nAnd then we just go down\na little bit further.\n\n94\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.740\nWe see some more information coming back,\na lot of repeat information there.\n\n95\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.080\nAnd then some registered information.\n\n96\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.640\nNow here, we have Contact Privacy Inc.\n\n97\n00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.675\nCustomer number, so\nwhat we're finding nowadays,\n\n98\n00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:31.015\nbecause this was a great way to source\ninformation, people have wised up.\n\n99\n00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:33.905\nAnd there's now services out\nthere that we can use to kinda\n\n100\n00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:35.605\nobfuscate our information.\n\n101\n00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:40.005\nIt puts this generic information in there,\nso that if somebody was trying to get in\n\n102\n00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:44.705\ntouch with the owner of the company, or\ntrying to glean information out of here,\n\n103\n00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:47.350\nthey wouldn't find any\ninformation about ITPRO.TV.\n\n104\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.280\nIt's about this third party,\nContact Privacy Inc.\n\n105\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.270\nThat's really all even the email address\ngoes back to contactprivacy.com.\n\n106\n00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.860\nSo we've done a decent job that\nobvious [INAUDIBLE] our information.\n\n107\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.014\nYou still get DNS server information but\nthat's about it.\n\n108\n00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:11.094\nLet's try some other one, if it's trying\nsomething like a whois, let's do ufl.edu.\n\n109\n00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:16.230\nLocal college here, and\nsee what kind of information we get.\n\n110\n00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.640\nThis is an edu, so\nit's different database that is scanning.\n\n111\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.310\nAs we come down and\nscroll down through here though,\n\n112\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.470\nhere's a case where they have not\ntried to hide any of that information.\n\n113\n00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.090\nI can see who the registrant is,\nwho the administrative contact is.\n\n114\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.690\nAssuming this information is current.\n\n115\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.030\nThis could be out of date.\n\n116\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.446\nBut it's a good starting point.\n\n117\n00:06:38.446 --> 00:06:41.200\nI've got a name, I've got an address.\n\n118\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.260\nI've even got a phone number.\n\n119\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.320\nAnd an email address, although it looks\nkind of a generic email address but\n\n120\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.070\nagain, a good start to my\ninformation gathering.\n\n121\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.430\nI've got some contact information here,\nagain, another phone number and\n\n122\n00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.240\nit's different from that first one and\n\n123\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.200\nthat looks like an actual email,\nBrad O, Brad O'Hara.\n\n124\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.130\nSo there's some information\nthat I can start using.\n\n125\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.940\nInformation about their names,\nservers as well comes back.\n\n126\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.510\nSo this is an example of some of\nthe information that I can get\n\n127\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.710\nusing that whois database.\n\n128\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.920\nAnother thing you can do with the whois\nis you can actually do reverse look ups\n\n129\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.000\nas well.\n\n130\n00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.640\nIf we were to,\n\n131\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.930\nlet's just ping ufl.edu.\n\n132\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.370\nWe can actually get their return address,\n\n133\n00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.530\nor, let's see if they gave\nit to us up in our results.\n\n134\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.490\nThey did not.\n\n135\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.980\nPinging it forced it to resolve\nthat name into an IP address.\n\n136\n00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.088\nLet's see what happens if we do a whois.\n\n137\n00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:48.009\nOn 128.227.9.98.\n\n138\n00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.781\nAnd again,\nwe're getting a lot of good information.\n\n139\n00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.836\nActually it's like were getting\na little more information.\n\n140\n00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:57.169\nHere, this is nice.\n\n141\n00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:59.920\nIt gives me their net range in a block.\n\n142\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.893\nSo now we might have, we've got ranges\nthat we can start scanning looking for\n\n143\n00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.070\nnodes, live hosts.\n\n144\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.320\nThat again tells me again about\nthe University of Florida.\n\n145\n00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.095\nLooks like I got another contact point.\n\n146\n00:08:13.095 --> 00:08:16.817\nMy org tech name, a phone number,\nan email address,\n\n147\n00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:21.619\nagain there's that Brian O'Hara or\nmost likely like Brad O'Hara,\n\n148\n00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:26.445\nhis email address again,\nabuse@ufl.edu, there's Brad again.\n\n149\n00:08:26.445 --> 00:08:30.890\nSo you can see that just by simply\ndoing a query of that who is database,\n\n150\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.510\nwe can gather information and\npassive because we're not touching UF.\n\n151\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.780\nWe're not doing anything illegal.\n\n152\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.470\nWe are just scanning or\nquerying public sources of information.\n\n153\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.080\nAll right Ronnie,\nwho is can kind of get us started?\n\n154\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.360\nUsually what we're using that for\n\n155\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.160\nis contact information is a big\none we can get out of there.\n\n156\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.430\nWe can usually find their name server IP\naddresses add that whose information.\n\n157\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.610\nWe can do the reverse lookup and\nmaybe find some network blocks or\n\n158\n00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.950\nnetwork addresses that have\nbeen assigned to them.\n\n159\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.490\nNext tool I want to show you is actually\none on the Internet known as Netcraft.\n\n160\n00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.639\nAnd Netcraft has been around for a while.\n\n161\n00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.450\nI'll browse out there.\n\n162\n00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.670\nAnd this is a site that you can use.\n\n163\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.430\nLike I said it's been around for\na long time.\n\n164\n00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:30.450\nBut the one other use of this site is\nto try to determine what software,\n\n165\n00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:36.893\nwhat web hosting software is being run on\na public facing web server, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:36.893 --> 00:09:40.110\nAgain, trying to get information and\nI don't want to,\n\n167\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.290\nI know that I could do some\nin map scanning, right?\n\n168\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.947\nWe can do some OS detection using nmap,\n\n169\n00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:49.930\nbut if I start doing that\nI'm hitting you up servers.\n\n170\n00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.600\nI'm hitting their server,\nit gonna be a log of that activity.\n\n171\n00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.720\nBy using something like Netcraft I might\nbe able to find that same information\n\n172\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.680\nwithout ever touching their server.\n\n173\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.730\nWell, let's see.\n\n174\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.430\nWhat is that site running over\nhere on the righthand side?\n\n175\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:11.020\nWe're gonna put in ufl.edu and\nsee what we get.\n\n176\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.680\nAll right.\n\n177\n00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.130\nAnd it brings back my results and\nI know that is really small so\n\n178\n00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.970\nlet me zoom in a wee bit for you there.\n\n179\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.910\nLike that might be a little better.\n\n180\n00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.730\nFound 61 sites that have ufl.edu in there.\n\n181\n00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.570\nAll right, so you can see that again,\nby using Netcraft, I get information about\n\n182\n00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.470\nthe different sites that it found,\nand the OS that it's running.\n\n183\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.070\nNow, what we could do for this,\none this is good information.\n\n184\n00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.150\nAs we said earlier, I can use this\nto find exploits against particular\n\n185\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.500\noperating systems maybe they\nhaven't patched, right?\n\n186\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.810\nAnd the other thing though, I like\nflipping through here and looking at this,\n\n187\n00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.470\nbecause you'll find interesting stuff.\n\n188\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.500\nIf I look at the OS column,\n\n189\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:56.010\nI see mostly Linux, I see a few Windows\nservers here, I see some unknowns.\n\n190\n00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.350\nWhich might warrant further investigation.\n\n191\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.024\nI also see Linux Ubuntu,\n\n192\n00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:04.902\nwhich I don't know to me is not one\nI associate with web servers, right?\n\n193\n00:11:04.902 --> 00:11:10.260\nI think of Ubuntu, I think of\ndesktop operating systems primarily.\n\n194\n00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.280\nSo that it kind of curious.\n\n195\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.230\nWhat is going on here?\n\n196\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.530\nI see www.astro.ufl.edu.\n\n197\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:22.640\nAnd the other one is www.phys\nmaybe physics.ufl.edu.\n\n198\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.620\nAnd what my brain immediately goes to is\nmaybe these are sites that somebody within\n\n199\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.540\nthis department has put up and is not\nbeing hosted on their main servers or\n\n200\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.160\nbeing protected as much or\npatched as much right?\n\n201\n00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.010\nSo I clicked on that link,\nlet me zoom out.\n\n202\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.720\nIt tells you welcome to\nthe Physics Department it's www dot and\n\n203\n00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.330\ngives me the URL etc, etc.\n\n204\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.790\nWhat I'm actually going to look\nat is right down here, right?\n\n205\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.660\nIs the hosting history.\n\n206\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:57.600\nUniversity of Florida yada yada there's\nthe IP address Linux Apache 2.2.22.\n\n207\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.726\nNow I will tell you that\nthis Refresh right here,\n\n208\n00:12:00.726 --> 00:12:05.130\nis because of me earlier testing some\nof those before we got on camera.\n\n209\n00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.590\nLet's take a look at another one,\nI'm gonna go back one page and\n\n210\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:14.422\nlet's check out Astro also being\nhosted on Linux Ubuntu Right or\n\n211\n00:12:14.422 --> 00:12:17.800\naccording to the scan it\nthinks it's Linux Ubuntu.\n\n212\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.540\nAnd same thing happens actually\nthis one refreshed too as well.\n\n213\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.890\nBut my point is when I first came in\nhere it actually said 2016 as last seen.\n\n214\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.390\nSo the first thing I\ndid was click Refresh.\n\n215\n00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.090\nThat's gonna update this information,\nand go out and query that server again.\n\n216\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:39.150\nAnd now I can see is of July 17th which\nis the day we're recording this video,\n\n217\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.410\nthey are running 2.2.22, interesting.\n\n218\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:51.150\nSo if we go out here and\nwe do a latest I can't type today.\n\n219\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.730\nApache web server.\n\n220\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.790\nAll right,\nI can see this Apache web server project.\n\n221\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.034\nAnd I see a 2.4 here, if I look at 2.2.\n\n222\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.180\nAll right so it's saying 2.2.34 was\nreleased but they're running 2.2.2.\n\n223\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.430\nSo what I'm doing is I come down here and\nI say, wait, what is this?\n\n224\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.900\nVulnerabilities in 22,\nlet's check that out.\n\n225\n00:13:20.942 --> 00:13:25.896\nAll right, and\nhere is a list of vulnerabilities and\n\n226\n00:13:25.896 --> 00:13:32.439\nall I'm gonna do is scroll down I\ncan see these patch levels, right?\n\n227\n00:13:32.439 --> 00:13:36.070\n2.2.29, 27, 25, 22 and there we go.\n\n228\n00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.390\nSo these were fixed in Apache 2.2.\n\n229\n00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:43.520\nSo really I should go I guess one\nmore back before that, 2.2.1, right?\n\n230\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.710\nCause if they've updated to 2.2.2.22,\nthat means all of those are fixed,\n\n231\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.180\nbut anything after that they're not\npatched, I guess, so I consider and\n\n232\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:14:00.080\nuse this as a way to find\nvulnerabilities in that system, right.\n\n233\n00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.260\nAll again,\nfrom just going out to Net Craft.\n\n234\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.790\nAnd looking up information, right?\n\n235\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.370\nSo this an example of what net\ntraffic can do, go out and\n\n236\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.300\nfind out what operating system\na particular server is running.\n\n237\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.808\nYou can see what it ran in the past.\n\n238\n00:14:16.808 --> 00:14:18.620\nAnd now Mike we can start looking for\n\n239\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.820\nvulnerabilities that are specific\nto that web server version.\n\n240\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.900\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike I found it interesting in the\ncolumn where it actually listed where it\n\n241\n00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.920\nphysically was.\n\n242\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.730\nEven told you what room\nnumber it was actually in.\n\n243\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n244\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.450\n&gt;&gt; So that's pretty specific.\n\n245\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.500\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n246\n00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.690\nI don't know if that\ninformation is still valid but\n\n247\n00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.120\nphysical access to a machine\nis the end all right?\n\n248\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.140\nSo by telling you how are we\ngoing to get into that machine?\n\n249\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.480\nI put on an overall and\na name badge, who knows?\n\n250\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.320\nMany different ways we might get access.\n\n251\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.530\n&gt;&gt; Or just walk through the front door.\n\n252\n00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, half the time [LAUGH].\n\n253\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.220\n&gt;&gt; See if that room door\nis unlocked [LAUGH].\n\n254\n00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's see.\n\n255\n00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.950\nSo we looked at a couple of public\nsources there, the Who Is database.\n\n256\n00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:04.100\nWe talk about the Netcraft and the ability\nto take a look at what Operating Systems,\n\n257\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.970\nand versions, web servers are running\non publicly facing web servers.\n\n258\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.110\nSo again, all open source.\n\n259\n00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.620\nAll of this is publicly\navailable information.\n\n260\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.110\nAll right, the next tool we wanna take\na look at is known as the Harvester.\n\n261\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.800\nThis is another tool that we can use for\nopen source intelligence.\n\n262\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.900\nAnd it will scour the web, or\ndifferent places on the internet.\n\n263\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.450\nLooking for email addresses.\n\n264\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.180\nAgain, email addresses are a great thing\nto have on our target organization,\n\n265\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.900\nbecause we can use them in social\nengineering settings with our\n\n266\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.590\nphishing scams.\n\n267\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.870\nThey can possibly be log on names or\npart of the email can be log on names.\n\n268\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.340\nJust a great thing to get.\n\n269\n00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.280\nSo the harvester, that's what it does,\nit scans and looks for email addresses.\n\n270\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.025\nLet's take a look at how\nwe can run this guy.\n\n271\n00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:58.845\nIf I just type in the harvester, we'll\nget the help file associated with it.\n\n272\n00:15:58.845 --> 00:16:02.817\nAnd it's pretty straightforward,\ntheharvester and options.\n\n273\n00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:05.780\nAnd then here is your list of options.\n\n274\n00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.210\nYou are gonna need to give it a domain or\na company name.\n\n275\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.150\nSo we'll do a -d and then the name\nof the domain we want to search for,\n\n276\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.090\nand then you're gonna\nneed to give it a source.\n\n277\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.690\nYou can see it has several\ndifferent sources.\n\n278\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.510\nGoogle, several from Google,\nBing, LinkedIn,\n\n279\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.850\nJigsaw, Twitter, some of which\nyou might need an API access or\n\n280\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:31.360\na key to be able to\naccess their information.\n\n281\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.050\nSo let's try it.\n\n282\n00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:32.840\nLet's see what happens.\n\n283\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:39.638\nWe're gonna type in theharvester,\nand then let's do a -d and\n\n284\n00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:44.266\nufl.edu, our favorite, and then a -b.\n\n285\n00:16:44.266 --> 00:16:46.550\nAnd I'm just gonna put all.\n\n286\n00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.195\nWe'll go ahead and add all the sources.\n\n287\n00:16:48.195 --> 00:16:51.590\nYou could say Google,\nor Bing, or Jigsaw, or\n\n288\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.330\nTwitter, whichever one you\nwanted to hit individually.\n\n289\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.220\nI say let's do them all, and\nwe'll let this run for a second.\n\n290\n00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.704\nAnd you can see it's going on and\nit's talking to Google,\n\n291\n00:17:02.704 --> 00:17:06.758\nit's talking to PGP Key server,\nit's looking at Bing, Exalead,\n\n292\n00:17:06.758 --> 00:17:11.738\nseveral different sources, all of which\nI could do manually I suppose, by using,\n\n293\n00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:16.440\nI don't know, some, by going through\ntheir code on their web pages.\n\n294\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.940\nBut this makes it a whole lot easier,\nright?\n\n295\n00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.930\nWe'll give this a minute to finish.\n\n296\n00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:27.834\nIt does go through these IP blocks and\nit's looking for additional sub domains,\n\n297\n00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:32.519\nsome of which are valid,\nsome of which are not so good.\n\n298\n00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:39.660\nAnd that comes from virtualization\nof some of these network blocks.\n\n299\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.670\nYou see a lot of different IP or\ndomain names, result back to the same\n\n300\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.970\npublic address and that's because it's\nagain, prior cloud based hosting.\n\n301\n00:17:48.558 --> 00:17:53.400\nAll right, so as we scroll up through,\nagain, a lot of these do have ufl.edu, so\n\n302\n00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.540\nthese are just sub domains that I might\nconsider trying to look at, right?\n\n303\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.040\nMore information is always good.\n\n304\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.197\nAs I scroll back up through these results,\nget past all of these sub domains.\n\n305\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.330\nWe could grep this out and\nlook for anything in it.\n\n306\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:16.040\nWe can say wildcard ufl.edu to get\nrid of all of the inaccurate stuff.\n\n307\n00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.506\nAs we scroll back up to the good stuff.\n\n308\n00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:23.850\nAgain, there's your virtual host,\nthat's what we're looking at there.\n\n309\n00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.860\nHere, we can see where it started\nresolving IP addresses, host found and\n\n310\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.740\nsearch engines resolving\nhost name IP addresses.\n\n311\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.521\nSo it's taking this IP address and\nit's resolving it, or\n\n312\n00:18:33.521 --> 00:18:35.925\nthis host name is resolving\nit into an IP address.\n\n313\n00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:41.230\nAnd now I've got the name of a machine and\nthe IP address.\n\n314\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.390\nThese are public IPs, right?\n\n315\n00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:49.290\nSo that means these machines\nare accessible from the outside, curious.\n\n316\n00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.420\nEmails found, another great list\nof emails that I can now use\n\n317\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.880\nin my social engineering endeavors.\n\n318\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.112\nAnd it was just a matter of\ntyping in theharvester and\n\n319\n00:19:00.112 --> 00:19:03.348\na domain name that you wanted to search,\nall right?\n\n320\n00:19:03.348 --> 00:19:06.375\nAll right, so that's theharvester, Ronnie.\n\n321\n00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:09.742\nI'll give you a quick heads up on one more\nthat I wanna spend an entire episode on,\n\n322\n00:19:09.742 --> 00:19:12.229\nbecause it's that powerful,\nit does a lot of good things.\n\n323\n00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:15.166\nAnd that is known as recon-ng.\n\n324\n00:19:15.166 --> 00:19:20.075\nWe'll take a quick peak at it here\nbefore we wrap this episode up,\n\n325\n00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:23.308\nrecon-ng is the name of the tool, right?\n\n326\n00:19:23.308 --> 00:19:26.445\nDeveloped by the guys out\nthere at Black Hills, guys and\n\n327\n00:19:26.445 --> 00:19:29.470\ngals at Black Hills Info Sec,\ngreat little program.\n\n328\n00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.730\nAll of this red that we see,\nis you'll see Bing API key not set,\n\n329\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.091\nBing LinkedIn cache module likely\nfail at runtime, all right?\n\n330\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:47.410\nAnd these are basically all of the places\nthat it can go and search for information.\n\n331\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.160\nBut I'm gonna need access.\n\n332\n00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.700\nSome of those places,\nyou can get an API key for free.\n\n333\n00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:57.120\nSome places, you can simply create\nan account and you can get an API key.\n\n334\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.670\nOther places,\n\n335\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.100\nyou might have to pay money and setup\nan account in order to get the API key.\n\n336\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.770\nBut it allows if I was\ndeveloping an application,\n\n337\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.880\nthat application programming interface,\n\n338\n00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.600\nAPI key is what lets my application\ntalk to say, Facebook servers, right?\n\n339\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.940\nAnd interact with those guys.\n\n340\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.820\nSo you would need keys for that.\n\n341\n00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.625\nBut we can get some results right here.\n\n342\n00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.506\nThe first thing I wanna\ndo is show modules.\n\n343\n00:20:24.442 --> 00:20:28.400\nRight, and we'll get a list of\nthe different modules that are available.\n\n344\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.194\nNow we haven't hit Metasploit yet or\nI should say Metasploit yet, but it's very\n\n345\n00:20:33.194 --> 00:20:38.440\nsimilar in the way it's structured in that\nit's got modules that we can load up.\n\n346\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.644\nEach one of those modules has options\nwhere you key in options, and\n\n347\n00:20:41.644 --> 00:20:44.510\nthen we just run the module and\nlet it do its magic.\n\n348\n00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:51.010\nWe can see Discovery modules here,\ncache snoop, interesting files,\n\n349\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.600\nwe've got Exploitation modules,\nImport modules, Recon modules.\n\n350\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:04.480\nCompany contacts, domain credentials,\ndomain hosts and the list goes on and on.\n\n351\n00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.370\nAnd again, well, and then there are some\nreporting modules there at the end.\n\n352\n00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.820\nAnd we'll take a closer look\nat some of these modules.\n\n353\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.680\nLet's just see what we can do with this.\n\n354\n00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.776\nI do wanna show you,\nI'm gonna type in keys List, all right?\n\n355\n00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:23.310\nAnd what this is showing me is\nthe keys that I have programmed in,\n\n356\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.120\nof which there are none.\n\n357\n00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.300\nIf you had a key, a valid key for\none of these APIs and\n\n358\n00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.010\nyou wanted to make sure that it could\nhit that and pull back information,\n\n359\n00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.310\nyou would just simply add the key with\nkeys, add and then whichever one.\n\n360\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:43.638\nLet's do, I don't know,\nIt doesn't really matter,\n\n361\n00:21:43.638 --> 00:21:50.325\nwe'll do Bing API, bing_api 123456, right?\n\n362\n00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:52.250\nAnd it says Key 'bing_api' added.\n\n363\n00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:57.231\nIf I do another keys show or keys List,\nI can see that key is now put in for\n\n364\n00:21:57.231 --> 00:21:58.507\nthat bing_api.\n\n365\n00:21:58.507 --> 00:22:01.071\nObviously, it's is not a valid key but\n\n366\n00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:05.158\nthat is how you would go about\nadding those to your recon-ng.\n\n367\n00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:07.160\nOnce you've got your different\nkeys loaded in there,\n\n368\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.600\nwe would look at our modules\nas we did just a minute ago.\n\n369\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.266\nAnd let's say we wanted, and let's do\nthat again, let's say show modules.\n\n370\n00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.640\nIt's a really tough day for typing.\n\n371\n00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.400\nAnd I wanna play around with one,\n\n372\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.320\nthere was one I thought was kinda neat\nthat we can do without any API keys.\n\n373\n00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:36.764\nUnder contacts, there's a module for,\nwhere are we at here?\n\n374\n00:22:41.075 --> 00:22:41.728\nThere it is, Ronnie.\n\n375\n00:22:41.728 --> 00:22:45.314\nSorry, it was staring at me in the face,\n\n376\n00:22:45.314 --> 00:22:49.460\nrecon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs.\n\n377\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.139\nRemember we did earlier,\nwe did some whois queries, right,\n\n378\n00:22:53.139 --> 00:22:55.062\nfrom the actual whois command.\n\n379\n00:22:55.062 --> 00:22:59.243\nWell, this is one that we can\nstart automating some of that.\n\n380\n00:22:59.243 --> 00:23:03.520\nWe use our recon-ng to\nhelp us out with that.\n\n381\n00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.260\nSo the syntax for this is going to be, you\nhave tell it which one you want to use.\n\n382\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.762\nSo we're gonna say use, what was that,\n\n383\n00:23:12.762 --> 00:23:17.418\ndomains-contacts.\n\n384\n00:23:17.418 --> 00:23:20.000\nNow I gotta go back and\nget that right name.\n\n385\n00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.790\nDomains-, it's under recons,\nand then domains-contacts.\n\n386\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.579\nSo let's try that again.\n\n387\n00:23:30.313 --> 00:23:34.140\nRecon/domain-contacts.\n\n388\n00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.110\nYou know when you can use your tab\nauto fill that you're typing it\n\n389\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.106\ncorrectly, right?\n\n390\n00:23:38.106 --> 00:23:40.279\nAs soon as I realized it\nwas not auto filling for\n\n391\n00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:43.534\nme, I realized I missed a directory there,\nI forgot the recon part.\n\n392\n00:23:43.534 --> 00:23:50.058\nSo recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs.\n\n393\n00:23:50.058 --> 00:23:52.539\nSo I'm basically just\nloading up that module.\n\n394\n00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:57.311\nAnd if you look at my path down here,\nit says [recon ng] [default] and\n\n395\n00:23:57.311 --> 00:23:59.746\nthen in brackets [whois_pocs].\n\n396\n00:23:59.746 --> 00:24:02.294\nSo now I have that module loaded up.\n\n397\n00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:05.666\nThen we're gonna do show options, and\n\n398\n00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:11.093\nit shows me what options go along\nwith this particular module.\n\n399\n00:24:11.093 --> 00:24:14.441\nI can see there's one called SOURCE.\n\n400\n00:24:14.441 --> 00:24:19.750\nCurrent value is set to default and\nit is required, all right?\n\n401\n00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.454\nDescription is source of input, okay?\n\n402\n00:24:23.454 --> 00:24:24.850\nWhere do I wanna get this and\n\n403\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.840\nyou know what is it that we're\ngoing to be interrogating.\n\n404\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.433\nSo let's set that.\n\n405\n00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:35.240\nWe're gonna do set source.\n\n406\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.170\nSource is the name of\nthe option that I wanna set,\n\n407\n00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.270\nset being a right command, right?\n\n408\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.459\nSet source ufl.edu and I'll hit enter.\n\n409\n00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:48.190\nAnd you see there, it succeeded,\nsource is set to ufl.edu.\n\n410\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:54.589\nIf I do show options again, I'll see that\nthe current value is set to ufl.edu.\n\n411\n00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:58.104\nNow again, I'm just scratching the\nsurface, I'm not trying not to go too far,\n\n412\n00:24:58.104 --> 00:25:01.670\nbecause we can set up workspaces, and this\nis a really, really fantastic tool for\n\n413\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.290\ninformation gathering.\n\n414\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:09.064\nRight now, we're just using the default\ndatabase, see over here, right?\n\n415\n00:25:09.064 --> 00:25:13.540\nBut all this stuff we set in can be\nstored in a database, and can be reused.\n\n416\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.810\nAll the information that we gather\ncan be stored in this database, and\n\n417\n00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.640\nit can be queried, it's fantastic.\n\n418\n00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.150\nAll right, but for us for\n\n419\n00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:25.600\nnow, now that we've set the source,\nthat was the only option we had to set.\n\n420\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.557\nSo now the command is just run.\n\n421\n00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:35.220\nAll right, and we'll let it go through and\ndo its thing, and I see 19 total.\n\n422\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:42.362\n15 new contacts found, and as I go up\nthrough here, I can see the results.\n\n423\n00:25:42.362 --> 00:25:48.829\nBerkley@ufl, Berkleyj@ufl.edu, you can see\nall these names and all these contacts.\n\n424\n00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:51.607\nAnd it's funny, Ronnie,\ncuz we didn't see these, did we,\n\n425\n00:25:51.607 --> 00:25:53.620\nwhen we did the whois query earlier?\n\n426\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.560\n&gt;&gt; No, we did not.\n\n427\n00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.370\n&gt;&gt; We did not see nearly as many.\n\n428\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:01.364\nSo we can see that Recon-ng is doing\na really good job of interrogating\n\n429\n00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:06.117\nthose whois databases and\nfinding this information, all right.\n\n430\n00:26:06.117 --> 00:26:11.676\nNow, if I wanna see this information,\nto get back out of this module,\n\n431\n00:26:11.676 --> 00:26:15.670\ncuz look at my prompt,\nI'm at this whois.pocs.\n\n432\n00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.442\nWell, we're gonna jump back by typing\nthe word back, gets me back to my fault,\n\n433\n00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:21.760\nall right?\n\n434\n00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:27.890\nThere are some modules,\nIf I can type, for reporting.\n\n435\n00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:33.880\nReporting slash HTML, JSON list push pin,\na few different ones.\n\n436\n00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:40.697\nLet's say use reporting slash HTML, right?\n\n437\n00:26:40.697 --> 00:26:45.723\nYou see my prompt now says HTML,\nI'm simply gonna type run.\n\n438\n00:26:45.723 --> 00:26:51.141\nAll right, and that's not actually going\nto work without my customer option.\n\n439\n00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:54.571\nAll right.\n\n440\n00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:55.403\nSo, let's check it out.\n\n441\n00:26:55.403 --> 00:26:58.465\nYeah, Mike forgot a few steps there,\nI was getting carried away.\n\n442\n00:26:58.465 --> 00:27:00.615\nLet's do some show options.\n\n443\n00:27:00.615 --> 00:27:04.952\nNow, the options that we're gonna\nset are actually used in the report.\n\n444\n00:27:04.952 --> 00:27:08.970\nIf I do show options, you'll see I\nneed a creator and customer, and\n\n445\n00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:14.100\nthen I can change that default file path\nor that's where it's going to dump it.\n\n446\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:21.920\nSo let's do set creator Hacker, right?\n\n447\n00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:30.088\nLet's do set customer UFL.edu.\n\n448\n00:27:30.088 --> 00:27:34.789\nAll right, and now, if we do show options,\n\n449\n00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:38.102\nI can see those values are set.\n\n450\n00:27:38.102 --> 00:27:41.179\nNotice they were required, so\nif I had done my job correctly and\n\n451\n00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:43.503\nlooked at the options\nbefore I ran the command,\n\n452\n00:27:43.503 --> 00:27:47.520\nI would have known that I was missing\nimportant or required values.\n\n453\n00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.884\nRight now,\nwe should be able to type run and\n\n454\n00:27:50.884 --> 00:27:55.569\nwe should be able to open this file up,\nso let's grab that.\n\n455\n00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.807\nLet's just leave that there.\n\n456\n00:28:06.243 --> 00:28:07.220\nAnd see what we got.\n\n457\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.029\nAnd there we go if I can\nzoom in a wee bit for you.\n\n458\n00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:14.339\nAnd again,\nthis is what I needed those options for,\n\n459\n00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:16.555\nyou can see the name of\nthe customer goes up there.\n\n460\n00:28:16.555 --> 00:28:21.152\nCreated by goes down there, so it wasn't\nanything, I'm trying to think of a better\n\n461\n00:28:21.152 --> 00:28:24.540\nway to say that, it is required,\nright, you have to have it.\n\n462\n00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.550\nIt has nothing to do with\nthe data you've gathered.\n\n463\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.619\nBut, in order to generate the report,\nit needed certain options, and\n\n464\n00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:30.756\nI just forgot about this.\n\n465\n00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:33.260\nAnd here I can see 15 contacts were found.\n\n466\n00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.890\nIf I expand out Contacts,\nthere's all that information,\n\n467\n00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.300\nmuch easier to read than from\nthe command prompt, right.\n\n468\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.150\nAnd all of it, again,\nis stored in that database.\n\n469\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.240\nWe can go back and\nget this information at any time.\n\n470\n00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.520\nWhen we get into our Recon-ng episode,\nwe'll expand on this and\n\n471\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.470\nwe'll let that add additional information.\n\n472\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.710\nAnd you'll see it all shows\nup under the same report\n\n473\n00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.610\nwhere I can expand at each one of\nthose sections, contacts, hosts,\n\n474\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.000\nwhatever else I choose to discover or\nbring into this database.\n\n475\n00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.233\nAs far as, I know we've talked a little\nbit about reporting and how it's\n\n476\n00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:09.950\nimportant at the end of any penetration\ntests, there's a reporting phase.\n\n477\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:11.550\nThis is the kind of\nthing that makes really\n\n478\n00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.160\nnice deliverables that I can turn in.\n\n479\n00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:18.740\nSo quick peek at Recon-ng, more to come on\nthat particular tool in a future episode.\n\n480\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike.\n\n481\n00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.280\nWell, thank you again for\nhelping to introduce us to this idea of\n\n482\n00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.810\npassive information, gathering\nwhere we can learn about the target\n\n483\n00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.740\nof what we need to do when we\ntalk about penetration testing.\n\n484\n00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.510\nJust by the publicly available\ninformation that's out there.\n\n485\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.490\nIt doesn't require us\nto come into contact or\n\n486\n00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.660\ndo anything that we may even suspect as\nbeing, I don't know if I should or not\n\n487\n00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.590\nsince the information's actually out there\nand publicly available for us, it gives us\n\n488\n00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:47.140\na nice little base set of information that\nwe can use to help us out in the future.\n\n489\n00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:52.770\nBut there is more to come with Kali Linux\nbut that is for another show then.\n\n490\n00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.790\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n491\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.760\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n492\n00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.815\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows.\n\n493\n00:30:01.815 --> 00:30:08.037\n[MUSIC]\n\n494\n00:30:08.037 -->

00:00:08.211\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:11.017\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:14.970\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.060\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.460\nAnd today We're actually going into\nwell active information gathering.\n\n9\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.330\nNow we've already talked about\npassive information gathering in\n\n10\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.190\na previous episode,\nnow we're gonna explore the nature active\n\n11\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.080\ninformation gather with of course Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.260\nMike, welcome back to the show.\n\n13\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.110\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.150\nGlad to be back and excited.\n\n15\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.800\nCuz we are.\n\n16\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.490\nYeah, we're moving on\ninto the active phase,\n\n17\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.090\nalthough I will say that we're border\nof active passive at this point.\n\n18\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.890\nWhen we talked about passive information\ngathering, we're going out and\n\n19\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.535\nwe're getting publicly available\ninformation Information through search\n\n20\n00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:57.970\nengines, through who is databases,\nthrough social media,\n\n21\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.835\n[INAUDIBLE] good stuff there or we'll just\nget publicly available information, right.\n\n22\n00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:05.515\nIP addresses of the internet servers,\n\n23\n00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:08.375\nnetwork blocks that have been assigned\nto a particular organization.\n\n24\n00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:14.225\nOnce we've done our passive phase, we're\ngoing start moving into the active phase\n\n25\n00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.830\nand that now We're actually gonna\nstart hitting servers, right?\n\n26\n00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.220\nWe might be doing port scans,\nwe might be interrogating the DNS\n\n27\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.540\nserver which is kinda what\nwe're gonna look at here.\n\n28\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.210\nWe're gonna start with DNS and\ndoing some interrogation there.\n\n29\n00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.880\nBut we are moving, as I said,\ninto that active phase cuz now we're\n\n30\n00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.980\ngoing beyond what's normally\npublicly available, right?\n\n31\n00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.830\nAnybody can go to Google and\nsearch that information and\n\n32\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.660\nfind like what we're shown\nin previous episodes.\n\n33\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.900\nBut if I start querying DNS Server and\npuling back MX records and NS records.\n\n34\n00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.950\nAgain this is why I say it's kind of\nbottom line because that stuff will\n\n35\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.250\nnormally be available anyway like if\nI wanted to send an email to that\n\n36\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.990\norganization.\n\n37\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.150\nThat information has to be out there.\n\n38\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.580\nBut if its a privately owned DNS server.\n\n39\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.150\nRight now we're going, we're having\nto one get to that DNS server.\n\n40\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.880\nSo it is like I said kinda\nborderline active passive.\n\n41\n00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.819\nAnd we will move on into the full\non active phase in a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.680\nAll right so,\n\n43\n00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.030\nwhat are some tools we can use if we're\ngonna do som DNS interrogation or\n\n44\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.330\nenumeration, I guess would be a better\nword for it, what tools do we wanna use?\n\n45\n00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.850\nAnd there are several for this.\n\n46\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.570\nBut we're gonna start kinda\nlike we did in our passive\n\n47\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.120\nwith tools that are just built in to just\nabout every Linux system, including Kali.\n\n48\n00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.310\nAnd that tool, the one I'm thinking of,\nis the host command, all right?\n\n49\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.630\nSo if we take a look at my screen here,\nI'm gonna type in, host.\n\n50\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.190\nDid she pull it up quick\nenough to see my typo?\n\n51\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.805\nIt's all gone that I can't spell host.\n\n52\n00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:47.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we type in host,\n\n53\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.150\nwe'll see that there are a few different\nswitches that go along with this command.\n\n54\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Just a few.\n\n55\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.670\n&gt;&gt; Just a few.\n\n56\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can also do\n\n57\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.980\na I don't know what I try spell there,\nhost and you\n\n58\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.890\ncan get a lot more detailed information\non how to use this particular command.\n\n59\n00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.330\nAll right, I'm gonna click out of that,\nclear up my screen and\n\n60\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.690\nlet's just see what we can use.\n\n61\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.690\nActually, let me do host one more time.\n\n62\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.250\nThere's a couple of switches\nthat I'm gonna start with here.\n\n63\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.630\nLower case t is for type,\n\n64\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.170\nand this tells it what type of record\nyou're trying to retrieve, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.650\nFor example, if I wanna find out\nthe name servers of ITPro.tv.\n\n66\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.640\nWell, I can type in host -t ns for\n\n67\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.440\nname server and\nthen ITPro.tv and there we go.\n\n68\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.700\nWe get four different DNS servers\nthat are hosting the ITPro.tv zone.\n\n69\n00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.290\nQuick and easy, right?\n\n70\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.500\nCould we have gotten this\ninformation from whois lookups?\n\n71\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.990\nYeah, absolutely, other sources as well.\n\n72\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.670\nMultiple tools to do the same thing.\n\n73\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.810\nAlways good to have a choice when it\ncomes to finding this information.\n\n74\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.329\nAnd plus this one is focused in on just\nthat DNS info, so very, very quick.\n\n75\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.630\nWhat else could we look for?\n\n76\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.760\nMaybe I want to find out if\nthey've got any mail servers,\n\n77\n00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.400\nwhat the IP address is of their mail\nservers, host-TMX, for mail exchanger.\n\n78\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:25.790\nAnd there, I get\nITPro-TV.mail.protection.outlook.com.\n\n79\n00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.960\nDidn't give me I would then have to\ngo back and look up IP address for\n\n80\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.270\nthat but it gave me yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.620\n&gt;&gt; Find a qualified domain name.\n\n82\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.180\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Ronnie.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n83\n00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.960\n&gt;&gt; FQDN was the word that was not coming\n\n84\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.630\nout of my mouth.\n\n85\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.440\nAll right let's do some more here.\n\n86\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.418\nLet's do what if I do host?\n\n87\n00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:52.280\nwww.itpro.tv, all right\n\n88\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.050\nwe'll get back itpro.tv is an alias for\nitpro.tv, gives me the IP\n\n89\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.040\naddress of their web server and again\nit tells me who is handling their mail.\n\n90\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.750\nOkay that's good information.\n\n91\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.998\nWhat if I picked one that was invalid,\nlet's do Host nada.itpro.tv.\n\n92\n00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:15.010\nAnd I get nothing.\n\n93\n00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.700\nSo what we're seeing here,\nwhen I do host.www.itpro.tv,\n\n94\n00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.020\nI'm really trying to guess a host name.\n\n95\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.250\nWhen you look at the itpro.tv is\nmy DNS suffix, that's our domain.\n\n96\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.780\nWhat occurs before that,\n\n97\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.420\nassuming I'm sticking at that root domain,\nwww is a hostname.\n\n98\n00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.800\nWell, it's an alias in this case.\n\n99\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.010\nI don't think we actually have a host\nnamed www, but you get the idea.\n\n100\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.520\nSo I could put anything I want there.\n\n101\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.350\nIf I wanna see, maybe they've got\na machine named server22.itpro.tv.\n\n102\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.790\nAnd it would go out and\nit would query the DNS server, and\n\n103\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.920\nsee if it could return an IP address.\n\n104\n00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.380\nThat's the whole idea here, is I'm trying\nto get information about their machines,\n\n105\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.690\ngetting their IP addresses so\n\n106\n00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.010\nthat I can then start doing\nwhatever's next in my attack cycle.\n\n107\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.340\nBut me guessing names like that.\n\n108\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.990\nIt's tedious,\nI don't wanna sit in here and\n\n109\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.450\ntype in okay they don't\nhave a not.itprotv.\n\n110\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.250\nMaybe they have a host server.itpro.tv,\n\n111\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.530\nnope they don't have one of those and\nI can keep going and going and going.\n\n112\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.150\nOne of the cool things we can do\nwith Bash in a command like host\n\n113\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150\nis we can actually automate the process.\n\n114\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.750\nAll I can do is feed in a list of names.\n\n115\n00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.670\nSo that I don't have to try them.\n\n116\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.960\nCuz what are some common\nnames we might think of for\n\n117\n00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.720\npublicly facing servers, mail.\n\n118\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.530\nYeah, mail.\n\n119\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.355\nAll people have mail at ITPro Pro.tv or\nmail.yourcompany.com or\n\n120\n00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:48.385\nwhatever the case may be\nproxy is another common one.\n\n121\n00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:53.005\nOWA is a common one, web is a common\none and we can start mangling those.\n\n122\n00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:58.625\nWeb 01, web 02, web 03, mail 01,\nmail 02, mail 03, so we can take what\n\n123\n00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:03.300\nwe call a dictionary file, a word list\nwhich is simply one word on each line.\n\n124\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.870\nAnd we can feed it into that host's\ncommand, and say hey, try this, try this,\n\n125\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.670\ntry this, and if you find it,\ngive me the IP address of those machines.\n\n126\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.560\nSo basically what we're doing is we're\nbrute forcing host names on domain\n\n127\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.350\nusing the host command.\n\n128\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.060\nNow to do that,\nwe're gonna need a word list, which I have\n\n129\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.850\ncreated one called hostnames.txt.\n\n130\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.170\nAnd, I simply put a few in there.\n\n131\n00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.530\nIn the real world,\nI'd break out my dictionary files.\n\n132\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.420\nYou can go out and do a search on\nthe Internet, you can look for\n\n133\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.930\ncommon host names, or\nhostname dictionary files, or whatever,\n\n134\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.920\nyou can build your own,\nbased on your own experience.\n\n135\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.860\nWhat are some common names?\n\n136\n00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.204\nAnd I simply put one word on each line.\n\n137\n00:07:47.204 --> 00:07:54.730\nSo now, I can type for\nname in $ (cat Hostnames.txt,\n\n138\n00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.374\noops, you cannot use your tab auto\n\n139\n00:07:59.374 --> 00:08:04.351\nfill when you are writing like that.\n\n140\n00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:07.714\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let me get out of there and\n\n141\n00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:09.860\ndo that one more time.\n\n142\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.950\nWe'll do for name in $,\nopen parenthesis, hostnames.txt.\n\n143\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.994\nDo not auto fill that, Mike,\nclose your parentheses.\n\n144\n00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:24.780\nSo I'm saying for each name, or\nyou can put, for this right here, for\n\n145\n00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.391\nname, I could put anything I wanted.\n\n146\n00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:34.330\nFor Mike in it's saying for\neach line in that file hostname.txt.\n\n147\n00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.830\nWe're gonna call it names.\n\n148\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.482\nSo, grab the first line, the first name,\n\n149\n00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:46.666\nin hostname.txt and then we're gonna\n\n150\n00:08:46.666 --> 00:08:51.866\nsay do host $name.microsoft.com.\n\n151\n00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:56.689\nSo, I'm saying for\neach word in this file run the command,\n\n152\n00:08:56.689 --> 00:09:00.770\nhost, whatever word it is, .microsoft.com.\n\n153\n00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.126\nSo the first word on my list was www.\n\n154\n00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:07.346\nSo it's gonna do host www.microsoft.com.\n\n155\n00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.750\nThen it's gonna go to the second word\nin there, which I think is proxy.\n\n156\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.293\nAnd it's gonna say host\nproxy.microsoft.com.\n\n157\n00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:15.020\nSo you see what I'm doing?\n\n158\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.845\nInstead of me typing each one,\nhost, let me think of something,\n\n159\n00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:22.570\nserver01.microsoft.com, I'm just\ngonna take this word list and\n\n160\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.690\npipe each one of those words,\none at a time, into that command.\n\n161\n00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.180\nPut a semicolon on the end there and\nput done, and let's see what happens.\n\n162\n00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:32.730\nAnd there we go.\n\n163\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.220\nSo let's look at the results and\nsee what we've got.\n\n164\n00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:44.130\nWe see microsoft.com is an alias,\nso www is the first one in my list.\n\n165\n00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.000\nIt says it's an alias for\nmicrosoft.com, yadda yadda yadda,\n\n166\n00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.280\nfound some more www's, look there,\n\n167\n00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.610\nit found one mail.microsoft.com,\nand there's an IP address.\n\n168\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.090\nI might not have known about that,\nbut now I do.\n\n169\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.460\nThere's another one,\nthey've got two mail servers out there.\n\n170\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.130\nLook at all the OWA servers they've got.\n\n171\n00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.730\nSeveral different IP addresses for\nowa.microsoft.com.\n\n172\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.300\nAnd so this is how we can\nstart brute forcing names,\n\n173\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.110\nhost names, on a particular domain.\n\n174\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:23.170\nNow, another cool thing about host,\nbesides using a word list like that and\n\n175\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.370\nlooking for known names,\nas far as host values go.\n\n176\n00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.820\nAnother thing we can do is,\nwe can do it the other way around.\n\n177\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:35.140\nAnd we can do IP addresses, cuz remember,\nwhen we were doing our passive information\n\n178\n00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.870\ngathering, very common thing to obtain is\nthe IP address block, that's been assigned\n\n179\n00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.520\nto a particular organization,\nthrough those who is look apps.\n\n180\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.440\nWe can obtain that\ninformation pretty easily.\n\n181\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.560\nI don't know what host they've got on in\nthat block but we can find out, right?\n\n182\n00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.440\nAnd we can use host to do that, and we can\nactually automate that process as well.\n\n183\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:05.697\nLet me show you what it looks like in the,\nactually you know what I'll do,\n\n184\n00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:10.890\nlet's run that command again for\nmicrosoft.com.\n\n185\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.195\nAnd I'm seeing, I'm just gonna cheat,\nand I could go back and\n\n186\n00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.585\nrun a who is and find other blocks.\n\n187\n00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:18.990\nWe're just gonna grab\nthis block right here.\n\n188\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.838\nI can see that there is three\ndifferent addresses on there, and\n\n189\n00:11:22.838 --> 00:11:26.330\nthere potentially could be more,\nI'd like to find out.\n\n190\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:32.165\nSo, what we're gonna do,\nif we just wanted to run the command\n\n191\n00:11:32.165 --> 00:11:40.462\nhost 131.107.1.89, And we hit enter.\n\n192\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.050\nHere I can see it's\ndoing a reverse lookup.\n\n193\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.090\nIt's taking that IP address, and\n\n194\n00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:51.790\nit's turning it back into the domain name,\nor a DNS name I should say.\n\n195\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.510\nA fully qualified domain name.\n\n196\n00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.540\nThat's what we wanna do.\n\n197\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.380\nBut we wanna go through every single\nIP address in that block, and\n\n198\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.430\nsee if there's any hosts that resolves,\nany host names we can get out of that.\n\n199\n00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.240\nSo for that we're gonna do\nsomething very similar.\n\n200\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.060\nLet's clear up that screen a little bit.\n\n201\n00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:13.722\nWe're gonna do for ip in $, so just\nlike we did earlier, open parenthesis.\n\n202\n00:12:13.722 --> 00:12:17.802\nBut here, instead of catting\nthat hostnames.txt file,\n\n203\n00:12:17.802 --> 00:12:23.130\nwhich had one name on each line,\nwe wanna cycle through IP addresses.\n\n204\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.330\nWell I don't have to go out and make\na file with one IP address on each line.\n\n205\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.030\nI can actually use my sequence\ncommand to roll through a consecutive\n\n206\n00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.870\nsequence of numbers.\n\n207\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:40.451\nSo that's what we're gonna do, we're\ngonna type in sequence 1 through 254.\n\n208\n00:12:43.494 --> 00:12:45.800\nAnd I'll put a semicolon.\n\n209\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:51.380\nSo basically, what I just did was\nsequence 1 through 254 as I made a,\n\n210\n00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.890\nin a sense you can think about it like\nmaking a file with 1 number on each line.\n\n211\n00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.750\n1, 2, 3, 4 all the way down to 254.\n\n212\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.140\nSo a list of numbers, 1 through 254.\n\n213\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.758\nNow, we're gonna do our host command.\n\n214\n00:13:06.758 --> 00:13:14.100\nAnd the IP address is 131.107.1., and\nthis is where I don't know, right?\n\n215\n00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:19.456\nI wanna go 1, and then I wanna try 2,\nand then I wanna try 3,\n\n216\n00:13:19.456 --> 00:13:25.750\nso we can put in our $ip for\nthat last octet, and then semicolon, done.\n\n217\n00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.290\nNow I'm gonna add something here, and\n\n218\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.870\nthis you know just because you've run\nthis before and you've seen the results.\n\n219\n00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.690\nRemember when I said let's\ntry nada.microsoft.com?\n\n220\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.940\nAnd it said host not found,\ndidn't give me a valid IP address.\n\n221\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.470\nWell now I know, in the output,\nif these IP addresses don't resolve\n\n222\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.948\nback to a host name, then I'm gonna\nfind the word not found in there.\n\n223\n00:13:47.948 --> 00:13:52.410\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ngrep that out, so that our results\n\n224\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.960\nare just IP addresses that actually\nresolved back into host names.\n\n225\n00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.050\nSo we'll do a little grep -v,\nand then in quotes,\n\n226\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.610\nnot found, and end my quote,\nand we'll hit enter.\n\n227\n00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.440\nAnd invalid,\nit doesn't like what I typed there.\n\n228\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.850\nSo let's see, if you're IP in dollar sign.\n\n229\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.399\nLet me check my notes.\n\n230\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.093\nFor IP in dollar sign sequence,\nI did all of that to get my semicolon.\n\n231\n00:14:27.246 --> 00:14:31.570\nWhy does it not like me Invalid\nfloating point argument 1 through 254?\n\n232\n00:14:35.861 --> 00:14:40.110\nYou know what, I think I, yeah.\n\n233\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.310\nThat was my mistake.\n\n234\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.200\nI put a dash there just to have it for\ntyping ranges.\n\n235\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.020\nI'll go back and\nI'll show you that command again.\n\n236\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.371\nLet's go ahead and\nlet it run through this.\n\n237\n00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:52.000\nShould be about 254 possibilities.\n\n238\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.600\nSo it won't take that long,\nand there it finished.\n\n239\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.970\nLet me go back up and show you what\nI did wrong, my typo in that command.\n\n240\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.210\nWhen I set up my sequence I did a 1-254.\n\n241\n00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.380\nLeave that dash out.\n\n242\n00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.440\nHere's the correct way to\ndo the sequence command.\n\n243\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.770\nFirst value, space, last value.\n\n244\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:10.990\nIt's not like NMap, or any of those,\n\n245\n00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.940\nwhere you put the actual hyphen\nin there to do the ranges.\n\n246\n00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.340\nAnd then you can see what it's doing.\n\n247\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.330\nIt's taking each one of those addresses,\nand it's saying,\n\n248\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.390\nall right, let me see if I\ncan resolve that to a name.\n\n249\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.788\nIt's basically doing our reverse look up,\nand look at all the machines that I found.\n\n250\n00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:31.242\nMail, nsc.microsoft.com,\n\n251\n00:15:31.242 --> 00:15:36.080\npublic.microsoft.com, bunch of mails.\n\n252\n00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.400\nA lot of good stuff, there's an Outlook,\na doghouse.exchange.microsoft.com.\n\n253\n00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.760\nNot sure what that goes to, but\nthis is, again, information gathering.\n\n254\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.232\nYou're gonna find that as you\ndo information gathering,\n\n255\n00:15:47.232 --> 00:15:49.054\nyou're gonna get information overload.\n\n256\n00:15:49.054 --> 00:15:52.680\nA good majority of the information\nthat you get back will probably turn\n\n257\n00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.220\nout not to be all that useful.\n\n258\n00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.370\nBut if I don't find all of that, and\n\n259\n00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.973\nwhittle it down to what is useful That's\nprobably not the best way to say it.\n\n260\n00:16:00.973 --> 00:16:03.854\nBut I need to get all that information so\nthat I can dig through it and\n\n261\n00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:05.710\nfind what's useful, all right?\n\n262\n00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.830\nSo a lot of hosts that I might\nnot have seen otherwise,\n\n263\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.710\nwithout doing this host\ncommand with that reverse.\n\n264\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.750\nNow, there was something, I thought,\nthat I was gonna show you guys.\n\n265\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.970\nBut maybe not.\n\n266\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.690\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n267\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:28.930\nThere is using the host command\nto brute force host names, right?\n\n268\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.210\nWe can use just the simple host command or\nyou can use a word list as a input, and\n\n269\n00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.550\nwe can brute force those.\n\n270\n00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.500\nWe could also use the host\ncommand to do reverse lookups.\n\n271\n00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.910\nWe're taking the address blocked assigned\nto an organization and we can find out\n\n272\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.260\nwhat host exists on that block simply\nby running a little batch script and\n\n273\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.020\nfeeding each one of those IP\naddresses into that host command.\n\n274\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.420\nAll right, Ronnie.\n\n275\n00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.010\nSo there again is our\nsimple little host command.\n\n276\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.770\nNow, let's take a look at a couple\nof tools that we can use and\n\n277\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.490\nwe'll do a quick look here.\n\n278\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.850\nAnd then, we'll do an in depth\nlook in their own episode.\n\n279\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.280\nSo the first one we wanna do,\nis dnsrecon, right?\n\n280\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.510\nSo typed in dnsrecon and you'll blow this\nup, this we get a better look at it.\n\n281\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:17.200\nAnd you can see the syntax\nis simply dnsrecon.\n\n282\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.310\nAnd then my options all right?\n\n283\n00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.000\nAnd as far as my options go\nthe little d is a good one to know,\n\n284\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.980\nthat is my target domain right?\n\n285\n00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.736\nWho are we going to try to recon.\n\n286\n00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:33.379\n[COUGH] Excuse me,\nwhat else do I wanna show you,\n\n287\n00:17:33.379 --> 00:17:38.047\ndash n for the name server, all right.\n\n288\n00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:41.780\nAnd then -t for type.\n\n289\n00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.520\nThose'll be the three\nswitches we'll focus on here.\n\n290\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.480\nSo what DNS recon allows me to do is,\nit will try to do queries.\n\n291\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.710\nIt can return, just like we did with\nthe host command, I can go out and\n\n292\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.070\nget the MX record, I can go and\nget their NS record.\n\n293\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.890\nIf it's available on that DNS server.\n\n294\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.990\nBut the other thing that DNS really kinda\ndo that we don't do with that host command\n\n295\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.750\nis a full blown zone transfer.\n\n296\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:12.410\nZone transfer and the DNS server\nhost the portion of the name space\n\n297\n00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:17.090\nand a zone file are all the records\nthat exist within that name space.\n\n298\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.530\nSo for example, here at ITPro.TV,\nthat would be run this laptop at ITPro.TV.\n\n299\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.950\nThere's a record in there that\nhas its name, the IP address.\n\n300\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.580\nOther things you find in the DNS zone\n\n301\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:32.610\nwhich we should be familiar with at\nthis point are MX records, aliases,\n\n302\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.740\nSRV records, help you find services,\nright service locator records.\n\n303\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.790\nSOAs, gosh, what else can I find in there?\n\n304\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.580\nAll kinds of good stuff in there.\n\n305\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.390\nBut anyway, a zone transfer is,\nI wanna get a copy of that file, right?\n\n306\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.690\nAnd if a bad guy can get a zone transfer,\n\n307\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.630\na copy of your DNS zone file,\nit's a road map to your entire network.\n\n308\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.790\nIt's every machine's name and IP address.\n\n309\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.140\nAll of the aliases that\nthose machines go by.\n\n310\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.700\nWhat services are being\nrun by what machines.\n\n311\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.400\nI can now tell you exactly where\nyour domain controllers are.\n\n312\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.120\nWhere your name servers are.\n\n313\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.770\nWhere your exchange servers are.\n\n314\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.030\nBecause I've got SRV records\nin your zone files so\n\n315\n00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.210\nthat legitimate users Confine\nthose services, all right.\n\n316\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.860\nSo DNS recon, let's try it out.\n\n317\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.680\nI've got a server that I have\nset up intentionally weak.\n\n318\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.440\nSo we're gonna do DNS recon,\nthe domain name that I wanna transfer,\n\n319\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.814\nso -d lab.itpro.tv.\n\n320\n00:19:31.814 --> 00:19:38.314\nAnd then the -n,\nthe name server I wanted to use Is 10.10.\n\n321\n00:19:40.556 --> 00:19:47.700\n1.12 and the -t for type axfr.\n\n322\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.280\nThere's different zone transfer types axfr\n\n323\n00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.930\nversus ixfr incremental is just\nthe changes since the last replication,\n\n324\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.180\naxfr Is the full zone\nwhether it's changing that.\n\n325\n00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.350\nNow, we don't have a previous replication.\n\n326\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.850\nSo I expect it wouldn't\nreally do us any good.\n\n327\n00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.070\nAnyway, we want the whole zone file.\n\n328\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.200\nSo we hit enter and there we go.\n\n329\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.970\nTesting NS server for\nzone transfer, checking for\n\n330\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:17.050\nzone transfer for lab at IT Pro Chat TV.\n\n331\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.130\nIt's found the I address, all right.\n\n332\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.340\nIt's verified,\nthere's the start of authority.\n\n333\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.614\nTelling you who the DNS server is.\n\n334\n00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:28.690\nIt removes any duplicate IP addresses and\nthen it starts hitting each ones.\n\n335\n00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.940\nSo if there was more than one\nrecord found in that zone file.\n\n336\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.630\nIt would do this for each DNS server.\n\n337\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.870\nIt will attempt to transfer.\n\n338\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.870\nHere I can see has port 53 open and\nthen it says, yay!\n\n339\n00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.870\nZone transfer was successful!\n\n340\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.160\nThen as I stroll down through these\nresults, I can see all their NS records.\n\n341\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.400\nI can see all their A records.\n\n342\n00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.030\nAnd again, most importantly,\nto go along with those A records,\n\n343\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.810\nall the SRV records telling me\nwho's running kerberos, right?\n\n344\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.680\nWho their global catalog server is.\n\n345\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.410\nBasically who their main controller is,\n\n346\n00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.140\nit's a little teeny tiny demand\nI set up a little bit ago.\n\n347\n00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.150\nIt's got one server and a couple clients,\nbut the point is is I was able to transfer\n\n348\n00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:17.402\nthat entire zone file using DNS recon.\n\n349\n00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:21.550\nAll right, I'll tell you most of the time\nit's not gonna be quite that easy right.\n\n350\n00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.406\nThey're not gonna let us,\n\n351\n00:21:23.406 --> 00:21:28.343\nlike if I go back over to this server I\ncan show you let me log in real quick.\n\n352\n00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:32.075\nI'll open up DNS.\n\n353\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.416\nAnd I'm gonna pull up\nthe properties of that zone and\n\n354\n00:21:38.416 --> 00:21:42.520\non that zone transfers tab I allowed\nzone transfers to any server.\n\n355\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.343\nI'll tell you this used to be\nthe default back end serve 2000.\n\n356\n00:21:46.343 --> 00:21:51.420\nAnd you will find,\nunfortunately we still find servers set\n\n357\n00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.080\nup this way to this day because somebody\nfigured out ahead and it doesn't work.\n\n358\n00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.800\nIf I just allows on transfer any server,\nevery thing seems to work just fine.\n\n359\n00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.160\nWell this is not a good thing.\n\n360\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.050\nIf they had left it on the default,\ndo not allow on transfers Or\n\n361\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.640\nonly servers listed on\nthe named servers tab.\n\n362\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.120\nOr the following servers.\n\n363\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.840\nLet's see what that does to my recon NG.\n\n364\n00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.460\nTry that same command again.\n\n365\n00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.780\nZone transfer failed.\n\n366\n00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.390\nNo answer or reset.\n\n367\n00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.740\nThat is not going to allow me\nto have that zone transfer.\n\n368\n00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.810\nAll right?\n\n369\n00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.570\nSo, Just an example of one of the things\nthat we can do with DNS recon.\n\n370\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.953\nAnother tool that we wanna kinda\ntake a closer look at is dnsenum.\n\n371\n00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:40.790\nJust another tool for\ninterrogating or enumerating DNS.\n\n372\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.170\nThe last option here, I like this note,\n\n373\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:51.216\nthe Brute Force -F Switch Is\nobligatory all right.\n\n374\n00:22:51.216 --> 00:22:55.530\n[LAUGH] All right so\nlet's see what we can do with DNS enum DNS\n\n375\n00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.600\nlet me clear that screen up and\nget back to the top.\n\n376\n00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.005\nDNS enum and\nlet's pick on a UFL.edu again.\n\n377\n00:23:05.005 --> 00:23:09.950\nAll right so what this is doing It's\nbasically doing a lot of the stuff that\n\n378\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.760\nwe would do manually\nwith something like host.\n\n379\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.590\nI'm trying to do is own\ntransfer is that way.\n\n380\n00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.560\nYou can see it's going out.\n\n381\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.790\nIt's found an IP address for ufl.edu and\nthen it did some queries and\n\n382\n00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.100\nI found name servers and\ntheir IP addresses.\n\n383\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.600\nAlso found all of their mail servers And\nthen it's trying for\n\n384\n00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:34.330\neach one of these name servers that it\nfound it's trying to do an extra file.\n\n385\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.760\nWell it's own transfer\nfile from the DNA server.\n\n386\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.960\nSo NS refused RNS also refused.\n\n387\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.150\nAll right and this group force file and\n\n388\n00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.440\nthat specifys cuz I am not trying\nto move force anything just yet.\n\n389\n00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:55.290\nWe can add an a num switch to this command\nwhich gives me a little more information.\n\n390\n00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.666\nBy typing dnsnum-enum and\n\n391\n00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:04.153\nthen ufl.edu All right.\n\n392\n00:24:04.153 --> 00:24:05.710\nYou see it adds a little bit to it.\n\n393\n00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:11.850\nNot only does it go out and\nget the name servers, the mail servers.\n\n394\n00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.480\nAgain, it's just looking at those\nNS records in this NX records.\n\n395\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.420\nThen it tries its own transfers, and then\nscraping ufl.edu sub domains from Google.\n\n396\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.929\nAnd so it's actually going out and trying\nwww seeing if there's any sub domains.\n\n397\n00:24:26.929 --> 00:24:31.750\nStuff that would appear to\nthe left of the ufl.edu.\n\n398\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:39.047\nAnd I found www.purchasing.ufl.edu and\nwww.honors.ufl.edu.\n\n399\n00:24:39.047 --> 00:24:43.300\nSo it's finding those for\nus here in the google results.\n\n400\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.754\nAgain I can see a lot\nof the same stuff and\n\n401\n00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:48.446\nthe IP addresses that go along with those.\n\n402\n00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:53.026\nJust more information then I\ncan add to my research as I am\n\n403\n00:24:53.026 --> 00:24:55.856\ndoing that research on my target.\n\n404\n00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:58.609\nOr if I am a security professional,\ntrying to find out,\n\n405\n00:24:58.609 --> 00:25:00.200\nwhat information is out there.\n\n406\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.220\nI can look at this and go wait why is this\navailable, how can I hide this stuff?\n\n407\n00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:09.280\nNow that whole brute force thing is just\nlike we were doing with the host file.\n\n408\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.620\nYou feed it a word list.\n\n409\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.760\nHere it's searching Google right?\n\n410\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.280\nLike we did with some\nof the previous tools.\n\n411\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.180\nIt's just trying to see if it\ncan find anything.ufl.edu.\n\n412\n00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.120\nBut I can provide a word list for\nit and it will try those as well.\n\n413\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.310\nSo let's try DNS enum.\n\n414\n00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:31.232\nAnd we'll do a -F and\nthen that same file hostNames.txt.\n\n415\n00:25:31.232 --> 00:25:37.250\nAnd then a -R and the URL that\nI want to brute force ufl.edu.\n\n416\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:42.870\nAnd see what we come up with this time.\n\n417\n00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.170\nSo now rather than scraping Google and\n\n418\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.430\njust randomly trying to find stuff It just\nused the names out of my host name.text.\n\n419\n00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.990\nSo I can see it found a ufl or www.\n\n420\n00:25:52.990 --> 00:26:01.343\nIt found mail,\nthere's a couple of there mail servers.\n\n421\n00:26:01.343 --> 00:26:02.882\nSo there we go Ronnie,\n\n422\n00:26:02.882 --> 00:26:08.150\nthree different ways that we can do\nsome basic information gathering on DNS.\n\n423\n00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.228\nWe get that host command that\nwe can find from within Linux.\n\n424\n00:26:11.228 --> 00:26:15.330\nAnd then of course,\nKali has our wonderful selection of tools.\n\n425\n00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.160\nAnd we've got DNS enum as well as DNS.\n\n426\n00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, Micheal, thank you again for\n\n427\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.800\nhelping us to at least learn more\na little bit more about these tools.\n\n428\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.825\nWe're gonna dive in to some of them\na little bit more intensely, I would say.\n\n429\n00:26:28.825 --> 00:26:30.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In a future episode but\n\n430\n00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.870\nthis is a good taste and\na good understanding at least of some of\n\n431\n00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.170\nthe active ways that we start\ngathering some more information.\n\n432\n00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.270\nBut that means that this is another great\nepisode that we're gonna end right now.\n\n433\n00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.700\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n434\n00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.240\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n435\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.940\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodderick.\n\n436\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.210\n&gt;&gt; Stay tune right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows\n\n437\n00:26:48.210 -->

San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:06.164\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:07.680\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.413\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:12.345\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.585\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.110\nYou're watching the Kali Linux show.\n\n9\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.460\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.670\nAnd today, we're actually taking look\nat a neat utility called Recon-ng.\n\n11\n00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.580\nAnd here to help us to get a better\nunderstanding of that of course,\n\n12\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.700\nis gonna be Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.980\nMike, welcome to the studio.\n\n14\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.932\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:35.265\nYeah, excited today, and\nwe did a little prelook at Recon-ng.\n\n16\n00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.527\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the past episode,\n\n17\n00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:39.420\njust a little teaser.\n\n18\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.531\nNow we're gonna try to take a closer\nlook at what we can do, right?\n\n19\n00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:45.495\nAnd if you remember right, hopefully\nyou've watched that previous episode.\n\n20\n00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:51.310\nRecon-ng fell into the category\nof passive information gathering.\n\n21\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.000\nAnd it's funny, cuz as I sit here and\nthink about it, we are doing some pretty\n\n22\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.850\nheavy hitting when we start doing this\nreconnaissance work with Recon-ng.\n\n23\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.500\nBut we're not hitting the target and\n\n24\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.340\nthat's really what defines this\nas passive, for the most part.\n\n25\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810\nIt kind of blurs the lines, but\nwe'll leave it under passive for now.\n\n26\n00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.100\nAll right, but anyway, cool tool\neither way, whether it's passive or\n\n27\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.180\nactive, fantastic stuff\nthat you can get back with.\n\n28\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.221\nThere's just a treasure trove\nof information that's out there.\n\n29\n00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:25.660\nAnd with this tool, really, once you get\nused to the tool, and you get familiar\n\n30\n00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.115\nwith the different options, you'll find\nthat it's pretty easy to work with.\n\n31\n00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:32.143\nIt's a great way to gather information.\n\n32\n00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:35.834\nIt organizes it well for\nyou, allows for easy access.\n\n33\n00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:40.196\nSo it's quickly becoming one of my\nfaves when it comes to doing some of my\n\n34\n00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:42.172\ninitial reconnaissance work.\n\n35\n00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:46.556\nSo without further ado, Ronnie,\nI say we just dive right in and\n\n36\n00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:51.570\nfire it up, and see what kind of fun\nwe can have with gold old Recon-ng.\n\n37\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.300\nSo, we'll type in recon-ng from\nour shell and we'll load it up.\n\n38\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.180\nNow I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.540\nmaximize this terminal cuz we're gonna\nbe in here most of this episode.\n\n40\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.240\nAnd as we saw on the previous one,\n\n41\n00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.000\nI get a lot of errors when\nI first fire up Recon-ng.\n\n42\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.170\nThey're not really errors.\n\n43\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.109\nIf you look at them closely,\nit's telling me that I don't have\n\n44\n00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.969\nan API key set for being API, or\nbeing API key not set, right?\n\n45\n00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.250\nThere are several modules that\nare included with Recon-ng.\n\n46\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.213\nSome of which work fine without a key,\nothers require an API key.\n\n47\n00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:31.867\nAPI, application programming interface,\n\n48\n00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:35.270\nthis is how you can interface\nwith those applications.\n\n49\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.585\nFor example,\nif I wanted to scour LinkedIn for\n\n50\n00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:43.346\ninformation about a certain email address,\nand see what posts and\n\n51\n00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.782\nthings like that were there,\nwell I need a programmatic way.\n\n52\n00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:50.920\nI need to interact with\nLinkedIn a programmatic way.\n\n53\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.440\nAnd that's where that API key comes in.\n\n54\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.100\nI have a key that gives me access to\nLinkedIn application under the hood.\n\n55\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.850\nAnd I can start doing\nstuff with that data.\n\n56\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.715\nNow they are designed for\nbuilding applications, right?\n\n57\n00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:09.360\nI'm supposed to go to LinkedIn and\nsay, hey, I'm an app developer.\n\n58\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.695\nI wanna sign up for an account,\nI wanna build an app.\n\n59\n00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:16.400\nThey're gonna give me an API\nkey that my application can\n\n60\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.030\nthen use to access their\ndata that they have.\n\n61\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.890\nSome of these keys are freely available.\n\n62\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.720\nYou can just go and\nset up an account typically.\n\n63\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.170\nTell them a little bit about the app\nyou wanna develop or something and\n\n64\n00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.140\nyou'll get a key.\n\n65\n00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.119\nOthers, you might have to pay for,\ncould be a one time fee,\n\n66\n00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.553\ncould be a reoccurring fee\ndepending on what it is.\n\n67\n00:03:37.553 --> 00:03:40.667\nLike Jigsaw, I know for\none is, if I'm not mistaken,\n\n68\n00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.120\nthat is a reoccurring\nfee on their API key.\n\n69\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.550\nBut it also gives you\na lot of information.\n\n70\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.310\nSo, that being said, not all these\nmodules will work out of the box.\n\n71\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.330\nYou're gonna have to kinda play around.\n\n72\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.475\nI'll show you how to figure\nout if they need a key or not.\n\n73\n00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:56.540\nI mean, you can kinda see this list here.\n\n74\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.460\nAnd then I can show you how.\n\n75\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.100\nWell, I showed you in the last\nepisode how to enter a key.\n\n76\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.950\nI don't wanna bring up that table again.\n\n77\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.420\nRemember, you can always do show keys, and\n\n78\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.650\nyou can get a list of all\nthe keys that you've entered.\n\n79\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.090\nI've entered in several keys so\n\n80\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.930\nthat we can play around\nwith some of these modules.\n\n81\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.840\n[LAUGH] I don't really want to bring that\nup on screen, so I'm going to avoid that.\n\n82\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.620\nThe rest of these you see here are ones\nthat I don't have keys for yet or\n\n83\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.934\nI haven't bothered to\nenter them in to Recon-ng.\n\n84\n00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:26.600\nAll right, so, there we go,\nwe got past that initial whole block of\n\n85\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.870\nred things that usually scares people\nlike, my gosh something is wrong.\n\n86\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.670\nJust letting you know,\n\n87\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.570\nif you want some of the modules to work,\nyou're gonna need some keys.\n\n88\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.089\nAll right, so now we are in good old\nRecon-ng developed by Black Hills InfoSec.\n\n89\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.660\nAnd, we need to be familiar\nwith working our way around,\n\n90\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.050\nor navigating through Recon-ng and\nwe'll play with some of these modules.\n\n91\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.778\nI know, again, we did some highlights\nthere in the previous episode, but\n\n92\n00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:56.250\nI really wanna focus this time on getting\ncomfortable with Recon-ng, all right?\n\n93\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.360\nSo the first thing I think we need to\nknow is the good old show command.\n\n94\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.880\nIf I just hit show and\ndo a tab, I'm gonna do a show,\n\n95\n00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.570\nspace, tab, tab, it'll show me all\nthe things that I can look at, all right?\n\n96\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.820\nSo tab auto-fill is a feature of Recon-ng,\nit's fantastic.\n\n97\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.189\nIf you're familiar Metasploit,\nand working with that,\n\n98\n00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.800\nyou'll definitely be comfortable\nworking with Recon-ng.\n\n99\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.774\nIt is a framework, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:21.774 --> 00:05:25.040\nIt's not a, I a good way to say this.\n\n101\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.365\nIt's a framework and people write\nmodules and add those modules.\n\n102\n00:05:29.365 --> 00:05:31.689\nIn fact, you could write a module and\nyou could submit it and\n\n103\n00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:32.768\nhave it added it into here.\n\n104\n00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:35.545\nSo most of these modules\nare written by different people.\n\n105\n00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:38.245\nSome of them by the original authors, but\n\n106\n00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:40.317\na lot of them have been\nadded after the fact.\n\n107\n00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:43.317\nAnd they're updated and\nthey're continuously adding.\n\n108\n00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:45.897\nSo, if you're working with\nan older version of Recon-ng,\n\n109\n00:05:45.897 --> 00:05:47.337\nmake sure you go out and get your updates.\n\n110\n00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:50.177\nDo your apt-get update and your &amp;&amp;,\n\n111\n00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:54.235\nour ampersand ampersand\napt-get install Recon-ng.\n\n112\n00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:55.335\nMake sure you got the latest and\n\n113\n00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:57.419\ngreatest version cuz they have\nadded quite a few modules.\n\n114\n00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.710\nAnd they've done some reorganization as\nwell, as far as the modules themselves.\n\n115\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.430\nYou can kind of see\nthe categories over here, recon,\n\n116\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.430\nreporting, import,\nexploitation, and discovery.\n\n117\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.057\nAll right, so with the show,\nI wanted to show you that tab tab.\n\n118\n00:06:11.057 --> 00:06:14.057\nBecause if you're ever stuck and\nyou don't know where to go or\n\n119\n00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:17.417\nwhat's possible as a value, typically,\nyou can just hit a tab tab.\n\n120\n00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.910\nAnd it'll show you the possibilities.\n\n121\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.540\nSo if I wanted to do,\nI don't want a show keys, actually, so\n\n122\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.900\nwe're going to wait on that one.\n\n123\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.221\nThe first thing I want to do is set up\nwhat's called a workspace, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:36.410\nRecon-ng uses what they call\nworkspaces to store the data.\n\n125\n00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.080\nIt's an SQLite, or\na light database in the back end.\n\n126\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.340\nAnd I like to think of them as\nprojects that I'm working on.\n\n127\n00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.200\nYou start off with the default.\n\n128\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.710\nIf I go show workspaces, all right?\n\n129\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.040\nI'll see that I have one called default.\n\n130\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.600\nIf I start playing around with Recon-ng,\neverything's gonna go into that default.\n\n131\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.670\nBut as a penetration tester,\n\n132\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.580\nyou probably have more than one\nproject going on at the same time.\n\n133\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.920\nAnd you definitely don't\nwanna start mixing that data.\n\n134\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.420\nWe need to keep it organized, otherwise,\nyou'll have a nightmare on your hands.\n\n135\n00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.720\nNot to mention, there could definitely\nbe some confidentiality issues.\n\n136\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.510\nYou start mixing data and\nget somebody else's data into a report for\n\n137\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.380\nanother customer and\nnot gonna be a good day for you.\n\n138\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.007\nSo the first thing we need to do is\ncreate a new workspace that we can use to\n\n139\n00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:25.102\nstore our data.\n\n140\n00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:26.447\nSo I'm gonna add one.\n\n141\n00:07:26.447 --> 00:07:29.090\nWe're gonna play around with\ngood old ITProTV today.\n\n142\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.031\nSo the command is gonna be workspaces add,\nand then the name,\n\n143\n00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:38.335\nI'm just gonna call it itprotv,\nthe workspace.\n\n144\n00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:39.510\nDoesn't matter what you wanna call it.\n\n145\n00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.780\nYou can call it project one,\n\n146\n00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.170\nproject whatever, project x,\nwhatever you wanna call it, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.128\nAgain, it shows me which keys I do not\nhave set yet, and I'm okay with that.\n\n148\n00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:53.412\nBut now you can see my prompt has changed,\nright?\n\n149\n00:07:53.412 --> 00:07:56.037\nNow I'm at [recon-ng][itprotv].\n\n150\n00:07:56.037 --> 00:08:01.381\nAnd if I do another show work spaces,\nwe'll see my other workspace.\n\n151\n00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:07.340\nSo I can do work spaces, and\nI'm just gonna do a tab, tab to show you.\n\n152\n00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.019\nAdd, delete, list and select.\n\n153\n00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:12.600\nSelect is how I switch between\nthe different work spaces.\n\n154\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.183\nSo I wanna make sure that the active\nwork space is the ITPro.TV work space.\n\n155\n00:08:17.183 --> 00:08:22.109\nSo I'm gonna do work spaces,\nselect, and ITProTV.\n\n156\n00:08:22.109 --> 00:08:26.169\nAnd notice I'm doing tab autofill on\nall those, I'm not typing that quickly,\n\n157\n00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:27.389\ncuz I'm not that good.\n\n158\n00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:31.034\nAll right, and again, it was already\nselected, I just wanted to show you how\n\n159\n00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:34.850\nyou would switch back and forth,\nif you're working on multiple projects.\n\n160\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.550\nJust look at your prompt,\ntells you what work space you're in, and\n\n161\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.629\nthen use the work space select to change\nbetween the different work spaces.\n\n162\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.880\nAll right now, in that database,\nthere is a lot of information,\n\n163\n00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.100\nor there will be a lot of information.\n\n164\n00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.770\nAnd it organizes\nthe information by tables.\n\n165\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.780\nThere'll be different tables for\ndomains, contacts,\n\n166\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.320\nprofiles, hosts,\ndifferent things that it's finding.\n\n167\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.541\nAnd what we do,\nas we run these tools or these modules,\n\n168\n00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:07.320\nthey're gonna be loading information\ninto those tables, that we can then use.\n\n169\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.101\nSometimes, one table becomes a source for\nanother tool, or a module,\n\n170\n00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.200\nas we're going through here.\n\n171\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.570\nSo what I wanna do,\nbecause I know my target already.\n\n172\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.111\nIt depends, if you're doing a white box,\nyou doing a black box,\n\n173\n00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:22.410\nhow much information do you already have.\n\n174\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.241\nLet's just say all we\nreally know is the domain.\n\n175\n00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:30.519\nWe've been given the ITPro.TV, and that's\nit, we're left on our own to discover.\n\n176\n00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:35.060\nSo, the first thing I wanna do is add\nthe information that we already have.\n\n177\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.980\nBut I don't have much,\nbut it's a starting point.\n\n178\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.843\nSo we're gonna add digital\ndomain name in here,\n\n179\n00:09:42.843 --> 00:09:47.860\nand we're going to do that\nwith an add -domains.\n\n180\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.635\nWrite add -domains, and\nthen, I'm itpro.tv.\n\n181\n00:09:52.635 --> 00:10:00.530\nAll right, by do a show domains,\nI can see I have one domain listed.\n\n182\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.015\nAs soon as it says user defined,\n\n183\n00:10:02.015 --> 00:10:05.150\nright, cuz it wasn't a module\nthat discovered this information.\n\n184\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.919\nIf I'd use one of the modules\nto discover that information,\n\n185\n00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.950\nit will show me the module right there\nthat was use to pull that information in.\n\n186\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.180\nAnd you might add additional ones,\n\n187\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.650\nI might find sub domains that end up\ngetting added to this table as we go.\n\n188\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.380\nAlright, so,\nwe now have our domains listed.\n\n189\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.184\nSo, where should we start\nrunning as I read them in,\n\n190\n00:10:26.184 --> 00:10:27.700\nI tape up some really confusing notes.\n\n191\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:36.430\nLet's take a look at what modules\nare available for domains, right?\n\n192\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:41.130\nLet's do show,\nI'm gonna do show modules first.\n\n193\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.480\nI just wanna take a peek\nat all those modules again.\n\n194\n00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.290\nAnd if we look, Ronnie,\n\n195\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.140\nthe way these things are broken down is,\nthe category is listed first.\n\n196\n00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.020\nSo recon versus import\nversus exploitation.\n\n197\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.460\nThere's one for reporting,\nthere's one for discovery.\n\n198\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.506\nAnd then there's this word-word.\n\n199\n00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:05.660\nAnd what this is showing you is\nsource info and output info.\n\n200\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.920\nThis is saying I'm gonna pull company\ninfo and add it to the contacts info.\n\n201\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.930\nAll right, so as you're going through\nthese modules you can kind of get\n\n202\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.450\nan idea of what it's going to do.\n\n203\n00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.240\nIt's gonna look for\n\n204\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.550\ncredential information, and\nadd it to the credentials table.\n\n205\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.925\nOr it's gonna look for domain information,\nit's gonna search domains,\n\n206\n00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.710\nuse that info to look for\ncontact information.\n\n207\n00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.240\nAll right, so the input information's\non the left, output is on the right.\n\n208\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.050\nAnd then the last part is\nthe name of the module,\n\n209\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.220\nlike bing_linkedin_cache, all right?\n\n210\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.010\nSo, if we wanna search, if we're looking,\nthere's a long list of modules there.\n\n211\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.450\nThey have a search\nfeature that we can use.\n\n212\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.313\nSo if we're looking for,\nall we have is domain, and\n\n213\n00:11:51.313 --> 00:11:54.160\nwe wanna get information\nout of that domain.\n\n214\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.969\nWe know that the module we were\ngonna use is most likely in recon.\n\n215\n00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:01.300\nAnd it's gonna start with domain\nsomething, cuz the input is domain.\n\n216\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.030\nAnd the output is gonna\nbe I don't know what yet.\n\n217\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.955\nSo I'm gonna search domains-,Because\nI know that module is\n\n218\n00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:09.880\ngonna start with that domain-.\n\n219\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.266\nAnd there I get all the ones that\nstart with domain information, and\n\n220\n00:12:15.266 --> 00:12:19.740\ndump out either contact or credential,\nhosts, or vulnerabilities.\n\n221\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.910\nNow with that search,\nwe can do it the other way around.\n\n222\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.860\nIf I was trying to get domain information,\nbased on contact information, or\n\n223\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.490\nsomething, I would just switch\nmy search around, right?\n\n224\n00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.862\nI would do search-domains.\n\n225\n00:12:32.862 --> 00:12:37.040\nNow, domains is the second\npart of the search, right, so\n\n226\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.441\nit's gonna be the output field.\n\n227\n00:12:39.441 --> 00:12:43.539\nAnd there, I can see, I can use contact\ninformation to find domain info, or\n\n228\n00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:45.070\nhost to find the domain info.\n\n229\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.160\nAnd then last but not least,\n\n230\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.398\nwe can just leave the hyphen\noff altogether and find both.\n\n231\n00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:50.390\nEither direction, right?\n\n232\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.850\nThose that start with domains,\nthose that end with domains.\n\n233\n00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.790\nAgain, since we have some domain\ninformation, we're gonna start with that.\n\n234\n00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.450\nAnd let's do, I think one of\nthe first ones I like to do,\n\n235\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.100\nsome of these up here at the top.\n\n236\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.809\nI wanna start developing context.\n\n237\n00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:07.916\nWho's at this organization, right?\n\n238\n00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:11.840\nYou can either start really with,\nI don't know people or things.\n\n239\n00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.932\nYou know if I wanna search for people,\nor if I wanna do like host, and\n\n240\n00:13:14.932 --> 00:13:15.813\nthings like that.\n\n241\n00:13:15.813 --> 00:13:17.047\nBut I was like at the,\n\n242\n00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.485\npersonal information can help\nme find other information.\n\n243\n00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:23.245\nCuz I could use it for\nsocial engineering, for\n\n244\n00:13:23.245 --> 00:13:25.745\ngetting into servers once I find them,\nthings like that.\n\n245\n00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:28.005\nI think we'll start with\nthis one right here.\n\n246\n00:13:28.005 --> 00:13:31.069\nWho is POCS, or Point of Context?\n\n247\n00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:33.772\nRemember we did the who is yesterday,\nright?\n\n248\n00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:34.319\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n249\n00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:36.617\nwe saw what kind of\ninformation we can get back.\n\n250\n00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:39.457\nWe had just typed in who is and\na domain name, or\n\n251\n00:13:39.457 --> 00:13:43.837\nwe can go onto a website and\nfind who is search out there online.\n\n252\n00:13:43.837 --> 00:13:48.497\nFor us, we're gonna use that who is\nunderscore pocs or point of contacts.\n\n253\n00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:52.590\nSo to use a module,\nwe first need to load it up, all right.\n\n254\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:58.124\nSo let's start by typing in use, Recon and\n\n255\n00:13:58.124 --> 00:14:02.230\nwe have domain information.\n\n256\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:05.600\nOops, and\nwe're gonna find contact information.\n\n257\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.509\nSo domain contacts and\nthat was a whois_pocs, all right.\n\n258\n00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:13.940\nOkay hit Enter, and\nnow if you look in my prompt and\n\n259\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.470\nlet me it get me back to\nthe top of the screen for you.\n\n260\n00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.820\nYou can see we recon-ng, itprotv,\nmy work space, and then my domain, or\n\n261\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.526\nthe module that I have loaded up\ncurrently, which is Whois.pocs.\n\n262\n00:14:27.526 --> 00:14:30.540\nAnd now that we've got the module\nloaded up, we need to know what\n\n263\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.920\nis this module need, what are the options\nthat I have for this module.\n\n264\n00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.410\nFew different ways you can do this.\n\n265\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:43.020\nYou can do, show info, right?\n\n266\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.362\nAnd this is probably my favorite,\ncuz it's to me,\n\n267\n00:14:46.362 --> 00:14:49.878\nit's the one that gives\nthe most clear full results.\n\n268\n00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:53.362\nShows you the name, module information,\nwho the author was,\n\n269\n00:14:53.362 --> 00:14:55.080\ntells you what it's gonna do.\n\n270\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.704\nAnd then right here, under Options,\n\n271\n00:14:57.704 --> 00:15:02.490\nit's showing me you're gonna\nneed a source, all right?\n\n272\n00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:09.562\nAnd its current value is default,\nwhich it actually shouldn't be.\n\n273\n00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:13.537\nAnd it is a required value, so\n\n274\n00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:19.050\nlet's Actually, [INAUDIBLE],\nso we'll keep going with that.\n\n275\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.310\nSo that's really the only option we have.\n\n276\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.150\nDown below here,\nit shows me the source options.\n\n277\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.100\nIf it's default, and\nthis is really what you wanna look at.\n\n278\n00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:32.890\nIt's gonna select distinct domain from\ndomains where domain is not null.\n\n279\n00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.600\nWe already looked,\nwe have a table called domains.\n\n280\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.787\nIn that table,\nwe added the domain itpro.tv.\n\n281\n00:15:39.787 --> 00:15:44.450\nSo what's gonna do,\nis it's gonna go through that table, and\n\n282\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.730\nselect all the unique\ndomains listed in there.\n\n283\n00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.110\nAnd it's gonna use that as the source.\n\n284\n00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.780\nSo have more than one domain\nlisted in that table,\n\n285\n00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.826\nit would go through each one of those.\n\n286\n00:15:54.826 --> 00:15:58.832\nSo in this case, I'm okay with\nthe same default and no current value.\n\n287\n00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:03.854\nBecause I know the default is to go to\nthe domains table And pull entries.\n\n288\n00:16:03.854 --> 00:16:08.948\nNow, if you didn't have a domain in there\nand you try to run this then it's gonna\n\n289\n00:16:08.948 --> 00:16:13.967\nsay, hey, there's no value and that's\nwhat you can do a set source, the name\n\n290\n00:16:13.967 --> 00:16:18.720\nof the option, and then type in you\nknow what ever it is thatyou wanna use.\n\n291\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.276\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo\n\n292\n00:16:19.276 --> 00:16:22.257\neven if you had a database loaded up\nthat had domains and you wanted to\n\n293\n00:16:22.257 --> 00:16:25.342\nuse a different domain you can always\ndo a set source to kind of say hey,\n\n294\n00:16:25.342 --> 00:16:26.950\ndon't use the table.\n\n295\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.320\nUse what I'm telling you to use right now.\n\n296\n00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:32.950\nAll right ,so once we\ndetermined what options,\n\n297\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.920\nlet me show you the other\nones there's show options.\n\n298\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.600\nBeside show info, there's show options.\n\n299\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.580\nAnd you can see this one doesn't give you\nall of the other help and descriptions.\n\n300\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.040\nIt's very simple just what\noptions are available,\n\n301\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.320\nwhat I do need to make\nsure this module has.\n\n302\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.110\nYou can also do a set command.\n\n303\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.120\nSet is how we set the options.\n\n304\n00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.324\nBut if you type set with no options,\n\n305\n00:16:56.324 --> 00:16:59.713\nthen it will show you the same\nthing that show options.\n\n306\n00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:00.901\nShows you, right?\n\n307\n00:17:00.901 --> 00:17:06.130\nSo several different ways to figure out\nwhat that module needs in order to run.\n\n308\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.290\nOnce we have all those values set,\nwe simply type run.\n\n309\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.660\nAnd we let it go.\n\n310\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.020\nIn this case it's gonna reach out and\nfind a whole lot of nothing.\n\n311\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.590\nWell, that's okay.\n\n312\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.310\nJust cuz we got no\nresults from that module,\n\n313\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.520\nthere are other modules that we can use.\n\n314\n00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.590\nSo to get out of a module,\nyou typed the word back.\n\n315\n00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:31.510\nAnd you see that my prompt goes back to\njust my workspace with no module listed.\n\n316\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.230\nLet's try another one,\nthere's also a PGP search,\n\n317\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.410\nwhich is gonna check PGP key servers for\ninformation.\n\n318\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.405\nAnything to do with ITPro.TV.\n\n319\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:45.331\nSo we're gonna use, and\nthis is gonna be under recon.\n\n320\n00:17:45.331 --> 00:17:46.543\nOops, try that again.\n\n321\n00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:48.530\nWe're gonna do a little recon.\n\n322\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.700\nAnd this is again, is going to be,\nfor this one it's under domain.\n\n323\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.070\nCuz we're using domain information,\nright, ITProTV.\n\n324\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.530\nAnd I wanna find contact information so\nwe'll go contacts.\n\n325\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.720\nNow if I remember, it's pgp_search.\n\n326\n00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.020\nAgain great thing about\nthat tab Auto Fill.\n\n327\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.490\nHit a few characters, tab,\ntab and see what happens there.\n\n328\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.590\nSo now we've loaded that one up.\n\n329\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.360\nWhat do we need to do first.\n\n330\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.985\nLet me see what my options are?\n\n331\n00:18:17.985 --> 00:18:23.630\nSo show info and I can see that I\nhave one option known as source.\n\n332\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.580\nAnd it's gonna be pulling\nfrom my domain table.\n\n333\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.610\nSo I know I've already got\na domain listed in there.\n\n334\n00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.880\nSo I should just be able\nto just run the command.\n\n335\n00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.960\nType in run and we'll hit enter.\n\n336\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.100\nAnd let me go ahead and maximize this so\nwe can kinda see all that good stuff.\n\n337\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:46.510\nI found two PGP key associations\nassociated with that domain, ITPRO.TV.\n\n338\n00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.030\nWell, not bad for our start,\nwe're already finding information\n\n339\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.960\nabout most likely employees\nof a company ITPRO.TV.\n\n340\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.449\nRight.\n\n341\n00:18:56.449 --> 00:18:59.880\nAll right so\nnot only did it go out and find that.\n\n342\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.869\nAgain sort and quickly, right?\n\n343\n00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:05.605\nI mean it found that stuff almost\ninstantaneously, it comes back,\n\n344\n00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:08.300\nit gives me the information but\nthat's not all.\n\n345\n00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.494\nIt stored it in the contacts table.\n\n346\n00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:15.159\nSo if I do show CONTACTS.\n\n347\n00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:21.330\nAll right, here we'll see those\ncontacts we just found, right?\n\n348\n00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.020\nThe email address it found,\nthe title or where it found it and\n\n349\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.910\nwhat module was used to\nget that information.\n\n350\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.160\nAnd like I said it might\nnot seem like a lot, right,\n\n351\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.860\nit's like okay you found\ntwo email addresses.\n\n352\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.540\nAnd most likely, okay, I might be able\nto find those just browsing on the web.\n\n353\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.090\nYes, but you'll see that it's\ngonna start to snowball,\n\n354\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.630\nwe keep using the information that we\nfind, to find more information, and\n\n355\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.160\nthen that information to\nfind even more information.\n\n356\n00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.280\nAnd we start building up our data,\n\n357\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.390\nand we build profiles on each\none of these users, for example.\n\n358\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.790\nAnd now I know Phillip Ford,\nand his email address.\n\n359\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.450\nBut what about phone numbers addresses,\nall that good stuff, birthdays.\n\n360\n00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.850\nYeah, we can find all of this information.\n\n361\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.600\nSo, let's keep on tracking.\n\n362\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.474\nNow that we've got some basic info for\n\n363\n00:20:10.474 --> 00:20:14.291\nsome users, let's do this.\n\n364\n00:20:14.291 --> 00:20:16.520\nLet's take a look,\nbefore we take a look much further.\n\n365\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.150\nLet's do a show dashboard, right.\n\n366\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.950\nI like the dashboard.\n\n367\n00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.050\nDashboard's kind of a little\nsummary of what you've done so far.\n\n368\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.790\nSo if we scroll back up,\nI'll see Activity Summary,\n\n369\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.010\nand I can see the two searches, or\nthe two modules that I've used.\n\n370\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:37.449\nI also see that in my database I\nhave one domain and two contacts.\n\n371\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.650\nSo we're building up our information.\n\n372\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.290\nAll right,\nRonnie let's keep going with the contacts.\n\n373\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.210\nAnd this next one's an interesting one.\n\n374\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.140\nIf we look again at the modules,\nlet's do show modules.\n\n375\n00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.682\nAnd let's look for something with dash,\nand we'll do CONTACTS.\n\n376\n00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:03.640\nAll right, so contacts is the input\ncuz now I've got two contacts.\n\n377\n00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.220\nSo, I've got input for any of\nthe modules that start with contacts, so\n\n378\n00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.790\nto show modules CONTACTS-.\n\n379\n00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:16.030\nAnd I have invalid module category,\nall right.\n\n380\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.840\n&gt;&gt; That the search contacts?\n\n381\n00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.594\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] thank you Ronnie.\n\n382\n00:21:19.594 --> 00:21:21.749\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; How about search contacts, and\n\n383\n00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:24.630\nthat will work a lot better, I bet.\n\n384\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.852\nThank you, sir, and there we go,\nwe have our, there's mailtester,\n\n385\n00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:33.770\nmangle, unmangle, hibp_breach, hibp_paste,\n\n386\n00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:38.659\nmigrate contacts, and full contact,\nlot's of good stuff here.\n\n387\n00:21:38.659 --> 00:21:39.524\n&gt;&gt; Sounds painful.\n\n388\n00:21:39.524 --> 00:21:42.792\n&gt;&gt; It does, right.\n\n389\n00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:44.240\n&gt;&gt; Mangle, unmangle [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n390\n00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.370\nI hope you've done your yoga this morning.\n\n391\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.449\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n392\n00:21:47.449 --> 00:21:47.949\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n393\n00:21:47.949 --> 00:21:51.344\nAny idea what HIBP stands for Ronnie?\n\n394\n00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:52.199\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't but\n\n395\n00:21:52.199 --> 00:21:53.847\nit sounds painful again.\n[LAUGH]\n\n396\n00:21:53.847 --> 00:21:57.094\n&gt;&gt; It does, but it's, Have I Been Pwned.\n\n397\n00:21:57.094 --> 00:21:58.213\n&gt;&gt; Aah, okay.\n\n398\n00:21:58.213 --> 00:21:59.799\n&gt;&gt; There is a website out there that\n\n399\n00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:02.796\ntracks this kind of thing as\nthose big data breaches occur and\n\n400\n00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:06.340\nthat information is released about\nwhat accounts where compromised.\n\n401\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.200\nThey try to collect all that information\n\n402\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.770\nup and then you can go and search to see.\n\n403\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.347\nHey, it was my account I\nwas a customer of, blahoo.\n\n404\n00:22:14.347 --> 00:22:14.980\nCan I say that?\n\n405\n00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.260\nI didn't say.\n\n406\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.210\nI think we can say yahoo.\n\n407\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.710\nEverybody knows that they got breached.\n\n408\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.508\n&gt;&gt; Blahoo?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n409\n00:22:19.508 --> 00:22:20.429\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had to come up\n\n410\n00:22:20.429 --> 00:22:21.463\nwith something quick.\n\n411\n00:22:21.463 --> 00:22:24.540\n[LAUGH] Yeah, you would never know\nwhat I was talking about there.\n\n412\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Secret code.\n\n413\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:26.960\nAll right.\n\n414\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.370\nBut the idea is, hey,\nwas my account in there?\n\n415\n00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.660\nI can find out if it was one\nof the ones that was released.\n\n416\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:39.270\nHere's a module that I can now use\nthose contacts that I just scraped,\n\n417\n00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.656\nto input here,\nto go search the Have I Been Pwned site.\n\n418\n00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:45.142\nLet's see if it works, all right?\n\n419\n00:22:45.142 --> 00:22:47.799\nSo we're gonna say,\n\n420\n00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:53.853\nuse recon/contacts-credentials/hibp_,\n\n421\n00:22:53.853 --> 00:22:57.842\nlet's do the breach one first.\n\n422\n00:22:57.842 --> 00:23:04.114\nAll right, so now I'm using that\nmodule and lets do a little show info.\n\n423\n00:23:04.114 --> 00:23:09.730\nAll right, and we can see have\nI been pwned?Breach Search.\n\n424\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.090\nAll it needs is a SOURCE.\n\n425\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.625\nNow the source for this one, this is where\nyou gotta read this this show info, right?\n\n426\n00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:20.750\nCuz so far the ones we've been doing\nit was select distinct domains from, or\n\n427\n00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.290\ndomain from domains.\n\n428\n00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.600\nThis one is SELECT DISTINCT\nemail FROM contacts, all right?\n\n429\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:35.840\nDo we have, but we know, oops, That we\nhave emails for our contacts, right?\n\n430\n00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.710\nI can see Don's email and\nI can see Philip's email.\n\n431\n00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.720\nSo that's means I do have\nthe information it's gonna need.\n\n432\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.200\nSELECT DISTINCT email FROM\ncontacts WHERE email IS NOT NULL.\n\n433\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.580\nSo let's run it.\n\n434\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.080\nAnd see what we get?\n\n435\n00:23:53.675 --> 00:23:56.670\nAll right, there it finished and\nlet's take a look at these results.\n\n436\n00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.324\nSo that first one,\nphillip@itpro.tv, Not Found.\n\n437\n00:24:00.324 --> 00:24:04.166\nBut there I have a few with don@itpro.tv,\nBreach found!\n\n438\n00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:10.027\nSeen in the GeekedIn breach\nthat occurred on 2016-08-15.\n\n439\n00:24:10.027 --> 00:24:14.034\nSo what this is telling\nme is this email address,\n\n440\n00:24:14.034 --> 00:24:18.920\nwas in that database for\nGeekedIn when it was compromised,\n\n441\n00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.000\nwhich is kind of interesting,\nI don't know.\n\n442\n00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.840\nThat one doesn't give me a ton of info.\n\n443\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.890\nBut it does tell me that with a little\nmore looking I might find passwords too.\n\n444\n00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.280\nBecause that account has been released.\n\n445\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.405\nSo that information is out there.\n\n446\n00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:37.580\nIt gave me the credential but\n\n447\n00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.675\nit did not find any passwords\nin this particular case.\n\n448\n00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:46.380\nHe was also part of the Trillium\nbreach and the vBulletin breach.\n\n449\n00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.250\nNow keep in mind,\nsomething I should point out here.\n\n450\n00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.535\nThis is not, I actually talked to Don.\n\n451\n00:24:50.535 --> 00:24:52.800\nI said, hey you're okay with me\nsharing this information, right?\n\n452\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.810\nHe's like, yeah it's nothing, nothing bad.\n\n453\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.700\nIt just means that he\nsigned up at a company that\n\n454\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.640\ndidn't handle security very well.\n\n455\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.730\nProbably went to one of\nthese sites looking for\n\n456\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.760\nsome information or whatever,\nlogged in, created an account.\n\n457\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.200\nAnd then they got compromised,\nnot Don, not a weak password.\n\n458\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.200\nIt was Trillium that got breached.\n\n459\n00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.860\nTheir account database was stolen.\n\n460\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.930\nBut it did add some credentials.\n\n461\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.520\nSo if we take a look at\nthe show credentials,\n\n462\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.170\nI'll now have an entry for Don.\n\n463\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.890\nAgain, it didn't pull back his password.\n\n464\n00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.470\nIt didn't pull back the hash or\nany of that in this particular case.\n\n465\n00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.210\nBut depending on what's listed up\nthere on that Have I Been Pwned site,\n\n466\n00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.450\nI might very well come back with a hash.\n\n467\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:42.820\nOnce I get the hash, it's just a few\nsteps away from breaking those hashes.\n\n468\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.470\nIn fact, there's a module in here that\nyou can use that'll take you out to,\n\n469\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.620\nit'll go out to website and compare\nthe hashes against one of their tables\n\n470\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.220\nto see if they can find the password for\nyou.\n\n471\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.287\nThey won't try to break it or anything.\n\n472\n00:25:53.287 --> 00:25:55.800\nBut they will do their rainbow tables.\n\n473\n00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.470\nSo, building up data, building up data.\n\n474\n00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.570\nThe other one there,\nthe other hipb is actually a good one.\n\n475\n00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.820\nI don't think it's gonna return anything.\n\n476\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.481\nBut let's run it anyway just so\nyou can see it, if I could spell recon.\n\n477\n00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:17.660\nThat was /contacts-credentials/hipb_pasty?\n\n478\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.542\nYeah, paste.\n\n479\n00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:21.840\nAnd I'll do a little show info.\n\n480\n00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.890\nAnd this has two options.\n\n481\n00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.483\nIt tells you this.\n\n482\n00:26:27.483 --> 00:26:30.460\nGo into the ihavebeenpwned.com.\n\n483\n00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.270\nAnd it needs a source.\n\n484\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.249\nAnd the source is email\nfrom the contacts table.\n\n485\n00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:37.720\nSo we're good there,\nwe've got that information.\n\n486\n00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.800\nAnd then it is DOWNLOAD is set to True and\nit is required.\n\n487\n00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.012\nThis goes out to Pastebin.\n\n488\n00:26:46.012 --> 00:26:48.140\nI'm trying to see,\nit should say that somewhere.\n\n489\n00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.890\nPaste sites supported: Pastebin, Pastie,\nSlexy, Ghostbin, Quickleak, JustPaste,\n\n490\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.240\nAdHocUrl.\n\n491\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.360\nThere are several that it goes to.\n\n492\n00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.620\nAnd if you're familiar\nwith any of those sites,\n\n493\n00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.310\nthey're really quick file share sites.\n\n494\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.970\nLike if you've got, they're not really\nfor, usually not for full files.\n\n495\n00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.340\nIt's more like code snippets and\nthings like that.\n\n496\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.810\nHey, I need Ronnie to take a look at this.\n\n497\n00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.620\nI can put it up there in Pastebin,\ngive him a link.\n\n498\n00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.300\nHe can link to it and\nthings like that and access it.\n\n499\n00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.640\nSo here what we're doing\nis we're saying hey,\n\n500\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.980\nhave any of those people that you've\ndiscovered so far used any of these sites.\n\n501\n00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.757\nSo we'll say run, And\n\n502\n00:27:27.757 --> 00:27:30.900\nPhillip Ford wasn't found and\nDon wasn't found so they're in the clear.\n\n503\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.890\nThey have not been using Pastebin.\n\n504\n00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.200\nThat DOWNLOAD set to true,\ndo be careful with that one.\n\n505\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.530\nIt will automatically,\n\n506\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.830\nif set to true it'll download anything\nit finds in any one of those sites.\n\n507\n00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.730\nSo if you didn't wanna download,\n\n508\n00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:49.730\nif you just wanted to see\nif they had used it, and\n\n509\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:56.234\nthen wanna decide which ones to download,\nyou could do a set DOWNLOAD false.\n\n510\n00:27:56.234 --> 00:28:00.522\nAnd then it wouldn't download\nthose automatically.\n\n511\n00:28:00.522 --> 00:28:03.800\nSo continuing on with\nour user information.\n\n512\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.229\nLet's back out of this module.\n\n513\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.690\nAnd next we're gonna do\none called full contact.\n\n514\n00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:14.630\nNow, full contact is a place where you\ncan go and get a lot of information.\n\n515\n00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.410\nIt's scary how much they have on me.\n\n516\n00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.950\nLet's take a look at running this module.\n\n517\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:26.193\nWe're gonna say use\nrecon/contacts-profiles/fullcontact.\n\n518\n00:28:26.193 --> 00:28:30.990\nBecause in our database, we have\ncontacts and then we have profiles.\n\n519\n00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.880\nContacts are really, they're contact\ninformation like you might think,\n\n520\n00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.510\nphone number, email.\n\n521\n00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.790\nProfile is all the other stuff, their\naddress, their business address, their\n\n522\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.620\ndepartment, more things that we can use\nwhen we get into, say, social engineering.\n\n523\n00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.800\nAnd that's what this site is designed or\ngeared to do, is find that information.\n\n524\n00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.190\nSo if we do a show info,\n\n525\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.166\nwe'll see that it's gonna go to\nFullContact Contact Enumerator.\n\n526\n00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:59.744\nThat's the name of it, Contact Enumerator.\n\n527\n00:28:59.744 --> 00:29:01.780\nHarvests contact information and\n\n528\n00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:07.760\nprofiles from fullcontact.com\nAPI using email as the input.\n\n529\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.790\nAnd it updates both the contacts table and\nthe profiles tables.\n\n530\n00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.230\nAnything it finds it's\ngonna dump in there.\n\n531\n00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.710\nSOURCE, default,\nDISTINCT email FROM contacts.\n\n532\n00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:19.150\nSo we're good to go there.\n\n533\n00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.364\nWe can just run and\nlet's see where we get.\n\n534\n00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:26.445\nLot of good information here.\n\n535\n00:29:26.445 --> 00:29:27.523\nNow look what we are getting.\n\n536\n00:29:27.523 --> 00:29:32.139\nPhillip Ford, email address,\nposition, Sales Manager,\n\n537\n00:29:32.139 --> 00:29:37.125\nlocation, Gravatar information,\nLinkedIn profile account.\n\n538\n00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:41.329\nI mean, that's- I follow that link.\n\n539\n00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:50.213\nThere is Mr. Philip Ford.\n\n540\n00:29:50.213 --> 00:29:55.671\nSo we're starting to see the power\nhopefully of some of these modules and\n\n541\n00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:57.600\nwhat we can do with them.\n\n542\n00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.140\nIf we take a look at show profiles now,\n\n543\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.700\nwe'll see that we're starting\nto build up some information.\n\n544\n00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.940\nAnd so far we've really just been hitting,\n\n545\n00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.160\nwe've been focused on\nthe user side of things.\n\n546\n00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.560\nReally haven't even started to explore the\nhost and domain modules that are in here.\n\n547\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.894\nSo that is yet to come.\n\n548\n00:30:18.894 --> 00:30:21.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike,\nwell thank you again for\n\n549\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.014\nhelping us to get started with recon-ng.\n\n550\n00:30:24.014 --> 00:30:28.370\nYou're starting to see the power\nof what recon-ng can do.\n\n551\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.480\nThis entire product, it gives you\nthat ability instead of you having\n\n552\n00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.550\nto manually do the searches with multiple\nutilities and tools in one tool,\n\n553\n00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.590\nyou're now starting to see that snowball\neffect that Mike was talking about.\n\n554\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.890\nAnd there is a lot more for\nus to be able to do.\n\n555\n00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.210\nBut that is for another episode then.\n\n556\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.230\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n557\n00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n558\n00:30:52.340

basics,\n\n8\n00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:29.271\nand here to help us out to know what Nick2\nis and hopefully pronounce it correctly,\n\n9\n00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.282\nis gonna be Mr. Security himself,\nMike Rodrick, Mike welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:35.273\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie, I think that's right.\n\n11\n00:00:35.273 --> 00:00:38.590\nNick2, Nicktoe, who knows.\n\n12\n00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.775\nAlright, we'll stick with that,\nthat's our story and we're sticking to it.\n\n13\n00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:44.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes,\n\n14\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.075\nthat is exactly what we're gonna do today,\n\n15\n00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:51.230\nwe're breaking in to a new topic or\nset of tools on our menu in Kali.\n\n16\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.380\nWe're getting into vulnerability analysis,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.840\nWe've gone through a few different ones.\n\n18\n00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.340\nWe've done our basic Kali, with\nthe many different ways to install it.\n\n19\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.660\nWe've looked at information gathering,\na couple of tools, and\n\n20\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.080\nonce you get your targets, right, you've\ngone through your reconnaissance and\n\n21\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.590\ngathered your information, just keep in\nmind as we say this reconnaissance never\n\n22\n00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.010\nends, right, enumeration is something\nthat you're gonna be doing constantly.\n\n23\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.580\nAs you discover new resources,\nyou're gonna be starting over and\n\n24\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.120\ndoing reconnaissance on those, and\nenumeration, and all that good stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.660\nBut in general,\nwe've gone through reconnaissance,\n\n26\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.910\nwe've got our targets now we need to see,\nwell, okay, what do we do next?\n\n27\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.020\nAnd that's where the vulnerability\nanalysis typically comes in.\n\n28\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020\nYou know, we've looked at some port\nscanning in the very beginning of this\n\n29\n00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.600\nseries, because that's one of those\nbasic tools that you have to know and\n\n30\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.380\nthat would definitely be a step that\nI would do now that I have a target.\n\n31\n00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.240\nBut another thing would be\nthe vulnerability analysis,\n\n32\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.320\nbecause we want to find a way in.\n\n33\n00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.520\nRight we need to get into that machine, or\n\n34\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.730\nwe want to see if we can\npenetrate that machine.\n\n35\n00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.460\nAnd that means we need to find open ports.\n\n36\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.934\nSee what services are on there.\n\n37\n00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:02.729\nAnd see if any of those services\nhave any known vulnerabilities,\n\n38\n00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.010\nany exploits, that we can use to\nexploit those vulnerabilities.\n\n39\n00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.660\nAnd the easiest way to do that,\nis try to automate it with some tool.\n\n40\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.460\nAnd that's really what we\nwant to get into here So\n\n41\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.000\nthe one I wanna look at\ntoday is known as Nikto.\n\n42\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.370\nIt's been a staple for a long time.\n\n43\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.300\nIt's a really good vulnerability scanner.\n\n44\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.570\nIt's really a web application\nvulnerability scanner.\n\n45\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.190\nNow, let's clarify that, Ronnie.\n\n46\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.290\nBecause, when we think about\nvulnerability scanners,\n\n47\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.660\nwe need to make sure we understand\nwhat they're doing or looking for.\n\n48\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.560\nWhen we talk about a web\napplication vulnerability scanner,\n\n49\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880\nit is not looking at operation system\nconfigurations anything like that.\n\n50\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.820\nIt is focused in on web applications.\n\n51\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.490\nBut those really\nare a primary target right;\n\n52\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.089\nweb applications are a source\nof vulnerability.\n\n53\n00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.620\nSo Nick2, again web application\nvulnerability scanner, meaning it's gonna\n\n54\n00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.050\nlook at your web applications and compare\nit against databases that it maintains,\n\n55\n00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.330\nor that it has access to, for\nknown vulnerabilities, right.\n\n56\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.905\nIt's going to, depending on the tools,\nsome of them might try to\n\n57\n00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:12.229\ntake it a step further and\neven do a little text exploit on it.\n\n58\n00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.952\nMost of them that will report back,\nwhat they found and\n\n59\n00:03:15.952 --> 00:03:18.564\nthat's what we're gonna focus in on here.\n\n60\n00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:23.710\nNick2 is gonna run through a series\nof test on the web port checking for\n\n61\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.840\nall these known vulnerabilities, and in\nthe end, it generates a report saying, hey\n\n62\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.580\nlook, it looks like it might be vulnerable\nto this, and it'll describe it and\n\n63\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.150\nmaybe even give you a link to a reference\npage, or a way that you can test it and\n\n64\n00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.080\nthen usually gives you some kind of\nreference number or a vulnerability ID.\n\n65\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.340\nWe'll come back to that concept\nin a minute, but I can go out and\n\n66\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.880\nlook up, and get more information\non what that vulnerability is and\n\n67\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.550\nhopefully how I can patch against it.\n\n68\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.040\nRight?\nIf I'm a security professional for\n\n69\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.130\nmy organization, truly what I'm doing,\nI'm scanning my machines, looking for\n\n70\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.230\nvulnerabilities, and then trying to\nfix those before the bad guys do.\n\n71\n00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.320\nBut I digress back to what we're talking\nabout the difference between, the scanner.\n\n72\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.300\nSo you got things like in\na Microsoft world you got\n\n73\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.620\nthe Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n74\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.350\nRight?\n\n75\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.200\nKind of a vulnerability scanner for\nMicrosoft.\n\n76\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.821\nBut it's focused on the operating system,\nand maybe I already finished this thought,\n\n77\n00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:22.393\nbut I'll do it one more time.\n\n78\n00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:27.610\nBut these web apps, again, they're\nfocused strictly on web applications.\n\n79\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.040\nNow Nick2, like I said, it was a big one\nin its day, it's still relatively popular.\n\n80\n00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.207\nI'm gonna come back to why I,\n\n81\n00:04:36.207 --> 00:04:42.230\nI kind of sound like I'm\ntalking about it in past tense.\n\n82\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.508\nI'll read from their\ninfo that they put out.\n\n83\n00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:50.700\n6700 potentially dangerous files or\nCGIs, that's what it's checking for.\n\n84\n00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.990\nIt checks for\noutdated versions of over 2500 servers,\n\n85\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.330\nversion specific problems\non over 270 servers.\n\n86\n00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.740\nTalking bout things that\nNick2 knows to look for.\n\n87\n00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.550\nIt will look for\nserver configuration items.\n\n88\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.590\nKeep in mind, we're not talking\nabout server, the operating system.\n\n89\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.660\nTalking bout server, the web.\n\n90\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.617\nYes, like Apache, or\n\n91\n00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:20.460\nany of your various web servers\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n92\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.400\nSo let's fire it up.\n\n93\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.934\nIt's on our menu.\n\n94\n00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.752\nYou can definitely go into\nyour applications and\n\n95\n00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:28.820\nthen vulnerability analysis, and\nthere is Nick G right there.\n\n96\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.660\nWe can launch it that way.\n\n97\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.140\nAnd I might as well, since I'm there,\n\n98\n00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.760\nyou can definitely go to your\ncommand prompt your shell.\n\n99\n00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.360\nAnd you could just type Nick 2, and\nyou get these same results right here.\n\n100\n00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.280\nBy typing in Nick 2,\n\n101\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.230\nI'll do it one more time,\nNow you just get the basic help, alright.\n\n102\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.890\nSo it tells me hey there you\ndidn't specify any options and\n\n103\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.090\nhere's all the options\nthat you should use.\n\n104\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.780\nThis is what they call\nthe short help output.\n\n105\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.586\nIt'd be the same thing,\nif I did Nick2 dash H.\n\n106\n00:05:57.586 --> 00:06:02.710\nI'd get those same results,\nI want more detail help.\n\n107\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.247\nWe can do a Nick2, and\n\n108\n00:06:07.247 --> 00:06:12.690\nit's going to me a lot more information.\n\n109\n00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.140\nA little more details about\nthe possibilities within, like\n\n110\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.180\nin the short help you see display, and\nthen it turns off or on display outputs.\n\n111\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.579\nThis one actually shows you\nthe options that you can use.\n\n112\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.980\nThe ones with the plus signs, are the ones\nthat are going to require additional.\n\n113\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.190\nSome kind of parameter that\ngoes along with those options.\n\n114\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.030\nThe main ones that I typically use,\nwhen i'm doing it too.\n\n115\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.250\nI let it do it's thing.\n\n116\n00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.310\nI'll show you a couple of\nthings you might change.\n\n117\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.989\nThe display you can change to verbose.\n\n118\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.200\nSometimes I want to see a little more\ninformation, another one would be\n\n119\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.680\nthe output, because the information that\nis spitting out I most likely want to go\n\n120\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.770\nback and reference in the future or I want\nto save a hard copy up for deliverable\n\n121\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.200\nat the end of penetration test, so\nI wanna write the output to a file.\n\n122\n00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.398\nAnd you can specify a name,\nyou can do just a dot for auto name,\n\n123\n00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:14.430\nit will base on the whatever target\nyou specified her host to specified.\n\n124\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.900\nAnd there is also,\n\n125\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.010\nit's little confusing when you first\nget in here, because you have output.\n\n126\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.870\nAnd then you have one known as format.\n\n127\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.930\nAnd format is, how do I want to save this?\n\n128\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:26.900\nAs an HTML?\n\n129\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.850\nAs a CSV?\n\n130\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.930\nAnd you can see a several different\noptions you can choose, XML, TXT,\n\n131\n00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.515\nSQL, MBE, lot of different options there.\n\n132\n00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:42.300\nBut you have to use both, the output\nyou can give it a name like Target 101.\n\n133\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.640\nAll right.\n\n134\n00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.408\nAnd then the format,\nyou would say format htm.\n\n135\n00:07:46.408 --> 00:07:49.830\nAnd it'll make a file target101.html or\nhtm.\n\n136\n00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.273\nAll right.\n\n137\n00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:56.669\nBut, you can also specify the extension\nin the output when you give it the name.\n\n138\n00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:58.269\nYou can say dash O.\n\n139\n00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.667\nTarget101.htm and\nthen you leave off the format, and\n\n140\n00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:08.319\nit's smart enough to know, hey,\nhe's giving me a name that ends in HTML or\n\n141\n00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:12.060\nHTM, I think he probably\nwants the HTML output.\n\n142\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.600\nSo either way you wanna do that.\n\n143\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.950\nIf you wanna specify just the name\nin the output and then the format,\n\n144\n00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.169\nspecify which one you want.\n\n145\n00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.360\nOr you can specify the full\nextension on the name and\n\n146\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.730\nthe output and leave off the format.\n\n147\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.220\nThe other one that we\nneed of course is host,\n\n148\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.630\nwe've gotta have a target that we\nare going to scan for vulnerabilities.\n\n149\n00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.950\nNow when we look at this,\nthe extended help with a capital H.\n\n150\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.540\nAnother one that I haven't\nused too often but\n\n151\n00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.810\nI can see if I needed to,\nI could fine tune.\n\n152\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.830\nThis is basically showing you\nthe different categories of things\n\n153\n00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.920\nthat it's going to be scanning for, like\ninjection, either cross sight scripting or\n\n154\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.010\nHTML or file upload, like local file\nincludes or remote file includes or\n\n155\n00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.330\nSQL Injection is a category, and\nby default it'll run all of these, right?\n\n156\n00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.440\nBut let's say I only wanna look for\nSQL Injection attacks.\n\n157\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.900\nI can do a dash tuning nine,\nand it'll just run those tests.\n\n158\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.880\nSo if I'm trying to save time or\n\n159\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.390\nbe a little less noisy on the network,\nget in get out.\n\n160\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.450\nJust do the tests I want, this is how we\nwould do it with these tuning option here.\n\n161\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.960\nYou can list more than one on those\ntuning options if you wanna run tests.\n\n162\n00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.630\nThese's also an x,\n\n163\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.130\nsome times it might be easier to go this\nroute which reverses your tuning options.\n\n164\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.290\nNormally if I do a dash tuning five,\n\n165\n00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.000\nseven and nine,\nit's gonna only run category 5, 7 and 9.\n\n166\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.796\nIf I do a dash tuning 579x,\n\n167\n00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:50.950\nit's gonna run all tests except 5,\n7 and 9.\n\n168\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.960\nSo it reverses your selection,\nif you will.\n\n169\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.060\nAnd those are the most ones.\n\n170\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.440\nThere's a lot of other switches\nthat can definitely help,\n\n171\n00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.090\ndepending on your scenario.\n\n172\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.910\nBut those are the basics for\n\n173\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.530\nwhat we're going to be doing as far\nas getting started with good old.\n\n174\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.200\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike, when you start\nto talk about using this and\n\n175\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.600\nthis idea of the vulnerability scanner,\n\n176\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.890\nthat it checks it against some\ntype of database out there.\n\n177\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.010\nWhat are we really talking about?\n\n178\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.320\nWhere is it actually getting\nthis information from?\n\n179\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.156\n&gt;&gt; Well whoever writes the program,\nlike this one, nikto,\n\n180\n00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:29.140\nthere's a gentleman, I should know,\nit's really coming from them.\n\n181\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.240\nThey maintain a database of\nvulnerabilities and that's\n\n182\n00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.560\nactually an issue I wanna talk about here\nin a minute because it's unfortunate,\n\n183\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.160\nbut it's not around any more.\n\n184\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.680\nBut like I say, we'll come back to that.\n\n185\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.930\nAll right, cuz then if I tell you\nthat now, you're gonna tune out for\n\n186\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.330\nthe rest of the show, and go,\nwhy aren't we gonna use nikto any more?\n\n187\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.350\nAnd you really should learn this one.\n\n188\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.440\nIt's a good one to learn.\n\n189\n00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.050\nAll right, so.\n\n190\n00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:58.580\nNikto is the command, and we'll just\ndo a little -host And I have a couple\n\n191\n00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.430\nof vulnerable machines up, that we can\nscan and get some results, hopefully.\n\n192\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.610\nSo let's start with our\nMetasploitable machine.\n\n193\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.370\nI'll just do the IP address for\nthe host identifier.\n\n194\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:17.090\nAnd then for my output, let's do,\n\n195\n00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.835\nI don't know,\nwe'll call this one results.html.\n\n196\n00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:26.770\nAll right, notice I'm leaving off\nthe format option because I'm specifying\n\n197\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.220\nreally what I want in\nthe name of the file.\n\n198\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:34.670\nSo we'll go ahead and run that, and it's\ngonna output the results to my screen.\n\n199\n00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:38.820\nAs well as,\nto a file that we'll go back and look at.\n\n200\n00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.110\nSo as these results roll through here,\n\n201\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.100\nwe'll see that it starts off giving\nme some information about my target.\n\n202\n00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.990\nPort number that it's hitting.\n\n203\n00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.900\nAnd that's another thing I guess,\nyou can specify port numbers as well.\n\n204\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.290\nDefinitely want to do that,\nyou might run mmap on a machine and\n\n205\n00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.890\nsee that not only are they hosting one on\n80 but they're also over there on 443 or\n\n206\n00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.800\n8080 or some other port that they've\ntried to move a web service to.\n\n207\n00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.340\nSo you don't wanna miss those.\n\n208\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.184\nBut by default if they don't\nspecify it'll go to port 80.\n\n209\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.940\nSo it's still rolling through here.\n\n210\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.330\nAnd this is what you get,\nthis is the output.\n\n211\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.980\nNow, we've got to take that and\ndecipher it.\n\n212\n00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.516\nI'm just kidding.\n\n213\n00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:25.610\n[LAUGH] It's almost done here, we'll give\nit just another minute to finish up.\n\n214\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.579\nAgain, I did the default, so\nit's running all of the tests.\n\n215\n00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.310\nStill, it's pretty darn quick.\n\n216\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.820\nIt should be must another minute.\n\n217\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.380\nTell you what, while we're waiting for it\nto finish, and soon as I say that it will\n\n218\n00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.410\nfinish, what I was alluding to earlier,\nand of course there it goes, it finishes.\n\n219\n00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.320\nNow I'm gonna leave you\nwith a cliffhanger.\n\n220\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.580\nYou'll have to wait my story\nuntil we go over the results.\n\n221\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:53.220\nWe can scroll back up\nthrough the results here or\n\n222\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.390\nwe can go take a look at the HTML document\nwhich is gonna be a lot easier to read.\n\n223\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.480\nIn fact, I'm gonna run one more scan\non another vulnerable machine, so\n\n224\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.900\nwe can take a look at that,\nas well, let's do again.\n\n225\n00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.290\nI'll do results2.\n\n226\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:13.060\nI'm gonna change this good\nold IP address to 100 and\n\n227\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.110\nthat's my darn vulnerable web app, so\n\n228\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.140\nwe'll let that guy run,\nsee what kind of results we get from that.\n\n229\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.270\nAll right now,\nlet's take a look at our results.\n\n230\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.190\nThat was actually HTML.\n\n231\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:35.670\nSo we'll do Firefox results.html and\nsee what we get.\n\n232\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:42.700\nSo this is my output, I love tools that\ngive me nice html formatted output.\n\n233\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.780\nIt makes it so\n\n234\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.490\nmuch easier when it comes time to\nprepare your deliverables at the end.\n\n235\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.920\nIt's showing me my target,\nwhat port it scanned and\n\n236\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.060\nit tells me a little bit about it.\n\n237\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.880\nI found that it was Apache 2.2 and\nI can zoom in on that so you can see it,\n\n238\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.180\nhow is that, Ryan?\n\n239\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.730\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n240\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.380\n&gt;&gt; So, we can see, you know,\nthe target information,\n\n241\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.250\nit found that it's running Apache 2.2.8,\ndefinitely a good place to start.\n\n242\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.470\nEven gives us links so\nwe can browse to it if we want.\n\n243\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.130\nAnd there is that page that it found,\nall right.\n\n244\n00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.300\nAnd as we go down through here,\nwhat we're seeing,\n\n245\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.520\nthese first ones are just a lot of\ninformational, retrieve x powered header.\n\n246\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.250\nSo it's running PHP5.2.4.\n\n247\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.780\nAnd this is good information, right?\n\n248\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.560\nWe've talked about this in other episodes.\n\n249\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.080\nWe want that information version number so\n\n250\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.280\nthat we can go out and find vulnerability\nspecific to that version number.\n\n251\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.330\nIt tells me the anti-click jacking,\nX-frame option, headers not present.\n\n252\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.040\nIt's kind of one of those configuration\nthings that I was looking at.\n\n253\n00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040\nNotice it doesn't really give me.\n\n254\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.650\nIt says OSVDB 0 for a couple of these.\n\n255\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.820\nAnd that's because these really\naren't vulnerabilities, per se.\n\n256\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.820\nThese are configuration issues or\n\n257\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.920\njust informational saying that you know,\ncertain headers aren't defined.\n\n258\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:01.020\nNow as a security professional, I would\nwant to let them know, let's maybe do\n\n259\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:06.570\nsomething about that, let's look at what\nthis is, what it means, and how bad it is.\n\n260\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.840\nWe'll do our risk assessment and decide\nif we want to spend effort on that and\n\n261\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.570\npatch that up, as we go down through here,\nthough, we're gonna find\n\n262\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.770\nSome actual vulnerabilities and here we\nget to our first few ones that we see.\n\n263\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.090\nPeaceP info P variables\nscript alert vulnerability.\n\n264\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.160\nOutput from the PHP info\nfunction was found, right?\n\n265\n00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.340\nAnd this is again,\nwe're not gonna get into PHP, but\n\n266\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.270\nthis is saying that hey,\nthey've left the phpinfo script available,\n\n267\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.980\nwhich we wouldn't want people\nfrom the outside running, right?\n\n268\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.825\nIt's a script that returns information\nabout the configuration of your PHP.\n\n269\n00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:44.725\nThat you have installed.\n\n270\n00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:46.705\nWe open that in a new tab.\n\n271\n00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:50.510\nWe can see a lot of information\nthat it's able to return.\n\n272\n00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.349\nNormally for administration,\nwe might need this information.\n\n273\n00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:57.469\nWe don't wanna make this available to\nanybody who's browsing to our site.\n\n274\n00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:02.207\nThis is what we call information leaking,\nwhat things are allowed,\n\n275\n00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:03.850\nwhat aren't allowed.\n\n276\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.100\nAgain, this is a lot of just\nthe configuration for PHP.\n\n277\n00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.830\nWe'll keep going down, it says,\n\n278\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:16.110\nhey, there was directory in directing\nfound, something slash doc.\n\n279\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.960\nLet's go ahead and\nsee what that brings up.\n\n280\n00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.210\nYeah, that's probably not good.\n\n281\n00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.950\nSo now I can start\nbrowsing around through.\n\n282\n00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.260\nI'll see if there's anything good in here.\n\n283\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:31.900\nI would go through most of these as I was,\nfakeroot, ethtool.\n\n284\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.290\nAll right.\n\n285\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.540\nSo we would just start\ngoing through these, and\n\n286\n00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.700\nsee what kind of\ninformation we could find.\n\n287\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.850\nThere might be a place where I\ncan find some scripts, iptables,\n\n288\n00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.240\niproute, this is probably\nnot good information.\n\n289\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.880\nActually it looks like help files or\nsomething, right.\n\n290\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.630\nSo the docs library's available.\n\n291\n00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.820\nAgain, more PHP that's\ngonna reveal information.\n\n292\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.472\nAnd some of these are kind\nof false positives.\n\n293\n00:17:03.472 --> 00:17:07.719\nIf you look at, I don't know,\nmaybe this one.\n\n294\n00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:10.290\nI think it shows, yeah,\nthis is the logo for PHP.\n\n295\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.320\nSo in the end,\nthat's not that big of a vulnerability.\n\n296\n00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.100\nSo, we do have to go through here,\nand see what we're finding.\n\n297\n00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah as you scroll down there,\n\n298\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.160\nthere's one that says that right there,\nyou just passed it.\n\n299\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Just passed it?\n\n300\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right there.\n\n301\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.120\nI think it's actually one more up.\n\n302\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.400\nIt says this might be interesting.\n\n303\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.945\n&gt;&gt; This might be interesting.\n\n304\n00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:32.430\n[LAUGH] Well let's see if\nit's interesting, right?\n\n305\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:37.342\nWe'll open that up in a new tab here,\nand see what we\n\n306\n00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:42.083\ngot.Testoutput.Loginng file test\n&gt;&gt; Not so interesting.\n\n307\n00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:45.245\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not so interesting, but we wanna\ngrab that file and try to open it up\n\n308\n00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:48.316\nwith something else, and see if we\ncan find some information in there.\n\n309\n00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:51.935\nThat's exactly what we want to do,\nis start going through these links, and\n\n310\n00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:52.960\nseeing what we find.\n\n311\n00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.300\nRemember what I said a little bit ago,\nright?\n\n312\n00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.660\nThe numeration never ends.\n\n313\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.320\nEvery bit of information you find,\n\n314\n00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.030\nopens up a whole nother set of\nenumeration that you need to go through.\n\n315\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.830\nNow we get down to a little\nmore exciting stuff.\n\n316\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:11.633\nLet's see down here, there's,\nwhat else, anything good?\n\n317\n00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:12.974\nI don't see a whole lot.\n\n318\n00:18:12.974 --> 00:18:18.205\nIt's really just a lot of\ndirectory indexing found,\n\n319\n00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:22.514\nso not a lot of\nvulnerabilities on this guy.\n\n320\n00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:28.246\nDocumentation, well, all right.\n\n321\n00:18:28.246 --> 00:18:31.996\nSo that was our report on what?\n\n322\n00:18:31.996 --> 00:18:33.087\nOn net exploitable.\n\n323\n00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:35.730\nLet's go take a look at results two.\n\n324\n00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.370\nThat one should be done by now.\n\n325\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.840\nLet's get that guy back over here.\n\n326\n00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.080\nThere it is, and\nthat should out put it to a file as well.\n\n327\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.379\nSo let's see what's over there.\n\n328\n00:18:54.053 --> 00:18:55.780\nThis is another machine.\n\n329\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.270\nAgain, a lot of the same\ninfo at the beginning here.\n\n330\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.050\nHeaders not present.\n\n331\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.860\nCookie PHPSESSID created\nwithout the HttpOnly flag.\n\n332\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.010\nA bunch of temp URL's, again,\n\n333\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.190\nI'm trying to scroll down and\nfind some interesting ones.\n\n334\n00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:20.030\nHere's a good one, CGI Bend Print\nEnvelope, print environment, sorry.\n\n335\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:24.260\nThe site appears to be vulnerable to\nthe shell shock vulnerability, and\n\n336\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.340\nit gives me this CVE number,\nCVE is my common vulnerabilities and\n\n337\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.820\nexploit, that is a database that's\nmaintained of known vulnerabilities.\n\n338\n00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.560\nAnd that's an ID number that\nI can go out and look up, and\n\n339\n00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.100\nget additional information on.\n\n340\n00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.470\nGives me a link to follow, and\n\n341\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.890\nI would definitely want to go through\nsome of that information there.\n\n342\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.270\nThis is showing me that it is\nrunning this print environment.\n\n343\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.720\nAnd shellshock is a big one right?\n\n344\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.890\nAlmost a lot of Linux systems\nare vulnerable- It has to do with bash,\n\n345\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.930\nand messing around with the environment of\nvariables, and it's a tricky one to even\n\n346\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.830\npatch against, cause it has so\nmany ways you can take advantage of it.\n\n347\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.120\nWhat else?\n\n348\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.852\n&gt;&gt; The one right there, that one.\n\n349\n00:20:06.852 --> 00:20:09.032\n&gt;&gt; Config-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] maybe variable.\n\n350\n00:20:09.032 --> 00:20:10.250\nPCP reveals sensitive information.\n\n351\n00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.700\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; It\n\n352\n00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.340\nmight contain specific query strains.\n\n353\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.656\n&gt;&gt; There you go. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Let's\ngo take a look at that one.\n\n354\n00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:23.420\nShowing me a lot of the authors,\nmodule authors.\n\n355\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.700\nBut, there might be other\nthings that I can do, right?\n\n356\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is just saying with this\n\n357\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.080\nparticular string, look what it spits out.\n\n358\n00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.380\nThey just added a parameter.\n\n359\n00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.670\nThey said, hey, if you hit this IP\naddress with this particular parameter,\n\n360\n00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.710\nquestion mark equals PHP,\nVA blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n361\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.440\nYou can get it to spit\nout this information.\n\n362\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.390\nYou might go out there, and\nfind on the web that there's\n\n363\n00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.820\nother strings I can dump in here,\nto cause it to do other things.\n\n364\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.370\nOr spit out different information.\n\n365\n00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.610\nIn fact, you can see a few different\nones that it's coming up with\n\n366\n00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.120\nsaying that this string would also work.\n\n367\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.956\nAlthough, those look like the same,\ndon't they?\n\n368\n00:20:58.956 --> 00:21:01.357\n879008, yeah.\n\n369\n00:21:01.357 --> 00:21:02.139\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the same.\n\n370\n00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:02.780\n&gt;&gt; Those are pretty much the same.\n\n371\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.700\nService status is showing up.\n\n372\n00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:14.310\nAgain, some more shell shock, or that\nprinting environment, sxs type attacks.\n\n373\n00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.880\n&gt;&gt; There's one where some of\nthe default scripts were not removed,\n\n374\n00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.900\nthat should of been.\n\n375\n00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and default scripts typically\ngive you a lot of set up information.\n\n376\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.079\nSo all in all, that's the way Nikto works,\nif you just point it to your web server,\n\n377\n00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:31.287\ngive it your port number, if you need\nspecify anything other than 80, and\n\n378\n00:21:31.287 --> 00:21:31.910\nlet it go.\n\n379\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.021\nAnd then you have a lot of,\nhopefully you don't, right?\n\n380\n00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:36.898\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If this is your web server,\n\n381\n00:21:36.898 --> 00:21:39.727\nhopefully you don't have as\nmany results to go through.\n\n382\n00:21:39.727 --> 00:21:45.416\nBut if you're doing penetration testing,\nand the more results you get,\n\n383\n00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:49.453\nthe more things I've gotta go through,\npossibly,\n\n384\n00:21:49.453 --> 00:21:54.700\npotentially the more ways in,\nI guess, I could take advantage of.\n\n385\n00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.190\nAll right, so that is a little bit\nabout Nikto and the way it works.\n\n386\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.500\nLike I said, it's pretty straightforward.\n\n387\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.990\nNow for the bad news.\n\n388\n00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.200\nBecause I've been working with Nikto for\na long time, and\n\n389\n00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.740\nit's always one of my go-tos.\n\n390\n00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.402\nAnd in fact, you're gonna see in other\nepisodes that other tools actually rely\n\n391\n00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:13.910\non, Nikto to do some of\nthe vulnerability scanning.\n\n392\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:18.241\nBut the bad news is, that the people\nthat were supporting Nikto,\n\n393\n00:22:18.241 --> 00:22:21.730\nthat wrote it, founded it,\nhave stopped, right?\n\n394\n00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.801\nBack in April at the time of this,\nit was April of 2016.\n\n395\n00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:29.543\nSo at the time of this shooting is\njust over a year where they decided,\n\n396\n00:22:29.543 --> 00:22:32.136\nthey said hey,\nwe can't get any more support.\n\n397\n00:22:32.136 --> 00:22:34.720\nOr we're not getting enough\nsupport from the community.\n\n398\n00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.400\nTherefore, we're gonna\nshut our project down, and\n\n399\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.450\nwe have no plans to bring it back.\n\n400\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.279\nThey still maintain a blog,\nthat you can go take a look at.\n\n401\n00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.900\nBut unfortunately, and I kept waiting.\n\n402\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.350\nI was like, somebody is gonna pick\nthis up and go, man this is so\n\n403\n00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.490\ngood, we really need to keep this going.\n\n404\n00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.480\nIt hasn't happened yet.\n\n405\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.847\nSo unfortunately, I think it\nmight be going away from us soon,\n\n406\n00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:05.536\nthe founders and staff of the OSVDB,\nactually now have a company.\n\n407\n00:23:05.536 --> 00:23:10.050\nOr they're part of a company know as RBS,\nRisk-based security.\n\n408\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.670\nThey have a database known as VulnDB.\n\n409\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.275\nIt's a commercial paid product, so\nthey're not coming back, all right?\n\n410\n00:23:16.275 --> 00:23:18.240\n[LAUGH] They're now making money,\nwhich, hey, good for them.\n\n411\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.520\nMore power to them.\n\n412\n00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.100\nI understand, but\nit is sad that the OSVDB is no longer.\n\n413\n00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.780\nBecause a tool like Nikto,\nand Nikto uses the OSVDB\n\n414\n00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.620\nto figure out what exploits to look for,\nand to map back to those numbers.\n\n415\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.600\nThe problem is now that database\nis no longer being updated.\n\n416\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.011\nSo, the information that\nNicTool is looking for,\n\n417\n00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:44.945\nthe known vulnerabilities that it's trying\nto find, is no longer being updated.\n\n418\n00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:47.593\nSomebody hopefully will\nredirect that to one of\n\n419\n00:23:47.593 --> 00:23:51.379\nthe many other databases that we\nhave out there, but as of now, no.\n\n420\n00:23:51.379 --> 00:23:55.171\nYou know what,\nI don't think I showed you that either.\n\n421\n00:23:55.171 --> 00:24:02.790\nThis OSVDB_3092 or let's find one,\nhere's that cgi-bin issue.\n\n422\n00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:08.000\nSo this number, this is what I would\nnormally have gone out and looked up.\n\n423\n00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.710\nSaid, let me go to the OSVDB, look up this\nnumber and find out a lot of information\n\n424\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.420\nabout that particular vulnerability,\nhow I might take advantage of it.\n\n425\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.800\nIf there are any known written\nexploits already that I could use.\n\n426\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.020\nBut if we try that now,\nlet's see what we can do, Ronnie.\n\n427\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.380\nWe'll go out and\nwe'll see that when we search for that.\n\n428\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.930\nWe can still find information, right?\n\n429\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.950\nHere's one that looks like,\nmaybe this one maps back.\n\n430\n00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:42.980\nLet's start with the first one,\nPentester Labs.\n\n431\n00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.610\nLooks like they have a little\narticle written up about\n\n432\n00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.950\nhow to take advantage of that\nparticular vulnerability.\n\n433\n00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.970\nAnd that's why,\n\n434\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.585\nif you're wondering why I'm doing\nan episode on Nikto, this is why.\n\n435\n00:24:53.585 --> 00:24:56.430\nCuz there is still good information\nout there, you can find it.\n\n436\n00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.387\nThere's a couple of projects\nthat people have started.\n\n437\n00:25:02.387 --> 00:25:03.763\nWhat was the link for the one?\n\n438\n00:25:03.763 --> 00:25:07.841\nThere's the HP://CVE\n\n439\n00:25:07.841 --> 00:25:16.186\ncommonvulnerabilitiesandexploit.minor.org.\n\n440\n00:25:16.186 --> 00:25:23.722\n&gt;&gt; This is a big one.\n&gt;&gt; /Data/refs/refmap/source.\n\n441\n00:25:23.722 --> 00:25:25.032\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not watching so\n\n442\n00:25:25.032 --> 00:25:26.431\nhopefully I'm not making any typos.\n\n443\n00:25:26.431 --> 00:25:31.944\nOsvdb.html.\n\n444\n00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.670\nAnd of course I missed it CDMI.\n\n445\n00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.027\nLet me just double check that,\n\n446\n00:25:40.027 --> 00:25:47.454\ndata refs, ref mapsource-OSVDB.\n\n447\n00:25:47.454 --> 00:25:52.460\nCVE.tree.org/data, all right.\n\n448\n00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.549\nLet me see if I can find,\nlet me just go back here.\n\n449\n00:25:58.243 --> 00:26:00.530\nWell, shoot.\n\n450\n00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.175\nI'll tell you what we'll do.\n\n451\n00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:04.870\nWe'll go about this a different way.\n\n452\n00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.470\nWe will take you out to\na couple of these links here.\n\n453\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.140\nBecause I really wanna show you this,\npardon me for\n\n454\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.980\nnot getting that link to\nwork on that guy over there.\n\n455\n00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.340\nBut we'll cheat and\nwe'll go this way, hopefully,\n\n456\n00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:23.330\nI typed it in right here on my notes.\n\n457\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.980\nAnd there we go.\n\n458\n00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.490\nBecause the CVE is still out there and\nstill being updated.\n\n459\n00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.210\nAnd so what somebody has done\nis taken the time to map\n\n460\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.660\nthe OSVDB numbers over to CVE numbers,\nall right?\n\n461\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.580\nSo if you do a search and you can't\nfind a link, you can come in here and\n\n462\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.060\nmaybe find that OSVDB number and\nmap it over to the CVE number.\n\n463\n00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:51.370\nAnd the CVE number's just another\nvulnerability database that we can use.\n\n464\n00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.740\nSo like I was saying,\n\n465\n00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.340\nthat's kinda why I still wanted to show\nyou NIKTO, is because we can still use it.\n\n466\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.004\nIt's still a go to tool for\nthe time being.\n\n467\n00:26:59.004 --> 00:27:01.841\nSome other vulnerability databases,\nthough,\n\n468\n00:27:01.841 --> 00:27:06.350\nthat you might want to map information\nfrom when we can't find those OSVDBs.\n\n469\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:12.321\nRapid7, great people out\nthere have a vulnerability\n\n470\n00:27:12.321 --> 00:27:18.047\ndatabase rapid7.com/db/search, all right?\n\n471\n00:27:18.047 --> 00:27:21.673\nAnd they have their vulnerability and\nexploit database,\n\n472\n00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:25.390\nI don't know if it will let me and\nthat's not what I wanted.\n\n473\n00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.982\nWhat was that number, Ronnie?\n\n474\n00:27:26.982 --> 00:27:32.656\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do not remember now.\n\n475\n00:27:32.656 --> 00:27:35.324\nOSVDB 3233, so we might, and\n\n476\n00:27:35.324 --> 00:27:39.377\nI'm just going to flip back\nover to my machine here.\n\n477\n00:27:39.377 --> 00:27:45.745\nOSVDB 3233, let's just see if they-\n\n478\n00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.257\nAnd that is not the same exploit.\n\n479\n00:27:56.257 --> 00:28:00.670\nSo that didn't really work searching for\nthe OSVDB number through Rapid7.\n\n480\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.737\nBut from the information that I\ngot from the OSVDB from Nikto,\n\n481\n00:28:05.737 --> 00:28:09.270\nright, it's a CGI/bin/printM issue.\n\n482\n00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.214\nWell, that's good information.\n\n483\n00:28:11.214 --> 00:28:16.259\nAnd I can still come over here and\nsay all right,\n\n484\n00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:21.303\nI wanna look for\na CGI bin issues and let's see if\n\n485\n00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:26.247\nwe can do print environment,\nand no results.\n\n486\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.880\nWe do have some info.\n\n487\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.390\nSo not the most efficient\nway to go about that.\n\n488\n00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:41.930\nMaybe I wanna look for ShellShock and see\nif I can go back in and find it this way.\n\n489\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:46.691\nI might be able to scroll down here and\nlook for one that deals with, there we go,\n\n490\n00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:47.486\nMod CGI bin.\n\n491\n00:28:47.486 --> 00:28:52.880\nThere's one for GHB client, so and\nI've got several pages to go through.\n\n492\n00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.570\nSo the point is, even though the OSVDB is\nnot there anymore, it's not available,\n\n493\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.430\nit's not being updated,\nthat information is still valid, right?\n\n494\n00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.720\nI can use that number to search,\n\n495\n00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.235\nI could use one of the other vulnerability\ndatabases based on the information that\n\n496\n00:29:08.235 --> 00:29:12.870\nit's giving back to find out maybe\nwhat exploit I can take advantage of.\n\n497\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.720\nAnother one, NIST has one.\n\n498\n00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.932\nThe National Vulnerability Database,\n\n499\n00:29:17.932 --> 00:29:22.753\nthey have a good, in fact,\nlet's go out to that one as well.\n\n500\n00:29:22.753 --> 00:29:23.820\nLet's take a peek there.\n\n501\n00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.613\nIs that NVD?\n\n502\n00:29:29.613 --> 00:29:35.632\nIs it .nist, yeah, .nist.gov.\n\n503\n00:29:35.632 --> 00:29:39.370\nAnd here we can go through and you can\nhit their vulnerability search engine.\n\n504\n00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.226\nI know that's really small.\n\n505\n00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:41.800\nOops, really small.\n\n506\n00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.590\nYou can hit their\nvulnerability search engines.\n\n507\n00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:48.630\nThis is a National Vulnerability Database,\nvulnerability search engine.\n\n508\n00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:54.750\nAnd maybe I wanna do a printn here.\n\n509\n00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.330\nAnd I can come through and maybe\nhopefully find some information that way.\n\n510\n00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.986\nSo Nikto, good tool,\n\n511\n00:29:59.986 --> 00:30:05.883\ngives me good information that's still\na good web app vulnerability scanner.\n\n512\n00:30:05.883 --> 00:30:10.520\nIt's just if it doesn't get\nfixed in the near future,\n\n513\n00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.710\nunfortunately, the information it feeds\nback is gonna be a little bit dated and\n\n514\n00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.120\nit's not gonna be all that useful, so.\n\n515\n00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.330\nThere you have it, Ronnie.\n\n516\n00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:20.547\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well,\neven though it's not updated anymore,\n\n517\n00:30:20.547 --> 00:30:24.696\nit at least gets you familiar with some of\nthe information that you're likely to see.\n\n518\n00:30:24.696 --> 00:30:27.543\nAnd because those databases\nare getting updated and\n\n519\n00:30:27.543 --> 00:30:32.200\nthere are new tools coming out, It doesn't\nmean just tossing out everything that you\n\n520\n00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.767\ncan learn from using Nikto.\n\n521\n00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:36.096\nIt will actually give you\nquite a bit of information,\n\n522\n00:30:36.096 --> 00:30:38.843\nespecially those vulnerabilities\nthat you're looking for,\n\n523\n00:30:38.843 --> 00:30:41.660\nand then maybe even help you to\nbe able to find more information.\n\n524\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.030\nBut, once again, Mike makes that\ngood point there's probably new\n\n525\n00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.540\ntools coming out, or\nif somebody picks this up,\n\n526\n00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.650\nit's gonna be a tool that you'll\nactually want to be familiar with.\n\n527\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.760\nThat's a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n528\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n529\n00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:06.503\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:08.501\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.437\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:14.910\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.960\nYou're watching the Kali Linux Show.\n\n8\n00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.500\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n9\n00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.030\ntoday we're actually gonna be\ntaking a look at Sparta basics.\n\n10\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.200\nAnd here to help us out and understand\nthat a little bit more of course\n\n11\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.540\nis gonna be Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.965\nMike, welcome back to the show and\nthis show is about what?\n\n13\n00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:37.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] They're gonna make\nme say it one way or the other.\n\n14\n00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.210\nThis is SPARTA.\n\n15\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.145\nThat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.380\n&gt;&gt; That's right, okay we go,\nwe got that out of the way.\n\n17\n00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.784\nYou almost have to right,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:45.465\n&gt;&gt; With a tool like this?\n\n19\n00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:49.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n[CROSSTALK] We've got to do anyways.\n\n20\n00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:53.553\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we are gonna be covering\nSparta today, this is another one of those\n\n21\n00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.050\nWeb applications vulnerability scanners,\nsort of.\n\n22\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.570\nWhen I say sort of,\nyou'll see what I mean here in a minute.\n\n23\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.500\nSparta is really conglomeration?\n\n24\n00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630\nThat maybe be the word, it's a collection\nit's a tool that runs a lot of tools.\n\n25\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.590\nIt's almost like a interface to manage\nmultiple tools, it's really what is is.\n\n26\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.240\nAnd it's very very cool, because\nthe thing is that the penetration tester,\n\n27\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.480\nI know I've got several things I wanna do,\nduring my different phases.\n\n28\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.737\nAnd when we get into that reconnaissance\nphase I'm gonna running end map,\n\n29\n00:01:26.737 --> 00:01:27.830\nI've gotta do my scans.\n\n30\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.350\nI'm gonna be running my NIC too,\ndoing my vulnerability scans.\n\n31\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.800\nI'm gonna be doing other\nthings that I do every time.\n\n32\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.350\nAnd a tool like SPARTA does that for me.\n\n33\n00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.890\nI go into SPARTA and\nsay this is the machine I want to probe.\n\n34\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.180\nAnd it will do a lot of those things and\nthen some,\n\n35\n00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.930\neven let us do some post-enumeration,\ndigging around,\n\n36\n00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.010\nlike brute forcing passwords,\nscreen shots, all kinds of great stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.570\nSo, let's take a look at SPARTA.\n\n38\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.590\nAll right, so\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n39\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.630\nIf we go down to our vulnerability\nanalysis, and there is SPARTA.\n\n40\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.880\nAnd when you launch SPARTA,\nit's actually a GUI interface.\n\n41\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.790\nYou'll see a command window open up in\nthe background, creating temporary files.\n\n42\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390\nLet's see if we can bump that up here,\nhere.\n\n43\n00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.720\nWordList was created, opened,\nput in this temp location.\n\n44\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.930\nAnother WordList created, opened,\none for usernames, one for\n\n45\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.240\npasswords in case we want to\nstart doing brute forcing.\n\n46\n00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.260\nAnd then loading up my settings file,\n\n47\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.240\nthe sparta.conf file which\nwe're gonna take a look at.\n\n48\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.910\nAnd then once it finishes doing that,\nwe have Sparta, all right.\n\n49\n00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.460\nLeave that window open in fact actually I\ndon't know if it will let you close it.\n\n50\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.607\nYup it just kills everything.\n\n51\n00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:47.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] [CROSSTALK]\nIt will let you close it.\n\n52\n00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.672\nBut we'll just open that back up again.\n\n53\n00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:53.760\nAll right, because and that was my point,\nif you close that you lose Sparta.\n\n54\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.505\nAll right [COUGH] so\nwe got this nice graphical interface and\n\n55\n00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.850\nyou can it's just a lot of blank\nwindows when you first come in here.\n\n56\n00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.190\nI guess probably the first\nthing I would like to do,\n\n57\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.620\nwe talked a little bit about Sparta.\n\n58\n00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.920\nIt runs multiple tools,\nit really simplifies.\n\n59\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.370\nThe goal of Sparta was to make it easier\non pen testers, because we know there's\n\n60\n00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.600\na lot of steps we need to go through,\nand this kinda helps me organize them.\n\n61\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.520\nAnd it's customizable,\nand it saves information.\n\n62\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.860\nAgain, you've heard me\nsay this several times,\n\n63\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.570\ntools that give me nice\noutput I really like.\n\n64\n00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.612\nBecause reporting is a big\nheart of any penetration test.\n\n65\n00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:38.117\nYou can't just go to somebody that\npaid you all that money and say,\n\n66\n00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.665\nyeah I found a bunch of vulnerabilities,\nyou guys are in trouble.\n\n67\n00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:43.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.280\n&gt;&gt; You gonna tell us what they are?\n\n69\n00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.360\nYou gonna tell us how to fix them?\n\n70\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.686\nI mean we need reports to prove that\nwe were there, that kind of thing.\n\n71\n00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:54.590\nAnd so, any tool like I said it\ngives reporting, it's great now,\n\n72\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.730\nbefore we dive in, actually I'm\ngonna close for about one more time.\n\n73\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.840\nCuz I do wanna show you\nthe configuration file.\n\n74\n00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.040\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\n75\n00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.670\nI'll bump this up but we bit here.\n\n76\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.580\nAnd we are gonna, let's do,\nwhat should we use today?\n\n77\n00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.890\nI always flip around\nbetween different ones.\n\n78\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.850\nWe'll do nano for this one.\n\n79\n00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.490\nSwitch user, switch share,\nSparta, not Sparta,\n\n80\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.180\nyeah it should be Sparta, there we go.\n\n81\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.309\nSparta and then sparta.conf.\n\n82\n00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:34.680\nAnd here is our configuration file,\nall right.\n\n83\n00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.270\nBecause the last point I was gonna make,\nI think I talked about simplifying\n\n84\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.760\ninformation gathering,\nwas that it 's part of this customisable.\n\n85\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.310\nAnd, when I say customisable,\nthere's a certain set of tools\n\n86\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.515\nthat SPARTA runs then give\ncapabilities that it exposes to me.\n\n87\n00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:49.905\nBut, I can change that.\n\n88\n00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:51.795\nWe can come in here and add our own tools.\n\n89\n00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:56.745\nIf I have a favorite tool that I use all\nthe time as part of my enumeration or\n\n90\n00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:01.167\nreconnaissance phase, Sparta doesn't run\nit all ready, I can tell Sparta to run.\n\n91\n00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.637\nI can come in here and\nmodify this conf file and say hey,\n\n92\n00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.157\nSparta, do this, do this.\n\n93\n00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:10.867\nThey do need to be non-interactive\ntype tools though, that is one thing.\n\n94\n00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:12.207\nBecause you're scripting it basically.\n\n95\n00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:14.130\nYou're saying hey, go run this tool.\n\n96\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.230\nWith this set of options against this\ntarget and feed me back the results.\n\n97\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.905\nIt's not gonna, any kind of tool\nthat prompts you for input and\n\n98\n00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.490\nthings like that it is\nnot gonna work here.\n\n99\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.470\nSo it can't run every tool.\n\n100\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.200\nBut you can add additional tools.\n\n101\n00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.460\nAnd we'll come back o that concept\nat the end I'll show us how to.\n\n102\n00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.580\nTo modify this to make this and\nmake it run a new tool, but\n\n103\n00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.990\nfor now what I wanted to show you was\na couple of options up here at the top,\n\n104\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.040\nunderneath my general settings,\nthere's two here and not those, that is\n\n105\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.290\nnot the ones I want wherever it goes\nhere,there we go right here these two.\n\n106\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.878\nIs that the ones I highlighted first?\n\n107\n00:05:50.878 --> 00:05:52.040\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then those were\n\n108\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.682\nthe options I wanted to point out to you.\n\n109\n00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:59.380\nEnable-scheduler=True,\nenable-scheduler-on-import=False.\n\n110\n00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.950\nWhat this is, is when you launch\nSparta and you add a target.\n\n111\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.340\nIt'll [INAUDIBLE] immediately,\nand then it goes to town.\n\n112\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.070\nAs soon as you click OK, and\n\n113\n00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.830\nadd that target, it starts scanning,\nstarts doing its thing.\n\n114\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.214\nAnd that's because of this line here,\nenable.schedulerTrue.\n\n115\n00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:19.175\nI'm gonna show you a way\nthat you can import targets,\n\n116\n00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:22.695\nrather than adding them from\nthe interface, you can import a file.\n\n117\n00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:25.605\nWhen you import them, it doesn't start.\n\n118\n00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:28.715\nAnd then I think, and this is just me\ntrying to put logic to their defaults,\n\n119\n00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:34.315\nthe file could have several, right\nsources, most likely does, or targets.\n\n120\n00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:37.385\nAnd you don't wanna just start scanning\nall of them at once, so it doesn't start.\n\n121\n00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.730\nIf you add one, it just boom,\nit goes to town.\n\n122\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.750\nSo if you don't like that,\n\n123\n00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.220\nwhich a lot of people don't,\nyou can change this to false.\n\n124\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.200\nAnd just simply come in here,\nchange that word true to false.\n\n125\n00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.730\nSave your configuration file, restart\nSparta, and it won't start automatically.\n\n126\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.494\nSo if you're one of those that doesn't\nlike that, just come in here and\n\n127\n00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:57.888\nchange that easy enough.\n\n128\n00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.130\nI will tell you that I have had\nissues with their Word lists.\n\n129\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.800\nAnd we'll come back to that in a minute,\n\n130\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.440\ngenerating the word list hasn't\nbeen working for me lately.\n\n131\n00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.270\nIt's easy to get around, but it would\nbe nice if I could get this fixed.\n\n132\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.068\nSo I will work on that.\n\n133\n00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:12.530\nAnd maybe I'll come back with an addendum\nto see if I can figure out what\n\n134\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.290\nthe bug was there.\n\n135\n00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.090\nLet's see what else, the rest of it I\nthink we'll wait, we'll come back to when\n\n136\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.180\nwe get to the configuration of Sparta\nitself, we're adding new tools.\n\n137\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.891\nAll right, so\n\n138\n00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:32.075\na couple of base configurations like I\nsay you might want to turn off that auto.\n\n139\n00:07:32.075 --> 00:07:33.710\nAll right, let's launch Sparta up again.\n\n140\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.430\nAnd now we'll go to town with this guy.\n\n141\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.780\nSo Sparta, there's three different ways\nreally that you could add your targets.\n\n142\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.700\nYou could see right here it says,\nHosts, click here to add host to scope.\n\n143\n00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.961\nIf I click there it opens up this little\nAdd Host to Scope dialogue box and\n\n144\n00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:53.818\nevidently you can't move it.\n\n145\n00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:57.687\nBecause it just moved my entire\napplication, so sorry about that.\n\n146\n00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:00.948\nAnd you would type in your IP address,\nand IP range.\n\n147\n00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.767\nAnd then right below that, it says\nrun nmap post discovery, run staged,\n\n148\n00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:07.580\nand map scan.\n\n149\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.300\nSo this is gonna do\nthe host discovery phase.\n\n150\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.200\nRemember nmap, we've done a show on that.\n\n151\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.604\nYou got your discovery phase.\n\n152\n00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:18.211\nAnd you've got your scan phase,\nit's gonna do the host discovery.\n\n153\n00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:20.618\nIf you give it a range of IP addresses,\n\n154\n00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:25.753\nyou've gotta figure out which ones are\nlive first and then do staged nmap scans.\n\n155\n00:08:25.753 --> 00:08:27.507\nFive stages that it's gonna go through,\n\n156\n00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.730\nI'll show you those in\nthe configuration file.\n\n157\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.310\nWe can easily modify those but\nthe stage does save a little bit of time.\n\n158\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.500\nIt can launch multiple threads,\n\n159\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.400\nwhereas if you uncheck that it's gonna\ndo all of it's endmap stuff as one.\n\n160\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.780\nAnd it slows it down a little bit.\n\n161\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.760\nAnd if I was to add an IP address\nhere which I will in a just a minute.\n\n162\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.560\nIt would start the tool up and\nwe'd get to going.\n\n163\n00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.610\nI'm gonna cancel that out,\nblow this back up.\n\n164\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:58.290\nShow you the other ways you can do file,\nadd host to scope, Ctrl+H.\n\n165\n00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.320\nSame dialogue box.\n\n166\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.750\nExciting, I know.\n\n167\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:06.950\nAnd then the other one is gonna be\nimport from endmap or import endmap.\n\n168\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.050\nNow there's an interesting option.\n\n169\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.530\nWe saw how we could do a ping sweep\nof a network with an mmap-sn.\n\n170\n00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.670\nSo not do the port scans,\njust do discovery on a network.\n\n171\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.320\nIt's gonna spit out a file or\nput it's output on screen.\n\n172\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.790\nIf we save that, what this is\nexpecting is an XML file from mmap,\n\n173\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:33.090\nwhich is one of our options that we can\nsave or output the -oX and your file name.\n\n174\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.050\nGives you an XML file, and\nthen you can turn around and import that.\n\n175\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.810\nIn fact, I believe I did save one for\nus, I lied.\n\n176\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.230\nBut we can make one really fast, right?\n\n177\n00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.880\nCuz we know how to do that\nfrom the previous episodes.\n\n178\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.941\nIf we wanted to do a little end map, -sn.\n\n179\n00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:59.388\nLet's do 10.10.1.0/240 And\n\n180\n00:09:59.388 --> 00:10:02.912\nwe'll do a little -ox.\n\n181\n00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:11.144\nAnd we'll call this nmap.xml.\n\n182\n00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.550\nAll right, we'll give it just a second.\n\n183\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.170\nIt'll run through, do it's ping sweep.\n\n184\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.220\nThere's only 255 possibles so\nit shouldn't take it to long.\n\n185\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.040\nAnd we'll have a list of hosts and\n\n186\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.770\nthen we can turn around and\nimport that into our SPARTA.\n\n187\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.140\nJust about done.\n\n188\n00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:32.410\nI'm not gonna use this because one of\nthese is my virtualized, default Gateway.\n\n189\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.850\nOne of them is the machine\nI'm sitting on now.\n\n190\n00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.530\nI would want to make a better list,\nbut just to show you.\n\n191\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.810\nNow that we have that XML file,\n\n192\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.760\nwe can go back over to Sparta and\ngo file, import nmap.\n\n193\n00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.800\nI can find my XML file, open that up.\n\n194\n00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.210\nAnd there's all the hosts from\nthat XML file, from that map scan.\n\n195\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.970\nBut notice that it does not start, right?\n\n196\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.280\nNothing actually started here.\n\n197\n00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.970\nAnd Ronnie, you know what's funny?\n\n198\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:07.510\nThe one thing I don't know\nhow to do is remove hosts.\n\n199\n00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.520\nNever actually tried that before,\ninteresting.\n\n200\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.294\nLet's see, viewers, show host,\nlet's see, yada yada yada, yada yada.\n\n201\n00:11:13.294 --> 00:11:19.548\nThe easiest way would be just to close\nthat out and start it back up again.\n\n202\n00:11:19.548 --> 00:11:21.124\nHow about that?\n\n203\n00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:23.324\nAll right, so a couple of different ways,\n\n204\n00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:27.820\nreally three different ways that we can\ngo about adding our host to start it up.\n\n205\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.790\nNow let's go ahead and run this tool so\nwe can get to the good stuff.\n\n206\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.250\nI just clicked here to add my scope.\n\n207\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.593\nI'm gonna do 10.10.1.103 which\nis my meta splitable machine.\n\n208\n00:11:37.593 --> 00:11:42.047\nI will leave the host discovery and\nthe staged Nmap checked, and\n\n209\n00:11:42.047 --> 00:11:46.930\nthen I'm gonna click Add to Scope,\nand it should immediately begin.\n\n210\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:52.290\nIt looks kinda odd at first, but\nit's gotta do that stage 1 the discovery,\n\n211\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.550\nlet me go over there and\nsee What this ip address is all about.\n\n212\n00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.930\nAll right, make sure it's live.\n\n213\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.558\nI can see,\nas soon as that stage one finished,\n\n214\n00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:05.196\neverything else starts\nkicking in all right.\n\n215\n00:12:05.196 --> 00:12:07.370\nAnd it's going to start\nrunning additional tools.\n\n216\n00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.560\nYou've got nmaps stage 2 going.\n\n217\n00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.820\nLooks like I've got nikto going and\n\n218\n00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.270\nI don't think I can zoom\ninto this guy unfortunately.\n\n219\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.970\nTell you what I can do,\nlet me, while that's running,\n\n220\n00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:24.360\ncuz it will take it a minute,\nI'll bump up my where is it?\n\n221\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.697\nUniversal access, and\nwe'll turn on my zoom, if I can.\n\n222\n00:12:32.916 --> 00:12:37.086\nAnd I forgot the keyboard shortcut for\nthat.\n\n223\n00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:42.030\nThat's gonna be a problem.\n\n224\n00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.130\nI forgot that keyboard shortcut.\n\n225\n00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.725\nAll right, it's fine.\n\n226\n00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:46.550\nYeah, so I'll tell you what.\n\n227\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.740\nWhile this is running I'll go ahead and\nwe'll take a timeout,\n\n228\n00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.389\nwe'll let this thing run, I'll get\nmy zoom up, and we'll be right back.\n\n229\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.760\nAll right, so we're back.\n\n230\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.520\nI fixed my zoom issue,\nand it almost finished.\n\n231\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.700\nWhat you'll see down here, let me zoom in\nfor you since we now have that capability.\n\n232\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.180\nAs it goes through these different phases,\nand\n\n233\n00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.900\nI'll zoom back out cuz I\nneed to scroll a little bit.\n\n234\n00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.990\nWe got all these different phases\nthat it's going through, right?\n\n235\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.620\nBasically what it's doing is\nnmap goes through it's stages.\n\n236\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.630\nIt's doing staged port scans,\nlike stage one is it's discovery.\n\n237\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.930\nStage two I think does some basic\nports and very common ports.\n\n238\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.890\nAnd once it finds some ports like\nthat because it's doing stage and\n\n239\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.380\nit finishes and\nreports that back to Sparta.\n\n240\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.370\nSparta can say port 80 web banner seen,\nlet me launch another tool.\n\n241\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.790\nAnd so across the top, you gonna see\nall this tabs have been popping up\n\n242\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:49.610\nas the scan was running and\nas we take a closer look at those, right.\n\n243\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.758\nI can see several Scripts,\nInformation, Notes, nikto,\n\n244\n00:13:53.758 --> 00:13:59.030\nsome Screenshots, smtp-enum-vrfy.\n\n245\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.440\nMy SQL default, postgress,\nthese are different ports that Nmap has\n\n246\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.390\nreported back, and then Sparta has\ndecided to launch another tool,\n\n247\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.490\nand run a little further analysis\non those ports, all right?\n\n248\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.630\nLet me zoom back out so\nyou can see that whole thing.\n\n249\n00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.140\nSo, let's start from the beginning and\nkinda see what we've got.\n\n250\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.071\nNow what I did to finish this off,\n\n251\n00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:29.059\nI killed it actually in\nstage five down here.\n\n252\n00:14:29.059 --> 00:14:32.634\nStage five, and I'll show you in\nthe configuration files when it starts\n\n253\n00:14:32.634 --> 00:14:36.793\nhitting a lot of those high ports that are\nnot commonly used, real world penetration\n\n254\n00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:40.940\ntest, I would definitely wanna let\nthis finish and hit all the ports.\n\n255\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.600\nFor our demo purposes, went ahead and\n\n256\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.780\nshut it down cuz I know it's already\nfound everything that it's going to find.\n\n257\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.740\nAll right, so now,\nwhat do we do with Sparta?\n\n258\n00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.750\nMany things, many, many things.\n\n259\n00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:58.440\nSo all of this is basically interactive\nlike on the host itself I can right-click.\n\n260\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.200\nAnd see I have the option,\nport scan, and I can do n map.\n\n261\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.212\nIt won't let me zoom when\nI got a context menu out.\n\n262\n00:15:08.212 --> 00:15:13.550\nThere's nmap top 1000, quick UDP,\nfull UDP, fast fast UDP.\n\n263\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.330\nStage which is what it's already done.\n\n264\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.740\nSo I really don't need this\ncontext menu in this case\n\n265\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.470\nbecause we use the click to add and\nit launched automatically.\n\n266\n00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.850\nBut if I had imported that\nlist of 100 different hosts,\n\n267\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.790\nI would have right clicked on the host\nI wanted to start a scan on and\n\n268\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.320\nI could begin one of those scans.\n\n269\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.470\nNow we have the host tab\nwhere I'm showing my targets.\n\n270\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.950\nWe also have a services tab.\n\n271\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.630\nThese are the services\nthat were discovered, and\n\n272\n00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.700\nI can see all these different services.\n\n273\n00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.067\nIf there were multiple hosts,\n\n274\n00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:49.448\nwhat this is showing me is FTP was\nfound on this particular IP address.\n\n275\n00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:53.007\nSo if there were multiple\nhosts in my list, my targets,\n\n276\n00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:57.779\nI could see which machines were running\nFTP, which machines that I had in my\n\n277\n00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.669\nlist were running HTTP or\nrlogin or whatever the case may be.\n\n278\n00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:06.467\nSo we can look at it either way, by host\nand all the services that are on that host\n\n279\n00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:11.157\nOr by service, and all the hosts that\nare running that particular service.\n\n280\n00:16:11.157 --> 00:16:14.580\nAll right and each one of these, right?\n\n281\n00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.190\nI can right click on FTP,\nrun end map scripts on port, grab banner.\n\n282\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:25.790\nIf I right click grab banner,\nit's actually gonna launch another task.\n\n283\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.430\nWhere'd it go, banner, 2121?\n\n284\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.230\nAnd if I look back at my host,\n\n285\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.990\nthere's gonna be a new tab where I just\ntold that, hey go get the banner for FTP.\n\n286\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.840\nInstall two FTP ports, so I hit 21 and\nthere's the banner grab for that.\n\n287\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.630\nAnd I saw 2121 is also FTP.\n\n288\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.350\nAnd it grab the banner for that So\n\n289\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.680\nit just pops open new tabs for\neach task that you give it.\n\n290\n00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.600\nAnd I will simply right click on FTP and\ngrab banner.\n\n291\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.000\nIf I didn't need both of those I could\nhave selected it out here and grab banner.\n\n292\n00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.700\nAnd then it would just do\nthat one particular port.\n\n293\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.840\nBut look at these other options,\nOpen with Telnet.\n\n294\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.630\nWell, heck, let's try it.\n\n295\n00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:13.384\nAnd it's telling me there's PSFOTV, we can\ntake advantage of that in another episode.\n\n296\n00:17:13.384 --> 00:17:18.770\nAll right and\nnow we can launch a terminal from there,\n\n297\n00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.770\nwe can open up a Netcat,\nan FTP client send to Brute.\n\n298\n00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.950\nWe'll come back and\ntake a look at a couple of these.\n\n299\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.820\nCheck for the default FTP credentials.\n\n300\n00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.670\nAll right, and we can keep going down\nthrough the list of services and\n\n301\n00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:38.010\nthen for Tools, we can see which ones\nat Run like I did banner manually.\n\n302\n00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.070\nAnd there's the results.\n\n303\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.800\nWe've seen this output, we ran this\nscan from a Shell when we ran right?\n\n304\n00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.590\nWell, I could have just\nstarted with Sparta,\n\n305\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.599\nand now never actually launched\nmanually cuz it's gonna run it for me.\n\n306\n00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.945\nAnd there is my output.\n\n307\n00:17:55.945 --> 00:18:00.490\nThere's also a screen shooter which\ntries to grab screen shot any\n\n308\n00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.100\ntime it finds an open\nport running web there.\n\n309\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.260\nSo I can see what I would see\nif I connected to that port.\n\n310\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.291\nAnd heck we can open that up in a browser.\n\n311\n00:18:11.446 --> 00:18:13.600\nNot that that's going to\nbe all that exciting.\n\n312\n00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.470\nWell, it should open up in a browser.\n\n313\n00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.140\nIt's thinking about it, there it goes.\n\n314\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.870\nAnd so maybe I wanted to get a look at\nwhat it looks like rendered in a browser.\n\n315\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.130\nAnd we can pop that open,\n\n316\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.750\nI can start clicking on links and\nseeing what we've got.\n\n317\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.910\nLet's go back over to host and\nlook at the tabs.\n\n318\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.600\nSo, a couple different tabs here that\nwe can use, organize it by host,\n\n319\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.190\norganize it by services,\norganize it by tools.\n\n320\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.450\nThat's really just organizing my output,\nall the same output,\n\n321\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.880\njust a different kinda pivot on that data.\n\n322\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.550\nNow, as we go through these\ntabs I can see from services,\n\n323\n00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.760\nI can again see this is\nbasically my Endmap output,\n\n324\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.850\nall of the ports it found that were open,\nwhat it's seeing for a name,\n\n325\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.470\nand then doing it's versioning, the SV,\nand it's showing me what it's found.\n\n326\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.050\nAny one of these I can right-click on and\ntry to, depending on what it is,\n\n327\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.710\nopen with Telnet,\nopen with Netcat, send them Brute.\n\n328\n00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.890\nIf I've got some Endmap scripts,\nright, and I just click that.\n\n329\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.980\nAnd it's gonna look at all of the,\nwhat did I click on?\n\n330\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.020\nMetasploitable root shell?\n\n331\n00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.110\nI don't even know what scripts\nare available for that.\n\n332\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.450\nBut it is definitely running.\n\n333\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.490\nWe can see it down here.\n\n334\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.750\nIt just finished.\n\n335\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.860\nI should have a new tab.\n\n336\n00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.990\nIt did not pop open a new tab, so\n\n337\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.160\nit probably did not find\nanything running those.\n\n338\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.120\nThat was not the best one to click on.\n\n339\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.420\nAll right, but you know the point\nis again, all these tools tied in\n\n340\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.670\nto this one interface,\nScripts, Information.\n\n341\n00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.400\nThis is showing me information\nabout the target, 27 open ports.\n\n342\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.490\nI've got a place where I\ncan write my own notes.\n\n343\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.920\nLove that feature.\n\n344\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.720\nAnd then I've got tabs for\nthe different tools.\n\n345\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.540\nHere's NIC2, what it found on port 80.\n\n346\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.030\nThere's a screenshot of port 80.\n\n347\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.230\nAnd it found port 25 open.\n\n348\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.610\nSo it ran this script, smtp-user-enum.\n\n349\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.010\nTo see if we could enumerate\nany users via that SMTP.\n\n350\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.508\nAnd it used a UNIX users.txt.\n\n351\n00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:06.370\n[COUGH].\n\n352\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:11.630\nIt doesn't look like it found\nanything there, zero results, okay.\n\n353\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.110\nBut we didn't modify what\nword list it's using.\n\n354\n00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.270\nAnd we definitely can go back and\ntweak little bit.\n\n355\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.960\nOr we could just try to brute force it,\nwhich we'll do in a minute.\n\n356\n00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.160\nThen we go here and MySQL default.\n\n357\n00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.630\nAnd here I can actually see,\n\n358\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.890\nreduce number of task cuz MySQL\ndoesn't like parallel connections.\n\n359\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:36.030\nAnd it found one,\none valid password found, login root.\n\n360\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.480\nAnd then there's no password listed It's\nactually because the password is blank.\n\n361\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.200\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n362\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.630\n&gt;&gt; So\nit found one blank password on MySQL.\n\n363\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:45.850\n&gt;&gt; That's awesome.\n\n364\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Very little work, right?\n\n365\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.180\nAs a penetration tester, this is doing\na lot of the heavy lifting for me.\n\n366\n00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.000\nAnd this is just default configuration,\n\n367\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.660\nwe haven't tweaked it with custom\nword lists or anything like that.\n\n368\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.080\nGo over to Postgres,\nI got zero passwords found there.\n\n369\n00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.170\nAnd honestly like I said,\na lot of this is because I'm\n\n370\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.540\nhaving some issues getting it\nto use the right word list.\n\n371\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.240\nBut, we'll come back to\nthat in another episode.\n\n372\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.790\nThere I found one for postgress SQL,\nlogin anonymous password.\n\n373\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:14.510\n&gt;&gt; Anonymous?\n\n374\n00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.110\n&gt;&gt; Valid pair found.\n\n375\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.030\nAt this point.\n\n376\n00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:20.740\nWhen was that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n377\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.450\nSo we could go over to service lets go and\n\n378\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.870\nind [INAUDIBLE] let's\nright click on this guy.\n\n379\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.810\nLet's see if can open that [INAUDIBLE].\n\n380\n00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.470\nAnd not really gonna show me what I want,\nbut, at this point we should be able to\n\n381\n00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.500\nfire up the utility that can\n[INAUDIBLE] and connect.\n\n382\n00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.810\nWhat else do I want to show you here?\n\n383\n00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:52.300\nSo as we go through there, FTP found\na password there, one valid pair found.\n\n384\n00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:57.710\nAgain that was the anonymous.\n\n385\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.130\n2121 didn't find anything.\n\n386\n00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:04.370\nThere's a screenshot that actually\ndoesn't look like it worked.\n\n387\n00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:05.840\nThere's port 80 180.\n\n388\n00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.004\nAnd Matt found that there was more http\nports open so it fired up [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n389\n00:22:11.004 --> 00:22:13.940\nscanned those guys then we're\ngetting our screen shots and\n\n390\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.650\nour banners that we did earlier.\n\n391\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.460\nSo again that is [INAUDIBLE]\nright out of the box.\n\n392\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.040\nJust giving it the IP address and\nletting it do its thing and\n\n393\n00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.990\nwe've got so pretty good information.\n\n394\n00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.050\nNow At this point another thing\nwe might try to do is if we go\n\n395\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:37.190\nto host here, and\nlet's see what we want to try.\n\n396\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.980\nThat one, it found a valid password,\nthat one it did.\n\n397\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.860\nWhat's one that it didn't?\n\n398\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.600\nSMTP, I guess what I want to show\nyou here is if I go to Services and\n\n399\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.890\nlet's do postgres again.\n\n400\n00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.359\nWe're gonna right click on this.\n\n401\n00:22:52.969 --> 00:22:54.290\nData found.\n\n402\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:59.150\nAnd I wanna click Send To Brute because\nthis is another cool feature of\n\n403\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.280\nis the ability to do brute\nforce from within this tool.\n\n404\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.300\nSo if I send to Brute, you'll see\nthere's a tab up here called Brute.\n\n405\n00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.210\nAnd I could simply just go to that tab but\nit's kinda nice that I can right click,\n\n406\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.630\nSend To Brute If I go over to I\nshould not have a tab opened up\n\n407\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.350\nwith whatever it was I just\nright click on, right?\n\n408\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.870\nThere's the IP address,\nthe port number and the post script.\n\n409\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.450\nNow granted, it already found those guys.\n\n410\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.190\nLet's just go ahead and\nrun it and see what it does.\n\n411\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.840\nFiles for log is empty, blah, blah, blah.\n\n412\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.680\nYeah, this is telling me my usernames and\npasswords file is blank.\n\n413\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.810\nSo a couple of the options here\nthat I do want to point out.\n\n414\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.600\nI'll zoom in here real quick for us here.\n\n415\n00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.960\nYou can see try blank password,\n\n416\n00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.020\ntry login as password,\nloop around users, exit on first valid.\n\n417\n00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:52.410\nLoop around users try every combination\nof user and password in your files.\n\n418\n00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.669\nExit on first valid,\ndon't keep trying if you find a login,\n\n419\n00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:58.032\nyou might not want to do that.\n\n420\n00:23:58.032 --> 00:24:00.294\nYou might want verbose output and\n\n421\n00:24:00.294 --> 00:24:05.963\nyou can specify some additional options if\nyou need to from the command line there.\n\n422\n00:24:05.963 --> 00:24:09.268\nAll right, but\nnormally what I'm doing is I'm adding.\n\n423\n00:24:09.268 --> 00:24:11.710\nWhoops, sorry, it's jumping around on me.\n\n424\n00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.376\nLet's browse.\n\n425\n00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:15.440\nAnd I made a real quick little word list.\n\n426\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.080\nAnd I'm gonna have to zoom out,\nsorry guys and gals,\n\n427\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.170\nwe're gonna zoom out to\nbe able to focus on this.\n\n428\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.510\nThis defaults to that word list location.\n\n429\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.640\nAnd FastTrack's a good one,\nrock you is a great one.\n\n430\n00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.930\nBut there's a lot of words in there and\nit'll take a long time to run through.\n\n431\n00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.686\nSo just for an example,\nI made a real small one.\n\n432\n00:24:33.686 --> 00:24:36.147\nWordlist.txt, just has a few in there.\n\n433\n00:24:36.147 --> 00:24:38.140\nI'm gonna go ahead and open that up.\n\n434\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.820\nSo I'm just pointing it to\nwherever my dictionary file is.\n\n435\n00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:46.260\nIn this case, I'm using the same file for\nuser names and passwords, but\n\n436\n00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.100\nI could definitely have different ones for\nthat.\n\n437\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.460\nAnd I'm gonna do a whole little section\non creating word lists, I think,\n\n438\n00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.820\nbecause that's something\nthat I do wanna talk about.\n\n439\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.190\nAnd we usually wanna make our own.\n\n440\n00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:01.040\nWe can find a lot out there, but\nthe smaller and more refined you can\n\n441\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.038\nget that word list, the more success,\nand the quicker your success will be.\n\n442\n00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.810\nSo there is a little bit of\ntechnique we can apply to that.\n\n443\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.858\nBut here, I just find those guys.\n\n444\n00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:12.820\nI'll click Run, and\n\n445\n00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.530\nit is going to go through the process\nof trying to brute force that attack.\n\n446\n00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.490\nAnd in this case, zero were found.\n\n447\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.769\nSo evidently I don't have\nthe right words on my list.\n\n448\n00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.960\nBut it tried 120 log-ins.\n\n449\n00:25:28.707 --> 00:25:31.409\nHonestly, I thought I put\nthe right one in there, but\n\n450\n00:25:31.409 --> 00:25:33.870\nmaybe I did not in my word list.\n\n451\n00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:34.849\nBut that is how we go.\n\n452\n00:25:34.849 --> 00:25:37.490\nOr this is SSH, let's try that one.\n\n453\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.470\nLet's use that same Word file so\nit'll be really quick.\n\n454\n00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.100\nWe'll just open that up.\n\n455\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.778\nAnd I can probably just type in here\nfaster than I can browse for it.\n\n456\n00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:57.400\nIf I could type, maybe it would\nbe faster to actually browse.\n\n457\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.320\nAnd we'll run that one.\n\n458\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.500\nThe host is not in scope.\n\n459\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.070\nYeah, I got the wrong IP address up here.\n\n460\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.900\nWhat was that,10.10.1.103.\n\n461\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.022\nThis tab was already open, it's not\none that I right-clicked and said,\n\n462\n00:26:10.022 --> 00:26:10.895\nSend to Brute.\n\n463\n00:26:10.895 --> 00:26:14.860\nSo I don't even know if this\nguy is running on that port.\n\n464\n00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.392\nLooks like he is.\n\n465\n00:26:16.392 --> 00:26:18.176\nAll right, so it's going through and\n\n466\n00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:22.410\nit's trying the different combination of\nwords that are located in those files.\n\n467\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.184\nAnd it's gonna see,\ndoes not support password authentication.\n\n468\n00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:27.245\nAll right,\nlet's see if we can change that up.\n\n469\n00:26:27.245 --> 00:26:30.060\n21 was anonymous.\n\n470\n00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.370\nAnd I don't think I have\nthat in my word list.\n\n471\n00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.990\nI'll try to make another port that had\na password that we might try to crack.\n\n472\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.505\nI guess it's really, like I say we'll do\na, and there's one we can do that one.\n\n473\n00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:43.328\nOr did we just do that one?\n\n474\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:45.641\nI can't remember.\n\n475\n00:26:45.641 --> 00:26:49.701\nNo, we did we didn't do MySQL.\n\n476\n00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:51.384\nSo I come over here, there's a new tab.\n\n477\n00:26:51.384 --> 00:26:53.713\nIt's got all the ports already filled in.\n\n478\n00:26:53.713 --> 00:26:57.683\nWe can do our browse again,\ngrab those Word files.\n\n479\n00:27:03.551 --> 00:27:05.570\nAnd run that guy and see what it is.\n\n480\n00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.950\nAnd the point is, again,\nnotice what it's using, though.\n\n481\n00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:09.872\nI guess that's really what\nI want to point out here.\n\n482\n00:27:09.872 --> 00:27:14.050\nTHC Hydra, one of our favorite\npassword cracking utilities.\n\n483\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:18.200\nWell, Sparta is reaching out,\ngrabbing that tool, running it.\n\n484\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.820\nIt's got its own command in there to run\nit, pointing it towards our Word files.\n\n485\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.086\nAnd you can see, I think it'll show me\nsome of the options that it's doing.\n\n486\n00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:28.200\nNo, it's not showing them there.\n\n487\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.160\nBut it's using another tool\nthat's built into Kali to\n\n488\n00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.240\ntry to brute force those passwords.\n\n489\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.880\nAgain, all from this one interface.\n\n490\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:43.230\nI think that's the big key to Sparta\nis Sparta itself is not doing this.\n\n491\n00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.990\nSparta is bringing all these tools\ntogether and running them for us.\n\n492\n00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.630\nAnd allowing me to schedule them,\ncreate these tasks,\n\n493\n00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:55.270\nbrute force passwords, automate a lot\nof the routine tasks that I'm gonna\n\n494\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:28:00.110\nhave to go through as I\ndo my penetration test.\n\n495\n00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.160\nNow we do have a little bit more,\nRonnie, but\n\n496\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.300\nI know you're giving me that look which\nusually tells me we are low on time.\n\n497\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, Mike, well,\n\n498\n00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:12.910\nthank you again for helping us to\nunderstand this particular tool on Sparta.\n\n499\n00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:18.040\nAnd how incredible it is that it actually\ndoes run multiple different tests for us.\n\n500\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.219\nGiving us this one ability through this\nsingle interface to actually have a lot of\n\n501\n00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:26.830\ninformation show up and to be able to take\nadvantage of that information as well.\n\n502\n00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.412\nBut there is more to come,\nso this is a great place for\n\n503\n00:28:29.412 --> 00:28:31.380\nus to end this episode, then.\n\n504\n00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.166\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n505\n00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:35.976\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike

00:00:08.289\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.137\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.325\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:18.010\nYou're watching the Kali Linux Show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today,\n\n8\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.960\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nhow we can generate word lists.\n\n9\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.920\nAnd here to help us out, it's gonna be Mr.\nSecurity himself, Mike Rodrick.\n\n10\n00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.530\nMike, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.290\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.720\nGlad to be here, excited as always.\n\n13\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.345\nAnd yeah,\nword list is the topic of the day, right?\n\n14\n00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:41.578\nAnd in a previous episode,\nwe had used a program, Sparta,\n\n15\n00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:43.794\nif you guys remember that one.\n\n16\n00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:50.371\nAnd at one point, Ronnie,\nwe had to browse and find a word list.\n\n17\n00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:55.413\nAnd if we remember, that word list was\nwhat we used to try to brute force or\n\n18\n00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:57.450\nto crack a password.\n\n19\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.080\nAnd so\n\n20\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.420\nthat's what I wanna talk about today is,\nwhere do those word lists come from?\n\n21\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.347\nWhat are they?\n\n22\n00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.010\nWhat can we do with them?\n\n23\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.910\nThings like that.\n\n24\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.900\nAnd now Mike, as we get started here,\nlet's talk about that specifically,\n\n25\n00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.110\nabout where they normally come from.\n\n26\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.429\nNow, in the previous episode,\nyou did generate a very short word list.\n\n27\n00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.879\nI don't know if it was like four or\nfive, even five words long or so.\n\n28\n00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.993\nAnd that will work for\nthe example that we did, but when\n\n29\n00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:26.744\nwe start hearing about the idea of people\nusing these, it normally is much longer.\n\n30\n00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:30.512\nAnd so, is someone actually,\nthey're going, let me go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:33.030\ntype out these 10,000 words, Mike.\n\n32\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, typically not.\n\n33\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.860\nI mean, I guess maybe somebody at\nsome point probably started that way.\n\n34\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.510\nBut there's definitely\nmuch better ways to do it.\n\n35\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.200\nSo let's define what a word list is,\ncuz you pointed out that the other day,\n\n36\n00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.360\nI created one myself,\non the fly here on the screen.\n\n37\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.610\nAnd because a word list or dictionary\nfile, right, you might hear this term\n\n38\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.620\ndictionary file, is simply a text\nfile with one word on each line.\n\n39\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.670\nAnd each one of those words\nrepresents a guess, if you will,\n\n40\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.950\nthat I'm going to make at what\nsomebody's password might be or\n\n41\n00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.070\nsomething that we're\ngonna try as a password.\n\n42\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.545\nSo when it comes to a dictionary file or\na word list, it's simply a text file.\n\n43\n00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:19.480\nSo you could open up nanovim,\nwhatever you wanted, Notepad on Windows.\n\n44\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.873\nAnd you could write one word on each line\nthat you thought their password might\n\n45\n00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:28.840\nbe or that you wanted to try and then feed\nthat into your password cracking utility.\n\n46\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.570\nAnd it would do just that.\n\n47\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.990\nIt would start with the first word,\ntry it.\n\n48\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.660\nIf it works, great.\n\n49\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.510\nIf it doesn't, move on to the next one.\n\n50\n00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.810\nTry that one.\n\n51\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.318\nNow, obviously, me typing up that list,\n\n52\n00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:41.580\nlike Ronnie was saying in our little demo,\nI knew what the password was.\n\n53\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.425\nAnd I just wanted a few more passwords\nto make it do a little bit of work.\n\n54\n00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.935\nBut I didn't want it to take very long,\nand\n\n55\n00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:49.125\nI wanted it to actually\nfinish the process.\n\n56\n00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.852\nSo I did just that.\n\n57\n00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:53.311\nI opened up a little text file,\nput one word on each line,\n\n58\n00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:55.355\none of them being the right password.\n\n59\n00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.161\nAnd we were good to go.\n\n60\n00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:59.835\nAll right, but typically,\nthat's not gonna work.\n\n61\n00:02:59.835 --> 00:03:05.042\nAnd in a PIN test, in a security audit\nin your organization, you're gonna\n\n62\n00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:10.596\nneed an actual word list that has a good\nrepresentation of possible passwords.\n\n63\n00:03:10.596 --> 00:03:16.070\nSo the key then is, where do I get these\nword lists or these dictionary files?\n\n64\n00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.760\nDo I obtain them, do I make them,\nwhat is the best way to go about it?\n\n65\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.360\nBecause I myself, years ago,\n\n66\n00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.530\nhad this idea that the bigger my\nword list was, the better off I was.\n\n67\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.320\nI was gonna go out and find every single\nword list that other people had created or\n\n68\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.070\nwhat have you.\n\n69\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.550\nAnd I'm gonna start\nputting them together and\n\n70\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.430\nend up with this monster file that has\nthousands and thousands of words in it.\n\n71\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.600\nAnd that's gonna be my\nmaster dictionary file.\n\n72\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.504\nThe problem with that logic is that\nsome of those words are more likely,\n\n73\n00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:54.860\nsome of them are less likely\nto be somebody's password.\n\n74\n00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.584\nAnd to go through a list of\nhundreds of thousands of words,\n\n75\n00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:01.706\nit is gonna take some processing power and\ntime.\n\n76\n00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:04.890\nTime is the big one there.\n\n77\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.290\nThe longer the word list, the more options\nand more words are in there, obviously,\n\n78\n00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.740\nthe longer it's gonna\ntake to go through that.\n\n79\n00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.030\nSo when we think about a word list,\nyes, we want a lot of words,\n\n80\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.690\nwe need a lot of possibilities.\n\n81\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.810\nBut we wanna make sure we're approaching\nit in a smart or thoughtful manner.\n\n82\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.070\nWe don't wanna just take the Webster's\ndictionary from A to Z and\n\n83\n00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.980\nput that in a word file and use that.\n\n84\n00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.920\nBecause some of those\nwords that start with\n\n85\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.640\nA are not likely to be their passwords.\n\n86\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.780\nSome of those words that\nstart with T might be, right?\n\n87\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.440\nI'd love to have those up\nat the front of the list.\n\n88\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.084\nThe idea is to get this word list\nset up in a way that the most likely\n\n89\n00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:46.560\npasswords are tried first,\nthe less likely are tried later.\n\n90\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.460\nWe'll talk about it, maybe in this\nepisode, maybe in another one,\n\n91\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.280\nhow we can kind of think about\nthat process and sort these.\n\n92\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.170\nBut I wanna eliminate where I\nwanna keep my word list refined.\n\n93\n00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.910\nThat's the key is, I don't want just\nevery single possible word in there.\n\n94\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.010\nI want a good set of possibilities.\n\n95\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.490\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, you say that, but if I can\nactually say it, when we talk about brute\n\n96\n00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.500\nforce password attacks, isn't the goal to\nactually get every possible combination?\n\n97\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.240\nSo why not try that,\nbesides the idea of efficiency?\n\n98\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.580\n&gt;&gt; It's a little confusing\nwith the terminology there.\n\n99\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.740\nWhen we talk about password attacks,\n\n100\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.290\nwe really refer to typically\nthree major types.\n\n101\n00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.386\nWe've got dictionary attacks,\nwhere we're going through a word list, and\n\n102\n00:05:29.386 --> 00:05:30.969\nwe're just trying every single word.\n\n103\n00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.770\nAnd if the password is not in the list,\nit's not gonna be cracked, right?\n\n104\n00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.030\nThe only thing it's trying\nare those words in the list.\n\n105\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.035\nIt's not getting creative or\ndoing anything else.\n\n106\n00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:43.770\nYou've got brute force attacks, where you\nare trying every possible combination,\n\n107\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.590\nAAA, AAB, AAC,\nall the way up to ZZZ, right?\n\n108\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.440\nThat's a brute force attack on a password.\n\n109\n00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.145\nBut you will hear people\nreferring to brute forcing FTP.\n\n110\n00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:57.825\nBut what they're really doing\nis a dictionary attack,\n\n111\n00:05:57.825 --> 00:05:59.600\nfiring words against that service.\n\n112\n00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.740\nSo they're using a dictionary\nattack to brute force the service,\n\n113\n00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.250\nbut it's still a dictionary attack on\nthe password, so be careful with that.\n\n114\n00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.347\nBrute forcing takes a lot of power,\na lot of computational power,\n\n115\n00:06:13.347 --> 00:06:16.269\nand just a tremendous amount of time.\n\n116\n00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:20.910\nAnd usually, what we're trying\nto do is find the balance there.\n\n117\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.130\nYes, brute forcing is\nguaranteed successful, right?\n\n118\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.680\nYou're gonna try every possible\ncombination of letter, number, and\n\n119\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.370\nspecial character that's there.\n\n120\n00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.590\nSo eventually, you will get that password.\n\n121\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.975\nNow it might be in a month.\n\n122\n00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.569\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It might be in 3,000 years, right,\n\n123\n00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:36.334\nto go through.\n\n124\n00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:39.285\nIf you've got a ten character password,\nthe length of time,\n\n125\n00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:41.690\nit's not even feasible for\na single generation.\n\n126\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.080\nYou'd have to pass the job down\nto additional generations, right?\n\n127\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.636\nSo while brute forcing can break\nevery password, the problem is,\n\n128\n00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:53.090\nis it's not feasible,\nat least with today's technology.\n\n129\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.240\nYou've got the key spaces or\nspaces that are too large.\n\n130\n00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.410\nWe can't get through all the possibilities\nin a reasonable amount of time.\n\n131\n00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.970\nAnd that's where dictionary attacks come\nin, because we can put a little smartness,\n\n132\n00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.520\nright, a little intelligence\ninto our attack.\n\n133\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.073\nWe can say we know human behavior,\nall right?\n\n134\n00:07:09.073 --> 00:07:12.342\nWe know the way people think and\nact and do.\n\n135\n00:07:12.342 --> 00:07:15.310\nAnd so we can use that to our advantage.\n\n136\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.510\nWe also have a lot of examples.\n\n137\n00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.840\nAll those data breaches\nthat you hear about,\n\n138\n00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.410\nwhen Yahoo gives up millions\nof accounts or Target or\n\n139\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.180\nwhomever the latest victim is, that\ninformation typically gets out, right,\n\n140\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.760\nthe data that was breached,\nthat gets sold or what have you.\n\n141\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.380\nEventually, security professionals\nwould get a hold of that information,\n\n142\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.600\nthat database of those hashes.\n\n143\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.350\nAnd then we sit there, and\nwe try to break those passwords.\n\n144\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.530\nAnd then we start to see,\nwhat are the most common words?\n\n145\n00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.578\nThat's a great sampling, all right.\n\n146\n00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:52.182\nIf you've got a million accounts, and you\ncan figure out what those passwords are,\n\n147\n00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:54.544\nand you're not worried about\nsecurity at this point.\n\n148\n00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:56.095\nBecause those people have been notified,\n\n149\n00:07:56.095 --> 00:07:57.998\nthey've changed their\npassword after the breach.\n\n150\n00:07:57.998 --> 00:07:59.758\nWe're not trying to get\ninto their accounts.\n\n151\n00:07:59.758 --> 00:08:02.528\nWhat we're doing is we're using this for\nresearch.\n\n152\n00:08:02.528 --> 00:08:06.128\nWe're saying okay, this is the way\nmost people set up passwords.\n\n153\n00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:11.350\nAnd we start to see patterns, cause while\nwe think that we are being creative and\n\n154\n00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.780\ndoing something unique with our password,\nwe're not.\n\n155\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.300\nThey're humans following the same\npatterns and it's very easy to detect.\n\n156\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.140\nEspecially when you got that large\nnumber of research data if you will,\n\n157\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.320\nfrom those breaches.\n\n158\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.300\nWith that being said, kinda going\nback to your original question,\n\n159\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.970\ndo we just type out a word on each line?\n\n160\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.250\nYes and no, right?\n\n161\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:41.580\nWe do type out words on each line but\nwe're using intelligence to create that.\n\n162\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.240\nBut somebody did have to.\n\n163\n00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.210\nNow, there's other things we can do.\n\n164\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.510\nAnd I will get to how we can\nkind of manipulate that stuff.\n\n165\n00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.400\nBut in Kali Linux,\nthere are several word lists\n\n166\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.050\navailable to us already, so\nwe don't even have to create anything.\n\n167\n00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.740\nThe only reason I've done it in\na couple of shows is to kind of\n\n168\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.820\nspeed up the process, but we have\nseveral word lists built into Kali.\n\n169\n00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.040\nMost programs like John the Ripper,\nthese password trackers, Hydra,\n\n170\n00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.260\nthings like that, a lot of them\ncome with their own word lists.\n\n171\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.230\nAnd they've done some research and\n\n172\n00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.510\nthey think their word list is\noptimized for working, all right.\n\n173\n00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.490\nSo let's take a look at where we can\nfind those word lists in Kali and\n\n174\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.550\nlook at the different\nones that are available.\n\n175\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:33.320\nSo I'm gonna open up Shell, and\nlet me bump that size up just a wee bit.\n\n176\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.910\nAnd here we're gonna go to\nuser share word list and\n\n177\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.840\nI'm just gonna do a little listing.\n\n178\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.220\nWhoops, let's just do a LS on this one,\nall right?\n\n179\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.230\nLet's clear that screen and\nget that back up to the top.\n\n180\n00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:54.640\nAll right, so in word list, I'll see a few\ndirectories and a few lists themselves.\n\n181\n00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.697\nLike sqlmap.txt, if we cat that.\n\n182\n00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:03.070\nAll right, there you see it going by.\n\n183\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.070\nIt's simply a list of words,\none on each line.\n\n184\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.890\nAnd then SQL Map is a program\nthat'll work with SQL Injection and\n\n185\n00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.900\nstart brute forcing directories.\n\n186\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.500\nSo some of these are more\ngeared towards directory names,\n\n187\n00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.798\nrather than user names and/or passwords.\n\n188\n00:10:20.798 --> 00:10:24.970\nAll right, let's take a peek\nat another one, FastTrack.\n\n189\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.590\nFastTrack is a very popular word list.\n\n190\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.030\nMost of these lists are optimized or\nthey are, they're\n\n191\n00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:36.420\nnot just random words that somebody\npicked and put together in word list.\n\n192\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.050\nThese are, I can't remember where\nFastTrack came from and I can't type and\n\n193\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.749\ntalk at the same time, I wanna cat this.\n\n194\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.300\nAll right, this is a pretty short one.\n\n195\n00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.340\nBut a lot of these are geared towards,\nagain I don't know.\n\n196\n00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.970\nThis is not my fave, cuz all of these\nspring and summer 2015 yada, yada.\n\n197\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.910\nI actually have added quite a few things\nto this list just to use it as an example\n\n198\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.920\nin some shows because it's so short.\n\n199\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.950\nThe one that seems to be everybody's\nfavorite and the reason is because\n\n200\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.898\nof the success they've had with\ncracking passwords is the rockyou.\n\n201\n00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:17.630\nAll right, rockyou.txt over there it\nis zipped up, and I need to unzip that.\n\n202\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.630\nSo all right, so let's unpack this cuz\nyou can see it's compressed right now.\n\n203\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:28.265\nSo we'll do a little gzip-d\nhere rockyou.txt and\n\n204\n00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:31.155\nwe'll extract that out.\n\n205\n00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:34.194\nAnd now I've got my rockyou.text.\n\n206\n00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.596\nLet's cat that one.\n\n207\n00:11:37.643 --> 00:11:40.170\nAll right, and\nyou can see that it is a long one.\n\n208\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.060\nI don't know if you can see as it is\nscrolling by, one thing I want you to\n\n209\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.340\nnotice is it is slightly alphabetical but\nit is not completely alphabetical.\n\n210\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.490\nIt is not sorted A to Z and that's because\nthey have done their optimization and\n\n211\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.730\nsome of the more successful are up\ntowards the front of the list.\n\n212\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:04.540\nI am going to kill this,\ncuz it's gonna go on for a little while.\n\n213\n00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.360\nIn fact, let's do a on this guy and\nsee if we can see rockyou.txt.\n\n214\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.473\n&gt;&gt; That's a big file.\n\n215\n00:12:09.473 --> 00:12:11.435\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was trying to see my size.\n\n216\n00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:12.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right there.\n\n217\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.112\n&gt;&gt; 134 Megabytes in size and\nfor a text file.\n\n218\n00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:17.708\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty big.\n\n219\n00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:18.239\n&gt;&gt; That's a pretty good size.\n\n220\n00:12:18.239 --> 00:12:19.436\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right?\n\n221\n00:12:19.436 --> 00:12:23.620\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's one that a lot of people will use.\n\n222\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.265\nOther ones in here like\nDirBuster if we go inside Dir or\n\n223\n00:12:28.265 --> 00:12:33.450\nDirBuster, there's even\nmore lists in here, right?\n\n224\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:40.200\nThere's big, there's common, extensions\nis another one, small, mutation, Spanish.\n\n225\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.900\nAgain, all kinds of word lists that\nwe have available within Kali.\n\n226\n00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.620\nSo this is usually where I\ntell people to start, right?\n\n227\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.880\nYou can't go wrong with using some\nof these, rock you is a great one.\n\n228\n00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.770\nSome of the ones in DirBusters are great\nif you're doing that kind of attack on\n\n229\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.475\na web server.\n\n230\n00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.650\nIf you're trying to\nbrute force directories,\n\n231\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.270\nthose are really geared more towards\ndirectories like known directories and\n\n232\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.090\nApache and other web servers and\nthings like that.\n\n233\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.560\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Mike you had mentioned\nthat even though this is a great\n\n234\n00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.280\nplace to start, most of us that end up\nworking in this industry that we're in,\n\n235\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.650\nwe tend of course end up finding ourselves\nin our own specialized vocabulary for\n\n236\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.520\nthe industry, whether you're in\nthe medical industry, legal, or\n\n237\n00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.220\nif you're like us in the IT industry.\n\n238\n00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.820\nWe use acronyms like crazy, so if I needed\nto actually do something like that,\n\n239\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.480\nI don't think these word\nlists are really designed for\n\n240\n00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.280\nsomething that I might be specifically\ntargeting, let's say a company.\n\n241\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.550\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n242\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nit's a great way to start.\n\n243\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.370\nIf I'm tasked with Pinterest-ing an\norganization, one of the first things I'm\n\n244\n00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:48.350\ngoing to wanna do is create a word list\nthat I can use to attack some passwords\n\n245\n00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.330\nbut I want to make sure I'm using\nwords that are industry specific.\n\n246\n00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.860\nLike I might start with rock you.\n\n247\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.810\nBut I'm probably gonna add to that\nsome industry-specific terms,\n\n248\n00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.440\ncuz we do find that users tend to do that.\n\n249\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.930\nYou work in a IT department,\nyou use IT-related terms in your password.\n\n250\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:12.890\nYou work in a medical field and you use\nmedical terms as part of your password.\n\n251\n00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:17.440\nAnd so what you're alluding to there,\nRonnie, is how can I get a word\n\n252\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.610\nlist that's maybe geared towards the\nmedical profession or the IT profession?\n\n253\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:26.460\nAnd Kali has a tool called cewl,\nwhich is pretty cool.\n\n254\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.100\nIt's spelled cewl, that does just that.\n\n255\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.300\nIt's basically a website crawler.\n\n256\n00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.970\nIt will go out, I point it to a URL and\nI give it a few options.\n\n257\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.461\nWe'll talk about these\noptions in a minute.\n\n258\n00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:40.560\nAnd it'll scour that web page and\npull back words and\n\n259\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.830\ncreate a word list from what it finds\nlooking at the code on those web pages.\n\n260\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.430\nThe HTML that shows up,\nthe text that appears on the web page,\n\n261\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.540\nthe alt descriptions for\nimages, and things like that.\n\n262\n00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.560\nIt can pull all of that or\nscour through all of that and grab words.\n\n263\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.550\nSo let's take a look at\ncreating something like that.\n\n264\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.880\nAgain, cewl is the program.\n\n265\n00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.060\nIf I don't give it any arguments, it just\nsays, you need to give me some arguments.\n\n266\n00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.050\nSo I'm gonna do a little --help.\n\n267\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.880\nAnd we'll take a look at a few of\nthe options that I want to point out.\n\n268\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.330\nNow, with this one again,\nit's pretty straight forward.\n\n269\n00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.090\nThe syntax is cewl.\n\n270\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.890\nAny options that you want, and then\nthe URL that you wanna spider, or crawl.\n\n271\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.200\nYou can see the help option.\n\n272\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.930\nThis one right here will turn\nout to be an important one.\n\n273\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.700\nDepth to spider.\n\n274\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.260\nThe default is two.\n\n275\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.910\nSo, if I don't put this option in there,\nwhat that means is that it's gonna go out,\n\n276\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:46.400\nlet's say I give it the target of ITProTV,\nand it hits ITProTV, links on ITProTV.\n\n277\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.970\nIt will follow those links and\nhit that webpage and scour it as well.\n\n278\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.990\nAnd then links on that second page,\nit will go out and hit as well, right?\n\n279\n00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:01.064\nSo it's gonna go one, two layers\ndeeper than the page that I gave it,\n\n280\n00:16:01.064 --> 00:16:03.086\nthe start page or the root.\n\n281\n00:16:03.086 --> 00:16:04.764\nAnd that's something you\nwanna be careful with.\n\n282\n00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:08.670\nLook at the site that you're getting ready\nto crawl, that you're gonna use CeWL on.\n\n283\n00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.270\nAre there dozens and dozens and\ndozens of links on there?\n\n284\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.810\nCuz I know one time I got the bright idea,\n\n285\n00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.170\njust go to the Wikipedia page for\na particular topic, and\n\n286\n00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.990\nthen I can get a whole bunch of terms\nspecific to that topic, and I was right.\n\n287\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.440\nThe problem is there's about 150 links\non that page down the sidebar and\n\n288\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.140\nthings like that that it's\ngonna try to follow, right.\n\n289\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.950\nSo I had to make sure I set my D0 so\n\n290\n00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:38.070\nthat it only pulled from that page,\nnot from anything beyond that, all right.\n\n291\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.840\nBut then again sometimes you do want it to\nspider, right, because if I go to a law\n\n292\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.440\npage that law page has links to\nother pages on their own site.\n\n293\n00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.830\nI wanna hit those.\n\n294\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.460\nThey might link to references,\nlaw references, or other law sites, and\n\n295\n00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.990\nthings like that.\n\n296\n00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.090\nSo I kinda want a spider in some cases.\n\n297\n00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.790\nIt's really something that\nyou have to play with.\n\n298\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.210\nBe on the safe side, start small,\nand if your list isn't big enough\n\n299\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.569\nadd a layer of depth and\nsee what you get back, all right.\n\n300\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.370\nThen you've got min word length.\n\n301\n00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.870\nAnd min word length, the default is\ngoing to be three if I don't specify.\n\n302\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:16.040\nAnd this means when I'm looking at\nthe words that I'm finding on this code,\n\n303\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.050\nhow long does it have to be before\nI consider it a possibility and\n\n304\n00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.160\ngrab that and scrape that word.\n\n305\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.060\nThree is pretty good, right, that's\ngonna avoid the word and, the, actually\n\n306\n00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.365\nI think that would include and and\nthe because the default is three minimum.\n\n307\n00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:35.020\nBut words like a and and, it,\nright, it wouldn't get those.\n\n308\n00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:40.200\nI typically bump this up to like seven,\n\n309\n00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.450\nbecause I figure most passwords are gonna\nbe at least seven characters in length.\n\n310\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.500\nSo I'll try somewhere around seven and\nsee what I get.\n\n311\n00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.680\nOr I can drop it down to five cuz I know\nsometimes people use combination of words,\n\n312\n00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.650\nand there's ways we can kind\nof plug words together.\n\n313\n00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.510\nSo a little bit more than\nthree is typically what I do.\n\n314\n00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.298\nBut again, it might be something that you\nrun, see what words that you get back,\n\n315\n00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:04.750\ndecide that you want to\nreduce that a little bit, and\n\n316\n00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.282\ncatch some of the shorter\nwords that are on that page.\n\n317\n00:18:07.282 --> 00:18:13.060\nAll right, so mean word length, definitely\nsomething that we wanna specify.\n\n318\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.330\nWhat else, off site, if it's going\nto a completely different domain,\n\n319\n00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.220\ndo you want it to follow that out, right?\n\n320\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.798\nYou can say a -o will allow that to follow\nlinks to other domains, other name spaces.\n\n321\n00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:28.400\nAnd in then the w, the write,\nthat's gonna be an important one.\n\n322\n00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.150\nWe wanna save the output to a file.\n\n323\n00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.620\nThat is our goal is to generate\nthat word list, right.\n\n324\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.830\nSo I definitely wanna write that out.\n\n325\n00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.340\nWhat else?\n\n326\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.018\nAnd those are really the only\nones that I like to start with.\n\n327\n00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:45.547\nSometimes the -c, what this will do\nis it will throw a count in there, so\n\n328\n00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:49.946\nyou'll see the word router and\nit'll have the number 17 beside it.\n\n329\n00:18:49.946 --> 00:18:53.599\nIt means it found that same\nword 17 times on that page,\n\n330\n00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.185\nmeans it's a more commonly used term.\n\n331\n00:18:56.185 --> 00:19:00.700\nNow does that correlate into a more\ncommonly used as a password?\n\n332\n00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.900\nI don't know, but maybe it helps you,\nmaybe it doesn't.\n\n333\n00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.520\nSo you can see a count on there as well.\n\n334\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.280\nIt has ways to dealing\nwith authentication.\n\n335\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.170\nIf we need to authenticate to that\nweb page before we're able to get\n\n336\n00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.820\naccess to it, as well as proxy,\nif we need to go through a proxy.\n\n337\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.170\nAnd then a verbose option or\nheader options,\n\n338\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:25.790\nif we want to pass in header information\nor if we want to give verbose outputs.\n\n339\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.160\nAnd then the URL is the site\nthat we are going to spider.\n\n340\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.080\nAll right, so lets take a look at how\nwe can use CeWL in the real world.\n\n341\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.510\nLets see if we can\ngenerate some word lists.\n\n342\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.290\nSo lets start with,\nwhy don't we use our own site, Ronnie?\n\n343\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.810\nLets go get some IT terms.\n\n344\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n345\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, lets do a minimum length,\nso -m of five, and\n\n346\n00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.120\nthen I've gotta give it my output.\n\n347\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:56.765\nSo I'm gonna write and\nI'm gonna call this CeWL_ITPROTV.\n\n348\n00:19:56.765 --> 00:20:00.799\nI don't know, it's just my own personal\nnaming conventions when I look at a bunch\n\n349\n00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.970\nof files I'll have CeWL this target,\nCeWL that target.\n\n350\n00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:04.950\nKind of keep them separate.\n\n351\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.110\nI'll put the -c in there so\nwe can see what it looks like.\n\n352\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:14.050\nI'll do the -v, and the -v,\nwhen we talk about being verbose it's not\n\n353\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.170\naffecting the file that I'm creating,\nit's affecting the output on the screen.\n\n354\n00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.530\nDo I wanna see what it's\ndoing while it's doing it or\n\n355\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:24.450\ndo I wanna just see a cursor\nblinking until it finishes, right?\n\n356\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.845\nSo I'll do a -v so we can see it and\n\n357\n00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:35.708\nthen we'll go into our\nURL https://www.itpro,\n\n358\n00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:38.846\nwhoops, .tv, all right?\n\n359\n00:20:38.846 --> 00:20:41.930\nAnd we'll hit Enter and\nwe'll let that run.\n\n360\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.020\nAnd that was not very verbose,\n\n361\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.630\nbut I'll do another one that's gonna\nbe a little more verbose on there.\n\n362\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.360\nOne of the things you'll notice it\nsays where it's starting at, right,\n\n363\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.770\nthat's the URL I provided, says it's\nvisiting it and it got a response code.\n\n364\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.210\nMeans it was able to talk to that URL and\n\n365\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.290\nis getting a page back that\nit's able to scour for words.\n\n366\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.560\nBelow that I'll see attribute text found.\n\n367\n00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.900\nThis is typically alternate text,\n\n368\n00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.610\ndescriptions of images,\nand things like that.\n\n369\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.670\nAnd it says writing words to file and\nthen I get my prompt.\n\n370\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.090\nSo let's see what we got.\n\n371\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.510\nWe'll cat that file out and\nthere's my word list, right.\n\n372\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.110\nSo I can see the word login,\nit found five different times.\n\n373\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.350\nStudio, Google,\ndo we see anything CeWL here?\n\n374\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:35.530\nI don't know what Quantcast is actually,\nactivate, noscript, so.\n\n375\n00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.090\nYeah, this one, maybe or maybe not.\n\n376\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.730\nIt does give you some words but\nnothing really IT specific.\n\n377\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.170\nI might be better off\ntrying to find a page that,\n\n378\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.850\nlike if I went to one of our episodes-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n379\n00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.430\n&gt;&gt; And had the transcript on there where\nRonnie's using all those Cisco terms and\n\n380\n00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.980\ntalking about that switching and routing.\n\n381\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.660\nThat might be a better page to scour,\nall right.\n\n382\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.190\nBut it worked.\n\n383\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.090\nI mean it was able to create a word list\nand you can see the count out there.\n\n384\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:10.600\nThe count will probably throw off most\nof your utilities that you feed this\n\n385\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.210\nfile into.\n\n386\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.810\nSo this won't be my actual dictionary\nfile, I need to come in here and\n\n387\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.990\ntidy this up.\n\n388\n00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:21.110\nAnd what I'm gonna do is remove some of\nthe words that I don't want to be there.\n\n389\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.800\nOr just copy out some of the words\nI wanna add to another word list.\n\n390\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.170\nOr I could run it without the count and\nthen just go ahead and\n\n391\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.770\ndelete some of the words from it.\n\n392\n00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:30.710\nAll right, let's try another one.\n\n393\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.630\nLet's see if we can get some\nmedical terms going on here.\n\n394\n00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.220\nI'm just gonna bring this command back,\nand we'll change up our URL.\n\n395\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.470\nLet's try, I know a good one,\nwww.webmd.com, I think it's a dot\n\n396\n00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.460\ncom site.\n\n397\n00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.292\nAnd let's change my file name.\n\n398\n00:22:52.292 --> 00:22:54.040\nWe don't want to overwrite that.\n\n399\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.490\nIt will overwrite,\nit will not append, it'll overwrite.\n\n400\n00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.010\nSo change that unless you're\nusing a generic name and\n\n401\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.880\nyou just wanna overwrite it.\n\n402\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.850\nAll right, otherwise I'll use the same\noptions, five characters minimum length.\n\n403\n00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.740\nAnd let's take the count,\nwe'll leave the count in there for\n\n404\n00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.420\nnow it's kind of fun to see.\n\n405\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.070\nAll right, and we'll let that go.\n\n406\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.070\nAnd you'll see that there's a lot more\ninformation going across my screen\n\n407\n00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.820\nas we spider this site, all right.\n\n408\n00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.300\nAnd that's because there's links.\n\n409\n00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.220\nWe left this on the default of two, so\nthere's a lot more links on this site.\n\n410\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.700\nAnd as this is scrolling, let me see\nif I can get it to stop scrolling for\n\n411\n00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.260\na second, there we go.\n\n412\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.717\nYou can see visiting\nWebMD/baby/guide/taking-medicine-during-p-\n\n413\n00:23:35.717 --> 00:23:41.880\nregnancy, so you can see that's my\ntwo two, one, two, three, right.\n\n414\n00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.150\nSo yeah, three, which was our default.\n\n415\n00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.180\nOne, two, and\nthree levels deep I've referred from, and\n\n416\n00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.050\nthen this attribute text, Logo for webMD.\n\n417\n00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:56.053\nIf you're a web designer you've probably\nrealized, okay, that's their alt text for\n\n418\n00:23:56.053 --> 00:23:59.372\nscreen readers for their image,\nright, or a placeholder in that code.\n\n419\n00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:02.480\nAnd you see words like Ultrasound,\nyeah, that's a good one.\n\n420\n00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.540\nPregnant, that's maybe one that doesn't\nshow up in my normal list here.\n\n421\n00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.273\nSad dog and guacamole.\n\n422\n00:24:11.273 --> 00:24:14.588\n[LAUGH] Now, these words are obviously\nnot together on the webpage,\n\n423\n00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:16.990\nthey're just showing up together here.\n\n424\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.740\nBut hey guacamole is maybe a word\nthat I didn't have in there.\n\n425\n00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.710\nWhy are we getting guacamole and\nburrito from WebMD?\n\n426\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.045\nLet's see, this is vitamins and\n\n427\n00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:26.960\nsupplements/ss/slideshow vitamins\nminerals overview.\n\n428\n00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.083\nSo it's probably talking about where\nsome of these vitamins come from or\n\n429\n00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:33.180\nfood that I can eat that's strong,\nhigh in these vitamins.\n\n430\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.240\nAnd again, that's the alt text.\n\n431\n00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.375\nBut in the meantime, as we've been going,\nmy scroll bar is still going.\n\n432\n00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:41.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I probably should've dropped that down\n\n433\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.776\na little bit on the depth.\n\n434\n00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:45.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a big site.\n\n435\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.130\nYeah, you know what,\nlet's go ahead and kill it.\n\n436\n00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.219\nWe'll do a Ctrl+C, And\nlet's see if it generated anything.\n\n437\n00:24:55.011 --> 00:25:00.840\nThat was WebMD and yeah, by killing it in\nthe middle of the process, it's stopped.\n\n438\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.763\nSo let's run that one more time,\nbut let's add, Well,\n\n439\n00:25:06.763 --> 00:25:12.082\nlet's do a little -d 1, we'll let\nit go one deep and see how it goes.\n\n440\n00:25:12.082 --> 00:25:15.690\nSo that'll be the main page, and\nthen one more level underneath that, and\n\n441\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.030\nwe'll let that roll for a second.\n\n442\n00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.868\nWe should be much better this time.\n\n443\n00:25:19.868 --> 00:25:21.470\nAnd again this might be too much.\n\n444\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.920\nI really should do what I say,\nstart with zero, saying hey,\n\n445\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.350\nstart with one page see what I get,\nand then move on from there.\n\n446\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.210\nWe'll let this go for a second.\n\n447\n00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.225\nSo again, the idea behind CeWL\nis that it's a great tool\n\n448\n00:25:37.225 --> 00:25:42.038\nthat we can use to go out and\ngrab words for a word list.\n\n449\n00:25:42.038 --> 00:25:45.676\nWe're basically creating our\nown custom word list, and\n\n450\n00:25:45.676 --> 00:25:47.658\nyou can go to any site you want.\n\n451\n00:25:47.658 --> 00:25:52.465\nSo if you're working with a medical\nbusiness that you're doing\n\n452\n00:25:52.465 --> 00:25:56.916\na pen-test form, if it's a law firm,\nyou can now go out and\n\n453\n00:25:56.916 --> 00:26:03.250\ncreate world lists custom for that job\nthat include industry specific terms.\n\n454\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.965\nCuz when you think about an employee's\nsitting there, they work for\n\n455\n00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:15.950\na law firm, or let's say you're a doctor\nand you need to change your password.\n\n456\n00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.031\nYou might look around and see your\nmedical books in there, open it up,\n\n457\n00:26:19.031 --> 00:26:20.137\ngrab one of those terms.\n\n458\n00:26:20.137 --> 00:26:23.865\nAnd say ha ha, nobody's gonna\never think of that password, and\n\n459\n00:26:23.865 --> 00:26:25.830\nuse that term as your password.\n\n460\n00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.155\nSo, that is the idea and\nRonnie, it is still going.\n\n461\n00:26:29.155 --> 00:26:31.756\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know what, let's try one more, and\n\n462\n00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.357\nwe'll just do that down to a d 0.\n\n463\n00:26:35.564 --> 00:26:38.211\nCuz I do want it to finish so\nthat we can actually see.\n\n464\n00:26:38.211 --> 00:26:42.740\nThere we go, that was much shorter,\nand so let's see what we've got now.\n\n465\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.229\nThat one's probably not much good since\nit was so short, but we'll find out.\n\n466\n00:26:49.938 --> 00:26:53.260\nSee what kind of great\nwords we've got in here.\n\n467\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.890\nBlood, pacemaker, that's a nice one.\n\n468\n00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.300\nHartley, I don't know what that means,\nmight be a name or\n\n469\n00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.340\nit might be a tool of some kind.\n\n470\n00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.785\nCholesterol.\n\n471\n00:27:03.785 --> 00:27:07.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see\n\n472\n00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.290\nsomeone using that for a password.\n\n473\n00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:15.072\nProstate, bringing, fingers, asthma,\nlet's get up to where we see.\n\n474\n00:27:15.072 --> 00:27:16.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You know,\n\n475\n00:27:16.918 --> 00:27:20.193\nover here we really,\n&gt;&gt; I think you're starting to reveal\n\n476\n00:27:20.193 --> 00:27:21.426\nmore of the words that you're picking out.\n\n477\n00:27:21.426 --> 00:27:23.772\n&gt;&gt; I know, right, this is what you use?\n\n478\n00:27:23.772 --> 00:27:27.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Diabetes, that's gonna be my password.\n\n479\n00:27:27.651 --> 00:27:29.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n480\n00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.220\n&gt;&gt; But, again the idea is that users\n\n481\n00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.320\nfollow patterns.\n\n482\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.470\nAnd we've seen evidence that they will\nuse terms because they gotta change\n\n483\n00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.470\ntheir password every 30 days, or 40 days,\nor whatever their password policy is.\n\n484\n00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.090\nAnd they've gotta come up with a new one,\nand hopefully we've got rules in place\n\n485\n00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.030\nthat prevent them from just\nappending a number to the end,\n\n486\n00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.290\nor using their name and their birthday.\n\n487\n00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.050\nSo, what are they gonna do?\n\n488\n00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.920\nThey think about whatever's on their desk,\nor the report they just read, or terms\n\n489\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.390\nthat are fresh in their mind, and they\nare typically industry specific terms.\n\n490\n00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:07.230\nThat is what we use CeWL for,\nthat is how we are going to generate\n\n491\n00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.800\na word list geared towards our\ntarget that we're trying to test.\n\n492\n00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.969\nAnd again, I wanna stress,\n\n493\n00:28:12.969 --> 00:28:17.040\nthat that's really what we're trying to\ndo when we talk about dictionary attacks.\n\n494\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.840\nI don't want just the biggest\ndictionary in the world,\n\n495\n00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.190\nI want the most refined\ndictionary out there.\n\n496\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.029\n&gt;&gt; All right Mike,\nwell thank you again for\n\n497\n00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:28.614\nhelping us to understand that concept and\nthat idea of generating word lists.\n\n498\n00:28:28.614 --> 00:28:33.152\nThat may really help us in our penetration\ntesting, not just the idea of having\n\n499\n00:28:33.152 --> 00:28:38.063\nthe most, but having the one that really\ndoes fit what we're actually looking for.\n\n500\n00:28:38.063 --> 00:28:40.853\nThe idea of refining that\nword list is pretty key.\n\n501\n00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:45.260\nAlso, being able to generate a customized\none is also gonna be key as well,\n\n502\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.980\nwhen the generic ones that you\nmay find that are prebuilt into\n\n503\n00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.780\nthe way that Kali Linux has\nall those tools in there.\n\n504\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.467\nAnd they may work the majority of times,\nbut\n\n505\n00:28:53.467 --> 00:28:55.161\nyou may have to do\nsomething more specific.\n\n506\n00:28:55.161 --> 00:28:57.947\nSo, remember that tool as well,\nthat we call CeWL.\n\n507\n00:28:57.947 --> 00:29:02.240\nSo it's kind of neat, but there's more\nto come as far as generating different\n\n508\n00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000\nword lists, but that is gonna be for\nanother episode then.\n\n509\n00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.360\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n510\n00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n511\n00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.172\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Kali Linux shows.\n\n512\n00:29:14.172 -->

from\n\n3\n00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:05.413\nSan Francisco, [CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:12.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.070\n&gt;&gt; Welcome, ladies and\n\n7\n00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.940\ngentlemen to your Kali Linux series,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.092\nIn this episode we'll be looking at\nJohn the Ripper to crack some passwords.\n\n9\n00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.138\nAnd back in studios with us today,\nwe have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:25.380\nMike Rodrick, how's it going today, Mike?\n\n11\n00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.620\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back, excited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.490\nAnd yeah, we took a look at a previous\nepisode, we talked a lot about dictionary\n\n13\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.420\nfiles, and\nhow we would use them to crack passwords.\n\n14\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.400\nNow, it's time to kind of\nget down to business and\n\n15\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.158\nactually look at cracking some passwords.\n\n16\n00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:44.991\nSo the tool of the day is going to be,\nas you said Cherokee, John the Ripper.\n\n17\n00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:50.265\nJohn the Ripper's a very popular password\ncracker, it's a command line utility\n\n18\n00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:55.018\nin Linux, although they do have a GUI\nversion out, called I think Jumbo.\n\n19\n00:00:55.018 --> 00:01:00.137\nBut we'll be sticking with the classic\nJohn the Ripper here from our shell.\n\n20\n00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:03.481\nSo the first thing we need to talk about,\nreally, when we look at John the Ripper,\n\n21\n00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.244\nwe've talked in the past about\ndifferent ways you go about cracking\n\n22\n00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:07.132\npasswords, right?\n\n23\n00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:11.786\nWe talked about dictionary attacks,\nwe talked about brute force attacks,\n\n24\n00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:15.210\nwe talked a little bit\nabout rainbow tables.\n\n25\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.028\nJohn the Ripper will do Word Lists,\nwhich is dictionary attacks, right,\n\n26\n00:01:20.028 --> 00:01:25.630\nit'll also do what we call Incremental,\nwell what John calls Incremental.\n\n27\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.822\nWhat most of the rest of us\nare gonna call brute force,\n\n28\n00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:31.301\nwhere we're just trying characters and\ncharacters and trying to go through there.\n\n29\n00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:34.661\nSo don't get confused when you look at\nJohn, and you look at the options, and\n\n30\n00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:38.455\nyou're looking at the modes, you don't see\nbrute force, they call it Incremental.\n\n31\n00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:44.574\nAnd then there's an interesting one that's\ncalled Single Crack, and Single Crack\n\n32\n00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:50.190\nis a really quick way to try to crack\na password using some basic information.\n\n33\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.151\nNo brute forcing, no word list,\nit actually looks at the user's\n\n34\n00:01:55.151 --> 00:02:00.400\nlogon information, and\nwhat's known as their GECOS information?\n\n35\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.888\nIn the-\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna need to explain this one.\n\n36\n00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.303\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n37\n00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:03.957\n&gt;&gt; It's a different one, right?\n\n38\n00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.955\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n39\n00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:09.545\n&gt;&gt; But GECOS is actually, it's a GECOS\nfield, which is in the properties of\n\n40\n00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.780\nthe user, I can't remember if it's\nin the shadow or a passwd file.\n\n41\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.210\nBut it's a field where we can\nstore information about a user,\n\n42\n00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.380\nlike their real name, their home\nphone number, and things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.720\nAnd what that mode does, that Single Crack\nmode, it says hey, a very common thing for\n\n44\n00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.296\nusers to do is to use\ntheir name [LAUGH] or\n\n45\n00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:31.500\ntheir own [LAUGH] information\nin their password.\n\n46\n00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.430\nSo let me try that first, let me go\nthrough and get their username and\n\n47\n00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.580\nall the information out\nof the GECOS field and\n\n48\n00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.630\nsee if they've used that\nas one of their passwords.\n\n49\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.876\nLike their birthdate, right, and\nthings like that, and that's known as\n\n50\n00:02:41.876 --> 00:02:45.599\nSingle Crack mode, it's typically a good\none to start with, it doesn't take long.\n\n51\n00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.093\nIt'll do a little bit of mangling I\nthink of that information, like plugging\n\n52\n00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.550\nthe name and the password, or not\nthe password, but the birthday in there.\n\n53\n00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.704\nAnd if they have used that basic\ninformation, then you can get it,\n\n54\n00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:01.190\nthen if you don't get it, you move onto\nyour dictionary or your brute force.\n\n55\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.820\n&gt;&gt; So what kind of systems or\naccounts are we looking at here,\n\n56\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.450\nwhen we're talking about\nthat GECOS metadata, Mike?\n\n57\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.115\nIs it something like integrated\nwith an operating system, or\n\n58\n00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:11.484\nare we talking about any kind\nof online user accounts?\n\n59\n00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:15.474\n&gt;&gt; Yeah no,\nthis would be like Linux users,\n\n60\n00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:20.470\nlike when we look at,\nin fact here we can pull up.\n\n61\n00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.370\nI don't think I have any information\nstored in that field, but let's do this,\n\n62\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.780\nlet's bump that up just a wee bit.\n\n63\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.389\nAnd if I cat out our switch etc switch,\nI wanna say is the passwd file.\n\n64\n00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:40.830\nYeah, in here, down here towards\nthe bottom, this is a typical user, right?\n\n65\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.827\nThis is Cherokee's user account, and\nthere is nothing in here currently, but\n\n66\n00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:48.820\nthat's where I could\nstore some information.\n\n67\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.913\nIn fact if we look at some of these\nbuilt-in accounts for services,\n\n68\n00:03:51.913 --> 00:03:53.640\nyou see like ARP Watcher?\n\n69\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.200\nWell the service is actually ARP Watch,\nbut\n\n70\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.060\nthe full name of\nthe service is ARP Watcher.\n\n71\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.150\nSo if we had filled in,\nif I had gone back,\n\n72\n00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.090\nI just made these accounts to play\naround with in our password cracking.\n\n73\n00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.630\nBut if I had filled in more information\nabout Ronnie, like his full name and\n\n74\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.890\nhis home address and\n\n75\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.860\nhis phone number, it would be stored\nright in between these two colons here.\n\n76\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.860\nAnd so what's gonna happen is,\nJohn's gonna go and\n\n77\n00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.170\ngrab their username, cuz a lot of people\nlike to use their username as passwords.\n\n78\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.370\nAnd then any information it\nfinds in the GECOS field, and\n\n79\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.300\nattempts some variations\nof that as their password.\n\n80\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.200\nSo it's similar to doing\na dictionary attack, but\n\n81\n00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.070\nyou're not pointing it at a file,\nyou're just saying,\n\n82\n00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.330\nhey, there's already information\nstored in my passwd file.\n\n83\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.810\nUse that and\nsee if it's part of their password, or\n\n84\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.020\nif it is their password,\nI should say, all right?\n\n85\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.880\nLike I said,\nin my case it wouldn't do any good,\n\n86\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.088\nbecause there is no\ninformation stored in there.\n\n87\n00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:51.093\nSo if your sysadmin hasn't\nfilled in those fields,\n\n88\n00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:54.662\nthen Single Crack mode really\nisn't going to do you any good.\n\n89\n00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:57.095\n&gt;&gt; So Mike would I be selecting\nthese types of modes, or\n\n90\n00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:00.390\nis this all happening at once,\nor what's the process happening?\n\n91\n00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.430\n&gt;&gt; Normally we would specify,\nwe would tell it what we want it to do.\n\n92\n00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.587\nIf we don't specify,\nJohn actually has a default order.\n\n93\n00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:10.695\nAnd it does try that Single Crack first,\nbecause the information's readily\n\n94\n00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:13.970\navailable from the file it\ncan just grab it and try it.\n\n95\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.170\nIf that doesn't work,\nit'll go on and do a word list,\n\n96\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.300\nJohn has a very basic word\nlist that comes with it.\n\n97\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.687\nTypically it's not enough words in there,\nbut at least it has one to try, and\n\n98\n00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:27.388\nit'll go through that mode.\n\n99\n00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:32.008\nAnd then if it fails, it doesn't crack\nall the passwords, it'll move on into\n\n100\n00:05:32.008 --> 00:05:36.820\nIncremental, and just start doing some\nbrute forcing on those passwords.\n\n101\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.880\nBut normally we want a little\nmore control over that.\n\n102\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.790\nSo we'll specify, like if I put the word\nlist option in my John command,\n\n103\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.020\nthen it's gonna use the word list,\nit's not gonna do Single Crack,\n\n104\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.810\nit's not gonna do Incremental.\n\n105\n00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.789\nSo you typically do specify in the command\nwhat mode you want to do, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.370\n&gt;&gt; Now, and I know I'm asking\na million questions here Mike.\n\n107\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.602\nBut when you mentioned that word list,\nis this something that comes pre-installed\n\n108\n00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:04.554\nwith John the Ripper, or can I pick some\ndictionaries and integrate those in?\n\n109\n00:06:04.554 --> 00:06:07.662\n&gt;&gt; Definitely gonna use dictionaries,\nlike we saw in our previous episode,\n\n110\n00:06:07.662 --> 00:06:10.340\nwe've got different ways we can\nbuild those dictionary files.\n\n111\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.941\nWe can use Cool, we can use Crunch,\nwe can build our own,\n\n112\n00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:16.505\nwhich is actually what I've done here.\n\n113\n00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:22.006\nAnd remember we talked about all\nthe built-in word lists that Kali already\n\n114\n00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:28.220\nhas right, if we go take a look at, what\nis that, switch user, share, word lists.\n\n115\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.060\nAnd we take a look in there,\nwe'll see there's several word lists, and\n\n116\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.700\nremember, inside the dir and DirBuster\nthere's additional word lists, so\n\n117\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.240\nthere's definitely some that we could use.\n\n118\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.640\nWhat I did, I've made a really simple\none that we're gonna use in here,\n\n119\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.390\njust to speed up the process.\n\n120\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.485\nIf I have a word list with 20,000 words,\n\n121\n00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:49.726\nit's gonna take us [LAUGH] a long time\nto go through and crack passwords.\n\n122\n00:06:49.726 --> 00:06:52.863\nAnd we don't wanna sit around\nhere on this show for hours and\n\n123\n00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:54.443\nhours watching that happen.\n\n124\n00:06:54.443 --> 00:06:55.218\n&gt;&gt; No we don't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:57.326\n&gt;&gt; So yeah I've got a little pass.list\n\n126\n00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:00.270\nfile, and\nwe'll take a look at it in a minute.\n\n127\n00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.110\nFirst we'll get surprised and\nsee if it cracks it, and\n\n128\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.180\nthen we'll take a look at that file.\n\n129\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.342\nSo I've made my own,\nremember how we talked about it, it's\n\n130\n00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:10.900\njust a simple text file, one word on each\nline, that it's going to rifle through.\n\n131\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.317\n&gt;&gt; So just right now,\nyou're trying to crack that root password,\n\n132\n00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:14.580\nthat's what we're doing here.\n\n133\n00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.555\n&gt;&gt; In this case, not root, but\nwe're trying to crack some passwords, or\n\n134\n00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:18.605\nany user that we can get.\n\n135\n00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:19.133\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n136\n00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:23.079\n&gt;&gt; Basically, all right, and normally yes,\nyou would want the root account.\n\n137\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.804\nI just made some accounts, cuz I don't\nwant to one, the root password on my\n\n138\n00:07:28.804 --> 00:07:33.401\nvirtual machine is very strong, so we're\nprobably not gonna crack it in the show.\n\n139\n00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.150\nAnd, [LAUGH] two,\nI don't want to expose that password,\n\n140\n00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.320\nI might use it in other places,\nwhich is not a good thing, right?\n\n141\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.031\nYeah, but I wanted to use some accounts\nthat had some simple passwords that\n\n142\n00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:42.815\nwe can show to crack.\n\n143\n00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:46.945\nCuz it's again,\nunfortunately password cracking is not\n\n144\n00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:50.220\nnearly as glamorous as\npeople wanna think right?\n\n145\n00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.605\nYou think about Mr.\nRobot or something like that.\n\n146\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:58.511\n&gt;&gt; It's always funny, Mike, in the movies\nit's like [SOUND] and then, a crack and\n\n147\n00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:02.084\nthen, you've entered, or\nsomething crazy like that on the screen.\n\n148\n00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:06.372\nBut really, in real life, it comes\ndown to processing power and time Yes.\n\n149\n00:08:06.372 --> 00:08:09.076\n&gt;&gt; And that's like your trade off here so\nsometimes it could take\n\n150\n00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:11.832\nextended periods depending on\nhow many iterations you have and\n\n151\n00:08:11.832 --> 00:08:14.490\nhow fast that processor is\nrunning those iterations right.\n\n152\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly and\n\n153\n00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.980\nlike here I'm in a virtual machine and\nI can go through a dictionary file.\n\n154\n00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.860\nThese guys will hit about with my\nset up seventeen hundred guesses per\n\n155\n00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.590\nsecond on a dictionary file.\n\n156\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.182\nSo they can go through seventeen hundred\nwords in a second, which is decent,\n\n157\n00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:35.100\nbut I'll show you will get in some brute\nforcing maybe not this episode but\n\n158\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.390\nin later episode.\n\n159\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.860\nAnd you'll see that one,\n\n160\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.710\nit warns me hey this is probably\nnot going to be a good thing.\n\n161\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.320\nIf your going to be doing\nbrute forcing you need GPU's.\n\n162\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.900\nYou want to optimize your system for that.\n\n163\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.700\nYou want graphical processor units that\nyou've got more than one most likely.\n\n164\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.380\nIf you get a single CPU,\nyou're not going to have much luck\n\n165\n00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.850\ndoing brute forcing on passwords\nover four character or so\n\n166\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.280\nbecause you get up to seven a characters\nand you will see on my virtual machine,\n\n167\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.870\nit's going to tell me, hey,\nit's going to take a long time to do, and\n\n168\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.280\ni think my computer\nmight melt before that.\n\n169\n00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.760\n[LAUGHS] You'll hear the fans kicking most\nlikely when i start that application.\n\n170\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.000\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I saw a joke.\n\n171\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.195\nIt was from one of the Red Lion guys,\nthey posted online.\n\n172\n00:09:15.195 --> 00:09:16.170\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So if our naming\n\n173\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.475\nconvention was first letter of\nfirst name and full last name.\n\n174\n00:09:20.475 --> 00:09:22.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; What would we do for Richard Oot?\n\n175\n00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.240\n&gt;&gt; Richard Oot.\n\n176\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.670\nThat would be a good one [LAUGH].\n\n177\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'd be an easy one to crack anyway\n\n178\n00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:28.983\n[LAUGH].\n\n179\n00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:31.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's get in, and what\n\n180\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.270\nI'm gonna do I think is we'll, first we'll\ngrab some hashes that we wanna crack.\n\n181\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.610\nI'll show you how to set these up so\n\n182\n00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.480\nthat we can crack them with John and\nwe'll do a basic dictionary attack.\n\n183\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.430\nAnd then I'm gonna show you how\nto add a couple rules in there.\n\n184\n00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.520\nIn previous episodes, we've talked\nabout rules and how rules allow us\n\n185\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.630\nto mangle a word list so our word list\ndoesn't have to be as long, right?\n\n186\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.960\nI can have the word password\nin my word list, but\n\n187\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.670\nif somebody's password is\npassword123 I won't get it.\n\n188\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.010\n&gt;&gt; And that's called mangling?\n\n189\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.630\n&gt;&gt; I call it mangling.\n\n190\n00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n191\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.045\nI'm like woo, hold on.\n\n192\n00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:04.632\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is the other term for it?\n\n193\n00:10:04.632 --> 00:10:09.730\nBut yeah, a lot of programs do call\nit mangling or hybrid attacks,\n\n194\n00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.230\nwhere you're taking a dictionary file and\nthe word password's in there and\n\n195\n00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.423\nthen you're kind of adding brute force\non the end of it, you try password one,\n\n196\n00:10:16.423 --> 00:10:20.145\ntry password two, try password one two,\ntry password one two three.\n\n197\n00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:23.500\nSo as part of its dictionary attack\nhere is a word from a file and\n\n198\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.180\npart of it is a brute force attack, try\nrandom characters appending to the end of\n\n199\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.390\nthat or the beginning, we're gonna\nappend or prepend or Substitute, right?\n\n200\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.770\nWe saw those rules in\nour previous episode.\n\n201\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.430\nSo let's do some basic cracking.\n\n202\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.550\nThe first thing I wanna do is\nactually go out and get some hashes.\n\n203\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.530\nNow, in modern day Linux systems\nwe got two separate files, right?\n\n204\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.720\nYou've got the passwd file,\nwhich has your user account information,\n\n205\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.510\nsome group information,\nthe GECOS field that we looked at.\n\n206\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.110\nAnd then the password have been moved to\na separate file, known as the shadow file.\n\n207\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.990\nJohn, we could use just the shadow\nfile and crack it with John.\n\n208\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.080\nIt would be fine with that.\n\n209\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.790\nBut you'd end up is these passwords, and\nyou wouldn't know what user account they\n\n210\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.886\ngo back to and you'd have to kind of\nrematch hashes and try to figure it out.\n\n211\n00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:16.700\nIf you feed John in the right format,\nuser, hash, it'll keep track of that.\n\n212\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.730\nAnd as it cracks them,\nit'll keep the user and\n\n213\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.450\nthe new pass word that it found,\nin tact and makes it a little bit easier.\n\n214\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.820\n&gt;&gt; So Mike, what would you say is\nthe best line of defense that we have\n\n215\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.930\nagainst tools like John the Ripper?\n\n216\n00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.320\nIs that shadow folder\nsomething we can encrypt, or\n\n217\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.140\nwould you just encourage long passwords?\n\n218\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, you gotta have root access\nto get to it, so that's one thing.\n\n219\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.320\nIt is definitely protected that way.\n\n220\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.780\nAnd then using long, strong passwords.\n\n221\n00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.810\nYeah, just making sure that,\nhey, even if they get it,\n\n222\n00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.370\nthey're not gonna be able to crack my\npassword in a reasonable amount of time,\n\n223\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.920\nbut that's okay we're going to\nworry about red team stuff today.\n\n224\n00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.420\nWe're going to be all on the offensive.\n\n225\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.440\nAll right, so the command here is just\ngoing to be unshadow, if I can type.\n\n226\n00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:58.050\nUnshadow, right?\n\n227\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.110\nWe've got a password file and\na shadow file.\n\n228\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.770\nUnshadow allows me to put\nthese guys back together.\n\n229\n00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.500\nSo I'm going to do,\nwhat is it etsy switch pass w d and\n\n230\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.010\nI also need the atcswitchshadow,\nall right?\n\n231\n00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.770\nAnd I wanna take those m shadow and\nmarry them back together, and\n\n232\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.350\nI wanna out that out, and I'll call it\nsomething like, let's say join hashes.\n\n233\n00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.030\nCuz we might be doing a few of these,\n\n234\n00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.040\nI wanna keep track of which\none is set up for which.\n\n235\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.197\nNow I hit enter, it doesn't seem\nlike it does much bit if I cut,\n\n236\n00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:38.298\nJohn Hashes, Right,\nthere is a list of the,\n\n237\n00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:42.755\nyou can see the username is here,\nright,and then here is that hash value,\n\n238\n00:12:42.755 --> 00:12:47.709\nand there are some additional stuff that\ngets dumped in there when you unshadow it,\n\n239\n00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:50.893\nremember the other stuff\nthat's in the pass wd file,\n\n240\n00:12:50.893 --> 00:12:55.130\nIt's tacked back in there cuz\nwe're plugging it all together.\n\n241\n00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.530\nAnd John doesn't need that stuff,\nwe need to get rid of that.\n\n242\n00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.580\nActually, you know what?\n\n243\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.040\nI think we can probably do it with that.\n\n244\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.540\nWe'll see what happens here.\n\n245\n00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.130\nAlright, so\nlet's take a look then at our next step.\n\n246\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.460\nWhat I want to do is,\nI'm going to shorten this up a bit,\n\n247\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.010\nbecause I don't need to try to crack\nall of these half passwords on them.\n\n248\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.680\nLot of services that come built with\nCali accounts and things like that.\n\n249\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.810\nSo I'm gonna get rid of some of that.\n\n250\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.220\nWhat I wanna do here is just do a tail.\n\n251\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.420\nAnd I think I've got, what,\nDaniel, Cherokee, Wes and Ronnie.\n\n252\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.840\nSo there's four.\n\n253\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.029\nI'll say n4, and\nthat file we called JohnHashes.\n\n254\n00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:44.650\nAnd I'm gonna take that and\nI'm gonna put that into hashes, like that.\n\n255\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.350\nNow if we get hashes we should see I've\njust got those accounts that I wanna stick\n\n256\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.710\nwith and then I wanna try to crack,\nand really this first part has been\n\n257\n00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.600\nkinda showing you how to get these hashes,\nor getting them little quick for lab.\n\n258\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.360\nI'll do a separate show on hashes and\nhow we get them both from Linux and\n\n259\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.470\nfrom Windows like PW dumb and\nthings like that.\n\n260\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.560\nAll right so this point we got our\nfile of hashes that we've stolen we've\n\n261\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.500\nintercepted, we've got it obtained\nsomehow and we wanna crack them.\n\n262\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.800\nSo we break out John and\nwe try to crack these guys.\n\n263\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.610\nNow if I just type in John I\nthink it will balk at me.\n\n264\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.560\nLet's take a look at the help file here,\nall right.\n\n265\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.040\nSo it's basically just John any\noptions you want to set and\n\n266\n00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.850\nthen the password files, right, the ones\nyou want that we want to try to crack.\n\n267\n00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.180\nThere's our word list option,\n\n268\n00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.710\nthat one we're going to use if we\nwant to do our dictionary attack.\n\n269\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.290\nYou can see single.\n\n270\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.800\nThere's rules, which we'll take\na look at in just a second.\n\n271\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.780\nWe'll specify we wanna use some rules, and\nI'll show you a real cool set of rules.\n\n272\n00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.160\nWhat else did I wanna show\nyou while we are in here?\n\n273\n00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.970\nThere's a few different modes that\nwe're not going to deal with.\n\n274\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:03.470\nLet's take a look at\nthe man page real quick.\n\n275\n00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.625\nAs the man page has a little\nmore information about John.\n\n276\n00:15:08.193 --> 00:15:13.835\nAnd one thing I'll tell you is, you got\nthe help file, which we looked at first.\n\n277\n00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:15.345\nAnd this is the man page.\n\n278\n00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:19.435\nAnd what you'll notice is that in here,\nit tells me, where is it?\n\n279\n00:15:19.435 --> 00:15:20.665\n&gt;&gt; What does man mean?\n\n280\n00:15:20.665 --> 00:15:21.775\n&gt;&gt; Manual.\n&gt;&gt; Manual, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:24.125\n&gt;&gt; This is our manual page.\n\n282\n00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:25.035\nSomewhere in here,\n\n283\n00:15:25.035 --> 00:15:29.330\nit's gonna tell me that all the options\nare specified with a single dash.\n\n284\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.280\nBut if we go back and look at that\nhelp file I just pulled up the john-h,\n\n285\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.780\nthey're all listed with double dashes,\nright?\n\n286\n00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:41.130\nIf you go out and\nlook at the information out on the web.\n\n287\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.800\nYou'll find from Open Wall that John\nthe Ripper will actually use either one.\n\n288\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.430\nSo you can do a single dash and then your\noption or you can do the double dash.\n\n289\n00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.940\nAnd there was one in here that\ndoesn't show up in the other one.\n\n290\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.170\nThis is the standard n.\n\n291\n00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.819\nI just wanted to point this out,\n\n292\n00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:00.568\nbecause you remember the other\nday we did an episode or\n\n293\n00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:04.067\nif you remember from previous\nepisodes we were looking at hashcat.\n\n294\n00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:07.549\nAnd I said that hashcat can mangle\nwords really good, really cool,\n\n295\n00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.067\na lot easier, I think,\nworking with the rules.\n\n296\n00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:13.581\nAnd then we could pipe those to a standard\nout, like we did on the screen.\n\n297\n00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:17.520\nBut I also told you that's really\nuseful if you get another tool\n\n298\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.360\nthat accepts standard in, which John does.\n\n299\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.099\nSo even though Hashcat's a great\npassword cracker on its own, but\n\n300\n00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:28.305\njust as an example, you could use\nHashcat to mangle your dictionary file,\n\n301\n00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:31.073\nuse standard out on it,\nuse standard in on John.\n\n302\n00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:35.975\nBring those mangled words in, and\nuse John to actually try to crack\n\n303\n00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:40.889\nthe passwords, all right,\nenough talking, let's do, right?\n\n304\n00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:44.800\nAll right, I'm gonna bring that back down\njust cuz it bugs me when it's full screen.\n\n305\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.363\nAll right, so the command we're\ngonna do is gonna be John, and\n\n306\n00:16:49.363 --> 00:16:52.128\nthen we're gonna do a dash wordlist.\n\n307\n00:16:52.128 --> 00:16:56.032\nNow the word list I have set up was,\nnow I don't remember,\n\n308\n00:16:56.032 --> 00:16:59.315\npass.text I think, there we go, pass.list.\n\n309\n00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:03.221\nSo I'm telling it, oops, and\nyou need either an equals or\n\n310\n00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:07.765\na colon in here, dash,\ndash is typically an equals, single dash,\n\n311\n00:17:07.765 --> 00:17:12.747\nwe use a colon, I think you can\ninterchange those, I've never tried it.\n\n312\n00:17:12.747 --> 00:17:17.276\nBut the manual, or\nthe out on the website it'll tell you,\n\n313\n00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:20.332\nyou can use either a colon or an equals.\n\n314\n00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:23.149\nSo John, the name of the program,\nword list,\n\n315\n00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:26.276\nthat's your dictionary\nfile that you want to use.\n\n316\n00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:29.561\nAnd then we've got to tell\nit where the hashes are and\n\n317\n00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:31.509\nthat was a file called hashes.\n\n318\n00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:37.433\nAnd we'll let it run and see what it does,\nand you can see that was not very long,\n\n319\n00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:41.345\nit's already cracked three\nof the four passwords.\n\n320\n00:17:41.345 --> 00:17:45.905\nNow when you get these results, it was\nvery quick, because my dictionary was\n\n321\n00:17:45.905 --> 00:17:50.272\nrefined, I knew what the passwords were,\nI put them in a very short list.\n\n322\n00:17:50.272 --> 00:17:55.508\nLet me show you, if I go, CAT,\npass.list, you can see I've got very few\n\n323\n00:17:55.508 --> 00:18:01.442\nwords in my password file, just because we\nwant this to happen quickly on the show.\n\n324\n00:18:01.442 --> 00:18:04.969\nNormally, you would have a dictionary file\nwith thousands and thousands of words, and\n\n325\n00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:06.363\nit would take a little bit longer.\n\n326\n00:18:06.363 --> 00:18:09.824\nAlso something I'll point out that I\ndon't think we talk about in the previous\n\n327\n00:18:09.824 --> 00:18:12.511\nepisode, notice I've got a blank\nline in my password file?\n\n328\n00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:15.765\nAnd that's because many people many\nsometimes use a blank password, right?\n\n329\n00:18:15.765 --> 00:18:21.364\nAnd it will never try that if you\ndon't put it in your dictionary file.\n\n330\n00:18:21.364 --> 00:18:24.369\nI always like to put it somewhere\nin between other words,\n\n331\n00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:27.513\nyou could put it at the end, but\nwhen I CAT it and I look at it.\n\n332\n00:18:27.513 --> 00:18:28.592\n&gt;&gt; Just to know it exists.\n\n333\n00:18:28.592 --> 00:18:32.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if I put it between two lines,\nat least it'll stand out and\n\n334\n00:18:32.475 --> 00:18:37.293\ngo, look, I did remember to put a blank\npassword in my possible passwords.\n\n335\n00:18:37.293 --> 00:18:42.340\nAll right, so here, again,\nit cracked three of those four passwords,\n\n336\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.080\nnow John, another command we can\nuse with john is dash, dash show.\n\n337\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.970\n&gt;&gt; I love Wes' passwords.\n\n338\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you like that?\n\n339\n00:18:49.147 --> 00:18:55.286\nSo I'm gonna do dash, dash show, and then\nthe name of the file that I just cracked,\n\n340\n00:18:55.286 --> 00:19:00.224\nremember, hashes was the name of\nthe file we were trying to crack.\n\n341\n00:19:00.224 --> 00:19:05.568\nDash, dash show hashes will show\nme those three accounts that\n\n342\n00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:10.615\nwere cracked and\nthe password right next to the username.\n\n343\n00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:13.386\nSo a little bit easier sometimes\nthan reading from the output,\n\n344\n00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:15.117\nif you've got a lot of output up there.\n\n345\n00:19:15.117 --> 00:19:18.345\nAnd also a nice place to know\nthat it has been recorded,\n\n346\n00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:20.110\njust use that dash dash show.\n\n347\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.803\nThat does tell me I have three cracked,\none left.\n\n348\n00:19:23.803 --> 00:19:28.678\nSo it did not get all four of\nthose accounts because somebody is\n\n349\n00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:31.585\nusing a password that's-\n&gt;&gt; That was not on your list?\n\n350\n00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:33.894\n&gt;&gt; That's not in my list, exactly.\n\n351\n00:19:33.894 --> 00:19:38.518\nSo I wanna, and I did that intentionally,\nso we can take a look at using some rules.\n\n352\n00:19:38.518 --> 00:19:42.805\nSo, remember, rules are ways that I\ncan take my password list and add,\n\n353\n00:19:42.805 --> 00:19:45.671\nlet's try tour one,\nadmin one, log me in one.\n\n354\n00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:49.167\nLet's try tour two,\nlet's try tour with a capital T,\n\n355\n00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:53.961\nlet's try tour all uppercase, those\nare the kind of rules that we can use.\n\n356\n00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:59.145\nNow you can see, in fact,\nlet's clear this screen up and\n\n357\n00:19:59.145 --> 00:20:02.818\nwe'll head over to John and take a look.\n\n358\n00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:06.751\nUser share John, and if we look in here,\n\n359\n00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:10.809\nthere's a John.comp file, all right?\n\n360\n00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:16.426\nAnd then there's a John.local.comp file,\nthis is your configuration file for John.\n\n361\n00:20:16.426 --> 00:20:20.615\nAnd if we took a look at that file it's,\nlet's go to, oops,\n\n362\n00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:23.996\ncannot type today,\nlet's look at John.conf.\n\n363\n00:20:23.996 --> 00:20:29.264\nAll right, and you will see there's\na lot of information in here,\n\n364\n00:20:29.264 --> 00:20:32.652\nthere aren't any rules, there are some,\n\n365\n00:20:32.652 --> 00:20:36.902\nactually there are a few rules in here,\nI do believe.\n\n366\n00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:41.209\nThere are some modules, I guess, is\nreally what they call them in here, but.\n\n367\n00:20:41.209 --> 00:20:44.067\n&gt;&gt; So what kind of rules are we\nlooking at, are these like filters, or\n\n368\n00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:46.582\nare these just different\nparameters that we're adding?\n\n369\n00:20:46.582 --> 00:20:48.050\n&gt;&gt; Well, these are rules that say, hey,\n\n370\n00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:50.597\nI want you to take each one of those\nwords and add a one at the end of it.\n\n371\n00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:51.356\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n372\n00:20:51.356 --> 00:20:52.208\n&gt;&gt; Like you were talking about.\n\n373\n00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.579\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n374\n00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:57.182\nAnd there's a set in here,\nif we take a look at that again,\n\n375\n00:20:57.182 --> 00:21:00.065\nthere is one called corelogic.com, right?\n\n376\n00:21:00.065 --> 00:21:04.433\nThis was back from Blackhat 2010,\nthey had some kind of contest,\n\n377\n00:21:04.433 --> 00:21:07.627\nthey came up with a bunch\nof really good John rules.\n\n378\n00:21:07.627 --> 00:21:12.400\nAnd if we take a look at that,\nif we cap that corelogic file,\n\n379\n00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.797\nwhat you'll see is a whole bunch of rules,\nall right?\n\n380\n00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:19.317\nEach one of these,\nlet's get up towards the top there,\n\n381\n00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:21.258\na little bit easier to see the difference.\n\n382\n00:21:21.258 --> 00:21:25.812\nSo here is an example of a rule,\nthis is list.rules,\n\n383\n00:21:25.812 --> 00:21:28.864\nappend lower special, what is it?\n\n384\n00:21:28.864 --> 00:21:30.564\nAppend special lower lower.\n\n385\n00:21:30.564 --> 00:21:33.220\n&gt;&gt; So they're gonna be appending\nwith all those different characters?\n\n386\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.398\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And multiple iterations there.\n\n387\n00:21:35.398 --> 00:21:39.052\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going to append a special\ncharacter, so an asterisk, an ampersand.\n\n388\n00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:43.079\nAnd then a lower, like an a,\nor a lowercase alphabet,\n\n389\n00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:48.701\ncan't even talk today, a lowercase\nletter and another lowercase letter.\n\n390\n00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:53.311\nThis one's gonna append just specials\nthree times, so three special characters\n\n391\n00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:57.538\nat the end of each word, ampersand,\npound, exclamation point, right?\n\n392\n00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:01.003\nAnd there are tons of rules in here, and\n\n393\n00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:06.883\nthe way you work with these is you\ncall them by this name right here.\n\n394\n00:22:06.883 --> 00:22:13.110\nYou leave out the list.rules, and in your\nJohn command, you do a dash rules colon,\n\n395\n00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.599\nand then the name of the rule\nthat you want to try, all right?\n\n396\n00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:20.582\n&gt;&gt; Mike, these do look like a lot of\nrules, so I can imagine that the same\n\n397\n00:22:20.582 --> 00:22:24.296\nlogic applies, like we were talking about\npreviously, with our dictionary files.\n\n398\n00:22:24.296 --> 00:22:27.969\nThat if we had, if we are utilizing\nmultiple rules at once,\n\n399\n00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:31.502\nthis will also accumulate\nadditional processing time.\n\n400\n00:22:31.502 --> 00:22:34.040\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right ,yeah,\ncuz we gotta go back and run it for\n\n401\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.177\neach one of those rules.\n\n402\n00:22:35.177 --> 00:22:37.594\nGo through the dictionary\nagain using this rule,\n\n403\n00:22:37.594 --> 00:22:40.016\ngo through the dictionary\nagain using this rule.\n\n404\n00:22:40.016 --> 00:22:41.770\nSo this will definitely extend, but\n\n405\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.742\nhopefully our list of hashes to crack is\ngetting shorter each time as well, right?\n\n406\n00:22:45.742 --> 00:22:48.717\nWe've already removed three\nhashes from our list.\n\n407\n00:22:48.717 --> 00:22:49.438\n&gt;&gt; And only have one.\n\n408\n00:22:49.438 --> 00:22:52.662\n&gt;&gt; And we only have one left, yeah,\nso if we pick our rule right,\n\n409\n00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:54.837\nwe might get this next\none on the next try.\n\n410\n00:22:54.837 --> 00:22:55.523\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed.\n\n411\n00:22:55.523 --> 00:22:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Fingers crossed, right.\n\n412\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.622\nAnd there's one, and you guys, well,\nwe'll wait for that to come back.\n\n413\n00:23:01.622 --> 00:23:06.808\nThere's one in here that I'm going to use,\n\n414\n00:23:06.808 --> 00:23:13.546\nand it's called append just numbers,\nwhere did you go?\n\n415\n00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:15.597\nI've got to find it in here,\nthere's so many.\n\n416\n00:23:15.597 --> 00:23:17.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't rely on me,\nyou're going too fast in the text.\n\n417\n00:23:17.525 --> 00:23:19.096\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n&gt;&gt; It's just too small, I'm like,\n\n418\n00:23:19.096 --> 00:23:19.796\nI can't see that.\n\n419\n00:23:19.796 --> 00:23:22.764\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll slow down as soon as\nI get to what's interesting here.\n\n420\n00:23:22.764 --> 00:23:27.461\nSo, don't mind my scrolling through here,\nlike I say, like prepend, num, num,\n\n421\n00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:28.136\nnum, num.\n\n422\n00:23:28.136 --> 00:23:31.651\nSo I was gonna put four\nnumbers at the beginning,\n\n423\n00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:35.268\nand append special,\nnum num, where do I find it?\n\n424\n00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:36.811\nAppend to letters.\n\n425\n00:23:36.811 --> 00:23:38.257\n&gt;&gt; It seems like you're trying\nto get a toddler to eat.\n\n426\n00:23:38.257 --> 00:23:38.860\n&gt;&gt; I know, right?\n\n427\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.094\nNum num num num.\n\n428\n00:23:40.094 --> 00:23:41.903\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here is the one, just,\n\n429\n00:23:41.903 --> 00:23:46.499\nor add just numbers, so what this is gonna\ndo and it's gonna do it incrementally.\n\n430\n00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:50.572\nSo it's gonna say hey,\nlet's try password1, let's try password12,\n\n431\n00:23:50.572 --> 00:23:55.546\nnow let's try password111, 112, 123,\nand all of that, I don't know how many.\n\n432\n00:23:55.546 --> 00:23:58.779\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike, how do we add, do we just\nput a comma after each one of the names\n\n433\n00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:00.859\nof these rules, or\ncan you run them multiple?\n\n434\n00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:02.866\nI mean,\nI would think you should be able to.\n\n435\n00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:06.053\n&gt;&gt; You can actually do it,\ndepending on the rules you set up,\n\n436\n00:24:06.053 --> 00:24:10.160\nyou can have a rule all But you would\nhave to have all the rules listed there.\n\n437\n00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.186\nAnd typically you don't wanna try to\ndo every single rule at once because\n\n438\n00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:18.370\nyou're gonna go through so many\nguesses that aren't gonna get you any.\n\n439\n00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.070\nYou're really trying to refine it.\n\n440\n00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:25.730\nAnd you want to try to think about,\ntry to make it as quick as possible.\n\n441\n00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.450\nSo you wanna try to use the rules you\nthink are gonna be successful first, and\n\n442\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.200\nthen move on to rules that maybe\nhave less odds of success.\n\n443\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.610\nAlright, so let's see how we can do that.\n\n444\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.820\nWe're going to go back out.\n\n445\n00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.710\nLet me just clear the screen out.\n\n446\n00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.900\nI need to copy those over.\n\n447\n00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.030\nAll of these are in corelogic.com.\n\n448\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.310\nIf you can go out to their website and\ndownload it, as well, but like I said,\n\n449\n00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.280\nthere's a copy here in Kali.\n\n450\n00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.730\nBut I need to get those into my\nJohn dot local dot comp file.\n\n451\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.670\nAll right?\n\n452\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:25:00.325\nSo, to do that,\nI'm gonna cat cologic.comf, and\n\n453\n00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:05.500\nI'm going to append that\ninto my john.local.\n\n454\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.250\nNow I know john.local\nis empty currently but\n\n455\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:14.083\nif I had already made some rules in there\nlike my own rules, I would use the greater\n\n456\n00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:19.280\nthan greater than to make sure I didn't\noverwrite those and just append, mm-hm.\n\n457\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.440\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n458\n00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:26.380\nNow if I cat john.local, you see it\nactually looks exactly like core.conf.\n\n459\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.280\nBut it knows to read that file,\n\n460\n00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.495\nright, because in my john.conf file\nthere's a line in there that says look in\n\n461\n00:25:32.495 --> 00:25:35.580\njohn.local.conf if you\ncan't find something.\n\n462\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.920\nSo now I've moved all those rules\ninto a place that John is gonna look.\n\n463\n00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.330\nSo now when I call the name of that rule,\nit'll be able to find it.\n\n464\n00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.970\nSo hopefully we'll be able\nto get this last password.\n\n465\n00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.630\n&gt;&gt; Now Mike, when you said utilizing\nthe rules that make the most sense,\n\n466\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.680\nI guess a lot of it would\nreally depend on that target.\n\n467\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.710\nBut then also you have to kinda think\nabout some human characteristics and\n\n468\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.670\nthose are probably gonna fall back on the\nthings that I'm sure you've talked about\n\n469\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.820\nand people and\nyou've probably heard about even from A+,\n\n470\n00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:07.140\nbut the capital letters at\nthe beginning of the password and\n\n471\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.420\nthen the sequential numbers at the end\nof the password, multiple numbers,\n\n472\n00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.950\nor I should say, mirrored words.\n\n473\n00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n474\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.690\n&gt;&gt; Things like that.\n\n475\n00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:17.990\n&gt;&gt; All those rules are in there.\n\n476\n00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.100\nFor sure.\nFor sure.\n\n477\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.130\nBecause we know, as we said in the other\nepisode, humans love to think that they're\n\n478\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:25.950\nunique and what they're doing,\nnobody else is doing.\n\n479\n00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.392\nBut after a research on all those data\ndumps that have come from those breaches,\n\n480\n00:26:30.392 --> 00:26:34.174\nwhere you're looking at millions of\npasswords that have been released or\n\n481\n00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:38.855\nhave been breached, we see that\nhumans are not nearly as unique as\n\n482\n00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:42.265\nthey think they are,\nwe definitely follow patterns.\n\n483\n00:26:42.265 --> 00:26:45.305\nAll right, so to use a rule set we're\ngonna do something very similar.\n\n484\n00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:48.735\nWe're gonna use our word list,\nbecause if I don't have a word list,\n\n485\n00:26:48.735 --> 00:26:50.085\nwhat am I applying the rules to?\n\n486\n00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:53.950\nSo you still have to specify\nyour word list and for\n\n487\n00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.270\nthat one we did that pass list and\nthen it's going to be --\n\n488\n00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:04.640\nrules I'm sorry -rules: and\n\n489\n00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.870\nthen name of that one was normally\nI will copy and paste that out.\n\n490\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.070\nLike I will go ahead and\ncut that comp file and\n\n491\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:16.470\ncopy it out pasted it in here, but\nit was CoreLogicRulesAppendJustNumbers,\n\n492\n00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.410\nall right?\n\n493\n00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.480\nThat was the name of the rule.\n\n494\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.479\nAnd then we also wanna do our\nfile that has the hashes,\n\n495\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.710\nthat we are trying to break.\n\n496\n00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.360\nSo, really the only thing different\nbetween that first command and this\n\n497\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.730\ncommand is the dash rules colon and then\nwhatever rule it is that I want to run.\n\n498\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:44.230\nAnd you can write your own, and\nput them in the john.local.conf file,\n\n499\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.030\nas long as you follow that format.\n\n500\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:52.490\nOpen bracket, list dot rules and then I\nthink it was a colon, and then your name,\n\n501\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.280\nand the closed bracket and then write\nyour rule right underneath that.\n\n502\n00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.780\nSo we'll run this and\nno core logic rules append just numbers.\n\n503\n00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.240\nAll right so\nevidently I need to go out there and\n\n504\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.390\ncat that file again because I\ndid not spell it correctly.\n\n505\n00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.350\nAll right so let's do this.\n\n506\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:16.611\nLet's change back over to switch user,\nshare, John.\n\n507\n00:28:21.907 --> 00:28:26.716\nAnd let's cat that we'll do these\njohn.local files since I copied everything\n\n508\n00:28:26.716 --> 00:28:27.510\nover there.\n\n509\n00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.720\nSo cat john Local.com.\n\n510\n00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.770\nLet me go find that rule again.\n\n511\n00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.930\nSo I get back up to the top of this file,\nI know it was close to the top.\n\n512\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.505\nRules replace numbers.\n\n513\n00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.081\nThere's some rules in here that I don't\nknow how it'd be that successful,\n\n514\n00:28:55.081 --> 00:28:59.100\nlike append seasons to begin with,\nor prepend seasons.\n\n515\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:05.000\nNot append seasons to the end like\nSpring 2010, Spring 2011, but evidently\n\n516\n00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.010\nit's something that they have found, it's\nan actual pattern that people like to use.\n\n517\n00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.630\nWhen it's time to change their password.\n\n518\n00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.380\n&gt;&gt; And I can imagine also those leaps\nspeak as well like hey let's change all\n\n519\n00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.370\nthe A's for at symbols or something.\n\n520\n00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.320\nAt least that's what I would do if I\nwere coding this little right here.\n\n521\n00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and there I goofed it wasn't\ncorelogic rules appends Jest members.\n\n522\n00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.850\nIt's append Jest members right we're\ngoing to leave this part off and\n\n523\n00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:28.710\nappend Jest members.\n\n524\n00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.090\nSo let's try that again.\n\n525\n00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.578\nLet's get back up to where I want to be so\nthere is file are there and\n\n526\n00:29:36.578 --> 00:29:41.112\nwe'll just bring that command back and\nwe get rid of the core logic rules.\n\n527\n00:29:45.154 --> 00:29:46.050\nI end up with just numbers.\n\n528\n00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.410\nAll right and now it's going.\n\n529\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.700\nNotice it's not going nearly as first and\nwe did with the dictionary file because\n\n530\n00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.740\nnow it's trying,\nit has to brute force it so\n\n531\n00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.080\nI'm gonna try a one, I'm gonna try a two,\na three all the way through nine.\n\n532\n00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.570\nNow I'm going to try one one,\none two, one three.\n\n533\n00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.955\n&gt;&gt; But we're still based off\nof that original word list.\n\n534\n00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:05.110\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That you had compiled or\n\n535\n00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.241\nat least specified here so we're just\nmodifying or what was the word you used?\n\n536\n00:30:09.241 --> 00:30:13.570\n&gt;&gt; For the actual password?\n\n537\n00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.077\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt started with an M.\n\n538\n00:30:15.077 --> 00:30:16.060\n&gt;&gt; Mangles.\n\n539\n00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:16.600\n&gt;&gt; Mangles.\nYeah.\n\n540\n00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.380\nThere we go.\n\n541\n00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.457\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nWe've mangled it.\n\n542\n00:30:18.457 --> 00:30:19.355\n&gt;&gt; So now were mangling.\n\n543\n00:30:19.355 --> 00:30:21.200\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; And there exactly what we are doing and\n\n544\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.710\nthere we got the last one.\n\n545\n00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:25.880\n&gt;&gt; Alright,\nwe've got that last password cracked.\n\n546\n00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:31.398\nSo if we do a john dash dash show, hashes.\n\n547\n00:30:31.398 --> 00:30:35.000\nNow I have all four passwords cracked.\n\n548\n00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.715\nZero left, and you can see what happened.\n\n549\n00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:45.380\nIf I cat my password file the we were\nusing secret was in my dictionary file\n\n550\n00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.750\nbut, it didn't crack Ronnie's password,\nbecause his password was secret123.\n\n551\n00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:54.040\nBut by using that rule that says, hey,\ntry every word and add a one to it.\n\n552\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.610\nAll the way through nine.\n\n553\n00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.903\nAnd then try every word and try a one one,\n\n554\n00:30:56.903 --> 00:30:58.590\none two, one three,\ntwo one, two two, all right?\n\n555\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:05.080\nKeep going and finally, it got to the rule\nthat says, hey, let's try every word\n\n556\n00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.270\nwhere the one, two, three at the end of it\nand that is how we got Ronnie's password.\n\n557\n00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.490\n&gt;&gt; Not even Ronnie is safe, Mike.\n\n558\n00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.395\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n\n559\n00:31:12.395 --> 00:31:12.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n560\n00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.770\nthat really is an example\nof doing a hybrid.\n\n561\n00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:21.683\nLike I said, it's still a dictionary file,\nbut now we're throwing in a rule that's\n\n562\n00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:26.120\nkind of mingling that dictionary word and\nI guess because more possibilities\n\n563\n00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.830\nfrom where we talked about the other day\nwith dictionary files.We want to try keep\n\n564\n00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.811\nthem as small as possible.So instead of me\nhaving in my dictionary file password one,\n\n565\n00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:39.905\npassword two, password three,\npassword one one, password one two,\n\n566\n00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:44.260\npassword nine nine, password one two zero,\npassword one two one.\n\n567\n00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.580\nI mean I'd have to have\na password list incredibly long.\n\n568\n00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.300\nNow I can have password just\nonce in my dictionary file and\n\n569\n00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.550\nlet my application mangle it and try\nthose different numbers at the end, and\n\n570\n00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.840\nthe beginning, in the middle,\nwhere ever you wanna put them.\n\n571\n00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.210\n&gt;&gt; So there we go John cracking passwords.\n\n572\n00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.130\n&gt;&gt; Well thank for you time Mike\nshown us that really cool tool but\n\n573\n00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.020\nI really don't think we are any where\nnear being done here in Caliclinics.\n\n574\n00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.060\nSo ladies and gentlemen stay tuned,\nwe have more information headed your way.\n\n575\n00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.330\nBut for this show we are out of time and\nwe'll sign out.\n\n576\n00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.100\nRemember, I've been your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n577\n00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.840\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n578\n00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.919\n&gt;&gt; Se you next time, bye.\n\n579\n00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:24.093\n[MUSIC]\n\n580\n00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:26.630\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.813\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:15.965\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to our Kali Linux series,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.655\nIn this episode, we'll continue\ntaking a look at cracking passwords.\n\n6\n00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:23.795\nSpecifically the tool that we'll be\nusing in this episode is called Hashcat.\n\n7\n00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:26.965\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:27.975\nHow's it going today Mike?\n\n9\n00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:28.895\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.605\nThanks for having me back and yeah,\nmore fun with cracking passwords.\n\n11\n00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:36.407\nSo we, in a previous episode, we looked\nat Hashcat for a different reason.\n\n12\n00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:38.942\nWhen we talked about dictionary files,\n\n13\n00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:43.190\nwe saw how Hashcat could actually\nhelp us create dictionary files,\n\n14\n00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.930\nmangle words, lot of cool rules that\nwe could use along with Hashcat.\n\n15\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.700\nSo now we're actually gonna use that,\nwe're gonna go and apply some rules,\n\n16\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.510\nwe'll do some cracking,\n\n17\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.610\nwe'll take a look at the different\nmodes that we can use Hashcat in.\n\n18\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.530\nSo the first thing we're going to do is,\n\n19\n00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.780\nlet's take a look at the Hashcat,\nif I could type.\n\n20\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.010\nLet's look at the help file for\ngood old Hashcat and it's a long one.\n\n21\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.320\nSo when you get a chance\nperuse through it.\n\n22\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.866\nBut, a couple of things that\nI do want to point out,\n\n23\n00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.590\nsome of these options that\nwe are going to use in here.\n\n24\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.670\nI see a very verbose help file,\nI really like it.\n\n25\n00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.750\nWe´ll be using a couple\nof different switches.\n\n26\n00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.815\nOne is going to be our m switch,\nm is the hash type.\n\n27\n00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:33.871\nWe need to tell Hashcat what type of hash\nyou're getting ready to try to crack.\n\n28\n00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:36.059\nAnd you can see they give you,\nthis is a great help file,\n\n29\n00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:37.830\nthey give you the example out here.\n\n30\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.330\nDown below, I´ll show you,\nlike this 1,000, what does that mean?\n\n31\n00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.689\nWhat do you mean hash type 1000?\n\n32\n00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.622\nAll there is actually, that's a code and\n\n33\n00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:48.225\nthey have them all listed out in this\nhelp file, so we'll take a look at that.\n\n34\n00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:55.385\nThe -a is attack mode, for\nexample an a 3 is actually brute force.\n\n35\n00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:59.270\nAgain, see reference below so\nyou can get the the different numbers.\n\n36\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.786\nThat one is gonna be\nyour dictionary file and\n\n37\n00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:04.373\nwe'll take a look at\nthe rest of those there.\n\n38\n00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:08.218\nAnother important switch for\nus going to be the outfile.\n\n39\n00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:12.160\nSo that we can dump the results to a file.\n\n40\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.290\nCuz we want the passwords, right?\n\n41\n00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.610\nThat's why we're cracking\nthem in the first place.\n\n42\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.665\nIt will show it on screen, but\nit's always nice to have it in a file.\n\n43\n00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:25.427\nAnother one that we'll want to\npay attention to is going to be,\n\n44\n00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:32.621\nif I can find it here, what did I use,\nthere's a --remove, so let's go.\n\n45\n00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.657\nWhile we're here,\nlet's take a look at the hash modes.\n\n46\n00:02:35.657 --> 00:02:38.363\nThe hash modes, again,\nyou can see these different codes, and\n\n47\n00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:39.576\nhere are the actual hashes.\n\n48\n00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:43.956\nSo if I was doing an MD5 raw,\nit'd be -a 0, right?\n\n49\n00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:50.064\nIf we're doing a RIPEMD hash,\nthat's going to be a -m 6000.\n\n50\n00:02:50.064 --> 00:02:54.021\nSo you got to find the appropriate code\nfor what it is you are trying to break.\n\n51\n00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:58.503\nAnd you can see there's a lot of\ndifferent hashing algorithms that\n\n52\n00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:00.705\nHashcat understands.\n\n53\n00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:04.720\nAlright, other things I want to point\nout down here, the attack modes.\n\n54\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.330\nThere are the codes, remember I said 3\nwas a brute force, 1 is a combination.\n\n55\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.820\n6, hybrid word list combination,\nwe can use dictionary file for that.\n\n56\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.509\nI'm sorry, not dictionary file,\nstraight is my dictionary file.\n\n57\n00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.509\n0 is my dictionary.\n\n58\n00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.710\nCharacter sets will come into\nplay in just a little bit.\n\n59\n00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.276\nWe're gonna look.\nThey've got some built-in character sets,\n\n60\n00:03:28.276 --> 00:03:29.302\nwe can define our own.\n\n61\n00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:31.860\nIf we're gonna be doing brute forcing,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.444\nWe want to use the smallest\ncharacter set possible.\n\n63\n00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:38.010\nWe've talked about that\nin a previous episode.\n\n64\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.230\nIf I know there's no uppercase\nletters in their password\n\n65\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.990\nbecause of their password policy or\nlimitations of the authentication form or\n\n66\n00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.540\nwhatever it is, then I don't want to\nput uppercase letters as a possibility.\n\n67\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.910\nWhy even try them and waste time going\nthrough thousands and thousands of\n\n68\n00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.240\niterations with capital letters when\nthere aren't any in the password.\n\n69\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.650\nSo the character sets\nallow us to define that,\n\n70\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.000\nto reduce the number of\nattempts we have to make.\n\n71\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.500\nYou can create your own as well.\n\n72\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.590\nWhat else?\n\n73\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.550\nYou'll see device type and\nwork load profiles.\n\n74\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.510\nThat's gonna give us an issue\n[LAUGH] in my virtual machine.\n\n75\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.990\nBecause it recognizes that\nI'm in a virtual machine and\n\n76\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.810\nit says hey,\nyou're gonna hate the performance on this.\n\n77\n00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.750\nI can't tell how hot you're getting\ncuz doing brute forcing puts a lot\n\n78\n00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.500\nof stress on your machine and\nit says hey, you don't have any GPUs.\n\n79\n00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.580\nHow are we supposed to do this?\n\n80\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.185\nYou can do a --force.\n\n81\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.750\nTo force it to use your single\nCPU like in my virtual machine.\n\n82\n00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.292\nFor test purposes, that's fine.\n\n83\n00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.000\nIn the real world that\nwould be a little too slow.\n\n84\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.259\nAll right, so that's some of the help\nthat we can get from Hashcat,\n\n85\n00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.737\nand of course there's a man page for\nhashcat as well.\n\n86\n00:04:45.737 --> 00:04:47.116\nGives you even more examples,\n\n87\n00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:50.359\ngood to look at when we're first\ngetting started with good old Hashcat.\n\n88\n00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.380\nAll right, Cherokee.\n\n89\n00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.773\nSo the first thing we do is we really\nneed to set up our hashes, right?\n\n90\n00:04:55.773 --> 00:05:00.430\nI said we're gonna have another show\nwhere we learn how to get these hashes.\n\n91\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.270\nBut for now we're just gonna grab\nthe hashes off of my Kali machine.\n\n92\n00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.570\nAnd that's in that shadow file, right?.\n\n93\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.736\nSo if I cat /etc/shadow,\nwe'll see there is my password file,\n\n94\n00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:16.551\nit's simply username, password file,\n\n95\n00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:20.375\na little bit of additional information.\n\n96\n00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:25.383\nI'm sorry username, hash of the passwords,\nsalt type and then a little bit\n\n97\n00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:30.245\nof additional information about my\naccount or that particular account.\n\n98\n00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:35.030\nWhen we used John,\nwe pretty much just cracked passwords.\n\n99\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.740\nWe fed this file straight in.\n\n100\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.640\nWe grabbed the lines we wanted,\nwe fed it in, John handled that.\n\n101\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.950\nHashcat likes it with the hash value only,\none hash on each line.\n\n102\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.960\nSo what we're gonna do is,\n\n103\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.980\nwe've already done our tail\ncommand in our previous episode.\n\n104\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.790\nI believe I have a list of hashes\nalready that we can work with.\n\n105\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.690\nThere we go.\n\n106\n00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.100\nSo, there's four counts in there.\n\n107\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.909\nYou can see ronnie, and then his hash, and\n\n108\n00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.768\nthe extra information about that cuz\nwe unshadowed for our John episode.\n\n109\n00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:10.930\nWe plugged the shadow file and\nthe password file back together.\n\n110\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.546\nEither way, for\nHashcat we need to strip that stuff out.\n\n111\n00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:18.084\nSo I'm gonna use Leafpad, it will be\na little bit easier for you to see and\n\n112\n00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:20.417\nfor me to navigate while\nwe're on screen here.\n\n113\n00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:23.780\nI'm going leafpad hashes.\n\n114\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.498\nOops, that was not hashes, Mike.\n\n115\n00:06:26.498 --> 00:06:27.768\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n116\n00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:29.257\nThere we go.\n\n117\n00:06:29.257 --> 00:06:34.892\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\nthis file and chop off the username and\n\n118\n00:06:34.892 --> 00:06:39.238\nthat colon that's up there,\nright behind that username.\n\n119\n00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:47.140\nGonna take that out, get rid of that,\nso we're tidying this file up for use.\n\n120\n00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.029\n&gt;&gt; It's a little hard to see, Mike.\n\n121\n00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.925\nWhat are you removing there?\n\n122\n00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:49.645\nI just want to make sure\nI'm on the same page.\n\n123\n00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:52.804\n&gt;&gt; Let me see if I can bump\nthat font up a little bit here.\n\n124\n00:06:58.555 --> 00:06:59.129\nHow's that?\n\n125\n00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:00.026\n&gt;&gt; Better.\n[LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:01.500\n&gt;&gt; All right, and I'll even do a Ctrl+Z.\n\n127\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.129\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n128\n00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:03.403\n&gt;&gt; To dump a couple of those back.\n\n129\n00:07:03.403 --> 00:07:05.419\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now I'm just checking, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.255\n&gt;&gt; Now what I'm doing with each one of\nthese lines, and I'm taking that and\n\n131\n00:07:08.255 --> 00:07:09.381\nI'm just getting rid of it.\n\n132\n00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.800\nSo I'm kinda just selecting it,\nhitting Backspace on there.\n\n133\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.550\nThen I've got to do the same thing at\nthe end of each one of these lines cuz\n\n134\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.180\nthe hash value really stops\nwith this colon right here.\n\n135\n00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:22.772\nAnd Hashcat doesn't want\nthe rest of this information.\n\n136\n00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:24.887\nSo we're gonna have a hard\ntime working with that hash,\n\n137\n00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.063\nit can't pick it out of there.\n\n138\n00:07:26.063 --> 00:07:29.646\nSo we're gonna get rid of all\nof that home directory info and\n\n139\n00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:31.588\nall of that good stuff, right?\n\n140\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.377\nSo now we're left with a file\nwith just my hashes, right?\n\n141\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.342\nSo let's save that.\n\n142\n00:07:41.068 --> 00:07:43.290\nAnd we'll close it,\nwe don't need it anymore.\n\n143\n00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.863\nBut if I cat it again just to show\nyou that we did, we're good to go,\n\n144\n00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:49.761\nthere's just the hashes.\n\n145\n00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.011\nAll right, so we've got our file ready for\nwhat we want to crack.\n\n146\n00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:57.751\nWe've intercepted our hashes or\nwe've gathered them through other means.\n\n147\n00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:01.022\nWe need to know what\nthe encryption type is.\n\n148\n00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:04.030\nNow, on the Linux system there's\na way we can find that out.\n\n149\n00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.006\nWe can take a look at the login.devsfile.\n\n150\n00:08:08.006 --> 00:08:10.110\nRight, that's under the SC folder.\n\n151\n00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.570\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut\nthat out switch FCs oops it's not\n\n152\n00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.490\nhow you spell it login Wow.\n\n153\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.250\nThere we go, login, so\nJeff if I can get that out.\n\n154\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.850\nAnd it's a relatively long file.\n\n155\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.172\nThere is a lot of comments in there.\n\n156\n00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.430\nThere is a lot of stuff.\n\n157\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.240\nI know what I'm looking for.\n\n158\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.647\nI'm looking for the, I cannot spell today.\n\n159\n00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:36.568\nENCRYPT_METHOD.\n\n160\n00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:38.493\nAnd it's upper-cased like that.\n\n161\n00:08:38.493 --> 00:08:41.520\nAll right so I'm going to grip.\n\n162\n00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.910\nI kind of forgot the word grip there.\n\n163\n00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.970\nLet's cat that file and then let's, sorry.\n\n164\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.510\nTyping and\ntalking at the same time is challenging.\n\n165\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.320\nWe're going to grip for encrypted methods.\n\n166\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.544\nIf we can just find that line or\nso in that file.\n\n167\n00:08:57.544 --> 00:09:00.165\nAnd the ones with the pound\nsymbols are obviously common so\n\n168\n00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.890\nI don't really need to look at those.\n\n169\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.770\nBut here is what I'm looking for.\n\n170\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.990\nIt's SHA512, that is the method\nof encryption for those hashes.\n\n171\n00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.642\nSo now I need to go and\nlook up that in that code,\n\n172\n00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:14.022\nthat list of codes we\nsaw in the help file.\n\n173\n00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:17.185\nWe need to figure out what the code is for\nSHA512.\n\n174\n00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:23.013\nSo we're gonna take advantage of\ngrep again, we're gonna go hashcat,\n\n175\n00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:27.788\nand we're going to do a -help or\nactually that's a dash h,\n\n176\n00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:32.181\nor a dash-dash help, and\nwe're gonna grip that for,\n\n177\n00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:37.271\nit tells me it's Shaw 512,\nso let's look for Shaw 512.\n\n178\n00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:37.926\n&gt;&gt; Super efficient.\n\n179\n00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:38.511\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n180\n00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.030\n[LAUGH] I thought so.\n\n181\n00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.100\nAnd we get a few different ones.\n\n182\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.310\nSo it didn't give me the answer\nI was looking for, but\n\n183\n00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:50.150\nas I go through here I see raw hashes,\nGeneric KDF HTTP.\n\n184\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.570\nOperating systems and\nthen full disk encryption.\n\n185\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.610\nWell these are hashes\nfrom an operating system.\n\n186\n00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.740\nRight, from my Linux box.\n\n187\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.550\nSo these two lines are probably\nwhat I'm looking for.\n\n188\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:05.210\nAnd if I look at that\nI've got PBKDF2 Shaw 512.\n\n189\n00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:10.605\nAnd I´ve got one that´s sha512 eunics with\na dollar sign, 6 dollar sign in there.\n\n190\n00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:11.446\n[NOISE].\n\n191\n00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:16.493\nSound familiar, right, if we cat hashes\n\n192\n00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:21.117\n$6$ I´m liking that one, right?\n\n193\n00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:22.580\nThat is most likely the one.\n\n194\n00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.430\nNow I want to tell you, trying to\nfigure out what hashing algorithm\n\n195\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.380\nit is can sometimes be challenging.\n\n196\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.590\nIf you've just got hashes, and you didn't\nknow what system you got them from,\n\n197\n00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.880\nit's all about looking at the length,\nthe number of values in there,\n\n198\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.750\nthe character sets.\n\n199\n00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.665\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\ncuz that part always takes the same,\n\n200\n00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:38.546\ndepending on whatever that hash is, so.\n\n201\n00:10:38.546 --> 00:10:42.684\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, the SHA-256 or 512 or\nwhatever other hashing algorithm\n\n202\n00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.663\n&gt;&gt; MD5, things like that, and\n\n203\n00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:46.650\nsometimes you might have to.\n\n204\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.294\n&gt;&gt; I'd say the same but\nI mean the character length there.\n\n205\n00:10:50.294 --> 00:10:54.510\nIt may have patterns that are similar but,\nof course, it should be unique there.\n\n206\n00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.638\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Shaw512 will always be\nthe same number of characters.\n\n207\n00:10:57.638 --> 00:11:00.779\nShaw256 will always be the same 256 bits,\nright.\n\n208\n00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:05.550\nThat's why we call is Shaw 256 so\nthat will help me narrow it down at least.\n\n209\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.330\nTo what algorithm it might be.\n\n210\n00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.043\nAll right, so we are good we know that it\nactually you know now I forgot what we\n\n211\n00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:13.795\nsaid, it's gonna be 1,800.\n\n212\n00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:14.875\nThat is the one we want.\n\n213\n00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:16.835\nWe'll just think, nah,\nI shouldn't say that.\n\n214\n00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:20.301\nI was gonna say we'll think of Guervo,\nbut you know [LAUGH].\n\n215\n00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:25.010\nProbably not, all right, but\nI said it anyways so now,\n\n216\n00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.650\nlet's take a look at, we already look\nat the built-in characters sets, right?\n\n217\n00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.970\nI think we did that, the code for\n\n218\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.290\nthose is gonna,\nwe're gonna a brute force attack first.\n\n219\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.120\nI'm gonna show you how this works,\nhow we can launch it.\n\n220\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.860\nAnd I'll show you how futile it's going to\nbe on this system and then we'll move on\n\n221\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.160\ninto some other methods that we might\ntry to use to break these passwords.\n\n222\n00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.195\nSo let's go look at that\nhelp again let's say\n\n223\n00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:56.905\na hashcat dash h and\nI'll find those one more time.\n\n224\n00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:04.720\nBack up on top of all my algorithms\nthat we support, I thought.\n\n225\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.550\n&gt;&gt; What are we looking for,\nso I can help you.\n\n226\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.890\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually looking for the\ncharacters, the built in character sets,\n\n227\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.680\nmust have been at the bottom down here.\n\n228\n00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.210\nAlmost done with the hashes.\n\n229\n00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.580\nMaybe output files.\n\n230\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.000\nDebugging mode, attack modes,\nbuilt in character sets, there we go.\n\n231\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.460\nSo notice this little question mark\nright there, and then character set, and\n\n232\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.070\nthen there's these letters,\nor these codes, here.\n\n233\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.940\nSo what we're gonna do when we do this\nbrute force is I'm gonna tell it, hey,\n\n234\n00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.760\nI wanna include lower case letters.\n\n235\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.370\nSo I'm going to say question mark L.\n\n236\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.360\nIf I want to include numbers,\nI would say question mark D, alright?\n\n237\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.350\nThat's how we're going to tell it,\n\n238\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.600\nthat's how we're going to build\nthe character set, alright?\n\n239\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.160\nYou could use a single one, just question\nmark L and it would be just lower case.\n\n240\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.642\nSo if you-\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why they didn't put\n\n241\n00:12:50.642 --> 00:12:53.380\nthe numbers like, in alphabetical\norder in that left hand column?\n\n242\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.260\nSorry, that's just like,\nmy OCD kicking in there.\n\n243\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.132\n&gt;&gt; Probably-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:00.623\n&gt;&gt; Typically we start with lower case and\n\n245\n00:13:00.623 --> 00:13:02.021\nthen upper case and then numbers and\n\n246\n00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:04.040\nthen special characters\njust is a though process.\n\n247\n00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so they are like associating\nthe L for lower U for upper.\n\n248\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.906\nI'm good now, I understand this and now.\n\n249\n00:13:08.906 --> 00:13:10.741\n&gt;&gt; And so now you don't have to go and\nlook it up each time.\n\n250\n00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:13.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you can remember, hey digits,\n\n251\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.815\nokay that's my number.\n\n252\n00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:16.800\n&gt;&gt; Digits, d, okay.\n\n253\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.237\n&gt;&gt; S for special characters.\n\n254\n00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:21.620\nH for hashing,\nthose that only goes to f, right?\n\n255\n00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.310\nSo it'll be, I'm sorry, hexadecimal,\ncapital H, lowercase h, for\n\n256\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:31.470\na lowercase hexadecimal, cause it only\ngoes zero through nine and A through F.\n\n257\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.520\nAnd then the A's, actually all.\n\n258\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.300\nYou notice it includes L, U, D, and S.\n\n259\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:43.470\nSo lowercase uppercase numbers and special\ncharacters, B for all the hex values.\n\n260\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.030\nAll right.\nSo now we've got our character sets,\n\n261\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.210\nwe've got our encryption algorithm, or\na hashing algorithm that were using.\n\n262\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.590\nWe've got our hashes,\nwe're pretty much good to go.\n\n263\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.914\nSo to run our brute force attack,\n\n264\n00:13:57.914 --> 00:14:03.861\nit's going to be hashtag,\nright and then dash m 1800.\n\n265\n00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:06.050\nThat's our encryption algorithm.\n\n266\n00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:12.170\nThat's specifying that sha 5 12 unit\nwith a dollar sign, 6 dollar sign.\n\n267\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.209\nAnd then dash a 3, that's that brute\nforce mode, remember the attack mode.\n\n268\n00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.540\n0 1 2 3 4.\n\n269\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.045\nThen it's gonna be a dash 1.\n\n270\n00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.486\nAlright, now what this /1 is,\n\n271\n00:14:25.486 --> 00:14:30.950\nis I'm building a character set that\nI wanna use for this brute force.\n\n272\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.670\nAnd you can actually do,\nI think four, total.\n\n273\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.748\nSo you can do a /1 and\nyou can build your character set.\n\n274\n00:14:35.748 --> 00:14:40.850\nA /2 and build another character\nset that it can try independent,\n\n275\n00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:46.030\nlike, we're gonna do a -1,\nand then I want to use,\n\n276\n00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:51.670\nI know that my passwords\nare all lower case and digits.\n\n277\n00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.980\nThere's no upper case,\nthere's no special characters.\n\n278\n00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.430\nSo I'm limited what characters\nI'm even going to try.\n\n279\n00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.090\nBut with this, once you specify\nthe character sets you wanna use.\n\n280\n00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:06.020\nYou also have to tell it the what's\ncalled a mask, all right.\n\n281\n00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.740\nWhich is how many characters\nbasically we want to be\n\n282\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.740\nwe'll say the maximum on that try.\n\n283\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.170\nAnd if I set up my mask, and\nthe way I set up my mask is ?1,\n\n284\n00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:23.100\none because this is my first\ncharacter said that I'm created it.\n\n285\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.450\nIf I added multiples, If I added dash\ntwo and then a different character set.\n\n286\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.750\nIt'll be question mark two\nquestion mark two for that one.\n\n287\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.480\nSo question mark one and\nthen I'm gonna do several of those.\n\n288\n00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.360\nEach one of those question mark\none represents a character space.\n\n289\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.870\nSo in this case, if I just left\nit like this, question mark one\n\n290\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:45.170\nquestion mark one question mark one We're\ntalking about three-character passwords.\n\n291\n00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.333\nIf there was a four-character password,\nit wouldn't do it,\n\n292\n00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:53.821\nbecause my mask is set to only work\nwith three character passwords.\n\n293\n00:15:53.821 --> 00:15:58.381\nSo I will know that those passwords\nare up to nine characters long.\n\n294\n00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:00.163\nMaybe I know the password policy,\n\n295\n00:16:00.163 --> 00:16:04.350\nI've done a little research, social\nengineering, or I'm guessing, right?\n\n296\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.344\nI'm just like, okay, most people don't\nuse anything longer than nine, or\n\n297\n00:16:07.344 --> 00:16:08.187\nwhatever I wanna do.\n\n298\n00:16:08.187 --> 00:16:09.140\nAnd I've lost count.\n\n299\n00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:16.040\nSo that's one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight, nine, oops!\n\n300\n00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.760\nAll right, so again, character set,\nand then mask for that character set.\n\n301\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.822\nI don't need one, but\nif I wanted to do a -2 and\n\n302\n00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:32.899\nset up another character set\nthat included lower case and\n\n303\n00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:36.697\nupper case and digits, all right,\n\n304\n00:16:36.697 --> 00:16:40.621\nthen my mask would be ?2?2?2,\n\n305\n00:16:40.621 --> 00:16:45.827\nbecause that mask goes\nwith this character set.\n\n306\n00:16:45.827 --> 00:16:47.960\nSo hopefully that makes sense.\n\n307\n00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.580\nWe're just gonna stick with a one,\nand nine characters long.\n\n308\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.620\nAnd now I need output, so we'll do a -o,\nand I'm just gonna put this into cracked.\n\n309\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.730\nThat will be our file we store\nthe passwords that we've recovered.\n\n310\n00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.870\nAnd I'm also gonna do a --removed.\n\n311\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.155\nI love this command.\n\n312\n00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:10.130\nNow something we didn't talk about our\nJohn episode, but most password cracking\n\n313\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:14.750\nutilities give you the ability to stop,\nand then pick up later on.\n\n314\n00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.890\nJohn creates a John.pot file,\nin a hidden John folder, and\n\n315\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.400\nit allows me to resume a password cracking\nsession, because they can take a long\n\n316\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.310\ntime, and maybe I need to stop and\nwork on something else, or\n\n317\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.570\nthat computer needs to be used, or\nI just need to shut down or what have you.\n\n318\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.900\nI can go back and\npick up where I left off.\n\n319\n00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.480\nAnd one of the cool things about\nHashcat is if I have a file\n\n320\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.220\nthat has 30 hashes in it, and I'm working\non it, days and days are going by, and\n\n321\n00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.520\nit's slowly cracking these passwords,\nas it cracks that hash,\n\n322\n00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.540\nit puts the plain text in my output file,\nin this case cracked, and\n\n323\n00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.990\nit removes that hash\nfrom the list of hashes.\n\n324\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.280\nThat way when I go back to resume it\ndoesn't try to crack that one again.\n\n325\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.900\nIt's already cracked it.\n\n326\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.350\nSo your list of hashes gets shorter,\nand shorter, and shorter.\n\n327\n00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.140\nSo I do like that option,\nthe good old --remove.\n\n328\n00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.840\nAnd what else do I need there, Cherokee?\n\n329\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:10.970\nI need the input file, right?\n\n330\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.860\nWhere are my hashes?\n\n331\n00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.030\nAnd that is hashes, all right?\n\n332\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.640\nSo if I try to run this it's\nprobably going to scream at me.\n\n333\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.280\nIt says this is not a native OpenCL\nruntime, expect massive speed loss.\n\n334\n00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.830\nYou can use the force forced override,\nbut do not report related errors.\n\n335\n00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.900\n&gt;&gt; They don't want to hear about it?\n\n336\n00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.370\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much\nwhat they're telling.\n\n337\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.340\nThey are saying you can do it but,\ndon't call us.\n\n338\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.930\nAnd that was what those devices, when I\nshowed you the help file and the devices,\n\n339\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.130\nif we can choose OpenCL,\nwe can do kudos in there,\n\n340\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.860\nmight be one for some of your\ngraphics cards and things like that.\n\n341\n00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.200\n&gt;&gt; So would I not get this message if\nI was on a system that was a little\n\n342\n00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.380\nmore robust?\n\n343\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.980\n&gt;&gt; And you specified,\nlike let's take a look at that real quick.\n\n344\n00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.658\nLet's do hashcat -h.\n\n345\n00:19:01.658 --> 00:19:04.170\nAnd right here device type.\n\n346\n00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.520\nI would need to specify\nwhich one I wanna use.\n\n347\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.250\nOne, two, or three, CPU,\nGPU, or coprocessor.\n\n348\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.700\nAnd you can also change workload\nprofiles if you were, I don't know,\n\n349\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.160\ndoing other things with that machine,\n\n350\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.000\nmaybe you wanna just use some of\nthe resources for the password cracking.\n\n351\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.380\nObviously, it will make it take longer,\n\n352\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.520\nbut you can limit what\nHashcat is allowed to get.\n\n353\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:35.310\nAll right, now, I did kill that right?\n\n354\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.810\nThere we go.\n\n355\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.410\nSo I think we are good to go.\n\n356\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Do we need to force it?\n\n357\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe're gonna do a --force this time.\n\n358\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.160\nIn fact, you know what?\n\n359\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.980\nLet me get back to the top of the screen,\nso we can kinda see what's going on.\n\n360\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.480\nSo I'll bring that command back, so\nMike didn't have to type it all again.\n\n361\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.835\nAnd we're gonna do force, and\n\n362\n00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:56.544\nnow it'll run, even though it's telling\nme it's not gonna be great performance.\n\n363\n00:19:58.456 --> 00:20:00.821\nAnd I have a signature unmatched.\n\n364\n00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:02.580\nWhat did I miss there?\n\n365\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.170\nLet's see.\n\n366\n00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:08.970\nAll right, I see my error now, so\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n367\n00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.560\nI had the options in the wrong order.\n\n368\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.670\nVery important with Hashcat,\nthe mask information,\n\n369\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:23.040\nthe character set and\nthe mask needs to come after the file,\n\n370\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.420\ninput file that you're using, the hashes\nthat you're getting ready to crack.\n\n371\n00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.820\nSo now that I've got my order\nstraightened out, we will go ahead and\n\n372\n00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.960\nrun this command.\n\n373\n00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.910\nRemember I've got the --force in\nthere to make sure it will go anyway,\n\n374\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.560\nwith my virtual CPU.\n\n375\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.270\nAnd it's funny, let me blow this\nup a little bit for a second.\n\n376\n00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.470\nAnd if you listen,\nwe'll give it about a minute and\n\n377\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.480\na half, and I think that's going\nto change, I hear nothing yet.\n\n378\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.770\nBut as we're waiting for\nthat, you see watchdog,\n\n379\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.730\nhardware monitoring interface not found,\ntemperature abort trigger disabled,\n\n380\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.510\ntemperature retained trigger disabled.\n\n381\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.320\nIt's saying, hey, I can't stop\nthis if it starts to overheat.\n\n382\n00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.590\nMake sure you pay attention.\n\n383\n00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.500\n&gt;&gt; Should I be worried about like smoke or\nanything, Mike?\n\n384\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.354\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nMost likely.\n\n385\n00:21:05.354 --> 00:21:06.704\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, not yet.\n\n386\n00:21:06.704 --> 00:21:08.460\nWe'll turn off way before there.\n\n387\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.990\nAnd it's funny cuz it's gonna tell me.\n\n388\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.490\nLet's see, where are we at?\n\n389\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.100\nCHD is my processor and what we're using.\n\n390\n00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.130\nGives me my warnings.\n\n391\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:17.770\nAnd it starts up.\n\n392\n00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.890\nAnd then it gives me this line,\nright down here.\n\n393\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.940\nStatus, pause, resume,\nbypass checkpoint, quit.\n\n394\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.390\nSo I hit the little s for status.\n\n395\n00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.410\nI get a little message.\n\n396\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.330\nAnd I can hit it again\na few minutes later.\n\n397\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.580\nAnd it'll refresh the status, so\nthat the little s gives you your status.\n\n398\n00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.890\nAnd what we'll see is when it started,\nright, 51 seconds ago,\n\n399\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.590\nand when it thinks it's gonna end,\ncan you see that, Cherokee?\n\n400\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.357\n&gt;&gt; Something like thousands of years.\n\n401\n00:21:44.357 --> 00:21:48.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 8,416 years, and another 339 days.\n\n402\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.410\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n[LAUGH]\n\n403\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:49.927\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n404\n00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:50.930\n&gt;&gt; Just to be specific.\n\n405\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.840\n&gt;&gt; So just to make sure you know you're\nnot gonna finish in 8,416 years.\n\n406\n00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.185\nIt's gonna be closer to 8,417.\n\n407\n00:21:57.185 --> 00:21:59.315\nAnd then it shows me the mask I'm using.\n\n408\n00:22:00.415 --> 00:22:03.045\nAnd what else is interesting down here?\n\n409\n00:22:03.045 --> 00:22:04.915\n&gt;&gt; Now, Mike,\nthat number would change if what?\n\n410\n00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:09.635\nIf we had better hardware, if we\nchanged the search parameters, or what?\n\n411\n00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:10.385\n&gt;&gt; Yes and yes.\n\n412\n00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:11.205\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n413\n00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:14.665\nbecause if I had better hardware,\nI could do more guesses per second.\n\n414\n00:22:14.665 --> 00:22:19.752\nIf we look at my speed,\nit's taken about 8.5 milliseconds,\n\n415\n00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:24.180\nor 1,529 hashes per second,\nthat we're attempting.\n\n416\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.860\nSo it's generating random characters or\nlower case and\n\n417\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.570\nnumbers, hashing it, comparing it.\n\n418\n00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:36.860\nAnd it's doing about 1,500 of those hashes\nper second, which is pretty good, really.\n\n419\n00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.270\nBut it's for my virtual setup,\nnot for what we're trying to do.\n\n420\n00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.660\nSo yes, processor.\n\n421\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.280\nYou know, power, using GPUs,\n\n422\n00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.020\nmultiple GPUs, tuning this a little bit\nbetter could definitely shorten that time.\n\n423\n00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.950\nAnd then, character sets.\n\n424\n00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.710\nRefining the character set,\nbut there's only so\n\n425\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.850\nfar I can go with that, it's a password.\n\n426\n00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.090\nIt's made up of letters,\nnumbers and special characters.\n\n427\n00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.450\nI don't know what letters, numbers and\nspecial characters, so I kinda gotta use.\n\n428\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah if I did I wouldn't\nbe using this tool, right?\n\n429\n00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n430\n00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.566\nSo that's where, remember,\nwe talked about reconnaissance and\n\n431\n00:23:06.566 --> 00:23:09.363\ngathering information, and how important\nthat is if I can get a password policy.\n\n432\n00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:11.240\n&gt;&gt; Learning the pet names.\n\n433\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n434\n00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.260\n&gt;&gt; Pet names, absolutely.\n\n435\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay, or of course, you know we're\nreally not using this in that way.\n\n436\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.240\nSo we're in a corporate environment,\nof course.\n\n437\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.810\n&gt;&gt; And here we don't have a dictionary,\nright?\n\n438\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:25.320\nWe're just trying random letters and\nnumbers, so not really words, per se.\n\n439\n00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.190\nBut, what was I gonna say?\n\n440\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.780\nIf we had, let's say this was attacked.\n\n441\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.456\n&gt;&gt; I hear your fans kicking on.\n\n442\n00:23:32.456 --> 00:23:33.092\n&gt;&gt; Can you hear it now?\n\n443\n00:23:33.092 --> 00:23:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.860\n&gt;&gt; If I lean forward and put my mic in\nthere, you might be able to hear that.\n\n445\n00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.470\nThey are definitely heating up, so\nI'm gonna go ahead and quit this process.\n\n446\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.840\nLet's do one more status,\nsee where we're at.\n\n447\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.090\nTimeframe has actually dropped\na little bit because, hey,\n\n448\n00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.350\nwe've done three minutes worth of work.\n\n449\n00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.820\nSo we've dropped a little bit.\n\n450\n00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.060\nAnd let me go ahead and quit that.\n\n451\n00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.170\nSo I'll let it quit and\nit gives me my final statistics.\n\n452\n00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.470\nBut as I was saying, if you can\nreduce the character set, absolutely.\n\n453\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:09.420\nMaybe I am doing an attack, or\na penetration test, on an online service,\n\n454\n00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.890\nand I've got a hold of their accounts\ndatabase, and they're hashed in there.\n\n455\n00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.170\nAnd by going to their webpage and\nsigning up for\n\n456\n00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.620\na fake account, their password\npolicy was made evident to me.\n\n457\n00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.320\nCuz I tried to use special characters and\nit said, nope, you can't do that.\n\n458\n00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.820\nAnd I tried to use numbers and\nit wouldn't do that.\n\n459\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.950\n&gt;&gt; And then they tell you.\n\n460\n00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they'll say, hey,\n\n461\n00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.370\nyour password has to be made\nup of just lowercase letters.\n\n462\n00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:31.360\nThat will help me.\n\n463\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.830\nNow I can remove one of\nthose character sets.\n\n464\n00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.420\nLike I said, you can only get so\nfar with that.\n\n465\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.930\nSo processing power is\nreally the key to that.\n\n466\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:40.940\nSo we're not going to let that run.\n\n467\n00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.520\nObviously, I went ahead and killed it.\n\n468\n00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.730\nWhen we come back, Cherokee, we can take\na look at doing our dictionary attack,\n\n469\n00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.230\nas well as trying a little\nbit of a hybrid attack.\n\n470\n00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:53.040\nWhere we combine our dictionary with\nsome brute forcing by using rules,\n\n471\n00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.280\nto mangle those words.\n\n472\n00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I love it.\n\n473\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.390\nI love that word Mike.\n\n474\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.230\nAnd yeah, we've seen some mangling\nin previous episodes, but\n\n475\n00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:02.560\nwe haven't used Hashcat for that.\n\n476\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.380\nSo ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned.\n\n477\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.590\nBut we are out of time for this show,\nso we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n478\n00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.020\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n479\n00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n480\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.663\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n481\n00:25:13.663 --> 00:25:19.625\n[MUSIC]\n\n482\n00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:21.650\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",
