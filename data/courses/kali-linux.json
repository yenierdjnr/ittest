00:00:13.370\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.350\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.910\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.110\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.430\nI'm excited because we've got Mr Sean\nOriyano standing right next to me and\n\n8\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.850\nwe're getting ready to start\nour series on Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.970\nAnd Sean, Kali Linux is a very\npopular version of Linux nowadays for\n\n10\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.070\nseveral reasons.\n\n11\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.280\nBut, tell us why we want to\nlearn all about Kali Linux.\n\n12\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.710\nWhat's so great about it?\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790\n>> Well there's a lot of great\nthings about it, to be honest.\n\n14\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.440\nIt is, like you said a very powerful\noperating system is definitely what it is.\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.550\nIt's a Linux based operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.210\nIt's highly customized so it's not\nthe generic type, like Ubuntu or Fedora or\n\n17\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.060\nanything like that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.640\nIt's specifically built for\npenetration testing.\n\n19\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.100\nAnd it also, quite interestingly,\nhas a role in forensics, too.\n\n20\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.440\nIt can do that.\n\n21\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.410\nAnd it can do just\na whole range of things.\n\n22\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.160\nIf you have been through our CEH course, a\nlot of the stuff we did in there, in fact,\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.240\nall of the stuff we did\nin there was Windows.\n\n24\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.350\nWhat we're gonna be doing in here is\nshowing a lot of the same stuff that we\n\n25\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.720\ndid in there, but showing you how\nto do those same things on Kali.\n\n26\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.420\nAnd the reason why you would do this,\nsaying, well,\n\n27\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.610\nwhy would you do it on windows and and\nthen do the same thing on Kali is that,\n\n28\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.320\nthere's different approaches, shows\nyou different approaches to something.\n\n29\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.620\nAnd there's also quite frankly\nmore tools available and\n\n30\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.110\ndiverse tools available in the Linux side\nthan there just are on the Window side.\n\n31\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.050\nYou have more flexibility,\nmore power, more options.\n\n32\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.290\nAnd so this is just to open\nup a world even more for you.\n\n33\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.190\nSo this is something that you can use\nto just really enhance your power and\n\n34\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.690\ncapabilities more than they already are.\n\n35\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.070\nSo if you've taken the CEH,\n\n36\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.850\nyou're gonna get to see\na different viewpoint on things.\n\n37\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.780\nIf you haven't, well that's fine.\n\n38\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.150\nWe're gonna show you how it fits in and\nshow you the process and\n\n39\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.610\nshow you the tools you use along the way.\n\n40\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.160\nTalk about the differences and all that\ngood stuff to really kind of get you\n\n41\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.870\ngoing, get you more comfortable with it.\n\n42\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.335\nThen you can do more exploring\non your own afterwards.\n\n43\n00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:06.340\nCuz there's still plenty that we won't\neven get to in here, there's just so\n\n44\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.510\nmuch with this tool.\n\n45\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.090\nBut this is really just to\nkind of get you going, and\n\n46\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.350\nyou'll definitely be able to after all is\nsaid and done with this series of courses.\n\n47\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.510\nYou'll be able to say, oh, let me explore\nsome more here and try some stuff out.\n\n48\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.297\n>> Fantastic.\n\n49\n00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.656\nAll right, well I hope that got\nyou as excited as it got me,\n\n50\n00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:25.780\nI'm really dying to learn\na lot more about this.\n\n51\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.090\nI'm a Windows guy by nature,\n\n52\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.290\nI've played with a bunch of\ndifferent versions of Linux.\n\n53\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.390\nThis one just seems to have\neverything built in to it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.290\nI don't have a lot of compiling,\nor extra tools to do.\n\n55\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.900\nWe can do quite a lot with it.\n\n56\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.120\nSo hopefully everybody is ready.\n\n57\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.130\nSo stay tuned.\n\n58\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.972\nWe'll be back with more on Kali Linux.\n\n59\n00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:42.472\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.050\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.830\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.230\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?r\n>> I'm doing great because we are getting\n\n6\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.890\nready to kick off our Kali Linux series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.030\nI'm standing here next to Sean Oriyano,\nthat's good enough right?\n\n8\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.590\nBut we've got a great topic for\n\n9\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.450\nyou, we're going to be going\nover can I say, Kaa-lee Linux?\n\n10\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.410\nI know you've been saying Kay-lee Linux,\nis there a reason for that?\n\n11\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.520\nOr it is just-\n>> Nah.\n\n12\n00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.760\n>> I just like to be different, I guess.\n\n13\n00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.980\n>> I apologize then, I don't know what\nthe proper pronunciation for that is,\n\n14\n00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.720\nwe'll go with Kay-lee Linux.\n\n15\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.556\nBut Kali Linux, Sean, is a distro\nof Linux we can get free obviously.\n\n16\n00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:52.850\nAnd we can download that and install it.\n\n17\n00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.460\nIt's got some pretty cool origins.\n\n18\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.940\nIt's a pretty cool distro when it comes\nto our myriad of choices out there.\n\n19\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.750\nBut tell us a little bit about Kali Linux.\n\n20\n00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.450\n>> It's funny, when I wanna say Kay-lee,\nI wanna say Kaa-lee, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.865\nthen I wanna think Kah-lee,\nfrom Indiana Jones the second movie.\n\n22\n00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:10.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n23\n00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.100\n>> The head of the cult was Kali, so.\n\n24\n00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.855\n>> I keep saying in my head, I'm going\nback to Kaa-lee, I don't know why.\n\n25\n00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:19.029\n>> Aw yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:23.390\n>> [LAUGH] It is a really good distro.\n\n27\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.430\nI'm a Windows guy,\nI've done a lot with Windows.\n\n28\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.080\nKinda dabbled in Linux, and I remember\nplaying with one called BackTracks\n\n29\n00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.920\nbecause it was one that had a lot of\nthe tools already combined into it, and\n\n30\n00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.210\nit was good for doing certain testing and\nthings like that.\n\n31\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.950\nAnd that really where Kali gets\nits history, where it's from.\n\n32\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.730\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.650\nThat's its roots is we had BackTrack for\nso many years.\n\n34\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.700\nIt went through several iterations.\n\n35\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.370\nYou saw that brought up in several\ndifferent places as one of the tools or\n\n36\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.630\nthe tool to use on the Linux side that\nbrought everything together for you.\n\n37\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.930\nIt actually did a good job,\nwe saw a lot of\n\n38\n00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.150\npeople using that tool over the years and\na lot of discussion on it.\n\n39\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.170\nAnd you can tell how popular it was by the\namount of people that still refer to it.\n\n40\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.780\nYou know you still hear people,\nlike oh well you've got Kali and\n\n41\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.140\nthen you've got BackTrack.\n\n42\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.160\nIt's like there's a little\nmore to the story there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.935\nOh well okay, I haven't seen Kali but I've\nused BackTrack, well, you kind of have.\n\n44\n00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:29.775\nWell, you know what happened is BackTrack\nwas around for a number of years.\n\n45\n00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:32.055\nLike I said it did a great job.\n\n46\n00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:36.165\nIt shares a lot in common, or\nKali shares a lot in common with it,\n\n47\n00:02:36.165 --> 00:02:38.685\nbut there definitely are some differences.\n\n48\n00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:43.345\nBasically what happened is that\nas the whole thing went on and\n\n49\n00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:47.870\nthey kept upgrading and\ndoing stuff to BackTrack.\n\n50\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.920\nReally what it amounted to is\nthey took a version of Linux and\n\n51\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.290\nthen just started putting\ntools on top of it.\n\n52\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.230\nThat's what it really was, and so they\njust initially started putting that stuff\n\n53\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.390\non top of it, and\nthen just putting more stuff on top of it.\n\n54\n00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.090\nAnd people liked it, it was great.\n\n55\n00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.520\nIt was like one-stop shopping.\n\n56\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.690\nYou had everything there\nright in that one bundle.\n\n57\n00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.780\nHowever, at one point, they decided when\nthey were going from the last version of\n\n58\n00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.920\nBackTrack, which was, I think was 5 R3,\nas I think Ben's put up here.\n\n59\n00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.460\n5 R3 was the last version of that, and\n\n60\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.700\nthey were deciding what they\nwanted to do after that version.\n\n61\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.140\nAnd what they said was,\nlet's just redo the whole thing.\n\n62\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590\nAs they started evaluating how\nthe upgrader was gonna work,\n\n63\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.690\nthey really started looking at it and\nsaid, we can do a lot better than this if\n\n64\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.030\nwe really decide just to strip the whole\nthing down and do it from the ground up.\n\n65\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.660\nSo what they did is\nthey got distrub Linux.\n\n66\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.750\nI just had a brain thing in there.\n\n67\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.600\nBut yeah, debian is what I'm looking for.\n\n68\n00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.206\nSo they took Debian and what they did\nwas they talked to the companies that\n\n69\n00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:07.316\nmade a lot of the tools that\nwere included in BackTrack.\n\n70\n00:04:07.316 --> 00:04:11.225\nAnd they said, well, we're redoing\nthings from the ground up, you know, so,\n\n71\n00:04:11.225 --> 00:04:15.310\nwhen we do this, we'd like to talk to you\nabout having much tighter integration with\n\n72\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.840\nthe product than you have in just\ninstalling it in top before.\n\n73\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.830\n>> Huh.\n>> And so,\n\n74\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.770\nthat made a lot of these\ntools work a lot better and\n\n75\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.220\nhad substantially more power than\nthey had in previous versions.\n\n76\n00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.260\nAnd you also have them just natively\nthere instead of just kinda\n\n77\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.760\ninstalled on top of it\n>> And so that gives you a lot more power,\n\n78\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.900\na lot more efficiency and\nthe ability to do a lot more things.\n\n79\n00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.830\nOverall, if you look at the two\nthey still are close enough and\n\n80\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.640\nenough similarities that if\nyou were with BackTrack and\n\n81\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.760\nyou're moving over to Kali, you're not\ngoing to have really that much problem.\n\n82\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.800\nYou may just come over and say okay, well,\nthere's a few new utilities in there.\n\n83\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.070\nBut for the most part it looks the same.\n\n84\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.160\nIf you haven't then heck no big deal.\n\n85\n00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.560\nIt's not even going to matter to you.\n\n86\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.720\nI would tell you at this point you're not\ngoing to be going with BackTrack anymore.\n\n87\n00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.120\nYou can still use it.\n\n88\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.390\nBut if you wanna be using the new\nstuff you really be on Kali and\n\n89\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.070\nnot be messing with BackTrack.\n\n90\n00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.880\nIt already has started showing its age and\nits end of life, and\n\n91\n00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.340\nthat's just gonna get more and\nmore dramatic as things go forward.\n\n92\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.720\nSo, Kali is where you wanna be.\n\n93\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.990\nYou see it referenced in all\nsorts of different places now.\n\n94\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.470\nThey don't mention BackTrack\nnearly as much as they used to.\n\n95\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.300\nI was even last week, before I came here,\n\n96\n00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.075\nI was attending a seminar and\nBackTrack was never, ever even mentioned.\n\n97\n00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:49.805\nAnd we had quite a few people\nthat were pen-testers, and\n\n98\n00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:54.145\nhad probably about 40 when all was\nsaid and done in the same room,\n\n99\n00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:59.045\nand none of them mentioned BackTrack\nduring that, it was all done on Kali.\n\n100\n00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:03.400\nSo it shows you just kind of right\nthere people at that point doing it.\n\n101\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.185\n>> You know, like I said,\nfor a Windows guy like me,\n\n102\n00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:11.260\nKali is a fantastic distro because\nit has everything, as you said,\n\n103\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.660\nprecompiled in there or\nreally designed in there.\n\n104\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.320\nIt's not like they just went,\ndownloaded it, added it to their ISO and\n\n105\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.410\nput it out there.\n\n106\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.100\nI mean from the ground up, this was\nbuilt with penetration testing in mind.\n\n107\n00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.420\nIt's got just dozens, and dozens, and\n\n108\n00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.310\ndozens of tools already compiled in there,\nready to go.\n\n109\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.720\nWe've got so\nmany different ways we can run Kali Linux.\n\n110\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.870\nSo you guys are in for a real treat,\nit's a very good distro to get used to.\n\n111\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.750\nIf you're gonna do any type\nof penetration testing,\n\n112\n00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.280\nas Sean says, this is the distro to use.\n\n113\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.150\nIf you just want a Linux\ndistros to keep handy.\n\n114\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.660\nLike me as a Windows guy, I still like\nto have a nice live thumb drive now and\n\n115\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.660\nagain, because Linux has some tools\nthat I can't port over to Windows.\n\n116\n00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.370\nThis is the one to have, cuz half of\nthem are precompiled right on there.\n\n117\n00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.292\nIt's a very well-thought\nout distro of Linux.\n\n118\n00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:00.407\nI really like it.\n\n119\n00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:03.180\n>> Yeah, and there's so\nmuch support for it.\n\n120\n00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.870\nLike you said the tools are already there.\n\n121\n00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.790\nAnd then there's even the repositories\nthat you have available in every version\n\n122\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.100\nof Linux, that there's even more tools\nup there that you can add to that.\n\n123\n00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.600\nIf you have something else that you\n\n124\n00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.120\ndeveloped yourself you\ncan add it into there.\n\n125\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.560\nThere's third party developers that\nhave their own stuff that can be\n\n126\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.270\nadded in to there.\n\n127\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.270\nYou know, so,\n\n128\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.310\nit saves you the trouble of finding a lot\nof that stuff right from the get go.\n\n129\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.300\nBut, I wouldn't just limit yourself\nto what's in the interface.\n\n130\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.306\nYou know, we're gonna concentrate a lot\nof the stuff that's in the interface\n\n131\n00:07:38.306 --> 00:07:40.610\nover the course of our segments here.\n\n132\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.800\nBut don't limit yourself to just that.\n\n133\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.800\nDon't be afraid to go out and\nlook at these other things because there\n\n134\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.340\nare plenty of other things\nyou can put on top of this.\n\n135\n00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.244\nSomething to mention, by the way,\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n136\n00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:55.619\nThis version of Linux,\nyou could, if you wanted to,\n\n137\n00:07:55.619 --> 00:08:00.344\ninstall it right in your hard drive and\nput your other applications on it and\n\n138\n00:08:00.344 --> 00:08:02.748\nuse it like a desktop OS if you wanted.\n\n139\n00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:04.583\nI've seen people do that.\n\n140\n00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:08.571\nIt's not really meant for that but\nheck, if that's the way you roll,\n\n141\n00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.810\nwho am I to go through and say anything?\n\n142\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.040\nBut it wasn't intended to\nbe that sort of thing.\n\n143\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.342\nIt's like, if you're using Linux and you\nwant to have a desktop version of Linux,\n\n144\n00:08:19.342 --> 00:08:24.310\nUbuntu would be good for that,\nthose ones would be totally acceptable.\n\n145\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.149\nBut yeah, you could do it with this but\n\n146\n00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:28.400\nthat's not what they\nreally intended it for.\n\n147\n00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.875\nThey already have quite a few\nthings in there going on that,\n\n148\n00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:35.100\nit's just better to use something else for\nit.\n\n149\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.630\nYou never know, there's always\nsomebody that wants to do it.\n\n150\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.320\nI tried it just to see at one\npoint myself to see as well.\n\n151\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.690\n>> See if you could use\nit as a daily driver.\n\n152\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.160\n>> And it's like, yeah, could I have both?\n\n153\n00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.920\nYeah, can I do both things with it and\nit's like yeah, you can, but, it\n\n154\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.090\nwasn't meant for that, so it's just better\njust to leave that to something else.\n\n155\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.925\nAnd just FYI,\nsomething else l'd add on to this as\n\n156\n00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:07.630\nfar as kind of a prereqs thing sort\nof we're talking about this is.\n\n157\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.213\nAnd this is a prereqs as far as skills and\n\n158\n00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:14.989\nexpectations go is that when you talk\nabout what is Kali Linux and the fact\n\n159\n00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:19.950\nthat it has all these tools built into\nit and it's made to be easy to use and.\n\n160\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.050\nWell, relatively speaking, it's easy.\n\n161\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.130\nIt's not like Windows easy.\n\n162\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:30.085\nDon't expect to see a lot of GUI tools and\nall that in there.\n\n163\n00:09:30.085 --> 00:09:35.270\nNot only do you have to know,\nif you looked at the CEH course,\n\n164\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.790\nfor example, not only do you have to\nknow what those concepts are, but\n\n165\n00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:46.160\nnow you also have to know how to make\nthose things happen using Linux.\n\n166\n00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.890\nAnd Linux is not going to\nsay in every case, well,\n\n167\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.600\nhere's a box you can fill in and\nhit OK, it's not gonna do that.\n\n168\n00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.635\nYou have to get familiar\nwith the command line.\n\n169\n00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:58.740\n>> Yeah, I've seen people playing\naround with Kali Linux and\n\n170\n00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.540\nthey get this huge menu with all these\ndifferent tools and stuff on there.\n\n171\n00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.300\nThey click on a tool.\n\n172\n00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.010\nA shell pops open.\n\n173\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.260\nThey just stare at it.\n\n174\n00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.910\nThey go, okay and they close that one.\n\n175\n00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.070\nThen they try another tool.\n\n176\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.720\nA shell pops open and they stare at it for\na little while and go okay,\n\n177\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.270\nthat's not what I thought it was.\n\n178\n00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.470\nThere's no wizards, there's no GUI.\n\n179\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.977\nI mean there's a couple in there but\na lot of it is going to be shell driven or\n\n180\n00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:18.380\ncommand line driven.\n\n181\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.024\n>> Yeah, we want to set that expectation\nright up front that is that why,\n\n182\n00:10:23.024 --> 00:10:26.963\nwhen you're doing pen testing\nwith Windows, you have just\n\n183\n00:10:26.963 --> 00:10:32.220\na tremendous amount of GUI based tools but\nyou also have some command line.\n\n184\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.460\nBut there's not nearly as many\ncommand line tools in Windows.\n\n185\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.730\nThey are there,\nthere's no denying that they're there.\n\n186\n00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:46.313\nAnd, heck, you could, in a lot of cases,\ngo through a whole pen testing suite and\n\n187\n00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:50.240\nnever have to touch\nthe command line in Windows.\n\n188\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.300\nIf you really know what you're doing\nyou don't have to get in there.\n\n189\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.772\nNow granted, a lot of pen testers, and\npeople that do that sort of thing, still\n\n190\n00:10:58.772 --> 00:11:04.180\nhave this thing where they like to get in\nand work with the console now and then.\n\n191\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.849\nCuz there's still something satisfying\nabout typing something in and\n\n192\n00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:08.140\nsomething pops back.\n\n193\n00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.980\nAnd remember, if you're gonna do the\nconsole, it always needs to be black with\n\n194\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.540\ngreen text on it,\nbecause that's traditional hacker stuff.\n\n195\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.870\n>> That's right, if you do any other\ncolors you're not a true hacker, right?\n\n196\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.381\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n197\n00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.260\nit's more powerful with a black\nbackground with green text.\n\n198\n00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.590\nIf you use the white on black, not nearly\nas powerful, that's advanced mode.\n\n199\n00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.760\nBut yeah, just to make sure we're\nclear on that you're gonna have to get\n\n200\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.690\nfamiliar with command line, you're going\nto have to get comfortable with it.\n\n201\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.750\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes.\n\n202\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.850\nYou're going to, I mean heck,\n\n203\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.200\nI can guarantee you'll see me\nmistype a few things in here.\n\n204\n00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.680\nI've done it, hey, I still do it from time\nto time, I'm like, hold on, it happens.\n\n205\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.960\nBut don't just sit there and stare at the\nthing, figure out what's going on with it.\n\n206\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.505\nSo, there you go.\n\n207\n00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:58.730\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nwell Shawn, I'll tell you what.\n\n208\n00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:59.950\nSo, I'm sitting here on the home page.\n\n209\n00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.780\nI have browsed over to Kali Linux, looking\nat the home page, and I probably think\n\n210\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.335\nthat the first thing that I wanna do is I\nwanna go to click one of these downloads.\n\n211\n00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:10.075\nBut there's several different\noptions I've got, so\n\n212\n00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:13.795\nlet's talk about the different\nways we can install.\n\n213\n00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:16.698\nWe might go in later and\nactually show some, but\n\n214\n00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:19.685\nthere are different ways I can run Kali,\nright?\n\n215\n00:12:19.685 --> 00:12:21.635\nI can install it, I've got other options.\n\n216\n00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:22.595\nWhat are my options there?\n\n217\n00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:29.560\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of options here, a\nwhole lot of options as a matter of fact.\n\n218\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.467\nThe first thing you're going to look at\nis what you're seeing up top on there\n\n219\n00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:38.250\nis when you look at those downloads.\n\n220\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.124\nWhat they have is those should be ISOs,\nright up top, and\n\n221\n00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:47.010\nthey also have, and you can see them\navailable in the torrent version.\n\n222\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.460\nThose are the ones, if you get those ones,\nyou can, any of those ones up top, those\n\n223\n00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.060\nones, once you download you can install\nthem directly onto your hard drive or\n\n224\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.560\nburn them to a CD or\nDVD as the case may be.\n\n225\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.750\nOr you can put it on a flash drive,\nyou've got that option.\n\n226\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.000\nThat's precisely what those are for.\n\n227\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.880\nWhat you want to pay attention\nto when you look at these,\n\n228\n00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.502\nis the fact that we do have a 64 and\n32 bit version.\n\n229\n00:13:15.502 --> 00:13:20.650\nYou're gonna need to pay attention to that\nbased on what architecture you've got.\n\n230\n00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.110\nIf you have one or the other, you want to\nget the one that's appropriate for it.\n\n231\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.700\nOther than one being 32, one being 64,\nas far as what we're talking about now,\n\n232\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.160\nthere's really no appreciable difference.\n\n233\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.250\nAnd, I know, probably, there's people\nin chat room right now, and people\n\n234\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.190\nare watching us later and screaming,\ngoing hold on, there's differences.\n\n235\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:38.820\nDidn't say there wasn't.\n\n236\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.750\nI said there's no appreciable difference\nyou need to worry about right now.\n\n237\n00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.150\n>> Right.\n>> So, what you want to do is,\n\n238\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.940\nyou want to make sure you\nget the appropriate one.\n\n239\n00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.120\nYou'll also notice when\nyou look at that list,\n\n240\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.820\ndown at the bottom of those two you\ncan see some ARM versions on there.\n\n241\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.740\nThose are for another type of processor.\n\n242\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.220\nUnless you have that processor,\n\n243\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.810\nyou're probably never gonna\nworry about that at all.\n\n244\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.820\n>> One of the big things about it, and\n\n245\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.720\nI'll flip back out to the home\npage if it'll let me here.\n\n246\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.250\nI'm using Internet Explorer so\nit's a little on the slow side.\n\n247\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.550\nBut Kali is very flexible, right?\n\n248\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:17.230\nI can run it on 32 bit Intel architecture,\nI can run it on 64 bit.\n\n249\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.080\nThey've got that mini version, if I\nwanna put it on a smaller thumb drive,\n\n250\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.180\nthey've got that mini version there.\n\n251\n00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.260\nAnd I think that's their\nlittle page right there.\n\n252\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:32.248\nWe can see that it'll run on Raspberry Pi,\nOdroid, Cubox, Beagle Bones, Chromebooks,\n\n253\n00:14:32.248 --> 00:14:37.810\nanything with ARM architecture as well,\nso really, really flexible.\n\n254\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.360\nI could see building your own little\ncustom Razz Pi or something like that and\n\n255\n00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.770\nputting it on there,\ncould be kind of cool.\n\n256\n00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.900\nSo, that's really what you gotta do is\nyou've gotta pay attention to which\n\n257\n00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.750\nflavor you need, and\nthey've got some other options below that.\n\n258\n00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.360\nIf I get back over to that page again,\nsorry it's going a little slow.\n\n259\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.920\nIf I keep going down a little bit,\nas soon as it will let me, there we go.\n\n260\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.240\n>> Yeah, they've got you with\nthe virtual images there too,\n\n261\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.000\nif you wanna go that way and\ngrab them that way.\n\n262\n00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.670\nI guess it says that they moved\nthem over to Offensive Security.\n\n263\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.000\nThey're the ones that really\ngave birth to this whole thing.\n\n264\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.250\nSo they're handling that now, so\nyou can just go over and grab it.\n\n265\n00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:25.540\nEverything for this is free,\nfor Kali Linux.\n\n266\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.220\nSo don't worry, it's like oh,\nthey're going to charge me for\n\n267\n00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.800\nthis if I go over there.\n\n268\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.890\nNo, they're not going to charge you for\nit.\n\n269\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.000\nJust that they are the ones\nthat maintain that.\n\n270\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.814\nAs far as I'm concerned,\nI really don't worry about,\n\n271\n00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:45.540\nI almost never download a virtual image\nfor Kali, it's just so easy to build one.\n\n272\n00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:51.200\nThe only time I would do it is if was for\na training session\n\n273\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.420\nwhere there was a specific environment\nbuilt and customized, then I would do it.\n\n274\n00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.899\nOther than that, probably not.\n\n275\n00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:02.252\n>> If you guys want to get a first look\nat it, you've never played with a Linux\n\n276\n00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:06.003\ndistro, don't feel like diving into doing\nthe installs or something like that.\n\n277\n00:16:06.003 --> 00:16:10.079\nIt is kinda handy, virtual box is free\nas a free virtualization software.\n\n278\n00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:13.520\nVMware has their VMplayer I\nthink is free as well, download,\n\n279\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.540\nI tell you I download one the other\nday just to see if it worked.\n\n280\n00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.460\nLike a charm, downloaded the hard drive,\nit's already installed,\n\n281\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.320\nyou create a new virtual machine,\nthrough a virtual box and\n\n282\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.590\njust point at that existing hard drive and\nyou're up and running.\n\n283\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.022\nAs Shawn said,\nas extremely easy to install.\n\n284\n00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:32.420\nWe're gonna show you guys about how\nto go through that install process.\n\n285\n00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.020\nBut if you want to get started right now,\nhey go ahead and\n\n286\n00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.471\njust download that virtual box for\nimaging and use that.\n\n287\n00:16:37.471 --> 00:16:39.770\nThat's definitely a good\nway to get started.\n\n288\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:42.600\nSo they give us lots of flexibility\ndepending on what we want to do,\n\n289\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.230\nif we want to run it off a thumb drive and\nlive, we want to run it off a live CD.\n\n290\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.170\nHeck, if we want to install it,\n\n291\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:53.150\nwe use those same ISOs if we want\nto install it locally on a machine.\n\n292\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.930\nOr do a dual boot.\n\n293\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.670\nOr create your own virtual machine.\n\n294\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.840\nSo, all there for\nthe download, free, love it.\n\n295\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.370\nCan't beat that.\n\n296\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.690\n>> Yeah, it's worth mentioning at this\npoint, by the way, too, is that, yeah,\n\n297\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.340\nthere's, as you mentioned, there's\na live version, so you can pop it in\n\n298\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.760\na USB device and\nhave it run right off that USB device.\n\n299\n00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.470\nNo problem.\n\n300\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.850\nOr off of optical media,\nif that's the way you want to do it.\n\n301\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.160\nYou can definitely put it on\nthe hard drive, no problem.\n\n302\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.860\nSo you can have a dedicated\npen testing box.\n\n303\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.100\nYou can virtualize it, if you want.\n\n304\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.770\nBut there is also another mode\nthat's worth throwing in here,\n\n305\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.780\nand that is the forensics one.\n\n306\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.680\nThere actually is specifically\na forensics mode in there.\n\n307\n00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.920\nAnd that's a significant.\n\n308\n00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.000\nOption to have, especially for\n\n309\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.138\nthose of you that went through our\naward-winning forensics class.\n\n310\n00:17:44.138 --> 00:17:46.420\n>> [LAUGH] Digital forensics investigator,\n\n311\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.990\nmake sure you go check out\nthose DFI episodes, absolutely.\n\n312\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.420\nYou can actually use Kali over\non that side of the house too,\n\n313\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.080\nso it's not just something where you can\ndo this penetration testing role with.\n\n314\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.770\nYou can also take it over and\ndo forensics with as well.\n\n315\n00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:08.450\nAnd if you think about it, that's kind of\nneat because you've got a sweet tools you\n\n316\n00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.350\ncan use on pen testing and\nget familiar with it there.\n\n317\n00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.670\nAnd then if you're gonna be transitioning\nit over to a forensics role at some point,\n\n318\n00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.130\nor at least taking some of that on well,\n\n319\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.990\nyou've got a tool that you can\ncarry over that you already know.\n\n320\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.170\nIt makes it so\nyou can concentrate in other areas.\n\n321\n00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.600\nIt may not be the only tool you end\nup using, but you've got a tool\n\n322\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.680\nthere that you're familiar with\nall the other stuff inside of it.\n\n323\n00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.190\n>> And\n\n324\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.020\nthe benefit of the forensics version over\nthe live version is the forensics version\n\n325\n00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.660\nkeeps you from touching the hard drive and\nstuff like that.\n\n326\n00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:49.070\nAnd if you were in the digital\nforensic class, remember that's a huge\n\n327\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:54.310\nthing is that you can't tamper with\nthe stuff that you're analyzing.\n\n328\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.820\nYou can't tamper with or\nalter evidence, so that's a huge deal.\n\n329\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.270\nAnd it does that, a very good job with it.\n\n330\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.570\nIt loads everything into memory just\nlike it does with a live version.\n\n331\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.180\nBut it puts those extra safeties in\nplace to make sure that those things\n\n332\n00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.460\ncan't get altered.\n\n333\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.450\nAnd people have done tests where they've\nplugged a hard drive in and hashed it and\n\n334\n00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.260\nchecked it out and\ngot a fingerprint of it.\n\n335\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.810\nAnd then after they did that,\nthey did some stuff with Kali,\n\n336\n00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.490\nand then checked the hard drive again,\nand it hadn't changed.\n\n337\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.550\nSo it didn't alter it at all.\n\n338\n00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.680\nThat's what you want.\n\n339\n00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.380\n>> Absolutely.\n\n340\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.340\nThat's so impressive.\n\n341\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.860\nAnd I know we're gonna talk about it\nlater, I hate to give it all away.\n\n342\n00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:36.280\nBut I know there's one way we can install\nit, run it live off of a thumb drive.\n\n343\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.190\nBut then have an extra encrypted partition\nthat we can use to maybe if we're\n\n344\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.570\ncapturing log files or\nintercepting data or whatever.\n\n345\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.840\nHere we are doing this\nforensic investigation, and\n\n346\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.060\nI can't touch the hard drive.\n\n347\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.480\nI'm running my tools off\na live little thumb drive.\n\n348\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.450\nHow do I collect information?\n\n349\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.050\nHow do I get it off that machine, right?\n\n350\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.420\nHey, you can make an encrypted\npartition right on that thumb drive.\n\n351\n00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.420\nAnd even though the Linux part,\nthe Kali part, is running live and you're\n\n352\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.220\nnot going to have any persistence there,\nthat one volume is persistent so you can\n\n353\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:10.200\nkeep log files and things like that so\nit's a fantastic tool, it really is.\n\n354\n00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.160\nLooking forward to this whole series and\nShawn, I went ahead and pulled up\n\n355\n00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.090\na webpage here, just to give you guys\nan idea of what Shawn was talking about.\n\n356\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.290\nHe said there's a lot of tools in here, so\n\n357\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.660\nI'm gonna click on tools there's\nprobably at least 10, 15 right?\n\n358\n00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.420\n>> Let's see what we got.\n\n359\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.485\n>> Oh my goodness.\n\n360\n00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:26.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Would ya look at that, I mean,\n\n361\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.550\nlook at all the different tools\nthat are already in Kali.\n\n362\n00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.020\nThat's pretty dang impressive.\n\n363\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.200\nI'm still going,\nstill scrolling down the list there.\n\n364\n00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.450\nSo quite a few tools.\n\n365\n00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.600\nThey even give you meta packages, to\nwhere maybe you don't want all of those.\n\n366\n00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.250\nMaybe you want to make your\nown lighter version of it.\n\n367\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.570\nYou can download just the meta\npackages and create you own ISS.\n\n368\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.740\nIt's impressive stuff.\n\n369\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.680\n>> Yeah.\n\n370\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.110\nAnd that's the cool thing,\nyou have got so many options here.\n\n371\n00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:01.570\nA lot of the tools you'll see on\n\n372\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.350\nhere, you have them all available to you.\n\n373\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.720\nYou may never use them all.\n\n374\n00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.720\nI would tell you if you have the time and\nyou really want to do your homework,\n\n375\n00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.470\ntry them all to get familiar\nwith what they all do.\n\n376\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.950\nAnd we won't get time to cover them\nall here, because we're not gonna\n\n377\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.410\ngo to that nauseating level of detail.\n\n378\n00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.170\nBut we're gonna show\nyou the major areas and\n\n379\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.110\nshow you some of the ones\nin each category.\n\n380\n00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.070\nAnd then you know, once you've seen that\nyou can say, well maybe I wanna take\n\n381\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.880\na look at what this one does, or\nwhat this one does, or what this one does.\n\n382\n00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.050\nYou know so there's all sorts\nof specialized tools in there.\n\n383\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.730\nAnd by no means does the ones that they\nhave on that list are you limited to.\n\n384\n00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.390\nThere's some ones way out beyond that too.\n\n385\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.980\nYou can pull from really\nany place if you so choose.\n\n386\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.490\nYou can write your own stuff to go on\ntop of that, that's the power of Linux,\n\n387\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.350\nthat you can do all that.\n\n388\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.380\nAnd you'll just,\n\n389\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.670\nyou'll that flexibility is going to be\nsomething that you really appreciate.\n\n390\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.500\nInitially getting into\nsomething like this.\n\n391\n00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:10.500\nA new operating system coming from Windows\nit's probably going to be irritating and\n\n392\n00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.220\nfrustrating for you.\n\n393\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.220\nEveryone's been through it.\n\n394\n00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.650\nBut you'll learn it.\n\n395\n00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.280\nYou'll start cutting your teeth and\ngo okay.\n\n396\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.040\nNow I kind of see the flow of things.\n\n397\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.010\nYou'll get used to things.\n\n398\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:27.070\nIt will be second nature and so\ndon't worry about that part.\n\n399\n00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.500\nI can actually just give you a quick peek.\n\n400\n00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.080\nWe'll show you how the installation looks,\n\n401\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.230\njust in case you've never seen it all\ninstall in a virtual environment, and\n\n402\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.220\nkinda give you a peek at what that looks\nlike for those of you who haven't seen it.\n\n403\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:48.360\nWhat I have up on my screen,\nthis is Kali running in VMware's player.\n\n404\n00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.760\nSo this is a plain,\n\n405\n00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.620\nright out of the box installation,\nnothing special's been done to it.\n\n406\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.590\nWhat we have is,\n\n407\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.000\nwe have you know down at the bottom we\nhave a status bar sitting down here.\n\n408\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.330\nWe have our menus sitting up here.\n\n409\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.710\nYou can very clearly see\nthat here is our menus.\n\n410\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.370\nIn fact, we are going to spend\na lot of time here under our menus.\n\n411\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.360\nYou can see that we have a whole\nbunch of tools listed here.\n\n412\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.430\nHere is our Kali Linux one, all the stuff\nthat Mike was just showing on there.\n\n413\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.730\nOn their webpage, all those tools or\n\n414\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.610\nmost of those tools are gonna\nbe located right here.\n\n415\n00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:26.220\nYou can see they're specifically\nbroken into categories.\n\n416\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.670\nHere's our information gathering and\npoof, it comes out and\n\n417\n00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.610\nhere's a whole list of tools specifically\ndesigned for information gathering.\n\n418\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.450\nSo if you click on one of those it might\nvery well just come out even further.\n\n419\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:45.350\nThat one really,\nlook at many menus we went down on there.\n\n420\n00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.706\nIt's really really going down\nto a high level of detail,\n\n421\n00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:55.177\nor in depth level of detail\nI guess I should say.\n\n422\n00:23:55.177 --> 00:23:58.350\nSome of these things, by the way,\nif you look at it this is,\n\n423\n00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.835\nand we'll look at this\nwhen we get further in.\n\n424\n00:24:00.835 --> 00:24:05.794\nBut this live host identification,\nwhen you look at this this also shows\n\n425\n00:24:05.794 --> 00:24:10.752\nyou the diversity of tools, is you can\nsee if you look really close at this\n\n426\n00:24:10.752 --> 00:24:15.330\nyou can see that there's some of\nthese tools have a six after them.\n\n427\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.590\nThey've got tools that\nare specifically designed for IPv6.\n\n428\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:24.210\nSo there are tools here that are readily\ndesigned for it to work with that now.\n\n429\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.330\nSo you're really ready for\na lot of things.\n\n430\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:33.500\nSo if you don't know IP6 yet,\nyou've got even more reason to learn.\n\n431\n00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:38.515\nAll right, it looks like a great distros.\n\n432\n00:24:38.515 --> 00:24:43.555\nReally excited about diving into this\nweek and plugging our way through it and\n\n433\n00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:46.990\nI think our viewers,\nhopefully you guys are as excited as well,\n\n434\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.155\ncuz this is going to be a good time.\n\n435\n00:24:48.155 --> 00:24:49.165\nLots of fun stuff.\n\n436\n00:24:49.165 --> 00:24:52.585\nWell, what do you think, Sean,\nhave we pretty much done,\n\n437\n00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:56.475\nanything else you want to throw into\nour just learning about Kali and\n\n438\n00:24:56.475 --> 00:24:59.240\ngetting ready for\nall the fun we're going to have?\n\n439\n00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.630\nWell I would recommend if you're\ngonna start doing this and\n\n440\n00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.920\nfollow along with this.\n\n441\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.400\nJust go ahead and\nget Kali downloaded choose your\n\n442\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.690\nvirtualization software of\nchoice if you' wanna visualize.\n\n443\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.380\nFor what we're gonna be doing\nhere over all these segments\n\n444\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.320\nit doesn't really matter\nif you visualize it.\n\n445\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.900\nLater on you might You might have a reason\nto physically install it on something,\n\n446\n00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.680\nand that's your call on that.\n\n447\n00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.200\nBut for right now,\nchoose a virtualization software.\n\n448\n00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.220\nDon't care what it is,\nit doesn't matter to me.\n\n449\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.455\nAnd then just download the appropriate\nversion of Kali and get going.\n\n450\n00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:42.835\nIt only takes a few moments\nto install literally.\n\n451\n00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:45.425\nI mean it's very quick to install.\n\n452\n00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:49.195\nSo once you've got that done,\nyou can go ahead and\n\n453\n00:25:49.195 --> 00:25:50.295\nsee some of the stuff we're doing.\n\n454\n00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:51.925\nYou can experiment yourself.\n\n455\n00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:54.385\nIt's gonna be some trial and error.\n\n456\n00:25:54.385 --> 00:25:56.335\nJust be prepared for that.\n\n457\n00:25:56.335 --> 00:25:59.150\nWe're also gonna show you\nonce you have that set up.\n\n458\n00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.030\nAlso gonna show you in here how,\ncuz I get asked this all the time.\n\n459\n00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.540\nWell, you show us all this neat stuff.\n\n460\n00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.440\nWell, how can, you know?\n\n461\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.170\nHow can I practice it.?\n\n462\n00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.442\nWell, there's a site\ncalled Bank of America.\n\n463\n00:26:12.442 --> 00:26:12.955\nNo.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:26:12.955 --> 00:26:15.020\n>> There's this, what you can do.\n\n465\n00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.268\n>> Wait, you got my account number?\n\n466\n00:26:16.268 --> 00:26:16.771\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n467\n00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:23.930\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so and the prize is,\nbut what you can do is we're gonna,\n\n468\n00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:29.820\nI have some virtual machines that\nyou can also load that you can,\n\n469\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.129\nthey're intentionally vulnerable.\n\n470\n00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:37.875\nSo you can use them to run different tests\nagainst them, see how these tools work and\n\n471\n00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:40.155\nactually get real responses from it.\n\n472\n00:26:40.155 --> 00:26:45.795\nWe have one that can do everything that\nwill work with just basic scans to\n\n473\n00:26:45.795 --> 00:26:50.715\ndoing SQL injections,\nto testing web applications.\n\n474\n00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:54.300\nThere's so many of them available.\n\n475\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.260\nAnd that's something else\nwe're gonna get into too,\n\n476\n00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.020\nbut you're gonna wanna start\nletting the rubber hit the road by\n\n477\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.410\ngetting your virtualization software and\ngetting Kali.\n\n478\n00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.820\nLike I said, you can use whichever\none you want to use VMware,\n\n479\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.880\nif you've got access tot he full\nversion of VMware, go for it.\n\n480\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.320\nYou just wanna use the VMware player.\n\n481\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.410\nGo ahead and use that.\n\n482\n00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.010\nVirtual box, fine.\n\n483\n00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.700\nVirtual PC, get out of my class.\n\n484\n00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.120\nYou know, other than that.\n\n485\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.190\nBut, yeah you can use\nwhatever it is that you want.\n\n486\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.120\nVery good, very good.\n\n487\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.040\nWell, everybody's got their homework,\nthen.\n\n488\n00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.820\nIf you wanna follow along with these\nepisodes coming your way, get yourself\n\n489\n00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.640\na version of Kali, download your\nparticular flavor, install it your way.\n\n490\n00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.890\nIf you want to put it on a live USB, or\nCD, or you wanna install it on a VM,\n\n491\n00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.440\nor download one of those pre-created\nvirtual hard drives and fire that up.\n\n492\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.580\nDo what you gotta do, get yourself\nKali Linux so you can play along with us.\n\n493\n00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.310\nWe're not only going to show you how\nto work with Kali but actually do\n\n494\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.310\nsome actual scans and stuff and show you\nhow to set up you own little sandbox so\n\n495\n00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.600\nthat you can play along as well.\n\n496\n00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.940\nHope you guys are as syked as we are but\nfor\n\n497\n00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.800\nnow we're gonna sign off here at IT ProTv.\n\n498\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.304\nI'm Mike Rodrick and I'm Sean Oriyano\n>> And we'll see you soon.\n\n499\n00:28:05.304 --> 00:28:11.320\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.480\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.410\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.270\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.270\n>> I'm fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.240\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.610\nWe're dealing with our Kali Linux and\nin today's episode we're\n\n9\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.760\ngoing to talk about installing Kali\nbecause there really are several\n\n10\n00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.360\ndifferent ways you can go about\ninstalling Kali and working with Kali.\n\n11\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.750\nSo Sean let's talk about some\nof the different ways and\n\n12\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.280\neven show you guys a couple\nof ways we can install it.\n\n13\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.000\nYes, Kali, it does have a whole bunch of\noptions as far as how you can install it.\n\n14\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.480\nWhich way you install it really depends\non what your personal preference is.\n\n15\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.510\nAnd really what you're trying\nto accomplish would be another\n\n16\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.380\nfactor that comes into it.\n\n17\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.630\nSo, we talked about the fact that you can\nphysically install it on a hard drive.\n\n18\n00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.520\nYou can run it live, which is just\nrunning it off a piece of media.\n\n19\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.910\nYou can put it in a virtual machine, or\n\n20\n00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.380\nyou can even run it in what\nthey call forensics mode.\n\n21\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.360\nSo you have those options and\nyou could probably make some variations\n\n22\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.250\nto those two,\nif you really wanted to be honest.\n\n23\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.990\nEvery one of those offers is something.\n\n24\n00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.500\nTypically if we look at one, like the live\nversion, where someone has just download\n\n25\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.800\nthe ISO and is burning that ISO to a DVD,\nfor example.\n\n26\n00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.020\nThey're doing that just so\n\n27\n00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.200\nthey can, typically, they do that when\nthey test drive it for the first time.\n\n28\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.490\nBut it's not the only case.\n\n29\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.760\nYou can use it for other reasons, too.\n\n30\n00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.230\nIt doesn't mean, hey,\nif you're running the live version.\n\n31\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.390\nYou're just test drive it and that's it.\n\n32\n00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.740\nYou might use it just because\nit's a practical way for\n\n33\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.420\nyou to drop it into a machine and\nboot off that and\n\n34\n00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.970\nbe able to do what you need to with\nthat machine and then you can walk away.\n\n35\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.544\nI mean you can see how useful\nthat would be as a pen tester,\n\n36\n00:01:57.544 --> 00:02:00.070\nif you could get physical\naccess to a machine.\n\n37\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.410\nAnd just be able to drop that in and\nboot the machine off of it.\n\n38\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.650\nYou're now, you got to a point you're\nusing that machine's hardware but\n\n39\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.870\nyou're not touching the operating system.\n\n40\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.060\nAnd so you can run your tests and\nall that and when you're done,\n\n41\n00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080\nshut the system down,\neject the CD and walk away.\n\n42\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.520\nBoot the thing back up,\nit's back where it was.\n\n43\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.740\nSo that would be kind of useful there.\n\n44\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.960\nSo that would be the live version of it.\n\n45\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.510\nThen you have installing it\nwithin a virtual machine.\n\n46\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.170\nA virtual machine is what we're\ngonna be using here during all\n\n47\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.090\nour playing around and demoing.\n\n48\n00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.660\nWe're gonna do it that way because\nit's just easier for us to do here.\n\n49\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.340\nIt also has a practical advantage to.\n\n50\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.410\nYou can still do real world physical\npen testing with [INAUDIBLE],\n\n51\n00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.280\neven if it's installed inside a virtual\nmachine, there's no problem with that.\n\n52\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.700\nOr some limitations here or there but\nwe're not even gonna get to those yet.\n\n53\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.370\nWe'll worry about those\nwhen the time comes.\n\n54\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.300\nSo, for\nthe most part you can put something, Kali,\n\n55\n00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.970\nright inside your virtualization software.\n\n56\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.820\nRun it from there, and it'll be just fine.\n\n57\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.670\nYou can do a live install from\na virtual machine too if you want.\n\n58\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.150\nSo you can just go ahead and\nmount the ISO and start it up and\n\n59\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.860\nnot install it to the virtual hard drive.\n\n60\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.445\nOr you could install it to\nthe virtual hard drive, you're call.\n\n61\n00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.760\n>> [LAUGH] Flexibility's good, right?\n\n62\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.500\nWe all like options, and\nit sounds like that they give us plenty.\n\n63\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.790\n>> Yeah, you've got so many options.\n\n64\n00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.800\nThen you have the installation\nto a physical drive.\n\n65\n00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.338\nYou've got just installing\nit to a hard drive.\n\n66\n00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:41.860\nSo I could drop that media in and just\ninstall it on there and be ready to go.\n\n67\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.340\nNow it becomes my operating system for\nthat.\n\n68\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.040\nAnd then the other way to do it as far\nas not just install it on a hard drive,\n\n69\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.260\nyou can also install\nit on a USB drive too.\n\n70\n00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.160\nThere's no limitation for that so\n\n71\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.330\nyou can have a flash drive, you can dump\nit right on there and be ready to go.\n\n72\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.610\nAnd that gives you some really\ninteresting possibilities there,\n\n73\n00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.620\nyou think of how easy it is to sneak\nin a flash drive someplace and\n\n74\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.940\nhow many different form\nfactors flash drives come in.\n\n75\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.950\nI've even seen the James Bond style watch\nthat you pull the thing out of it and\n\n76\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.950\nplug it in.\n\n77\n00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.640\nYeah, so, you could typically or\ntechnically do it with that.\n\n78\n00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.260\nI've got pens.\n\n79\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.620\n>> Just be like zzzz.\n\n80\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.400\nThe future over there,\njust slide into your computer real quick\n\n81\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.424\n>> Yeah, just stick something like that.\n\n82\n00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:28.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, I've got a pen at home that you\n\n83\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.550\njust unscrew it, and\nit's got the USB plug right there.\n\n84\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.300\nYou just pop it in.\n\n85\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.150\nIt's easy.\n\n86\n00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.370\nAll you have to do is just you\nclip it on your shirt, it's a pen.\n\n87\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.920\nNo one's really looking at that.\n\n88\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.420\nSo you've got plenty of\noptions at that side as well.\n\n89\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.420\nAnd that that last one\nreally isn't an install but\n\n90\n00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.430\nit is an option, is that forensics mode.\n\n91\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.040\nThat forensics mode would be for doing\nimaging and investigations of a system so\n\n92\n00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.555\nit is fully capable of doing that.\n\n93\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.030\nAnd like I was saying\nin our other segment,\n\n94\n00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.950\nit looks very similar look and feel wise.\n\n95\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.790\nTo a live version of Kali\nexcept the difference is,\n\n96\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.800\nit prevents you from doing\nstuff with the drive.\n\n97\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.085\nYou can do analysis on it, but\nyou can't alter anything there.\n\n98\n00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:20.515\nSo it's almost like putting\na physical write blocker in there,\n\n99\n00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:23.545\nif you remember that from our DFI class.\n\n100\n00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:26.465\nIf you didn't do that one, it's a DFI.\n\n101\n00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:31.850\nThe DFI class talked about\na write blocker which is\n\n102\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.560\na hardware device that you plug in between\nthe hard drive and the rest of the system.\n\n103\n00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.530\nSo, it blocks writes going to the device\nso you don't alter it in any way.\n\n104\n00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.720\n>> Right, cuz if we're doing\na forensic investigation,\n\n105\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.190\none of the keys is to make sure we don't\nmodify anything we're touching cuz that's\n\n106\n00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.280\ngonna contaminate the evidence and\nthings like that.\n\n107\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.270\nSo, the fact that Kali has a mode\nthat we can turn on to prevent\n\n108\n00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.860\nany types of rights or changes to the\nsystem, just another reason why this is\n\n109\n00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.710\na great choice when it comes to\npicking your Linux disc drive.\n\n110\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.100\nAll right, so let's start with,\nwhat do you wanna do first, Sean?\n\n111\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.410\nWith all the different ways we\ncan go about installing it,\n\n112\n00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.420\nhow about installing it in a VM maybe?\n\n113\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.940\nYeah, we'll install it in a VM.\n\n114\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.258\nThat's always the good place to start\nis just to put it right inside a VM.\n\n115\n00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:23.010\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\ninstall in a VM with a virtual box.\n\n116\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.050\nThat's probably what a number of you have.\n\n117\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.750\nSo, what I'm gonna do is,\nI have on my screen here,\n\n118\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.300\nI have a virtual box started up.\n\n119\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.070\nYou can see I already have a couple\nvirtual machines over there on\n\n120\n00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.750\nthe left hand side.\n\n121\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.830\nBut I'm just gonna create another one,\nand what I'm gonna do is I will name it,\n\n122\n00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.580\nand I'll call it Kali Linux.\n\n123\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.785\nActually I spelled that the wrong way,\nit's Kali Linux.\n\n124\n00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:49.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gotta pronounce it a different way,\n\n125\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.480\nsee, it's a subtle difference.\n\n126\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.105\n>> That's right,\nwe're going back to Kali Linux.\n\n127\n00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:57.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you choose a Linux and\n\n128\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.610\nwhat you can do is if you go\n>> You can go down through the list and\n\n129\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.620\nyou can see we have a whole bunch\nof different versions in there.\n\n130\n00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.400\nWhat you should be doing is just do,\ndepending on the version you got, if you\n\n131\n00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.305\ngot 32 or 64 bit,\nyou're gonna choose the appropriate one.\n\n132\n00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:19.925\nHere I've got a 64 bit machine, and\nI've got a 64 bit version of Kali, so\n\n133\n00:07:19.925 --> 00:07:25.135\nI'm just gonna go ahead and click devium,\nbecause we said, it's based on devium.\n\n134\n00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:28.990\nThey're not gonna have Kali's\nsitting there, well I didn't see it,\n\n135\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.600\nI'll take another look, but\nthey don't have it sitting there.\n\n136\n00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.940\nThey don't even have backtrack in there.\n\n137\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.090\n>> Right, so since they don't have\nKali listed specifically as one of\n\n138\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.100\nthe versions, and what virtual box can do\nis they can have certain settings that\n\n139\n00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.420\nthat particular flavor\nof Linux might like.\n\n140\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.032\nBacktracks or Kali links doesn't\nshow up in there so you can pick,\n\n141\n00:07:48.032 --> 00:07:51.359\nsince it's based on to be in,\nwe can go ahead and pick that one.\n\n142\n00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:53.887\nI've seen some people just pick\nthat Linux like three, but\n\n143\n00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:57.035\nif you know what kernel it's based off of,\nyou can also pick that as well.\n\n144\n00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:59.321\n>> Yeah, if you know that, hey great.\n\n145\n00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:05.860\nIf not, you can usually even just choose\ngeneric one, tweak the settings anyway.\n\n146\n00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.200\n>> I mean, any edge you can really\nprobably pick any one of them and\n\n147\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.920\nit'll work just fine.\n\n148\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.530\nAs long as your, remember you gotta\nhave the platform though, 32 bit,\n\n149\n00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.400\n64 bit, that will make a difference.\n\n150\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.010\n>> Yes.\n\n151\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.420\nAnd, that is a little gotcha,\njust in case any of you run into this.\n\n152\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.509\nYou can have a situation where\nyou install your virtualization\n\n153\n00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:28.510\nsoftware on the system, and\nyou get ready to do this process.\n\n154\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.000\nAnd you go down to this version drop down\non here and when you go to the drop down\n\n155\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000\nall you see is 32 bit, and you've got\nyou're like, how the heck did that happen?\n\n156\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.080\n>> You've already downloaded\nthe 64 bit ISO and now what?\n\n157\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.930\n>> Yeah, you're like,\nwell it says 32 bit in here, but\n\n158\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:49.290\nyou know the machine absolutely is 64 bit,\nyou know that for a fact.\n\n159\n00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.740\nWhat's gonna happen with virtualization\nsoftware when it does that is you're\n\n160\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.590\nprobably gonna have to go into BIOS and\nactivate the virtualization extensions.\n\n161\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.450\nAnd then it will go ahead and it will say,\nokay now I see that they're there.\n\n162\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:06.050\nAnd the 64 bit stuff will pop up, but\nthat's if you are in that situation.\n\n163\n00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.575\nSome times it happens.\n\n164\n00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:08.355\n>> Good tip to know.\n\n165\n00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:11.465\nSo remember if you don't see\nany 64-bit options in there and\n\n166\n00:09:11.465 --> 00:09:14.190\nyou've never played with any\nvirtualization software before.\n\n167\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.265\nGood chance that the options\naren't turned on in the BIOS of\n\n168\n00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.120\nyour physical machine itself.\n\n169\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.500\nReboot your system, hit your F12,\nwhatever you gotta do to get in your BIOS.\n\n170\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.400\nEnable any virtualization\noptions through your BIOS,\n\n171\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.120\nget back into Windows if\nthat's what you're running,\n\n172\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.480\nwatch Virtual Box again and\nsee if your options don't change.\n\n173\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.140\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n174\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.310\nSo, we've got that punched in.\n\n175\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.290\nI'm gonna go ahead and click Next.\n\n176\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.900\nMemory, memory is the big\nquestion on this.\n\n177\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.890\nYou at least want to have what we've\ngot here, which is 512 megabytes.\n\n178\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.320\nYou at least want to have that.\n\n179\n00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.240\nIt will work on that.\n\n180\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.710\nI'm not gonna say it's gonna work\nreally well, but it will work.\n\n181\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:10:02.450\nAnd you should, it's really also kind of\nworth while pointing out in here is that.\n\n182\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.386\nIf you're installing this\non a physical machine,\n\n183\n00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:06.420\nif you're not installing\nthis on a virtual machine.\n\n184\n00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.750\nYou install this on a physical machine,\nit doesn't have to be a new machine.\n\n185\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.360\nYou can get an older machine and\nthis will work well on that too.\n\n186\n00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.580\nSo this really doesn't need\na ton of resources to use.\n\n187\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.680\nThat's the really cool thing about it.\n\n188\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.185\nBut that being said,\nyou probably still want to,\n\n189\n00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:28.860\nif you have it available, kick it up.\n\n190\n00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:36.980\nSo in my case I'll just go up to 1024,\n2048 is really good as well.\n\n191\n00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.912\nSo I see in here I've got it 1024,\nI click Next.\n\n192\n00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:44.600\nI'm gonna create a virtual hard drive,\nso it's just gonna create that file,\n\n193\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.740\nit's gonna install every thing onto.\n\n194\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.160\nSo I'll just go ahead and click Create.\n\n195\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.760\nThis hard drive type usually doesn't\nmatter unless you're going to be moving it\n\n196\n00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.120\nbetween virtualization platforms where\nyou have some other management or\n\n197\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.840\nadministrative stuff going on.\n\n198\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.160\nFor what we're doing, care less,\nI just leave it as the default.\n\n199\n00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.450\nSo once we have that,\nthis is an interesting one.\n\n200\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.970\nYou and I had a talk about this and\n\n201\n00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.420\nsome of you may have heard it when we\nwere talking about this on the break.\n\n202\n00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.298\nIs what type of hard drive do\nthe dynamically allocated, which\n\n203\n00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:23.100\nmeans it resizes or the fixed size where\nit takes what it needs at the beginning.\n\n204\n00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.534\nPersonally for me, I always used\ndynamically allocated with this, and\n\n205\n00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:29.978\nI've never really had\nany problems with it.\n\n206\n00:11:29.978 --> 00:11:33.390\nIn fact, interestingly enough it's been on\nthe Windows side where I've had problems\n\n207\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.540\nwith it, it hasn't been here.\n\n208\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.506\nBut you'll look at a lot of the guidance\nthat they have online that says,\n\n209\n00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:42.730\nuse a fixed size.\n\n210\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.330\nA lot of them say, fix size,\nfix size, fix size.\n\n211\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.750\nI don't know, I'm good here.\n\n212\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.820\nI'm gonna leave it as dynamically\nallocated, the machines I showed you\n\n213\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.240\nrunning are dynamically allocated, but-\n>> If it works, it works, yeah.\n\n214\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.860\nI will say that if you have a problem\ncuz I've run into the issue\n\n215\n00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.140\nthat's what we were discussing earlier,\ntrying to install Kali.\n\n216\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.960\nAnd I'm like you,\nI always use the dynamic.\n\n217\n00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.250\nThese aren't production machines.\n\n218\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.130\nI'm not worried about any performance hit\n\n219\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.660\nI take from doing\na dynamically expanding drive.\n\n220\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.240\nAnd I'm more concerned about space.\n\n221\n00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.950\nSo I don't wanna dedicate 64 gigs\n\n222\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.620\nto this drive when it's only gonna\nhave a couple gigs of data on it.\n\n223\n00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.870\nI don't wanna do a fixed drive.\n\n224\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.540\nI wanna do dynamic.\n\n225\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.110\nBut I will tell you that I've had\na situation where installed galley,\n\n226\n00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.770\nit finishes, everything looks\nlike it installed correctly.\n\n227\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.252\nBut when it goes to boot,\nit tells me I'm out of hard drive space.\n\n228\n00:12:31.252 --> 00:12:36.210\nAnd from doing a little bit of research,\nit looks like the swap volume, was unable,\n\n229\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.430\nsomething about it,\nit was unable to expand the drive, so\n\n230\n00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.930\nit saw it as the drive being out of space.\n\n231\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.190\nI switched over to a fixed size,\nand everything worked fine.\n\n232\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.540\nSo if you run into the problem,\nI would say use dynamic.\n\n233\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.290\nIf you have a problem with the dynamic\ndrive, then maybe try the fixed.\n\n234\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.950\n>> Yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.640\nJust be aware of that.\n\n236\n00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.410\nThey give you some old\nguidance here on it.\n\n237\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.230\nYou can see it defaults\nto dynamically allocated.\n\n238\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.690\nThey give you some guidance.\n\n239\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.350\nI believe on some of your virtualization\nplatforms, I know on some\n\n240\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:11.010\nof your virtualization platforms you do\nhave the ability to switch after the fact.\n\n241\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:16.800\nSo you're not exactly stuck if that\n\n242\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.500\nsituation does arise for you, but\nthat said, dynamically allocated.\n\n243\n00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.830\nI'll leave it as it is for right now,\nanything else and see here's the thing.\n\n244\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:30.290\nIt's saying how much space does it need\nfor that, for the virtual hard drive.\n\n245\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.290\nSo what I'll do, is just go to be safe,\n\n246\n00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.830\nI'll do 20 gigabytes.\n\n247\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.410\nI know it's not gonna be that big,\nbut yeah, that's the way I'll do it.\n\n248\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.840\nSo I'll go ahead and click Create.\n\n249\n00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.840\nAnd I have a virtual machine that's been,\nit's been populated.\n\n250\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.330\nIt's basically an empty,\nkind of just an empty system right now.\n\n251\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.810\nI always like to, when I'm doing this,\nI like to, [INAUDIBLE] the machine and\n\n252\n00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.030\ngo to settings.\n\n253\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.610\nAnd just to doublecheck,\neverything's what I need to have.\n\n254\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.470\nThere are some things that\nare worth doing in Virtual Box.\n\n255\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.470\nThis is the way you set it up.\n\n256\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.710\nSome of the other virtualization\nsoftware does this, not all of them.\n\n257\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:23.196\nBut what you have here under the General\nsection, under the Advanced tab,\n\n258\n00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:28.790\nyou can see here the sharing of clipboards\nif you set them to bidirectional.\n\n259\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.555\nIt means you can actually move stuff\nback between virtually the host machine\n\n260\n00:14:31.555 --> 00:14:32.570\nand this one.\n\n261\n00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.980\nIt's not always the best situation to do.\n\n262\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.480\nYou notice you can set it to go one way or\njust the other way, or\n\n263\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.190\nin this case both or you can by\ndefault it's shut off completely.\n\n264\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.330\nSo if you want to make your life\na little easier, maybe copy stuff in and\n\n265\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.600\ncopy stuff out,\nthat would be the way you could do it.\n\n266\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.630\nBut I wouldn't tell you just go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.930\nturn it on as a matter of\nfact anytime you go in.\n\n268\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.240\nThink about if that's something\nthat's worth you doing,\n\n269\n00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.570\nbecause there is a potential\nsecurity risk there.\n\n270\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.680\nThere's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.\n\n271\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.820\nIf you can drag stuff between\nthe host machine and that machine,\n\n272\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.000\none of the reasons why we\nsay we do virtualization\n\n273\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.900\nis because we had that sandbox,\nthat enclosed environment.\n\n274\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.120\nYou've just busted that sandbox there,\nto a certain degree.\n\n275\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.808\nSo anyway, and I know some of\nthem just don't plain allow it or\n\n276\n00:15:22.808 --> 00:15:25.250\nare unaware of a way to allow it.\n\n277\n00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.789\nI think if you're one of\nthe people that use HyperV,\n\n278\n00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:32.500\nI don't think HyperV there's\neven a way to turn it on.\n\n279\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.755\nI think Hyper-V just blocks completely\nin that state, but I may be wrong.\n\n280\n00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:37.545\n>> Yeah.\nI'm pretty sure you'd have to network them\n\n281\n00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:41.295\ntogether and set up shared folder like\na normal network or something like that.\n\n282\n00:15:41.295 --> 00:15:41.845\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n283\n00:15:41.845 --> 00:15:44.805\nsomething to keep in mind if\nyou're in your own sandbox and you\n\n284\n00:15:44.805 --> 00:15:48.450\nwanna be able to move stuff back and forth\n>> That might be the easiest way to go.\n\n285\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.835\nIf you're doing a PIN test or\n\n286\n00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:53.609\nsomething like that you might not want\nany sharing between the host machine.\n\n287\n00:15:53.609 --> 00:15:56.380\nAnd a quick question from the chat room,\n\n288\n00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.203\nJason asks wouldn't a fixed size be\nbetter for portability of the VM?\n\n289\n00:16:01.203 --> 00:16:03.531\nWell, I think it might depend\non what you're trying to do.\n\n290\n00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:05.912\nIf you're putting this\non a USB hard drive and\n\n291\n00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:09.710\nyou wanna take it to another machine\nthat's also running VirtualBox.\n\n292\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.560\nI don't think it would\n\n293\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.000\nreally matter because the file's\non the portable hard drive.\n\n294\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.710\nIf you're talking about trying to put this\non a live, like on a thumb drive to run it\n\n295\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.240\nlive, you're not gonna have that option\nto create fixed or dynamic, right.\n\n296\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.135\nIt's gonna install on that thumb drive,\nso if I'm not mistaken.\n\n297\n00:16:25.135 --> 00:16:29.660\n>> Yeah, I've never really can say\nI've even had a problem with it when\n\n298\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.460\nit's been dynamically allocated cuz\nI've copied virtual machines back and\n\n299\n00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.760\nforth just by copying to a flash drive or\nto a portable hard drive.\n\n300\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.770\nI've moved them all over the place, and\n\n301\n00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:45.650\nhad zero problems with it,\nso I can't say it's better.\n\n302\n00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.790\nOne of the things they also say\nabout a fixed drive, that comes in,\n\n303\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.510\nis also the performance issue.\n\n304\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.950\nIt could be what Mike was pointing out,\nas far as it bumping its head up against\n\n305\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.280\nthe size limit when it's trying to swap or\ngenerate a lot of files.\n\n306\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.750\nThat could definitely be a problem.\n\n307\n00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:09.220\nBut I can even say one of\nthe things I'm thinking of when you\n\n308\n00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:14.200\nwere talking about the swap file in there\nis what about If you give it enough space?\n\n309\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.700\nWhat if you went like me here,\n\n310\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.490\nand I said well,\nI'm gonna go from the 8 gigs up to 20?\n\n311\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.510\nWell, that would seem to\ntake care of the swap file.\n\n312\n00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.380\nWell, I would hope.\n\n313\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.500\n>> You would think that I did it\ndynamic and I think I gave it 64 gigs.\n\n314\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.240\nSo it should of had\nplenty of room to expand.\n\n315\n00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.930\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it could have been something on\n\n316\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.560\nmy machine, too, so like I said,\njust try it, see what you think.\n\n317\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.092\nBut as far as which one's better,\nit's really just what you need.\n\n318\n00:17:37.092 --> 00:17:39.050\nThe differing discs take up less,\nor not the differencing, but\n\n319\n00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.880\nthose dynamically expanding, take up a lot\nless space so they can grow as needed.\n\n320\n00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.510\nThey can become fragmented,\ncould be a performance hit, but\n\n321\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.100\nagain these aren't production machines.\n\n322\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.730\nThis is your penetration testing machine,\nso\n\n323\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.550\nI don't think you really\nhave to worry about it.\n\n324\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:58.545\n>> And it's really important to emphasize\nat this point we're showing you all the,\n\n325\n00:17:58.545 --> 00:18:01.495\nwe're gonna be showing you all these,\ngreat things during this whole week.\n\n326\n00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:04.945\nWe're going through different features and\ndifferent capabilities,\n\n327\n00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:10.175\nwe're gonna talk about different\nenvironments you can go in.\n\n328\n00:18:10.175 --> 00:18:14.545\nIt still falls on you to experiment\nwith all this, and test it out,\n\n329\n00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:18.270\nto see which ones are gonna\nbe more appropriate for you.\n\n330\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.510\nI can speak from experience and\nstuff I've done, but\n\n331\n00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.590\nthat is gonna be different to whatever\ndegree from what you've done.\n\n332\n00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.910\nSo you're gonna have to try this stuff\nout and see which tools you like,\n\n333\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.630\nwhich installation you like,\nwhich ones work.\n\n334\n00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.990\nSo you really gotta think about it.\n\n335\n00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.060\nI would tell you one of the things that\ncomes into play for me is that this\n\n336\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.010\ncomputer right here,\nI would never, at least right now,\n\n337\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:50.130\nI just don't want to mess with it, I would\nnever physically install Kaylee on it.\n\n338\n00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.358\nIt's not worth it because the fact\nis is Linux has problems with,\n\n339\n00:18:54.358 --> 00:18:57.290\nshouldn't say problems,\nit sounds negative, but\n\n340\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.440\nit requires extra configuration with\ntouch screens, the multi-touch.\n\n341\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.030\nAt least on this model it does.\n\n342\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.340\nAnd so I can make it work, but there's\na whole bunch of stuff I got to load and\n\n343\n00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.796\nI just don't want to mess with that.\n\n344\n00:19:06.796 --> 00:19:09.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've got older computers at home, and\n\n345\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:14.970\nif I don't have one that is suitable at\nhome, I'm using it for something else,\n\n346\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.390\nI can go up on eBay and trust me, you can\nbuy a computer for a couple hundred bucks.\n\n347\n00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.950\nAnd this will work just fine on it,\nno problem.\n\n348\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.300\n>> All right, so\nwe've got all the way through the wizard,\n\n349\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.530\nwe've created that dynamic,\nexpanding drive.\n\n350\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.190\nWe checked a couple settings in there.\n\n351\n00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.420\nWhat's the next to get\nthis thing installed?\n\n352\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.010\n>> The next thing is to go ahead and\nstart at the install.\n\n353\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:42.190\nAnd the way we do that is I am going to,\nat least in VirtualBox, click Start.\n\n354\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:48.140\nAnd when I click Start, it's going to\nbring it up, and it says on my screen,\n\n355\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.000\nwhich it will say something similar on\nyours unless you mounted it ahead of time,\n\n356\n00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.490\nit's gonna say, okay,\nwhat do you want to mount in here?\n\n357\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:03.030\nSo what it's already got\nKlinux chosen in there.\n\n358\n00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.820\nBut the reason why it's\ngot that is because\n\n359\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.240\nI had already set up one prior with it.\n\n360\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.430\nSo it says, okay, whatever the last\none you used was, it remembered it.\n\n361\n00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.280\n>> Yeah, so don't think that it's\ngonna magically find your ISO\n\n362\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.330\nthat you downloaded.\n\n363\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.650\nIt did it for Sean,\nhow come it's not finding mine?\n\n364\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.500\nHe's already browsed to it once before,\nright?\n\n365\n00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.515\n>> That's 20 years experience, guys.\n\n366\n00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.652\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what happens right there.\n\n367\n00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:27.160\n>> That's right.\n\n368\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.633\n>> It knows better, it's like,\nwe understand, here you go.\n\n369\n00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:34.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what I have here, so like I said,\n\n370\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.328\nif you click that little folder icon\nsitting over there on the right hand side,\n\n371\n00:20:40.328 --> 00:20:46.310\nit's just gonna bring up a browse window\nand you go find your ISO and that's it.\n\n372\n00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.660\nSo no big surprise, everyone can do that.\n\n373\n00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.830\nSo what I am gonna do is I will click\nStart, and so it goes ahead and\n\n374\n00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.060\nyou can see it boots the thing up.\n\n375\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.950\nAnd, boom,\nwe get this first thing up here.\n\n376\n00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.790\nIt says, how do you want to install this?\n\n377\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.260\nNow, notice it's got all these\ndifferent options on here,\n\n378\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.140\nyou've got a lot of options.\n\n379\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.332\nLooks like way beyond\nwhat we talked about.\n\n380\n00:21:08.332 --> 00:21:12.030\nAnd it's really not,\nall the stuff that we talked about's here.\n\n381\n00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:17.820\nYou can see that we have the live one,\nthat's all it is.\n\n382\n00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.740\nWe'll go ahead and load the thing in,\nall into memory and, boom, done.\n\n383\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.490\nFailsafe would be\na troubleshooting type thing,\n\n384\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.130\nwe'll worry about that when we get to it.\n\n385\n00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.530\nThe forensic mode, well,\nwe know what that one does.\n\n386\n00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.560\nBut then here's the USB options.\n\n387\n00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.340\nIf you want to install it to USB using\nKaylee, what's really neat about it is,\n\n388\n00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.840\nif you take a look at it, it's got USB\npersistence, an encrypted persistence.\n\n389\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.670\nThe neat thing about that is,\nyou were mentioning it Mike,\n\n390\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:53.050\nis that you can have it where it's\nessentially, it is a live version.\n\n391\n00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.430\nSo when you power the system off,\nthe operating system goes, poof, but\n\n392\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.515\nall the data and stuff like that\ncan be saved on that device.\n\n393\n00:21:59.515 --> 00:22:03.735\nSo that would be really neat if you've\ngot a flash drive, you get a flash drive,\n\n394\n00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:06.535\nyou put this on there, and\nyou can carry your data around.\n\n395\n00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:09.995\nAll you need is a host machine,\nplug it in, boot off the USB device, and\n\n396\n00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.365\nyou've got your stuff there.\n\n397\n00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:14.075\n>> That's beautiful, I like that option.\n\n398\n00:22:14.075 --> 00:22:16.640\n>> It's great to be able to have that.\n\n399\n00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.170\nThe installation buttons, or\nthe installation options down here,\n\n400\n00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.630\nthose are as straightforward\nas you can get.\n\n401\n00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.975\nYou can have that thing\ntalk to you if you want.\n\n402\n00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:26.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n403\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.446\n>> Would you like to play a game?\n\n404\n00:22:28.446 --> 00:22:29.726\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n405\n00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:35.065\n[LAUGH] You're sitting here, going,\nis Stephen Hawking here some place?\n\n406\n00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:37.306\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but anyway, so\n\n407\n00:22:37.306 --> 00:22:39.820\nI've got this thing up there.\n\n408\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.711\nWhat I'm gonna do is,\nI'm just gonna do the graphical install,\n\n409\n00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.290\njust to make it easier on us.\n\n410\n00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.220\nAnd so it goes through and\nit starts puking all this stuff up here.\n\n411\n00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.190\nI'll close these couple windows up\nhere that are chattering at me.\n\n412\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.920\nAnd so what we're seeing up here,\nit says, okay, language.\n\n413\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.090\nYou can see it's a very simple install.\n\n414\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.000\nWhere is your location?\n\n415\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.500\nWell, you would obviously\nchoose wherever you are.\n\n416\n00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:12.245\nKeymap, usually it's fine with choosing\nthe correct keyboard mapping for it.\n\n417\n00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:13.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n418\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.050\n>> And sometimes, depending on the power\nof your machine and how much memory you've\n\n419\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.970\nallocated to this, sometimes it can\ngo faster or slower for install.\n\n420\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.888\nUsually installation\nis pretty fast anyway.\n\n421\n00:23:24.888 --> 00:23:28.560\nBut depending on what\na specific situation is,\n\n422\n00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.700\nit might take longer,\nit might take shorter.\n\n423\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.990\nBut the thing is is that the amount\nof steps you go through for\n\n424\n00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.100\nthis are really not that many.\n\n425\n00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.120\nIt's really a short number of steps.\n\n426\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.646\nNow if we had chosen\nthe live installation of it,\n\n427\n00:23:44.646 --> 00:23:51.100\nthe live installation just will load the\nthing up and go right in to the desktop.\n\n428\n00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.741\nIt doesn't need to do any of this.\n\n429\n00:23:52.741 --> 00:23:55.816\nSo what I have here is I have a,\n\n430\n00:23:55.816 --> 00:24:00.736\nit's asking what the name\nof the machine is, so\n\n431\n00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:05.053\nI can just call it, it's a test machine.\n\n432\n00:24:05.053 --> 00:24:08.397\nThen I can go through and\nclick Continue of course.\n\n433\n00:24:08.397 --> 00:24:11.050\nI don't need to provide a domain name.\n\n434\n00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.960\nI'm in a standalone system.\n\n435\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.240\nAnd so it's just gonna go right through.\n\n436\n00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.380\nPassword, it's asking me\nwhat the password is.\n\n437\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.752\nSo I can put in just\na password I wanna use so,\n\n438\n00:24:23.752 --> 00:24:27.710\nsimple enough.\n\n439\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.360\nI just type password.\n\n440\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.300\nHopefully, it matched.\n\n441\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.920\nGuess it didn't match.\n\n442\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.150\n>> Try that one more time.\n\n443\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.250\n>> I get that sometimes.\n\n444\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.354\n>> Pesky thing, making you type it twice\nto make sure you type the same thing.\n\n445\n00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:41.139\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n446\n00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:46.580\nclock gonna be about Eastern time,\nfor here that's fine.\n\n447\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.010\nSo it just goes through and\nit's doing its job and\n\n448\n00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.230\nit's gonna ask you stuff about\nthe disk and how to format the disk.\n\n449\n00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.660\nThat's one that you do\nwant to be careful with.\n\n450\n00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:00.490\nUnless some of that's really,\nreally like a Linux guru, or really\n\n451\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:05.660\nfamiliar with it then you probably aren't\neven gonna bother messing with this.\n\n452\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.750\nIf you're in a multi-boot environment or\nsomething,\n\n453\n00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.790\nthan you are gonna have to tweak this.\n\n454\n00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.285\nSo, be careful, but usually in\nour situation, we're just saying,\n\n455\n00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:18.245\nespecially in a virtual environment,\njust use the entire disk, there's\n\n456\n00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:22.685\nreally no reason to go through and do any\nfunny segmenting and stuff like that.\n\n457\n00:25:22.685 --> 00:25:28.117\nThere are some cases, and those are very,\nvery specific like the USB persistence\n\n458\n00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:33.177\ndeal, and it'll help you with that.\n\n459\n00:25:33.177 --> 00:25:36.697\nAnd if you're having problems with, and\nyou do want to start adjusting this and\n\n460\n00:25:36.697 --> 00:25:41.187\nyou're not sure,\nyou've got some kind of scheme in mind,\n\n461\n00:25:41.187 --> 00:25:44.427\nyou're used to doing something in\nWindows and you're moving it over here.\n\n462\n00:25:44.427 --> 00:25:48.650\nThen yeah, it's like what was it,\nDaniel or something does a Linux course.\n\n463\n00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:49.570\nSo-\n>> Yeah, we've got a bunch\n\n464\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.840\nof episodes where Don and\nDaniel have gone through Linux+.\n\n465\n00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.190\nAnd they've actually talked about\nthe Logical Volume Manager and\n\n466\n00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.110\ncreating partitions.\n\n467\n00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.295\nSo, if you wanna dive in a little beyond\nthe guided or just using the entire disk,\n\n468\n00:26:01.295 --> 00:26:03.245\ngo check out some of those episodes.\n\n469\n00:26:03.245 --> 00:26:07.015\n>> Yeah, and\nif you're new to the Linux world anyway,\n\n470\n00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:11.625\nI mean we're gonna get you through\nquite a bit here during the week, but\n\n471\n00:26:11.625 --> 00:26:16.995\nif you want to really unlock the power of\nthis, you're gonna wanna watch that and\n\n472\n00:26:16.995 --> 00:26:19.955\npractice to get familiar with it.\n\n473\n00:26:19.955 --> 00:26:22.392\nIt can't hurt you at all.\n\n474\n00:26:22.392 --> 00:26:23.356\n>> Exactly.\n\n475\n00:26:23.356 --> 00:26:25.328\n>> So i'm just gonna use the entire disk.\n\n476\n00:26:25.328 --> 00:26:26.560\nI hit Continue.\n\n477\n00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.493\nYeah that's the disk so fine.\n\n478\n00:26:29.493 --> 00:26:32.740\nGonna say all files in one partition.\n\n479\n00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.910\nYeah that's fine,\nI don't need to break anything out.\n\n480\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.550\nDo you want to make those changes?\n\n481\n00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.130\nYes I do want to make those changes.\n\n482\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.110\nAnd write up changes to the disk.\n\n483\n00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.710\nNotice how serious a move this is,\nit asks you a couple times.\n\n484\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.180\n>> At least four times, are you sure?\n\n485\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.180\n>> Do you wanna do this?\n\n486\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.980\nSo, go through yes I want to do that so\n\n487\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.850\nit does the partitioning, and boom, it's\ngoing to go ahead and do the installation.\n\n488\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.700\nAnd we can go to the restroom,\nwhatever else we wanna do, come back.\n\n489\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.430\nCome back in a few minutes and\nit'll be done.\n\n490\n00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.910\nIt usually does not take that long.\n\n491\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.610\nIt can take anywhere, I've seen it take\nanywhere from five to maybe ten minutes.\n\n492\n00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.800\nUsually it's not any longer than that,\nunless you happen to have some really old\n\n493\n00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.390\nhardware, then yeah it might take\na little bit longer but don't expect\n\n494\n00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.470\nit to be like some ridiculously long,\nlike a Windows install or\n\n495\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:29.590\nsomething where you're gonna have to,\ngo run some errands someplace or whatever.\n\n496\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.900\n>> I want to say in the end it's like a\nthree gig install or something like that.\n\n497\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.300\nIt's really not all that big.\n\n498\n00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.051\nAll right, I'll tell you what, while we're\nwaiting for that one to finish up, so\n\n499\n00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:42.373\nwe can show you the end result there,\nI wanna go through and throw, bleh,\n\n500\n00:27:42.373 --> 00:27:45.318\nif I could talk, show you a couple\nof other options that we can do,\n\n501\n00:27:45.318 --> 00:27:47.260\nwhen it comes to installing Kali.\n\n502\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.860\nHe's got it installing in that VM.\n\n503\n00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.505\nIf we pull up my screen real quick,\nremember we talked about downloading,\n\n504\n00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.850\nthose ISOs.\n\n505\n00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.830\nAnother way we could do this,\n\n506\n00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.580\nif you wanted to put this on\na thumb drive, for example.\n\n507\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.650\nI've got a little program\nthat I've downloaded, and\n\n508\n00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.620\nI'll share the link in a minute\ncalled Win32 Disk Imager.\n\n509\n00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.720\nI got it from Source Forge.\n\n510\n00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.710\nBasically all you do with\nthis one is find your device.\n\n511\n00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.810\nI know my thumb drive is the D\ndrive on this particular computer.\n\n512\n00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.395\nMake sure you pick the right drive,\ncuz it will format the drive right?\n\n513\n00:28:19.395 --> 00:28:20.608\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So make sure you know,\n\n514\n00:28:20.608 --> 00:28:23.340\nI mean if you have to double check\nthere's nothing wrong with it.\n\n515\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.370\nGo over there and double check and\nsee where your thumb drive is, and\n\n516\n00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.170\nmine is D:, so I'm good to go there.\n\n517\n00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.280\n>> I always find myself with these things,\n\n518\n00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.830\nwhat you said about the drive,\nI'm always plugging it,\n\n519\n00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.330\nI look at it and unplug the flash drive\nand plug it in and note, okay I got it.\n\n520\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.670\n>> Okay, that's the one, yeah.\n\n521\n00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.022\nAnd so\nbasically you just find your device.\n\n522\n00:28:43.022 --> 00:28:44.600\nYou're gonna find the ISO, and\n\n523\n00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.310\nI downloaded that ISO earlier,\nlet's see if I can go grab it real quick.\n\n524\n00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.284\nAs I've downloaded Kali somewhere on here.\n\n525\n00:28:57.284 --> 00:28:58.715\nAnd it's not an image file.\n\n526\n00:28:58.715 --> 00:29:01.720\nIt's just an ISO, so\nI'm gonna just have to change that.\n\n527\n00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.720\nThat image writer's looking for\nan IMG file, change that.\n\n528\n00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.650\nThere is my Kali Linux ISO\nthat I downloaded.\n\n529\n00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.145\nI'll click Open.\n\n530\n00:29:10.145 --> 00:29:12.060\nIt's gonna point it, and that's it.\n\n531\n00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.940\nI click Write and\nit's gonna warn me hey, are you sure?\n\n532\n00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.680\nThis is your last chance to get any\ndata off that drive before I go on.\n\n533\n00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.000\nI say yes, and\n\n534\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.750\nit's gonna cruise on through it, and\nit's gonna make my bootable thumb drive.\n\n535\n00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.770\nAnd at that point, I'm good to go.\n\n536\n00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:31.410\nThe other option that we've talked about\nwas that downloading of the pre-built.\n\n537\n00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.660\nNow, I know you guys said\nthere's some trouble.\n\n538\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.340\nIf you're watching this live, that website\nis having a little bit of trouble right\n\n539\n00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.100\nnow but they'll be back up soon.\n\n540\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.780\nAnd I went ahead and\ndownloaded the other day.\n\n541\n00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.786\nI downloaded from\nOffensive Security this right here.\n\n542\n00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:53.330\nKali-Linux-1.1.0a-vBox-amd64, it's\na 7-zip file.\n\n543\n00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.250\nI went and extracted that out.\n\n544\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:01.050\nAnd what you end up with,\nonce you extract that out, is this OVA.\n\n545\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:06.180\nWhich is actually some kind of,\nlike an application, actually.\n\n546\n00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.530\nOr what they call an appliance,\nis really the term they use.\n\n547\n00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.120\nAnd once I've extracted it out,\nall I'm gonna do is double click on it.\n\n548\n00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.117\nAnd give it just a second.\n\n549\n00:30:17.138 --> 00:30:18.975\nOr ten seconds.\n\n550\n00:30:18.975 --> 00:30:20.428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll watch for\n\n551\n00:30:20.428 --> 00:30:22.235\nmy little flashing window down here.\n\n552\n00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:24.400\nOh, how many of those do I have open?\n\n553\n00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:29.620\nAnd, it's thinking about it.\n\n554\n00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.120\nAnd, there we go.\n\n555\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.540\nAnd so here we go import so again, all\nI did was double click once I extracted\n\n556\n00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.010\nthat out from offensive security I\ndouble clicked on the OVA file, and\n\n557\n00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.820\nthis is what happened.\n\n558\n00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.935\nOracle opens up,\nVBox opens up, VirtualBox.\n\n559\n00:30:43.935 --> 00:30:47.910\nAnd you see all these properties,\nit's already got everything that it needs.\n\n560\n00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.895\nVendor's URL, version number, CPU, RAM.\n\n561\n00:30:51.895 --> 00:30:56.045\nSo some of these you can't really change\nsome of this, that's the only thing.\n\n562\n00:30:56.045 --> 00:30:57.880\nYou might have to change\nit after the fact.\n\n563\n00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.980\nBut it's got all these properties and\nI just click Import and\n\n564\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.160\nit's gonna begin the process.\n\n565\n00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:09.690\nAnd you'll see a new virtual machine pop\nup over here in my VirtualBox Manager.\n\n566\n00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.720\nSo, a couple of easy ways to install it.\n\n567\n00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.840\nSean's got a good one on\nthe virtual machine there.\n\n568\n00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.820\nI just showed you, in the time we're\nwaiting for that to finish, I showed you\n\n569\n00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.075\nhow to grab the ISO and burn it to a thumb\ndrive, now you've got that bootable.\n\n570\n00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:24.750\nCuz once that finishes\nburning to the thumb drive,\n\n571\n00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.520\nI can take that thumb\ndrive to any machine.\n\n572\n00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.730\nThat same screen that Sean just\nshowed us is gonna pop up.\n\n573\n00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.890\nI select live and\nI'm running it right from RAM.\n\n574\n00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.360\nThis virtual box appliance that\nI got from Offensive Security,\n\n575\n00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.070\nit's gonna finish in about 30 minutes and\nI'll have a pre-built virtual machine\n\n576\n00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.690\nextracted out with everything\nalready configured, ready to go.\n\n577\n00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.930\nI just have to log on.\n\n578\n00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.850\nSo, couple of different ways\nyou can go about installing.\n\n579\n00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.659\nHow's your install going there?\n\n580\n00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.630\n>> My install is still cruising along.\n\n581\n00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.692\nIt's still just kinda like slowly [SOUND]\n>> See if we can swap to the other screen,\n\n582\n00:31:56.692 --> 00:31:57.566\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n583\n00:31:57.566 --> 00:31:59.377\n>> We're about half way.\n\n584\n00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:00.038\n>> Halfway?\n\n585\n00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:03.301\nAll right yeah so I mean, it's gotta\nreach out and see if there's any updates,\n\n586\n00:32:03.301 --> 00:32:06.336\nI think, to the packages, if you've\ngot a network connection [CROSSTALK]\n\n587\n00:32:06.336 --> 00:32:07.948\n>> I'm not even sure it's got to that,\n\n588\n00:32:07.948 --> 00:32:11.120\nyet, it's still copying stuff out\nof the ISO, but, you know, it's,\n\n589\n00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.680\nI do have a good number of things here,\nrunning, in fact.\n\n590\n00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.670\nI've got two virtual machines running\nin the background behind this even,\n\n591\n00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:23.290\nso, it's a little taxed right now,\nbut, you know, that's fine.\n\n592\n00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.853\nAll right, well I'll tell you what Sean.\n\n593\n00:32:25.853 --> 00:32:27.046\nIn our, go ahead.\n\n594\n00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:28.870\n>> Let me interrupt you, sorry.\n\n595\n00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.250\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n596\n00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.645\n>> You showed the one for doing USB.\n\n597\n00:32:33.645 --> 00:32:35.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Installation.\n\n598\n00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:39.130\nThis is a website that I've\ngone here multiple times.\n\n599\n00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.460\nAnd this may also be of help.\n\n600\n00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.308\nIt's this Pendrivelinux.\n\n601\n00:32:42.308 --> 00:32:43.360\nMm-hm.\n\n602\n00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.420\n>> Dot com.\n\n603\n00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.150\nThis one also has their own installer and\nso\n\n604\n00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.940\nyou can just have the ISO and\ntell it which one.\n\n605\n00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.810\nAnd it will shoot it right on to the drive\nand install it on there for you.\n\n606\n00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.680\n>> Perfect.\n>> And so, and\n\n607\n00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.520\nyou can set the persistence and\neverything else in this.\n\n608\n00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.682\n>> Ooh, nice.\n>> So this is a universal USB installer.\n\n609\n00:33:02.682 --> 00:33:06.860\nAnd so it's 100% free, and\nyou can just boom boom boom,\n\n610\n00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:11.395\nwith a few button clicks,\ninstall Linux on a flash drive.\n\n611\n00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:12.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n612\n00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.250\n>> So there's several ways\nto accomplish this task.\n\n613\n00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.700\nWhat's cool about the tools here,\nthat Mike and I are talking about,\n\n614\n00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.220\nthis one and the other one.\n\n615\n00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.000\nYeah, there's other ones out there.\n\n616\n00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.870\nThis just makes it a little easier for\nyou.\n\n617\n00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.530\nSome people like having\na little more control over it.\n\n618\n00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.920\nIf you're one of those people that\nreally has to get into the and\n\n619\n00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.730\nmicromanage it or\nwhatever you want to call it, and\n\n620\n00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:40.470\nget deeply into there,\nthen these probably aren't for you.\n\n621\n00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.270\nThere are specific cases where\nthese just aren't gonna cut it,\n\n622\n00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:48.570\nwhether not you like to micro manage it or\nnot.I've seen people do little thing\n\n623\n00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:53.340\nwhere they use stuff like TrueCrypt and\nother utilities to make.\n\n624\n00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.840\nTo set the drive up a certain way so\nthey've got really a kind of secure,\n\n625\n00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:02.710\nrobust solution that's tamper proof and\nstuff like that.\n\n626\n00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.840\nBut some of the reasons they did it before\nare now covered by the new stuff but\n\n627\n00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:12.715\nthere are still some cases where you\nmight have to do it manually but\n\n628\n00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:15.725\nfortunately, those are very unique cases.\n\n629\n00:34:15.725 --> 00:34:18.487\n>> I sure do like those.\n\n630\n00:34:18.487 --> 00:34:21.905\nAll right well good deal Sean, I think\nwe've covered quite a bit in this episode.\n\n631\n00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:25.515\nWe've shown you several different\nways to get Kali Linux installed.\n\n632\n00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:29.400\nWe installed it in a virtual machine,\nthat one's running along.\n\n633\n00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.080\nWe installed it on a thumb drive so\n\n634\n00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.930\nwe can run it as a live thumb drive and\ntake it with us wherever we want.\n\n635\n00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:37.750\nHave it in our pocket any time.\n\n636\n00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.810\nWe also showed you how to download\none of those pre-built V-box or\n\n637\n00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.970\nvirtual box drives.\n\n638\n00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:45.852\nThey also have some pre-built drives for.\n\n639\n00:34:45.852 --> 00:34:49.900\nVMware so if you've got VM Player,\nyou could use that as well.\n\n640\n00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.520\nSo a bunch of different ways you can\nget this installed and get ready for\n\n641\n00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.310\nthe rest of the week, and\n\n642\n00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.740\nus going through all the different\nfun stuff we can do with Kali Linux.\n\n643\n00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.570\nSo anything else we wanna throw in our\ninstallation episode I don't think so.\n\n644\n00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.610\nI would say,\nsomebody please hIt fast forward so\n\n645\n00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.940\nthis thing installs faster,\nbut that's about it.\n\n646\n00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:15.600\nYou can see the installation,\nit's really not that involved.\n\n647\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.660\nIt's a really simple thing to do.\n\n648\n00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.230\nAnd you can see, oh we'll have,\nmine just finished.\n\n649\n00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:27.080\nAnd you can see in here just\nasking a couple more questions and\n\n650\n00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.710\nconnect to the internet,\nlike Mike was saying, to do the updates.\n\n651\n00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.920\nAnd once it's done that it\nshould be just reboot and\n\n652\n00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.520\nI'll get that log on screen and\nbe ready to go.\n\n653\n00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.080\nSo you can see, yeah,\nthese things are not that involved.\n\n654\n00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.190\nIt's not nearly what\na Windows installation is.\n\n655\n00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.370\nA Windows installation,\nyou gotta babysit it for\n\n656\n00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:49.340\na certain period of time before\nyou can let it go off on its own.\n\n657\n00:35:50.415 --> 00:35:52.980\nAnd granted, Windows installations have\ngotten better than they were, but.\n\n658\n00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.035\n>> [LAUGH] I was going to say I\nremember some of the earlier Linux\n\n659\n00:35:56.035 --> 00:35:58.915\ninstalls where you had to\nreally know you stuff!\n\n660\n00:35:58.915 --> 00:35:59.615\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Because\n\n661\n00:35:59.615 --> 00:36:01.115\nyou weren't working with\nany kind of wizards.\n\n662\n00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:04.717\nYou were at the command line and you\nreally had to understand your temp space,\n\n663\n00:36:04.717 --> 00:36:08.717\nand your swap space, and all of that\nother stuff, this makes it so easy.\n\n664\n00:36:08.717 --> 00:36:11.107\nEven I can do it.\n\n665\n00:36:11.107 --> 00:36:14.787\n>> Yeah, it's like let's make\nthis stuff easy, you know.\n\n666\n00:36:14.787 --> 00:36:18.957\nAnd so this one is indeed easy to do,\n\n667\n00:36:18.957 --> 00:36:23.677\nso you've seen how to install this, and\nlike Mike was saying, it's like you should\n\n668\n00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:27.840\nbe choosing in a way or experimenting\nwhich way's the best for you.\n\n669\n00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.190\nI would tell you as far as\ninstallation goes, start with\n\n670\n00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.350\nsomething like what we're doing here,\njust installed a virtual environment.\n\n671\n00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.030\nThat's good enough to practice and\n\n672\n00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.900\nlearn the capabilities of it if\nyou're not familiar with it.\n\n673\n00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.490\nPractice it, learn it, see what it can do.\n\n674\n00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.340\nKick the tires and all that.\n\n675\n00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.050\nAnd you can if you want, you can do a live\ninstall inside the virtual machine as\n\n676\n00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.260\nwell, but just install it,\nuse a ton of virtual machine first.\n\n677\n00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.290\nGet used to it,\nget that whole feel of capabilities and\n\n678\n00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.630\nall that, and then once you've\ngot that down, then, hey, either\n\n679\n00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.100\nresearch some other ways that you can\nconfigure and install it or experiment.\n\n680\n00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.992\nAnd go for it.\n\n681\n00:37:05.992 --> 00:37:09.560\nAll right, well I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n682\n00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:14.090\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this episode\nup and when we'll have more exciting\n\n683\n00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.110\nepisodes coming your way dealing\nwith Kali Linux so don't go far.\n\n684\n00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.210\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n685\n00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.350\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n686\n00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.504\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:37:23.504 --> 00:37:29.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.370\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.490\nHow're you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.320\n>> I'm doing awesome.\n\n6\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.970\nHow're you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.050\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.200\nWe've got another exciting\nepisode coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.610\nWe're doing our Kali Linux series and\n\n10\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.110\nin this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about configuring.\n\n11\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.670\nAnd in a previous episode we\nsaw how to get Kali installed.\n\n12\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.160\nNow that we've got it installed,\nwhat's our next step?\n\n13\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.660\nRight?\nWe've gotta make sure we set it up\n\n14\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.740\nproperly so we can actually use it.\n\n15\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.080\nSo let's just dive right in and\nlearn how to configure Kali Linux.\n\n16\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.840\n>> Yeah, so there's a number of things\nthat you're gonna be doing at this point.\n\n17\n00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.140\nAnd we're gonna show you some of these\nthings that you're gonna be doing\n\n18\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.810\nsome of them are kind of just\npersonalization type stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.430\nOther things are things that you do\nneed to do or at least consider doing.\n\n20\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.120\nAnd so we're definitely gonna go through\nthe ones that you really need to seriously\n\n21\n00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.240\nlook at doing to make sure that\neverything is all squared away.\n\n22\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.630\nCouple things that I like to\ndo right from the get go,\n\n23\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.560\nand I'll just put it up here on my\nscreen while I'm talking about it,\n\n24\n00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.580\nso this is my Kali install.\n\n25\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.460\nAnd so you can see the whole desktop,\neverything there.\n\n26\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.200\nI've logged in and all that,\nso We're in good shape.\n\n27\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.710\nThe first thing I want to do is make sure\nI have everything, you know up to date.\n\n28\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.910\nAnd you know,\ncheck to see if there's any upgrades.\n\n29\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.500\nThe way you do that, or\none of the ways you can do it,\n\n30\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.480\nthere's always more than one way\nto do things in about any product.\n\n31\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.600\nBut what I can do here is I'm\ngonna click on my button for\n\n32\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.820\nmy console, or terminal,\nup here and, remember where that is.\n\n33\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.140\nI'm just telling you right now,\n\n34\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.300\nremember where that is because\nyou will be spending time there.\n\n35\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.750\nSo, you can see that you\nknow I am logged into this.\n\n36\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.850\nAnd by the way, while this is up here,\n\n37\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.560\nif you're not already aware of this,\nif you install the live version of\n\n38\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.870\nKali, what's going to happen is your\nuser name is going to be root, and\n\n39\n00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.520\nyour password's going to be toor.\n\n40\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.120\nSo the opposite of root,\njust flipping it around.\n\n41\n00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.110\nIf you installed it on your hard drive,\n\n42\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.600\nyour password will be whatever you\nset it as during installation.\n\n43\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.790\nThe user name will still be root.\n\n44\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.430\nNow, could you change that?\n\n45\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.560\nYeah, you could change it if you want.\n\n46\n00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.610\nI would seriously consider seeing\nif you want to change that,\n\n47\n00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.550\nif you want to change that.\n\n48\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.770\nI haven't in a training environment,\ndon't really care at this point.\n\n49\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.432\nBest practice would say you'd consider\nchanging at some time down the road.\n\n50\n00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:54.988\n>> Kinda like in a windows environment\nwe don't recommend logging on as\n\n51\n00:02:54.988 --> 00:02:58.251\na domain admin all the time because\nif something was to happen.\n\n52\n00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.530\nSomething is compromised then you're\nputting your system at risk so\n\n53\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.918\nprobably not the best idea to run as\nroot but in a training environment or\n\n54\n00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.405\nwhen you're just learning it,\nin your little sandbox, that's okay.\n\n55\n00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:09.039\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n56\n00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:10.047\n>> All right.\n\n57\n00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:12.907\n>> So the way, things we can\ndo here is we can do the first\n\n58\n00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:15.767\nthing is to see if we got any,\nor we can do either one,\n\n59\n00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:20.910\nwe see that there's an upgrade available\nand see if there's any updates available.\n\n60\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.010\nAnd so, doing one versus the other,\nyou can do do at get at the command line,\n\n61\n00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.090\nand then do update, and here's the thing.\n\n62\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.880\nYou know, some of you might already be\nscreaming at this, and that's fine.\n\n63\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.270\nI'm going to point this out just in case.\n\n64\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.870\nThat's okay, it didn't really say\nthere's any things that was missing.\n\n65\n00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:48.230\nJust in case you are doing this on your\nsystem and it throws any errors or\n\n66\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.170\nanything out, notice the way I did this.\n\n67\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.970\nIt says app get update, so\nI brought that up at the bottom.\n\n68\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.160\nYou might very well have to put\none of these in front of it, sudo.\n\n69\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.230\nDo it as an escalator privileges if\nyou do it that way, and you hit Enter,\n\n70\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.560\nit will ask you for credentials of the\nperson that has administrator privileges,\n\n71\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.640\nor super user privileges, whatever.\n\n72\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.550\nSo perform just that action\nwith those elevator privileges.\n\n73\n00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.570\nSo, in this case if I run it\nas a sudo app get update,\n\n74\n00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.000\nit's doing the same type of thing.\n\n75\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.740\nI don't expect it to make any changes and\nit didn't.\n\n76\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.570\nI already have those privileges.\n\n77\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.500\nAnother thing you can do is,\nyou can do app and\n\n78\n00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.540\nyou can do an upgrade and it will do\nthe stuff and look what this one did.\n\n79\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.220\nThis one went through and said well,\nit's saying would you use another 40 megs\n\n80\n00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.490\nof additional disk space will be\nused if I choose to do this upgrade.\n\n81\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.710\nSo if you go through that\nlist you can see there's\n\n82\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.960\na good number of things that\nare being updated, upgraded rather.\n\n83\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.150\nSo, you know I might want to go ahead and\nsay yes and let it do it's thing.\n\n84\n00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.220\nAnd bring this stuff down.\n\n85\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.420\nYou want the system and get a backup,\nexcuse me, backup today.\n\n86\n00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.040\nSo, I like to this right when\nI set up the system initially,\n\n87\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.420\njust to make sure everything's\nall squared away and\n\n88\n00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.570\nI'm not working with a system that\nmight be a little bit out of date.\n\n89\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.970\nAnd do expect that by the way.\n\n90\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.530\nDo expect when you download\nthese ISOs off of wherever, or\n\n91\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.400\ndownload an appliance off of somewhere.\n\n92\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.840\nThose are something that\nwas made in the past.\n\n93\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.870\nWe know they were made in the past.\n\n94\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.850\nSo the question is, just how far\nback in the past were they made?\n\n95\n00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.060\nThese things could have been sitting\nthere for months and months and months.\n\n96\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.330\nAnd so you just have to do the updates to\nit to make sure they get what they need.\n\n97\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.250\nNow a lot of the updates will get\napplied If you're doing the installation\n\n98\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.330\nto a hard drive or\na virtual machine like I have here,\n\n99\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.380\na lot of those updates will get\napplied during the installation.\n\n100\n00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.460\nAnd you'll notice\nthe installation asked you.\n\n101\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.735\nLike you saw on the previous segment.\n\n102\n00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You saw it had network\n\n103\n00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.190\nmirror on there was saying.\n\n104\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.560\nDo you want me to configure\na network mirror, and\n\n105\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.450\nwhat's your proxy to get\nout if you have one?\n\n106\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.310\nIt was going to go look for updates.\n\n107\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.460\nAnd so it did.\n\n108\n00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.310\nIt went ahead and looked for updates.\n\n109\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.600\nIt didn't look for an upgrade at all.\n\n110\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.640\nSo in this case, I did the updates.\n\n111\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.460\nIt said it didn't find anything\nthat was of any use, so done.\n\n112\n00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.613\nIn the case of an upgrade, it very\nclearly said, yeah, it's not up to date.\n\n113\n00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:35.950\nOn the upgrade side, so\nit's upgrading various products and\n\n114\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.440\nlibraries in there, and making sure\nthose things are all brought, you know,\n\n115\n00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.360\ninto compliance, or, you know,\nat least up to the current version.\n\n116\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.340\nNow, depending on your speed and\nhow long ago this had stuff done to it.\n\n117\n00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.330\nIt could take a while.\n\n118\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.970\nThis may be that point in time where I'm\nlike looking at it saying, tap tap tap,\n\n119\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.250\nand go ahead and go out and\nget dinner or something like that.\n\n120\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.670\nIt might very well be.\n\n121\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.180\nI've seen that happen, where you pack\na lunch if you're going to watch it.\n\n122\n00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.690\nBut hopefully you're not\nthat far out of date.\n\n123\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.410\nIf you're that far out of date,\n\n124\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.060\nthen it might just be easier to\ndownload a newer version of an ISO.\n\n125\n00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.660\nOr, heck, if that's the only one, you're\njust gonna have to kind of just, you know,\n\n126\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.830\ngrin and bear it or whatever they say,\ndo that and put it up with that.\n\n127\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.730\n>> Yeah, get it done once,\nthen once you've got it done,\n\n128\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.220\nyou don't have to worry about\nit hopefully for a while.\n\n129\n00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.470\nI was trying to find on their website,\n\n130\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.360\nI know that there's a lot of\ndifferent packages in Kali.\n\n131\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.990\nAnd they do have a nice\nlink on their webpage\n\n132\n00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.850\nwhere it'll show you the latest\nversions of all the different packages.\n\n133\n00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.007\nSo if you wanted to compare and\nlook to see,\n\n134\n00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:53.528\nget that app kit update or\nthat app kit upgrade.\n\n135\n00:07:53.528 --> 00:07:55.896\nPretty much takes care of it,\nif you just wanna get all of them.\n\n136\n00:07:55.896 --> 00:08:00.094\n>> Yes, I would just go ahead and\nmake it a best practice.\n\n137\n00:08:00.094 --> 00:08:04.387\nOf doing that sort of\nthing when you get in.\n\n138\n00:08:04.387 --> 00:08:08.480\nSo you can make sure that is being done.\n\n139\n00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.220\nAnd it will update from all\nthe repositories that it's aware of and\n\n140\n00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.790\nyou can add them to there.\n\n141\n00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.540\nYou can add repositories so\nit looks in other places for other tools.\n\n142\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.250\nAnd there are plenty of other repositories\nout there that you could drop in for\n\n143\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.470\nwhatever reason.\n\n144\n00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.060\nYou know, there's so\nmany of them out there.\n\n145\n00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.820\nI'd also point out that they do this\nsort of thing on just about every\n\n146\n00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.410\nversion of Linux out there,\nthere's an update slash upgrade process.\n\n147\n00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:42.130\nUsually you're flagged anyway if\nsomething is out of date, it'll tell you.\n\n148\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.850\nThere's so many updates on there.\n\n149\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.660\nI know when I was using Ubuntu all the\ntime I would seem to get notifications.\n\n150\n00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.125\nSometimes it seemed like everyday.\n\n151\n00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was just like,\n\n152\n00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.680\nthere's some more updates.\n\n153\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.540\nYou're like, calm down guys.\n\n154\n00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.400\nJust get a few of these lined up\nbefore we go ahead and do this.\n\n155\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.660\nBut usually they're pretty good\nabout keeping you up to date anyway,\n\n156\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.090\nand it will also tell you if\nthere is an upgrade available.\n\n157\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.500\nSo you can apply those as appropriate.\n\n158\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:18.690\nBe aware though if you do and upgrade or\nupdate you're gonna want to if you've\n\n159\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.455\ncustomized anything,\none tool I think about would be Kismet.\n\n160\n00:09:24.455 --> 00:09:25.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n161\n00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.470\n>> Kismet, if you don't recall,\n\n162\n00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.850\nKismet's a utility for sniffing and\nworking with wireless devices.\n\n163\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.480\nWell, Kismet,\n\n164\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.415\nyou have to customize the configuration\nfiles to get the thing to work.\n\n165\n00:09:40.415 --> 00:09:43.575\nWell, if you've went through and\nspent all that time customizing then you\n\n166\n00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:47.845\napply updates, it can very well overwrite\nand dump your configuration file.\n\n167\n00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:48.345\n>> Hm.\n\n168\n00:09:48.345 --> 00:09:50.148\n>> And\nnow you've got a tool that won't work.\n\n169\n00:09:50.148 --> 00:09:52.325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what do you gotta do?\n\n170\n00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:54.805\nYou've gotta go through and redo that.\n\n171\n00:09:54.805 --> 00:10:01.360\nSo, be careful if you customize stuff,\ncuz that could be problematic.\n\n172\n00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.170\nI would save your configuration file,\n\n173\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.500\nstuff like that you've customized,\nput them on a flash drive.\n\n174\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.810\nThey're not gonna be that big,\n\n175\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.570\nand it keeps you from having a lot of\nneedless frustration down the road.\n\n176\n00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.967\nThat's all I'm saying, I've been there\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n177\n00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:16.886\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n178\n00:10:16.886 --> 00:10:18.195\n>> Yeah I got into it and\n\n179\n00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:20.670\nyou know what I did it multiple times.\n\n180\n00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.550\nYou know, happening once is like okay\nit happened once, don't do it again.\n\n181\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.672\nHappening multiple times it's like,\nyou're just being stupid, I'll admit it.\n\n182\n00:10:29.672 --> 00:10:30.510\n[LAUGHS]\n>> [LAUGHS]\n\n183\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.390\n>> I was like,\n\n184\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.720\nI don't believe I did that again.\n\n185\n00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.810\nI really don't.\n\n186\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.835\n>> Right, gotta remember to put those\non a portable drive, gotta do that.\n\n187\n00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.648\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not this again,\n\n188\n00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:44.710\nso just be prepared for that.\n\n189\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.160\nSo we've got those things installing.\n\n190\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.400\nIt's actually, even on my system,\nit's still doing the upgrade things,\n\n191\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.330\nit does take a little time, so\nyou can see it's still going.\n\n192\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.850\nI can see some of the tools getting\nupdated in there, which is great.\n\n193\n00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.770\nYeah, it's doing that, so usually what\nyou do is you go ahead and, like I said,\n\n194\n00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.940\nyou let that run, just let it run and\ngo through it's business and, you know,\n\n195\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.330\nwhen it's done,\nthen you can move onto the next step.\n\n196\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.400\nSo, what would be some other stuff that\nyou might configure at this point?\n\n197\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.270\nNetwork.\n\n198\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.990\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say, I don't know if\nyou wanna try to do anything with your\n\n199\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.140\nupdates going right now.\n\n200\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.310\nBut, what if I went and did ask it update\nand I didn't have any network activity.\n\n201\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.225\nIt's probably not going to be\nable to do those updates, right?\n\n202\n00:11:27.225 --> 00:11:31.770\n>> Yeah, it just won't work,\nit'll just stop right there.\n\n203\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.940\nSo and if you need to configure\nyour network adapters for\n\n204\n00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.450\nwhatever reason you can\ndo that fairly easily.\n\n205\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.710\nAnd you know it all depends,\n\n206\n00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.860\nI say fairly easily depending on\nwhat your kind of approach is.\n\n207\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.120\nMuch like our other operating systems,\nwe have a way to do that right\n\n208\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.820\nthrough the GUI and I'll just go ahead and\nwalk through with you here on screen.\n\n209\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.850\nIn fact, to get rid of the distractions\nI will minimize that, so\n\n210\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.640\nI will go over to system tools and\npreferences and\n\n211\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.940\nyou can see, in here,\nit's got network connections.\n\n212\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.140\nNow, my network connection,\nsince it's in a virtual machine,\n\n213\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.880\nI really don't have anything listed here.\n\n214\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.290\nIf this was on a physical machine,\nI could go and,\n\n215\n00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.250\nyou know, put in my additional\nnetwork adapters on here.\n\n216\n00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.810\nAnd, you know?\n\n217\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.440\nPut in, you know, whatever I need to.\n\n218\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.760\nI could, you know, name my connections,\nput my ID addresses.\n\n219\n00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.660\nYou know, in here as appropriate,\nyou just say okay,\n\n220\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.080\nI'm going to manually put it in and\ndrop all that stuff in and configure it.\n\n221\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.660\nReally, the stuff here may look a little\ndifferent, but it is really no different\n\n222\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.200\nthan when you are doing Windows or\nany other operating system.\n\n223\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.040\nIt is the exact same type of thing.\n\n224\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.660\nYou are just going to drop the stuff\nin the appropriate places and\n\n225\n00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.120\nboom you're done.\n\n226\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.990\nSo that's really what we have there.\n\n227\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.000\nOther things that are worth mentioning,\nthe cloned back address.\n\n228\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.970\nYou can dupe the the MAC address on here\nif you have some reason to do that, and\n\n229\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:06.220\nwe've already seen, in our CEH we saw\nthere's reasons why you would do that.\n\n230\n00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.730\nJust to either spoof a MAC address or\n\n231\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.960\nif we just need to look like\nsomething else we could do that.\n\n232\n00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.700\nYou would actually do that here,\nmost of that other stuff in here though,\n\n233\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.910\nyou really don't have to do much with,\nyou can just leave it as it is.\n\n234\n00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.930\nThis MTU for example,\nthat's one that typically,\n\n235\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.980\nyou don't have to mess with at all.\n\n236\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.520\nYou can leave it as it is, because that's\nthe maximum transmittable unit size.\n\n237\n00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.730\nThe size of chunks that\ncan go across the network.\n\n238\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.130\nYou should just let it go ahead and\ntake care of that itself.\n\n239\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.310\nBut in some cases,\nyou might very well want to adjust that.\n\n240\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.950\nBecause it might be optimizing it for\nyour specific environment.\n\n241\n00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.950\nSo we have, you can see for wired,\nwe have wireless over here.\n\n242\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:55.140\nIf we do the wireless, it's gonna have\nstuff specific to wireless in there.\n\n243\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.160\nAnd so I'll go right on down the line and\nconfigure what you need to and\n\n244\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.990\nname them, and you're pretty much\ndone once you've gone through.\n\n245\n00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.880\nAnd then of course you\ncan see the mobile stuff.\n\n246\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.580\nI don't know how often you might\nbe using these things, but\n\n247\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.770\nif you're gonna be doing pen testing\nover these types of mechanisms,\n\n248\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:20.650\nmobile broadband or VPN or anything\nlike that, then, boom, there you go.\n\n249\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.400\nYou can go ahead and\nconfigure that right there.\n\n250\n00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.880\nSo that's one way you can do it.\n\n251\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.840\n>> That was all under system tools,\npreferences then network connections.\n\n252\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.670\n>> Network connections.\n\n253\n00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.680\n>> Network connections okay.\n\n254\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.700\n>> Then we also have, you can do it\ntypically over here too, by clicking on\n\n255\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.900\nthe computers, you can go over here,\nright click and say edit connections.\n\n256\n00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.600\nThat usually brings you to the same spot,\nif you wanna do that.\n\n257\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.425\nYou also notice for, okay well that's\ngoing through the virtual machine.\n\n258\n00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:58.126\nBut if I had actually put in my network\nadapters and entered them directly into\n\n259\n00:14:58.126 --> 00:15:02.248\nthis, I could get the same status\ninformation I do through a Windows\n\n260\n00:15:02.248 --> 00:15:08.120\nmachine, telling me information that's\ngoing back and forth, you can do all that.\n\n261\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.440\nSo it's got quite a bit.\n\n262\n00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.438\nYou can also do this through\nthe command line, you can access,\n\n263\n00:15:14.438 --> 00:15:16.950\nyour stuff through the command line.\n\n264\n00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.370\nOkay, it's still finishing off there,\nso let me open up this,\n\n265\n00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:27.030\nif you want to look at the command line,\nyou can do IFconfig and\n\n266\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:31.150\nboom, it brings this\ninformation right up here.\n\n267\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:37.000\nRemember if this is your\nfirst time using Linux,\n\n268\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.280\nor you're stuck in a windows\nworld most of the time,\n\n269\n00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.010\nbe prepared for going,\ntap tap, is it working?\n\n270\n00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.440\nYeah you probably spelled IPconfig.\n\n271\n00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.280\n>> Why isn't IPconfig working?\n\n272\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.823\nI don't understand.\n\n273\n00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:54.843\n[LAUGH] Definitely go check out if\nyou're having any trouble at all,\n\n274\n00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:59.638\nanother selfless plug there, go check out\nour Linux plus episodes Those will get\n\n275\n00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:02.403\nyou through those basics\non that Linux stuff.\n\n276\n00:16:02.403 --> 00:16:06.247\nJust like in Windows, I've got to\nsomehow configure my TCPIP settings so\n\n277\n00:16:06.247 --> 00:16:08.050\nI can communicate on the network.\n\n278\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.850\nI can use my GUI through my system\nmenu there, my preferences.\n\n279\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.001\nI could jump up there with those\nlittle computer icon and get there.\n\n280\n00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:20.177\nAnd of course I've got my command prompt\nand ifconfig is the command to display it.\n\n281\n00:16:20.177 --> 00:16:22.090\nThe same command to modify it?\n\n282\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.490\n>> Yeah, you can through there,\nyou can use the ifconfig to modify and\n\n283\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.380\nrestore the settings here too if you so\nchoose.\n\n284\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.830\nNot a problem, just some more typing\nif you want to do it that way.\n\n285\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.380\nSome other stuff to note\nwhile we're in here is\n\n286\n00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.950\nif you look closely at\nthis you can see that.\n\n287\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.240\nIn fact,\nI'm just gonna look at the top one.\n\n288\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.300\nI mean, the bottom chunk in there.\n\n289\n00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.650\nIt says lo off to the left hand side.\n\n290\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.627\nThat's the loopback.\n\n291\n00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:53.004\nYou can see it's the loopback address.\n\n292\n00:16:53.004 --> 00:16:59.090\nWe can see the INET address\n[INAUDIBLE] 127001.\n\n293\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.520\nThat's, there's no special meaning\n\n294\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.560\nthat's here that's different from\nany other place you've seen.\n\n295\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.765\nIt's the loopback.\n\n296\n00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:11.500\nBut the one up top, the eth0,\n\n297\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:17.880\nthat represents the network adapter that\nit's using to communicate off the system.\n\n298\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.470\nIf you have multiple network adapters,\nit's gonna say eth0, eth1, eth2.\n\n299\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.959\nIt's gonna go that way.\n\n300\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.660\nNote the way I just said that.\n\n301\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.530\nIt's going to go eth0, eth1.\n\n302\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.280\nIt's going to start at 0.\n\n303\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.900\nSo, if you have one adapter on\nthe system like I got here,\n\n304\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.550\nthat LO is a virtual deal.\n\n305\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:42.430\nThat eth0, that's one connection.\n\n306\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.710\nIt's set up as 0, it's 0 indexed.\n\n307\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.830\n>> Yeah, it's a 0 index numbering system.\n\n308\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.490\nSo when you see 0 that's your first one.\n\n309\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.480\nIf you see number 1,\nthat's your second network adapter then.\n\n310\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.220\n>> Exactly.\n\n311\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.090\nSo pay very, very,\nvery close attention to that.\n\n312\n00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.470\nThat's a big, big gotcha, so\n\n313\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.010\nif you're taking notes,\nnow would be a good time to do it.\n\n314\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.810\nBecause when you start doing stuff later\non that we're gonna be going to showing\n\n315\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.687\nyou some of these tools and\nyou pop the command line in.\n\n316\n00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:14.470\nThey'll have, you'll type something in.\n\n317\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.290\nWe'll look at one called P0F.\n\n318\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.460\nIt'll ask what interface do\nyou want me to monitor on?\n\n319\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.570\nYou type in the command and\nyou put a switch in there, minus i.\n\n320\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.897\nWhich is minus i usually in most cases in\nthe interface a lot of these tools anyway\n\n321\n00:18:28.897 --> 00:18:30.781\nto kind of standardize it on that.\n\n322\n00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:35.246\nSo you put minus i, and\nif you have two network adaptors and\n\n323\n00:18:35.246 --> 00:18:40.167\nyou wanted to listen on it,\nyou better make sure if it's eth0 or\n\n324\n00:18:40.167 --> 00:18:44.384\neth1 or if it's a WLAN,\nthat's a wireless adaptor.\n\n325\n00:18:44.384 --> 00:18:46.820\nAnd that'll be WLAN0, WLAN1.\n\n326\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:54.120\nSame deal, so pay very, very, very, very,\nvery, very close attention to that.\n\n327\n00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.940\nBecause yeah, it will get you.\n\n328\n00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.420\nSo if you're ever looking\nat the syntax for\n\n329\n00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.360\na command, it says interface name, that's\nwhat they're referring to is right there.\n\n330\n00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.780\nSo just, if you're not sure which\none you're looking for ifconfig and\n\n331\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.880\nboom, look at the interfaces and you'll\nsee everything you need right there.\n\n332\n00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.830\n>> Nice.\n\n333\n00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.920\nSo we're getting that\nnetwork adapter configured so\n\n334\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.460\nthat we can connect to\nwhatever network we're on.\n\n335\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.170\nI mean obviously it supports DHCP,\nyou can statically map that guy,\n\n336\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.440\nyou've got several different ways\nyou can go in there and do that.\n\n337\n00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.380\nAnd at that point if we can go out and\ndo our app get and our updates and\n\n338\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.780\nour app get and our upgrade.\n\n339\n00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.100\nNow for us, Sean, I know we had\na question in the chat room there.\n\n340\n00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.100\nI think, who was asking?\n\n341\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.730\nBen was asking about, like, using\na distro name in that update command.\n\n342\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.960\nBecause we're running it from within\nthere, we don't have to supply that, or\n\n343\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.120\nis there some other.\n\n344\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.673\n>> You shouldn't have to use the distro.\n\n345\n00:19:50.673 --> 00:19:53.605\nThat should work with that app\nget should just work just fine.\n\n346\n00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:56.810\nDistro name or anything.\n\n347\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:58.410\nNo, I wouldn't bother putting it in there.\n\n348\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:04.960\nBut I see Michael put in something\na little different at this dash upgrade.\n\n349\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.710\nI mean,\nsome cases you might have to put that in.\n\n350\n00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.930\nI haven't had to for here.\n\n351\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.090\nAnd nor have I had to on Ubuntu either.\n\n352\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.730\n>> Gotcha.\n\n353\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.100\n>> But in some case, yeah,\nyou would have to put it in,\n\n354\n00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.670\nand usually that's pretty specific.\n\n355\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.645\nYou know that you need to put it in.\n\n356\n00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:20.320\n>> Yeah.\n\n357\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.890\nAll right, well,\nwhat else are we gonna configure then?\n\n358\n00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.510\nWe've got our networking,\nwhich obviously is a big part of it.\n\n359\n00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:30.168\nOtherwise, we're not doing much pin\ntesting, or forensics or anything,\n\n360\n00:20:30.168 --> 00:20:32.661\nso now we're connected to the network.\n\n361\n00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:36.202\nWhat's next on our list of things I\nneed to do to get this guy ready to go?\n\n362\n00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:39.892\n>> Yeah, there are definitely\na lot of other things, so\n\n363\n00:20:39.892 --> 00:20:44.160\nlet's take a look at\nthe interface again a bit.\n\n364\n00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.290\nThings we have in here.\n\n365\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.390\nFirst of all, just note we have\nthe web browser sitting up here.\n\n366\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.240\nWe're on the web browser that we've got.\n\n367\n00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.010\nThat's used in just about every place and\nevery demo, is Ice Weasel.\n\n368\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.420\nThat's the one that we use for here.\n\n369\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.140\nYes, you can get Firefox for this if\nyou really want to go ahead and use it.\n\n370\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.290\nAnd some people do, no harm, no foul.\n\n371\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.095\nI personally like keeping a couple\nweb browsers on a system.\n\n372\n00:21:08.095 --> 00:21:11.140\nJust just as a safeguard.\n\n373\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.200\nHere on my host system and\nif you're looking down there\n\n374\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.750\nat the bottom next to my start\nmenu you see the folder and\n\n375\n00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.565\nthen you see the next four icons,\nthose are all web browsers.\n\n376\n00:21:21.565 --> 00:21:24.110\n>> [LAUGH] You like to have a choice.\n\n377\n00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.960\n>> Yeah.\n\n378\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.302\nAnd notice there's no Internet Explorer,\nI evicted that really quick.\n\n379\n00:21:28.302 --> 00:21:28.802\nIt's gone.\n\n380\n00:21:28.802 --> 00:21:31.830\n[LAUGH] I would write down a list\nto add and remove features.\n\n381\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.725\nBang, bang, bang, done, get out of here.\n\n382\n00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.318\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there's that.\n\n383\n00:21:37.318 --> 00:21:41.301\nNow, if you want to add or\nremove anything from it.\n\n384\n00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:45.328\nThe way you do that is, again,\nyou go to System Tools and\n\n385\n00:21:45.328 --> 00:21:48.990\nwe have over here, we have Preferences.\n\n386\n00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.560\nAnd you can see under,\n\n387\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.670\nwell I should say right underneath\nPreferences, Admin Software.\n\n388\n00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.330\nSo it's telling you here you're\nran as a privileged user.\n\n389\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.150\nIt's letting you know that yeah,\nyou've got, you're gonna be,\n\n390\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.040\nyou've got these escalator privileges,\nthey're telling you because you could\n\n391\n00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.896\npotentially do damage,\nbut today we don't care.\n\n392\n00:22:09.896 --> 00:22:14.580\n[LAUGH]\nSo, anyway, and\n\n393\n00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.309\nI would say that if you're in here\nworking with Kali to be honest,\n\n394\n00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.400\nthis does not mean you're\ngetting a blank check for this.\n\n395\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.400\nWhat I'm going to tell you\nis that if you are using\n\n396\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.805\nsomething like Kali,\nI'm gonna assume that you're\n\n397\n00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:36.595\nprobably should know your stuff as far as\ndangers of working as a privileged user.\n\n398\n00:22:37.735 --> 00:22:39.695\nBut that still doesn't\nmean just go ahead and\n\n399\n00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:42.255\nrun it all the time because hey\nSean said we should know our stuff.\n\n400\n00:22:42.255 --> 00:22:45.390\nYeah, I said yeah you probably do,\nbut a lot of stuff goes on.\n\n401\n00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:46.130\nYou get distracted.\n\n402\n00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.110\nYou make a mistake.\n\n403\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.580\nAnd something happens.\n\n404\n00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.910\nBut right here we're not\nreally too worried about it.\n\n405\n00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:55.260\n>> This is not your install to be surfing\nthe web and to be watching YouTube videos,\n\n406\n00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.070\nand to be downloading torrents and\nthings like that, right?\n\n407\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.660\nAnd if you're logged on as\nroot doing any of those.\n\n408\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.710\nYou're putting yourself at a big risk so\nif you are, don't or\n\n409\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.350\ncreate another user, give it just basic\nprivileges then use your SUDO commands or\n\n410\n00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.280\nwhat have you when you need them.\n\n411\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.130\nBut at this point you guys should know,\ndon't be running root all the time.\n\n412\n00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.660\n>> Yeah, so here we're totally fine\nwith it but yeah, there's your warning.\n\n413\n00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:25.750\nWhat we have here is we have\nunder this add/move software,\n\n414\n00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.510\nyou can see there's a whole\nbunch of stuff there.\n\n415\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.300\nYou can search for\ndifferent packages in here and\n\n416\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.600\ngo ahead and\ndownload stuff on here as you see fit.\n\n417\n00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.250\nAnd if you don't see something\non here that you want,\n\n418\n00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:45.330\nyou actually can go into the product and\nadd new repositories.\n\n419\n00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.380\nSo if you want a repository,\nit has something that you want.\n\n420\n00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.162\nThat's not included here, then yeah, you\ncan go find what the repository is for it.\n\n421\n00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:54.810\nIf it's compatible, and\nthen just drop it right in.\n\n422\n00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.307\nAnd Really anything that's compatible\nwith Debian should work in here,\n\n423\n00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:01.420\nso that's the thing to remember.\n\n424\n00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.470\nWorks with Debian,\nit's gonna work in here.\n\n425\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.660\nHeck, if it works with Ubuntu\nit should work in here.\n\n426\n00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.440\nUbuntu is based off of\nDebian way back as well.\n\n427\n00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.930\nAnd I'll tell you by the way, if you poke\nthrough this software at some point and\n\n428\n00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:18.055\npoke through its repositories, first,\nthat's a major task if you're going to\n\n429\n00:24:18.055 --> 00:24:21.027\nbrowse through it cuz there's so\nmuch stuff in there, but\n\n430\n00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:24.568\nyou'll find some stuff there being like,\n[SOUND] who's using that?\n\n431\n00:24:24.568 --> 00:24:29.210\n[LAUGH] So, yeah,\nthere's some interesting stuff in there.\n\n432\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.330\n>> This is listing everything.\n\n433\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.500\nIf any of those were already installed\nthere'd be a little check mark in the box,\n\n434\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.320\na little icon would be open.\n\n435\n00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.070\nThose ones with the closed boxes,\nthose were more tools.\n\n436\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.780\nNot that there's not enough\nalready compiled into Kali,\n\n437\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.540\nbut you can actually go get more.\n\n438\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.090\nSo there's very specific ones.\n\n439\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.590\nI'm looking at one here, partition\neditor for acorn risk OS machines.\n\n440\n00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.030\nYou also have some\nBlackberry options in there.\n\n441\n00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.060\nSo you can browse through there and\nsee what they've got.\n\n442\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.909\nMaybe they've got something that you\nneed that's not part of the default disk\n\n443\n00:24:59.909 --> 00:25:01.768\nthat you can just download and work with.\n\n444\n00:25:01.768 --> 00:25:06.150\n>> Yeah, there are so\nmany that you can add in there.\n\n445\n00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.983\nI don't know if I'd browse through\nthe whole thing just aimlessly.\n\n446\n00:25:09.983 --> 00:25:12.599\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've done that a few times,\n\n447\n00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:16.449\ntyped in some random key words, and\nsubject areas that I'm interested in,\n\n448\n00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:19.530\nlike security, or stuff like that and\nspotted some things.\n\n449\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.520\nBut, you're probably just not going to\nwander aimlessly looking for something.\n\n450\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.170\nOther things worth mentioning,\n\n451\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.480\nthere's the other way you can\ndo a software update over here.\n\n452\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.950\nThat update we did at the command line,\nyou can also do it here.\n\n453\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.510\nRemember, I said that there's more\nthan one way to do most stuff.\n\n454\n00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.220\nI did it there.\n\n455\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.207\nYou're gonna notice in this all\nthe episodes we do here for\n\n456\n00:25:44.207 --> 00:25:46.353\nthis and the examples we do.\n\n457\n00:25:46.353 --> 00:25:49.869\nI'm probably gonna do quite a bit in\ncommand line or overdoing GUI, or\n\n458\n00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:54.102\nI'm gonna emphasize command line before I\ngo into GUI because its something that you\n\n459\n00:25:54.102 --> 00:25:55.730\nneed to get more familiar with.\n\n460\n00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.000\nSo I'm kinda trying to drill that\ninto you, that's my way of doing it.\n\n461\n00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in some cases there's not\n\n462\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.710\na GUI option.\n\n463\n00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:07.880\nUnless you were gonna write one yourself,\nit just doesn't exist,\n\n464\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.720\nso but that's the thing.\n\n465\n00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.380\nOther stuff you have\nthat you can customize,\n\n466\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:19.390\nyou can see we have under preferences you\ncan do all sorts of interesting things.\n\n467\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.930\nUp here to customize how things work.\n\n468\n00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:26.700\nThis is just look and feel, it doesn't\nreally impact the security of it at all.\n\n469\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.500\nIf you want to change it make it want to\nlook prettier or whatever, you got that.\n\n470\n00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.770\nSome people want to do that, and\n\n471\n00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.230\nwho am I to say okay you can't do it,\nbut there it is.\n\n472\n00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:42.172\nIf you want to change and\nstart tweaking things in there, you can\n\n473\n00:26:42.172 --> 00:26:47.360\ndefinitely do that all day.\n\n474\n00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.090\nThere you go.\n\n475\n00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.270\nYou might explore some of\nthe other stuff that's here on\n\n476\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.530\non this System Tools menu in\nthe Administration and Preferences.\n\n477\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:01.510\nI will tell you, by the way, when you\ninstall this physically on some hardware,\n\n478\n00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:06.310\nthere will be, now and then, be some\nchanges in what's available on the menu.\n\n479\n00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:10.670\nUsually what it is you'll see\nall the stuff you have here, but\n\n480\n00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.470\nyou'll also see some things that\nare specific to that hardware,\n\n481\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.280\nbecause it might actually recognize\nsomething with that hardware.\n\n482\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.740\nI've installed, I've installed stuff\non IBM and Lenovo machines and\n\n483\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.370\nit's picked up specific things with\nthat for the hotkeys or something.\n\n484\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.210\nIt installed something with that.\n\n485\n00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.820\nAnd so, it wasn't something\nyou'd see some place else.\n\n486\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.010\nSo, don't be surprised if you see that.\n\n487\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:44.100\nAs far as we're concerned,\nthings that are of real interest to us,\n\n488\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.580\nis we also have, I guess I should point\nout this one, it's System Settings.\n\n489\n00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.840\nThis one you might find\nyourself going into.\n\n490\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.200\nThis could be a usability issue.\n\n491\n00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:52.740\nThis one,\n\n492\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.610\nwhy I say it's a usability issue is yeah,\nyou do have the network stuff in there.\n\n493\n00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.600\nThere's just another way\nof looking at the network.\n\n494\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:06.280\nBut we also have adjusting power,\nthe mouse, if you have issues with that.\n\n495\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.120\nYou can see we have all sorts of things.\n\n496\n00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.700\nThe date and time.\n\n497\n00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.220\nThe date and time, that's gonna be an\nimportant one especially if you're using\n\n498\n00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.060\nthis forensic purposes.\n\n499\n00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.240\nAnd we went through that in the DFI cores,\nthat you need to make sure your time and\n\n500\n00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.460\ndates accurate.\n\n501\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.030\nSo that would be the same thing here with\npen testing, make sure it's accurate, so\n\n502\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.563\njust in case it doesn't pick it up.\n\n503\n00:28:26.563 --> 00:28:31.354\nAnd I have been in these situation\nwhere it definitely is not picked up\n\n504\n00:28:31.354 --> 00:28:36.062\nthe right time at all because it's\ntrying to pick it up off the BIOS or\n\n505\n00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:40.930\nsomeplace in the system like that,\nand it doesn't get it right.\n\n506\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.632\nYou can look at my system on here and\nit says it's June 28th.\n\n507\n00:28:44.632 --> 00:28:48.166\nThat's Sunday, I'm not even here yet.\n\n508\n00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:52.533\nIt says 11:53 PM.\n\n509\n00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:58.440\nMy computer down there in the bottom right\nsays 12:44 PM cuz it's on California time.\n\n510\n00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:05.954\nSo yeah, that's a mess [CROSSTALK],\nthere's really a big mess here.\n\n511\n00:29:05.954 --> 00:29:09.292\nSo you'd want to make sure\nthose things are accurate and\n\n512\n00:29:09.292 --> 00:29:12.914\ncorrect when your doing this\ncause it could be, like I said,\n\n513\n00:29:12.914 --> 00:29:17.816\npulling off the BIOS, and if you choose\na time zone when you're installing Kali,\n\n514\n00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:22.620\nit's just gonna apply offsets to that and\nthe offsets might not be correct.\n\n515\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.990\nYou might have Pacific time and\nyou say, oh, well I'm in Pacific Time.\n\n516\n00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.490\nOkay, well the BIOS is\nset to that already.\n\n517\n00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.220\nYou set the Kali at Pacific Time.\n\n518\n00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.700\nWhat Kali might do is say,\n\n519\n00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.910\nthe stuff that's in the BIOS might\nthink that that's Greenwich time and\n\n520\n00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.180\nthen offset from that, and\nnow you get some weird time off of that.\n\n521\n00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.800\nI've seen it happen.\n\n522\n00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.360\nJust be prepared that you\nmight have to tweak that.\n\n523\n00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.880\nThis is a definite case where\nyou'd have to tweak that.\n\n524\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.610\nOther stuff that's of interest,\nthere is their user accounts.\n\n525\n00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.570\nI'm not really gonna mess with that\ntoo much with what we're doing here\n\n526\n00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.080\nbecause that's covered\nin the Linux course.\n\n527\n00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.010\nAnd I also don't need to\nworry about what I do here.\n\n528\n00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:08.890\nBut if you want to have multiple users or\nanything like that, that's where you'd go.\n\n529\n00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:19.140\nSo you can see we've got a lot of stuff\nhappening here if you need to go in there.\n\n530\n00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.450\nYou know, so that's the system's settings.\n\n531\n00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.620\nAs far as what we're gonna be looking at,\n\n532\n00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:31.060\nyou can see on the menu we have all these\nthings going on all over the place.\n\n533\n00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.830\nFor the most part the stuff we're\ngoing to be looking at is going to\n\n534\n00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.640\nbe right under here under\nthe Kali Linux menu.\n\n535\n00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.250\nThe Kali Linux menu, as you saw\nwhen we did our first segment and\n\n536\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.050\nI was scrolling through it, it kept\nexpanding out, expanding, expanding out.\n\n537\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:49.030\nThose tools in there are a combination\nof tools that are GUI based\n\n538\n00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.010\nas well tools that are command line based.\n\n539\n00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.230\nDon't be surprised If you start\ngoing through this, and look, oh,\n\n540\n00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.910\nthere's DNS analysis.\n\n541\n00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.660\nI'm gonna choose DNS, enumerate off here.\n\n542\n00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:00.030\nI click on it, and all of a sudden, boom.\n\n543\n00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.290\nIt opens up a shell, and\nthere's all the options for you.\n\n544\n00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.085\n>> Wait, where's my GUI?\n\n545\n00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:04.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n546\n00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.190\nIt's just like, oh hey,\nI'll keep track of them for you.\n\n547\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.380\nBut you're still gonna have\nto go into the GUI and do it.\n\n548\n00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:18.060\nYou're gonna spending a considerable\namount of time doing stuff at the GUI.\n\n549\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.820\nI would tell you right now,\nif you're not a Linux person or\n\n550\n00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:27.115\nyou're not familiar with all these\ncommands, get used to command name, space,\n\n551\n00:31:27.115 --> 00:31:30.115\n--help, get used to it.\n\n552\n00:31:30.115 --> 00:31:34.790\n[LAUGH] That's going to be a very\nimportant, friendly thing for you.\n\n553\n00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.010\nAnd, hey, nothing wrong with that.\n\n554\n00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.782\nI don't remember every little switch,\neverything in there.\n\n555\n00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:43.310\nIt's impossible to really do that.\n\n556\n00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:47.307\nSo I just make it easier on myself, some\nof them I know off the top of my head and\n\n557\n00:31:47.307 --> 00:31:50.866\nother ones I'll just go through yep\nI want that, that, and that and\n\n558\n00:31:50.866 --> 00:31:53.410\nboom put it together and go on with it.\n\n559\n00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:58.850\nJust if you remember the --help that's\ngonna be a big, big assistance to you.\n\n560\n00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.470\n>> All right,\nwell Sean a lot of good information there.\n\n561\n00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.100\nWe've got Kali installed in\nthis episode we saw how to.\n\n562\n00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.720\nOne, do our updates to make sure you know\nbecause who knows when that distro was\n\n563\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.340\ncompiled so we downloaded that ISO, got\nit installed, but the first thing we need\n\n564\n00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.140\nto do is check and see if we've got\nany updates for that or possibly\n\n565\n00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:21.840\neven upgrades to certain programs or\nother things that are compiled in there.\n\n566\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.040\nSo we did our app get update,\nwe did our app get upgrade,\n\n567\n00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.790\nwe also saw how to configure\nthat network adapter.\n\n568\n00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.770\nGonna be very important to make sure\nour machine is on the right network so\n\n569\n00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.810\nthat we can communicate with the rest of\nthe network, and have some fun with Kali.\n\n570\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.340\nSo a lot of good info there.\n\n571\n00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.780\nAt this point, we've got a machine\nthat's up and running and\n\n572\n00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.660\nit's on the network and\nnow we're just ready to dive in and\n\n573\n00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.320\nstart playing with a lot\nof those different tools.\n\n574\n00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.510\nWell, I kid,\nthere's some more stuff we gotta go over.\n\n575\n00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.370\nBut looking at the clock, Sean,\nwe are about out of time.\n\n576\n00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.040\nSo anything else we want to throw\nin on our configuring Kali Linux?\n\n577\n00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.110\n>> Well,\nI think we're off to a good start here.\n\n578\n00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.160\nWe saw a lot of good stuff.\n\n579\n00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:05.050\nAnd just a little old thing to add to\nthe end of this is one of the cool\n\n580\n00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:09.980\nthings about Kali is that, yeah, you can\nconfigure these network adapters, and\n\n581\n00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.480\nconfigure hardware and stuff like that.\n\n582\n00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.240\nTypically, if you've got pretty normal\nhardware, I guess I should say,\n\n583\n00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.290\nI mean, stuff that's not exotic\nis the way I used to put it.\n\n584\n00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:27.000\nOr legacy even, it's probably just\ngonna install on your stuff and\n\n585\n00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.150\nnot need much in the way of tweaking.\n\n586\n00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.725\nBut with that being said,\ndon't be surprised if you do.\n\n587\n00:33:33.725 --> 00:33:39.205\nAnd search out the resources online for\nit.\n\n588\n00:33:39.205 --> 00:33:42.295\nEvery notebook I have is a ThinkPad.\n\n589\n00:33:42.295 --> 00:33:46.700\nThinkPads have their own thing called a\nThinkWiki that the community put together.\n\n590\n00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.210\nThat will tell you it's got specs\non every ThinkPad that's out there.\n\n591\n00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.630\nAnd it tells you how the different\nversions of Linux will act on it.\n\n592\n00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.850\nAnd what you're gonna need\nto do post installation.\n\n593\n00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:01.300\nAnd activate touchpads, activate the multi\ntouch on a touchscreen, stuff like that.\n\n594\n00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.260\nIt'll tell you that.\n\n595\n00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.830\nAnd they have those types of things for\nevery piece of hardware out there.\n\n596\n00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:10.050\nSo if something doesn't work the right\nway, like your bluetooth or wireless or\n\n597\n00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:14.320\nsomething else, don't lose heart,\ndon't get upset or anything else.\n\n598\n00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.060\nGo search those resources out to see\nif it's something that you can solve.\n\n599\n00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.670\nBecause again, in most cases one\nof the cool things about the Linux\n\n600\n00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.670\ncommunity is if you ask,\nthey're gonna help you.\n\n601\n00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.690\n>> That's exactly what I was gonna say.\n\n602\n00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:31.820\nOne of the great things about Linux is\na very community driven operating system,\n\n603\n00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.980\nand Kali's no exception.\n\n604\n00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.155\nThey've got great documentation,\nthey've got great forums, and\n\n605\n00:34:36.155 --> 00:34:38.845\nthere's always somebody you can\nask if you run into trouble,\n\n606\n00:34:38.845 --> 00:34:43.025\nor have something that's not working\nthe way you want it to work.\n\n607\n00:34:43.025 --> 00:34:46.395\nAll right, Sean, well that's about it for\nthis episode, so we're gonna call it,\n\n608\n00:34:46.395 --> 00:34:49.967\nand I hope you guys enjoyed the show but\nsigning off for\n\n609\n00:34:49.967 --> 00:34:52.757\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano\n\n610\n00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:53.917\n>> And we'll see you next time\n\n611\n00:34:53.917 --> 00:35:00.130\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.950\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.500\nHow are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.730\n>> I'm doing awesome.\n\n6\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.380\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.750\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.340\nWe are continuing on with our Kali Linux\nseries and in this episode we're gonna\n\n9\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.910\ntake a look at setting up maybe\na little sandbox or an environment\n\n10\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.140\nthat we can play and use all the cool\nthings that come with Kali Linux.\n\n11\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.160\nSo, Sean,\nwhat do you have in store for us here?\n\n12\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.390\n>> Well, what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna take a look at setting up a lab so\n\n13\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030\nyou can practice your skills.\n\n14\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.300\nAnd so we here have something to demo\nagainst why we are doing our thing.\n\n15\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.580\nAnd anything we're gonna do here\nas far as setting up our lab\n\n16\n00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.290\nis gonna be the same type of stuff that\nyou can do on your own home environment.\n\n17\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.590\nNow, you have a choice, you can set up\nin a virtual environment like we are or\n\n18\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.560\nyou can, if you wanna do it that way, you\ncan set up a bunch of physical machines.\n\n19\n00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.230\nIt's really kind of your call.\n\n20\n00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.630\nI just chose to do virtual machines\nhere because it works, it's easy,\n\n21\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.900\nit does everything I need it to for\nhere, and I'm cool with that.\n\n22\n00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.070\nThat's the extent of it.\n\n23\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.740\nBut I could have taken it further,\nbut I said, don't need to here.\n\n24\n00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.010\n>> Kind of a pain right?\n\n25\n00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.640\nI mean that's one of the great things\nabout virtualization nowadays,\n\n26\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.748\nmost of our machines can handle\nrunning several virtual machines.\n\n27\n00:01:32.748 --> 00:01:37.010\nI remember way back when, Sean, when I\nwas going to, that was back in 2003,\n\n28\n00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.180\nI set up a whole test lab,\nI had to go out and buy old machines.\n\n29\n00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.130\nSo you had four, five, six machines\nsitting there, all sucking power,\n\n30\n00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.540\nall generating heat,\nKVMs between them, things like that.\n\n31\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.990\nNowadays, virtualize.\n\n32\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.624\nMy laptop, I can run four or\nfive different virtual machines and\n\n33\n00:01:53.624 --> 00:01:56.670\nwe can have our entire sandbox\nright here on our laptop.\n\n34\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.360\nSo I think it's really, really good.\n\n35\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.580\nBut as you said, either way will work.\n\n36\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.050\n>> Yeah, it's your call.\n\n37\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.230\nAnd to be honest,\nyou're gonna find some situations where\n\n38\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.240\nhaving a physical box is really gonna have\nto be the way you go to test against, but\n\n39\n00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.060\nit's not gonna be those labs.\n\n40\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.050\nI had to do the same thing, you know,\nwhere you had to have that whole,\n\n41\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.015\nyou felt like you were sitting in\nthe middle of a server room, you know?\n\n42\n00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Big wrap around stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.690\nI swear my cubicle at my old work looked\nlike the bridge of the Enterprise with\n\n44\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.810\nthe way it's wrapped around.\n\n45\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.150\nThere's so many stuff happening there.\n\n46\n00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.280\nYou don't need to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.670\nBut if you do have a specific\nhardware environment or\n\n48\n00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.420\nsomething unique that you need to\ntest against that you just can't\n\n49\n00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.220\nemulate properly in a virtual environment,\nthen yeah, you're gonna need the hardware.\n\n50\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.170\nYou just have to have it.\n\n51\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.140\nIf you're going to be doing tests\nagainst maybe wireless access points,\n\n52\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.350\nusing the stuff here,\nyou don't necessarily have an effective\n\n53\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.020\nway to really emulate that\nwithin a virtual environment.\n\n54\n00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.930\nAnd I know someone might say,\nwell you could do this, this, or this.\n\n55\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.150\nAnd you have all these workarounds.\n\n56\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.260\nWell I don't wanna have workarounds\nin some of these cases.\n\n57\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.890\nI wanna actually have the real thing\nbecause that workaround may not\n\n58\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.020\nsimulate the real environment good enough.\n\n59\n00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.140\n>> It kinda skews your results.\n\n60\n00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.620\nAll of a sudden you don't\nhave the results, or\n\n61\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.481\nyou're not getting results because\nof the actual test not working, or\n\n62\n00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:18.250\nif it's because of a limitation\nof the virtualization.\n\n63\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250\nSo there are some times when you do\nhave to step outside that virtual world.\n\n64\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.880\n>> Yeah.\nSo do absolutely consider that, if that's\n\n65\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.140\ngonna be the, if virtualization's\nalways is gonna be appropriate.\n\n66\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.140\nYou're gonna find probably as the saying\ngoes nine times out of ten that it's\n\n67\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.000\nprobably perfectly fine and\nno issues whatsoever, but\n\n68\n00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.130\nthere's always going to be those little\nthings that could very well be a problem.\n\n69\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.830\nSome of the wireless stuff\nwe have doesn't work well or\n\n70\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.720\nis very tough to get working in a virtual\nenvironment, so the network interfaces\n\n71\n00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.820\nperiod can be trouble to get\nwork in the virtual environment.\n\n72\n00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.290\nUsually, we can get them working but\nsometimes little glitches pop up.\n\n73\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.930\nAnd then as far as testing\nagainst other stuff,\n\n74\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.810\nit just may not work the way you want\nit to and give you the desired results.\n\n75\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.590\nSo you may have to, occasionally, step\noutside of that virtual environment and\n\n76\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.990\nget a physical box there.\n\n77\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.450\nSo just so you know and\nwe're playing by the rules and all that.\n\n78\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.425\nSo, once we've addressed that, whether or\nnot we're going to go physical or virtual,\n\n79\n00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:18.598\nand we're gonna assume\nit's gonna be virtual,\n\n80\n00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.787\nthe question is how do you\nstart setting that up?\n\n81\n00:04:20.787 --> 00:04:23.410\nWell, you've got a lot of options.\n\n82\n00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.453\nLots and lots of options.\n\n83\n00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:30.412\nIf one of the things you're gonna be\ntesting against most of the time is\n\n84\n00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:35.287\na system that is configured with\none of the major operating systems,\n\n85\n00:04:35.287 --> 00:04:38.227\nand is set up so\nyou can test these tools and\n\n86\n00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:42.840\nget results from them to see\nwhat those results look like.\n\n87\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.290\nIt's all well and\ngood to use something like Kali to target\n\n88\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.650\njust our system at random, but if you\ntarget a system at random that tool you\n\n89\n00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.020\nhave may not reveal anything because\nthat vulnerability may not exist there.\n\n90\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.420\nSo, if you really need to\nlearn how to use that tool and\n\n91\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.380\nsee what the results look like when there\nis a vulnerability or issue there and\n\n92\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.310\nwhen there isn't,\nyou don't have that situation.\n\n93\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.169\nThe other thing is that some of\nthese environments that you can get,\n\n94\n00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.262\nyou can download,\n\n95\n00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:14.140\nthey already have the vulnerabilities\nthey already have in there,\n\n96\n00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.850\nthey document them and tell you, these\nare the vulnerabilities that are there.\n\n97\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.080\nSo if you scan a certain tool and\nyou get a certain result,\n\n98\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.820\nyou can compare it to what\nthey've documented and\n\n99\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.700\nsee, oh yeah, that's what I should be\ngetting based on what they've reported.\n\n100\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.110\nSo it helps you out in\na number of different ways.\n\n101\n00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.530\nNow you don't need to download\none of the pre-made ones,\n\n102\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.320\nyou could make them yourself.\n\n103\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.000\nAnd some cases that may\nbe the only way to go.\n\n104\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.920\nYou may have some unique application\nyou're gonna be testing against.\n\n105\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.800\nYou don't have another way to do it\nexcept to create it on your own.\n\n106\n00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.910\nAnd so you'll need to address that.\n\n107\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.270\nAnd hopefully you can\naccomplish it the right way.\n\n108\n00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.070\nBut fortunately for the stuff we're gonna\ndo in here to test the different scanners\n\n109\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.810\nand things like that, we're gonna be going\nahead and just using off the shelf, so\n\n110\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.190\nto speak, virtual machines and\nthere's so many of them.\n\n111\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.520\nAll you've got to do with them is just\ndrop them in and they're ready to go.\n\n112\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.670\nOkay so,\nwhat I've done to help this process\n\n113\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.070\nis I already have downloaded one of\nthe virtual machines that are out there.\n\n114\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.370\nI'm gonna tell you which one you\ndownload and that's your call,\n\n115\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.690\nwhich one you choose to download.\n\n116\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.720\nI just chose one to download and\nput it in here,\n\n117\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.230\njust one of the ones we're gonna use.\n\n118\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.410\nSomething also I'd point out here\ntoo is don't go crazy with these.\n\n119\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.690\nI mean you can download\nthem all no problem, but\n\n120\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.570\ndon't expect to be running\nthem all at the same time.\n\n121\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.210\nBecause unless you've got a ton of memory.\n\n122\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.470\nI know there are some people out there,\n\n123\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.850\nI heard someone literally last week that\nsaid I've got 64 gigs in my notebook.\n\n124\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.972\nWhen you're like, all right, whatever,\nthere's always somebody that's got it, so.\n\n125\n00:06:57.972 --> 00:06:58.951\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n126\n00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.355\n>> But that's not the norm.\n\n127\n00:07:00.355 --> 00:07:01.546\n>> That's Ronnie Wong.\n\n128\n00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.530\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, was that Ronnie over there?\n\n129\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.570\n>> Probably.\n\n130\n00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.840\n>> So anyway, so what I'm gonna\ndo is I have in an VMware player,\n\n131\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.918\nI have two virtual machines, which I'm\ngonna open them up both on my screen\n\n132\n00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:20.460\n>> I've got my Metasploitable\n\n133\n00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.440\nsitting up here.\n\n134\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.050\nThis is a virtual machine\nthat you can get for free.\n\n135\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.310\nYou can just Google Metasploitable,\nactually Metasploitable 2.\n\n136\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.200\nI will show you the link for\nit here in just a bit.\n\n137\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.610\nBut you can download\nthat just by Googling it.\n\n138\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.380\nAnd then I have my Kali Linux sitting\nover here in my virtual machine as well.\n\n139\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.801\nSo I've got two virtual machines\nrunning in VMWare Player.\n\n140\n00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:55.185\nSo I've got the two out there,\nI can see that they're\n\n141\n00:07:55.185 --> 00:08:00.100\ndoing their thing, and\neverything looks good.\n\n142\n00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.579\nWell what I can do is,\nlet me go over here to Metasploitable and\n\n143\n00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:10.094\nwhat I'm going to do is in Metasploitable\nI'm going to just double check and\n\n144\n00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:15.800\nI'm gonna see what my IP address is, so\nI'm gonna use IF config stuff in here.\n\n145\n00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.950\nAnd, I'm just gonna do a simple test,\nI wanna see if the two can actually talk.\n\n146\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.080\nSo, that one.\n\n147\n00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.850\n>> It'll make the future tests and\nlabs a little bit easier to do, right.\n\n148\n00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.710\n>> Yeah.\n>> As long as they,\n\n149\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.680\nif they can talk to each other.\n\n150\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.260\n>> Yeah, they don't talk,\nthe test become really easy at that point.\n\n151\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.235\nSo.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n152\n00:08:30.235 --> 00:08:34.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so what I'm gonna do is I have,\n\n153\n00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.530\nso it,\nI can see the IP address sitting there.\n\n154\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.505\nYou can see under S zero,\nyou can see that I have an IP address,\n\n155\n00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:47.417\nand if you can't read that,\nit's sitting right over here.\n\n156\n00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:52.180\nIt's 192168245.130.\n\n157\n00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.610\nSo, what I can do over\nhere is I've already typed\n\n158\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.170\nin the end map command and hopefully,\nyou'll recognize that, if you've been\n\n159\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.879\nthrough SCEH, which I know probably\na good number of you already have.\n\n160\n00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if you haven't,\n\n161\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.170\nyou really should watch it.\n\n162\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:11.875\nIt's award winning.\n\n163\n00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:15.670\n[LAUGH] But in any case,\n\n164\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.735\nwe have a n-map sitting-\n>> Starring none other than Sean Oriyano.\n\n165\n00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:22.660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well I am famous.\n\n166\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.460\nBut what I've got here, so I've got N map.\n\n167\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.340\nYou can see that I have my\nswitch sitting in there.\n\n168\n00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.950\nMy sin switch so I go through and\nhit Enter and boom it says yeah.\n\n169\n00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.600\nIt says it hit that machine and\nit said it saw it.\n\n170\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.680\nAnd it gave me some results.\n\n171\n00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.320\nThere's some open services\nsitting right there.\n\n172\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.040\nOkay.\nSo\n\n173\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.020\nthat's kind of neat to see that right\naway, that it's got some open ports.\n\n174\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.580\nIf I go over here, just to kinda\ngive you another insight into this,\n\n175\n00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.420\nI've got TCP dump, if you\n\n176\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.310\nrecall from our CEH\nthis is packet sniffer.\n\n177\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.860\nThis is a command line one.\n\n178\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.190\nThere's TCP dump and there's WIN dump.\n\n179\n00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.960\nThey both do the same type of thing but\ntheir command line.\n\n180\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.690\nSo what I'm gonna do here is\nI'm telling it, I go ahead and\n\n181\n00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:20.110\nstart it and you can see it's\nthe pseudo so it's raising privileges.\n\n182\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.900\nReason why it didn't ask me for a password\nis I typed it in really quick on the break\n\n183\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.480\nand it holds it for a period of time.\n\n184\n00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.980\nTCP dump but then look it's got\nminus I for interface and eth0.\n\n185\n00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.500\nRemember we talked about that?\n\n186\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.750\nIt's telling it,\nlisten on eth0 for anything.\n\n187\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.090\nNow, I've positioned these windows\nto kind of give you a little bit of\n\n188\n00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.270\na insight into this and make it a little\nmore exciting, if I can say that.\n\n189\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:54.550\nIs, I have end map, I go over to my\nKali machine and do end map again.\n\n190\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.700\nAnd hit Enter, and you can see on\nthe other machine, what did it do?\n\n191\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.820\nIt's actually spitting\nstuff up over there.\n\n192\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.760\nIt's saying that it's actually,\n\n193\n00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.720\nthat it's seeing the traffic come\nfrom one machine to the other.\n\n194\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.990\nYeah so we definitely can see,\nnot only are they talking,\n\n195\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.370\nthat we can see specifically\nwhat's happening there.\n\n196\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.340\n>> Nice.\n>> So that's kinda neat to see that.\n\n197\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.960\nTo see what's going on.\n\n198\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.780\nI'm not dumping that to a file or\nanything,\n\n199\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.820\nby the way, on the Metasploit machine.\n\n200\n00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.870\nI just, I ran that just to show\nyou that it's not just pinging it.\n\n201\n00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.520\nThere's more going on there.\n\n202\n00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.970\nAnd you can actually see that.\n\n203\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.210\nYou could go through that and\nsee the ports it hit.\n\n204\n00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.370\nAnd all that good stuff.\n\n205\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.800\nAnd see the responses.\n\n206\n00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.830\nI mean so that's right there.\n\n207\n00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.110\nYou will notice the Metasploitable.\n\n208\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.250\nThere is no GUI for this.\n\n209\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.970\nSo there's that whole\nthing I was telling ya.\n\n210\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.960\nYou better get use to\na command line pretty quickly.\n\n211\n00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.640\nBecause you ain't using Metasploitable,\nif you don't know command line.\n\n212\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.260\n>> Right.\n\n213\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.850\n>> So, fortunately, you know,\n\n214\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.370\nyou'll learn some of this stuff in Kali\nas you practice and try things out.\n\n215\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.660\nAnd then, boom,\nyou'll go over to Metasploitable and\n\n216\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.350\nstart doing little things like that.\n\n217\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.240\nYou know, so, kind of neat to see\nthat sort of thing happening.\n\n218\n00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.850\nSo that is.\n\n219\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.490\nBut that's Metasploitable that I\nhave running, you know, back there.\n\n220\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.430\nAnd I can get and just practice with it.\n\n221\n00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.630\nThere are a bunch of different\nvulnerabilities on it that we won't worry\n\n222\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.200\nabout right now.\n\n223\n00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.630\nBut that's just to show you here.\n\n224\n00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.590\nIt's set up it's talking.\n\n225\n00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.860\nAnd hey great we've got that.\n\n226\n00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.515\nThere are other vulnerable machines out\nthere if your gonna be setting up a lab.\n\n227\n00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:45.260\nMetasploitable is far\nfrom being the only one.\n\n228\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.320\nWriting off the fact that\nyou can create your own.\n\n229\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.360\nI mean cuz that's pretty specific,\n\n230\n00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.510\nif you're gonna create your own,\nI can't even cover it there.\n\n231\n00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.740\nI can tell you, yeah, install Windows or\nLinux and don't patch it.\n\n232\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.870\n>> Right, I was just going to say, just\nconnect the Internet and get hacked up.\n\n233\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.230\nThere you go.\n\n234\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.050\nIt's on your machine, on your network.\n\n235\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.650\nYou probably don't want that.\n\n236\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.060\nThat's why these machines\nare already set up to be vulnerable.\n\n237\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.676\nAre great ways to practice and\nlearn how to use these tools, so\n\n238\n00:13:16.676 --> 00:13:19.993\nthat I can be efficient when I get in a\nsituation where I've got to do a pen test,\n\n239\n00:13:19.993 --> 00:13:22.633\nor a digital forensic investigation or\nsomething like that.\n\n240\n00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:23.758\n>> Yup.\n\n241\n00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:27.999\nSo definitely think about\nthat sort of a thing,\n\n242\n00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:31.560\nis that, yeah, you can make your own.\n\n243\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.350\nAnd, you might want to make your own.\n\n244\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.300\nYou might want to just set up a Windows\nmachine and not patch it, and\n\n245\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.980\ndo some scans against it to see what\nhappens and what it looks like.\n\n246\n00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.310\nGet a feel for it.\n\n247\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.770\nOr a particular configuration that\nyou're thinking about running.\n\n248\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.730\nAnd you wanna use these tools to test\nyour configuration before you put it in\n\n249\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:49.490\na production environment.\n\n250\n00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.880\nSee what kind of vulnerabilities\nyou didn't see, and\n\n251\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.070\nthat you meant to patch, right?\n\n252\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.270\nSo, any number of ways you could use this.\n\n253\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.110\n>> And imagine that.\n\n254\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.920\nIf you are, if you were doing something\nlike what we did in our CEH where\n\n255\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:07.110\nwe're talking about creating accounts and\ncracking passwords and doing tampering.\n\n256\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.040\nI mean,\nyou could literally use those skills\n\n257\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.930\nthat we have the CEH to monkey with\nthe system and create those things and\n\n258\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.930\nthen see how you can do the same thing\non this side of the house with Kali and\n\n259\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.510\nsee if you can detect those\nthings even when you do an audit.\n\n260\n00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.580\nSo there are definitely some benefits\nthere, but as far as me telling you how\n\n261\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.200\nto specifically configure it for\nthat, I couldn't tell ya.\n\n262\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.820\nBecause that would be very\nspecific to that environment.\n\n263\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:43.060\nAll right, so that is,\nlike I said, Metasploitable, and\n\n264\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:48.830\nthen I've got Kali on here, but those\naren't the only ones that are out there.\n\n265\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.980\nThere are definitely other\nvulnerable machines out there.\n\n266\n00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.790\nThat is a Metasploit or Metasploitable 2.\n\n267\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.520\nThat is available for you to mess with.\n\n268\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.580\nIt's already set up.\n\n269\n00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.230\nAll you've got to do is just download it\nand drop it in and it's, download it,\n\n270\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.450\nit's going to be in a zipped\nfile compressed format.\n\n271\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.870\nYou just download it, expand it and\n\n272\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.080\nall you have to do is point your\nvirtualization software to it.\n\n273\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.988\nYou might have to do some memory\nconfiguration, not always.\n\n274\n00:15:20.988 --> 00:15:25.510\nAnd VM ware all I had to do is\njust point to that folder and\n\n275\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.710\nselect that virtual machine and it dropped\nall the settings in that I needed and\n\n276\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.670\nit was ready to go, it started right up.\n\n277\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.350\n>> And all the vulnerabilities are all\nbuilt in and already configured so there's\n\n278\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.890\nnothing else to do on that machine other\nthan make sure it's on the right network.\n\n279\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.860\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n280\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.400\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n281\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.960\nAnd the stuff we were talking about\nas far as IF config to figure\n\n282\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.900\nthe network on Kali.\n\n283\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.422\nYou can use the same thing\ninside of Metasploitable.\n\n284\n00:15:53.422 --> 00:15:58.195\nYou get the same thing, so\nit would just carry across, so\n\n285\n00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:05.371\nit's a universal skill to have, so that is\nMetasploitable if you wanna use that one.\n\n286\n00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:08.142\nBut it's, again,\nfar from being the only one.\n\n287\n00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:11.562\nAnd this is kind of where it gets\ninteresting, there's all these other\n\n288\n00:16:11.562 --> 00:16:16.360\nthings, and I've only got a short list of\nvirtual machines here that are vulnerable.\n\n289\n00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.750\nThis is one called pwnOS.\n\n290\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.977\nYou can see it's pretty much no frills,\nlook at that.\n\n291\n00:16:22.977 --> 00:16:25.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's an old,\n\n292\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.810\nlooks like an old webpage.\n\n293\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:32.255\n>> [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> And is this GeoCities still?\n\n294\n00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:32.800\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n295\n00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.780\n>> Yeah, but this is one that's used for,\nagain, used for doing pen testing.\n\n296\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.140\nAnd it's all documented so you can\nplay with it and practice with it and\n\n297\n00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.510\nsee what you get.\n\n298\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.570\nSo you got that.\n\n299\n00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.319\nThere's other ones, you got this Holynix.\n\n300\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.980\nSo it's,\nI don't know where they got the name.\n\n301\n00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.204\n>> I know.\nI was gonna say, they are so\n\n302\n00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:57.928\ncreative with those names, aren't they?\n\n303\n00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:00.769\n[LAUGH]\n>> The Holynix.\n\n304\n00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.660\nBut they've got that one.\n\n305\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.970\nThis one, again,\nthey tell you right here on Source Forge.\n\n306\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.995\nThey design it specifically\nto be vulnerable.\n\n307\n00:17:10.995 --> 00:17:11.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Then they've got the links to\n\n308\n00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.990\nthe main project website.\n\n309\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.400\nThen they have this TWiki.\n\n310\n00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.450\nIt's one that I heard mentioned.\n\n311\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.230\nThe reason why it's mentioned,\nit's a Wiki application.\n\n312\n00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.420\nSo it's a web app.\n\n313\n00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.870\nAnd the reason why it's mentioned is\na lot of major companies use this.\n\n314\n00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.860\nAnd so it gives you a chance\nto kind of poke around and\n\n315\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.020\nget in on the back end,\nstuff like that, see the database.\n\n316\n00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.310\nIt gives you experience with that, and\neven though it might not be something that\n\n317\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.760\nyour company uses or\na company you target ever uses.\n\n318\n00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.530\nIt does give you some experience poking\naround stuff like a SharePoint or\n\n319\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.580\nWiki site.\n\n320\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.150\nAnd working with something\nthat has a database on it.\n\n321\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.290\n>> Right, okay.\n>> So you've got that.\n\n322\n00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.435\nThen we've got one of my\nfavorite ones in here, is Sauron.\n\n323\n00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:03.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is one that is used, it's supposed\n\n324\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.570\nto be a system management utility,\nbut it also has a benefit that\n\n325\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.920\nyou can scan it and check it, try to punch\ninto it, since it is a management tool.\n\n326\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.670\nYou can kind of explore it and\n\n327\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.750\nsee what's going on with\nthis specific system.\n\n328\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.570\nSo you can just go ahead and\ndrop the thing in and\n\n329\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.982\nrun it and start playing around with\nthat one if you really wanted to.\n\n330\n00:18:29.982 --> 00:18:30.937\n>> Nice.\n\n331\n00:18:30.937 --> 00:18:37.000\n>> You've got to do something that\nyou have installed on your network.\n\n332\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.845\n>> I love their icon.\n\n333\n00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:39.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You try to find a link for that one,\n\n334\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.400\nand I'm coming up with all kinds of\nthings that have nothing to do with what\n\n335\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.596\nyou're talking about Sean.\n\n336\n00:18:43.596 --> 00:18:44.853\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there we go,\n\n337\n00:18:44.853 --> 00:18:46.455\nI think that's the one we want.\n\n338\n00:18:46.455 --> 00:18:48.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's it.\n\n339\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.110\n>> All right so that's really neat that\nthere's a lot of things out there.\n\n340\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:58.350\nI wanna build a test lab, I wanna\nreally dive in and learn Kali Linux and\n\n341\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.118\nlearn all the different tools I just don't\nhave the time to set up vulnerables.\n\n342\n00:19:02.118 --> 00:19:05.075\nI mean I've gotta have a license for\nWindows or other operating systems.\n\n343\n00:19:05.075 --> 00:19:09.320\nI've gotta figure out how to make them\nvulnerable so that i can do my testing.\n\n344\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.430\nHere's lots of options.\n\n345\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.645\nIf you just go out and just download these\npre-built appliances and fire them up.\n\n346\n00:19:13.645 --> 00:19:14.990\nAnd now we can really sit here and\n\n347\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.900\nplay here with Kali and\nget some good use out of it.\n\n348\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.640\n>> Yeah, and that's really the name of\nthe game is getting practice with this and\n\n349\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.670\nseeing what these tools\nare supposed to produce.\n\n350\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.170\nGet used to what different\nresults look like so\n\n351\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.205\nyou will recognize that when\nyou go out into the wild.\n\n352\n00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:32.980\nBut, Mike just brought up something here.\n\n353\n00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.326\nIs that, all the stuff I just did there,\nthose were all Linux machines.\n\n354\n00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:37.834\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n355\n00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:41.799\nthat brings up the question,\nwhat do you do if you do have Windows?\n\n356\n00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:43.687\n>> Right.\n>> Are you gonna have to make\n\n357\n00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:45.090\nthose yourself?\n\n358\n00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.000\nWell this is a kind of a interesting one.\n\n359\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.590\nI brought this up on my screen here.\n\n360\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:54.700\nThis is something that\nNIST has made available.\n\n361\n00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.300\nI don't know how they're doing it,\nbut it's available,\n\n362\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.010\nit's been published in numerous places.\n\n363\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:05.028\nBut what this is is these are on this\nspecific page they actually have\n\n364\n00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:09.887\nWindows machines that you can download and\nthey are vulnerable.\n\n365\n00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:10.700\n>> Really?\n\n366\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.470\n>> So you can download these things and\nuse them to check against.\n\n367\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.110\nAnd you could see there's a lot of\nthem there, a lot of them up there.\n\n368\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.348\nSo you can go ahead and\ngrab stuff off here, too.\n\n369\n00:20:23.348 --> 00:20:24.610\n>> Nice.\n>> So, as I've said,\n\n370\n00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.100\nI don't know how they're doing it.\n\n371\n00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.054\nAnd normally, if someone told me they\nhad a bunch of Windows virtual machines\n\n372\n00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:31.599\nup there that you could just download for\n\n373\n00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:33.929\nfree, you wouldn't hear me talk\nabout in a place like this.\n\n374\n00:20:33.929 --> 00:20:36.656\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's the US government so\n\n375\n00:20:36.656 --> 00:20:39.987\nI'll assume that considering who it is,\n\n376\n00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:44.572\nthat they've got the clearances and\neverything for it.\n\n377\n00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:45.129\n>> Right.\n\n378\n00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:49.431\n>> So that's one place where you can do\nthat if you don't want to set those up on\n\n379\n00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:50.670\nyour own.\n\n380\n00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.950\nI assume what they are is they're\nprobably some sort of time bomb release.\n\n381\n00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.786\n>> That's what I was gonna say,\nthey're probably a time bomb,\n\n382\n00:20:55.786 --> 00:20:58.254\nplay with them a little bit, and then they\ndie, and then you have to get them again,\n\n383\n00:20:58.254 --> 00:20:59.168\nor something like that, so.\n\n384\n00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:03.431\n>> And it's still good enough, I mean,\nit's still definitely good enough for\n\n385\n00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.883\nanything we'd be doing.\n\n386\n00:21:04.883 --> 00:21:05.742\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n387\n00:21:05.742 --> 00:21:08.660\n>> So there you go.\n\n388\n00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:15.470\nNow, the one that's kind of left out\nthere in the cold is the Apple products.\n\n389\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.420\nBut you kinda question,\nare those really left out in the cold?\n\n390\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.900\nBecause, really, it's a Unix based\noperating system, and we can get those and\n\n391\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.520\nlearn those through the stuff that\nwe've done in these other areas.\n\n392\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.940\nSo I don't really consider\nthat to be a major roadblock.\n\n393\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.500\nBut if it is and\nyou really want to get that\n\n394\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.760\nin the trenches experience directly\nwith something that was made by Apple,\n\n395\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.980\nthen I guess you kinda\nknow what you gotta do.\n\n396\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.460\nYou gotta go beg, borrow or steal\nan Apple computer and test against it.\n\n397\n00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.510\nThat's the only way you're gonna do that.\n\n398\n00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.660\n>> Yeah they're a little bit\nparticular about who gets licenses or\n\n399\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.070\naccess to their operating system,\naren't they?\n\n400\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah that's a tricky one.\n\n401\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.548\nAnd I'll tell you, you can even\nthrow another operation systems on\n\n402\n00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:07.450\nthere too is Android and Apple's iOS.\n\n403\n00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.110\nThose would all be out there\n>> Right.\n\n404\n00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.260\n>> And those are ones that you're gonna\nhave to do pin tests again at some\n\n405\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.750\npoint anyway.\n\n406\n00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.340\nJust so, you might actually start\nlooking at how you're gonna do those.\n\n407\n00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.650\nAs far as I know though,\n\n408\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.750\nyou can with Android, you can actually\nload that into a virtual machine.\n\n409\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.350\nThere's, if you Google it enough,\n\n410\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:32.320\nthere's developer editions that you can\ndownload and stick into a virtual machine.\n\n411\n00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.610\nAnd then you could test\nagainst it that way.\n\n412\n00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.680\nSo, you don't necessarily have to\nfind a way to plug a device in or\n\n413\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.060\nsomething to your computer or\ndo something that way.\n\n414\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.560\nYou can actually just run\nvirtual machine and scan it.\n\n415\n00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:47.460\nBut then again, that's gonna be just\nthe clean, pristine version of Android.\n\n416\n00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.740\nIt's not gonna be the one that goes\non AT and T or Verizon's phone or\n\n417\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.624\nsomething like that.\n\n418\n00:22:52.624 --> 00:22:55.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because those are all different,\n\n419\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.020\nevery last one of those is different for\nsome reason or another.\n\n420\n00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:58.900\n>> Right, customized, yeah.\n\n421\n00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.668\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I was gonna throw\n\n422\n00:22:59.668 --> 00:23:00.400\nanother link up there.\n\n423\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.010\nMicrosoft has that test drive thing, and\nnot set up to be vulnerable, right, these\n\n424\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:09.690\nare if you wanna go and you wanna try\nSQL and Exchange or something like that.\n\n425\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.910\nMicrosoft has all kinds of virtual hard\ndrives you can download and play with.\n\n426\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.170\nSo maybe you take one of\nthose that's running SQL and\n\n427\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:21.500\nthen you set up a database and\nyou see that you can use those as well.\n\n428\n00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.410\nThey're trial versions,\n\n429\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.990\nthey're time bombs, but\nyou can make your own vulnerabilities.\n\n430\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.350\nYou could misconfigure the SQL server,\nyou could fire up a web server and just\n\n431\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.390\nsee what it looks like out of the box,\nwhat are the default configurations, what\n\n432\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:38.120\nvulnerabilities does that leave me open to\nif I don't change those default settings.\n\n433\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.042\nSo lots of options out there where you\ndon't have to take days and days and\n\n434\n00:23:42.042 --> 00:23:45.610\nsetup the sandbox with\nthis live environment.\n\n435\n00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.530\n>> Yeah.\n\n436\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.360\nThey've made it a lot easier for\n\n437\n00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.550\nyou to set these things up than\nit was even just a few years ago.\n\n438\n00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:55.360\nSo it used to be a few years ago, you were\ngonna have to set all this stuff up and\n\n439\n00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.205\nset your own sandboxes up,\nand try different things.\n\n440\n00:23:58.205 --> 00:24:00.646\nAnd like I said you may still have to.\n\n441\n00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:04.651\nIt just really depends on what\nyour specific requirement is,\n\n442\n00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:09.281\nwhat you are trying to learn and\nmaybe what you need to pin test against.\n\n443\n00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:14.135\nYou're seeing guys up\nhere I see Ben saying,\n\n444\n00:24:14.135 --> 00:24:16.960\nhe says MS Dawson when NT.\n\n445\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.880\nOkay, it's not like those are unheard\nof operating systems nowadays.\n\n446\n00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.700\nThose are still out there.\n\n447\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.100\nThose are still very common to see and\na lot environments.\n\n448\n00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.530\nWhen in TE, I still run into\nit often enough, in MS-DOS.\n\n449\n00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.110\nFunny enough, I had someone ask me at\none point, this was like about five or\n\n450\n00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.745\nsix years ago but,\nhow do you secure MS-DOS?\n\n451\n00:24:38.745 --> 00:24:40.958\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's MS-DOS.\n\n452\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:41.886\nWhat else do you want me to say?\n\n453\n00:24:41.886 --> 00:24:44.870\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> That's it.\n\n454\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.809\nBut if you need to test\nagainst those things,\n\n455\n00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.990\nat least the DOS one I believe\nyou can just get the free DOS or\n\n456\n00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.120\nwhatever, and do most of your\ntesting against that and be okay.\n\n457\n00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.330\nIf you need a copy of MS-DOS the only way\nI know how to get it now a days reliably\n\n458\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:05.050\nwould be with the MSDN that gives\nyou access to everything, and so\n\n459\n00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:10.550\nthat maybe more of an investment than you\nwanna have for a customer engagement.\n\n460\n00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.260\nUnless you're making tons of bucks off\nof that you're probably not gonna want\n\n461\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.000\nto do something like that, but\nthat would be a unique case.\n\n462\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.020\nWhat also comes to mind is the OS/2,\nand OS/2 Warp.\n\n463\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.870\nAnd if you remember those,\n\n464\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.850\nI mean those things were,\nthat was IBM's operating system for ages.\n\n465\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.460\nThey had that thing sitting out\nthere on their machines and\n\n466\n00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.270\nI think they only killed support for\nit like two, three, four years ago.\n\n467\n00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.260\nIt wasn't that long ago.\n\n468\n00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.850\nAnd they weren't really doing any upgrades\nto it, they were just still supporting it.\n\n469\n00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.361\nAnd what happened is,\nis that when they stopped supporting it,\n\n470\n00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:54.956\nin fact, they haven't really\ntruly stopped supporting it, but\n\n471\n00:25:54.956 --> 00:25:58.061\nthere's ATM machines that still run that.\n\n472\n00:25:58.061 --> 00:25:58.670\n>> Really?\n\n473\n00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.940\n>> Yeah, there's ATM machines\nover in Europe, Middle East,\n\n474\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.550\nthere's even I hear some here in the\nstates that run OS/2 behind the scenes.\n\n475\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.710\nSo you got to ask yourself\n\n476\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.650\nif you were asked to pen test an OS/2\nbased machine, where are you gonna get it?\n\n477\n00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:17.173\nYou ain't get it from IBM.\n\n478\n00:26:17.173 --> 00:26:20.285\nThey won't sell it to you and there's\nnot an open source version of that.\n\n479\n00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:21.511\n>> Yeah.\n>> In fact,\n\n480\n00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:26.700\nIBM said there will never be\nan open source version of it.\n\n481\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.170\nThey've said just plain black and\nwhite that's how it's gonna be.\n\n482\n00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:35.200\nSo, you're kinda stuck there, and\nhave to go to your client and say,\n\n483\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.200\nI need something from you to test on,\nspecifically, to make that arrangement.\n\n484\n00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.390\nBut fortunately I don't see\nyou guys run OS/2 too often.\n\n485\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.770\nWho knows?\n\n486\n00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:47.580\n>> You never know.\n\n487\n00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.550\n>> Yeah you never know in this\nworld what you might run into.\n\n488\n00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.150\n>> Yeah.\n\n489\n00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.490\n>> So just be prepared but you can still,\n\n490\n00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.529\neven if you don't have access to those you\ncan still learn quite a bit even off these\n\n491\n00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:03.500\nvulnerable operating systems and\nthey've been around for a long time.\n\n492\n00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.050\nSo there's a long list of them.\n\n493\n00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:10.218\nAnd one of the ones I didn't mention that\nsome of you guys may have heard of is\n\n494\n00:27:10.218 --> 00:27:14.050\none called it's DVL, Damn Vulnerable Linux\nis what they call it.\n\n495\n00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.020\n>> I've heard that.\n\n496\n00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.870\n>> It's been discontinued.\n\n497\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:22.370\nThey didn't keep it update and\nfinally it was so far out of date\n\n498\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.230\nthat the community just decided we're not\neven gonna talk about that one anymore.\n\n499\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.265\nWe'll list it places saying yeah,\nit existed but,\n\n500\n00:27:29.265 --> 00:27:35.161\nhey, it's not useful to you anymore so\ndon't even bother messing with it.\n\n501\n00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:36.346\n>> All right.\nWell I'll tell you want, Sean,\n\n502\n00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:37.733\nthat was a lot of good information to me.\n\n503\n00:27:37.733 --> 00:27:42.590\nAt this point, we've got Kali Linux up and\nrunning, and now we've got a bunch of\n\n504\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.520\nvulnerable machines on our network\nthat we can start scanning and\n\n505\n00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.091\nstart testing out what we can do with\nKali Linux, and getting our feet wet and\n\n506\n00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:53.630\nstarting to learn how to use these tools.\n\n507\n00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.940\nSo, anything else you wanna add\nbefore we wrap this episode up?\n\n508\n00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.620\n>> Again I think we covered\nquite a bit of ground there,\n\n509\n00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:06.260\nI mean you should be already thinking\nabout setting up a lab for doing this.\n\n510\n00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:11.000\nI would say if you're gonna be\nfollowing along with these each one of\n\n511\n00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.940\nthese segments, and making sure you're\ngetting the most out of it, you not only\n\n512\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.910\nwanna have a virtual machine set up with\nKali, but you also want to have a virtual\n\n513\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:24.220\nmachine set up with some of those-\n>> Metasploitable.\n\n514\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.851\n>> Yeah, metasploitable.\n\n515\n00:28:25.851 --> 00:28:28.498\nYou can choose the one that you want.\n\n516\n00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:33.351\nI would have more than one because not all\nof them have the same vulnerabilities and\n\n517\n00:28:33.351 --> 00:28:36.444\nyou want to be able to see\nwhat the differences are and\n\n518\n00:28:36.444 --> 00:28:41.050\nhow different machines react to\ndifferent things, get used to that.\n\n519\n00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.820\nBut you definitely wanna have one\nof those until you get to one those\n\n520\n00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.090\nvulnerable environments available\nto you when you're doing this so\n\n521\n00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.470\nyou can practice against something.\n\n522\n00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:55.750\nJust make sure you have connectivity and\nif they can talk and boom, try stuff out.\n\n523\n00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.750\nSo, it's really the way to go.\n\n524\n00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.392\nYou gotta get your hands dirty and\n\n525\n00:29:00.392 --> 00:29:05.400\nroll up your sleeves to really\nlearn this stuff, the full way.\n\n526\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.258\n[CROSSTALK] And if you need OS/2,\nsomeone's got it.\n\n527\n00:29:07.258 --> 00:29:10.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Contact David if you need OS/2.\n\n528\n00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.702\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n529\n00:29:12.702 --> 00:29:15.650\nAll right ladies and gentleman hope\nyou enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n530\n00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.017\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n531\n00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:18.254\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n532\n00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:19.055\n>> And I'm Shaun

00:00:17.430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430\nHow are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.830\n>> I am doing pretty good how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.270\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510\nWe've got another exciting episode\ncoming your way continuing on\n\n8\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.570\nin our Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.215\nGetting ready to dive into\npenetration testing with Kali Linux.\n\n10\n00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:34.750\nAnd Sean this is something that we\nreally Kali is designed to do, but\n\n11\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.734\nbefore we get into actually using it,\n\n12\n00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:41.360\nwe kind of want to talk about the whole\nidea of penetration testing, right.\n\n13\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.350\n>> Yeah, this is what we're\ntrying to accomplish here,\n\n14\n00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.550\nis we're trying to talk in this section\nabout The penetration testing process and\n\n15\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.370\nwhere Kali really fits in.\n\n16\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.180\nThis is gonna be one of those things where\nfor some of you it's probably a review.\n\n17\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.960\nAgain, if you've been through CEH,\nyou've seen the process from over there.\n\n18\n00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.680\nIt has been altered just\nslightly over here.\n\n19\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.290\nThe names are different, and as far as\nwe're concerned here, there's been at\n\n20\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.870\nleast a couple points that have been\ndropped, but it looks fairly the same.\n\n21\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.243\nSo, what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntalk about what the penetration process\n\n22\n00:01:20.243 --> 00:01:21.430\nlooks like.\n\n23\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.670\nKind of when we expanded outside of just\nthe borders of what EC Council has in CEH.\n\n24\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.480\nWe're expanding outside of that and\nwe are gonna see, again,\n\n25\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.890\njust how Kali fits in there and\nhelps you accomplish it, and\n\n26\n00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.120\nthen kinda talk about some of\nthe tools that help you along the way.\n\n27\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.860\nNow this isn't meant to actually give you\n\n28\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.280\nThe in-depth experience each\none of the tools at this point.\n\n29\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.070\nThis is just kinda to give you an idea\nto make some associations of well,\n\n30\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.250\nthese are the types of\ntools they use here.\n\n31\n00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280\nThese are the types of\ntools they use here.\n\n32\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.120\nAnd I can tell you what they do so\n\n33\n00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.570\nyou can see the types of things\nwould happen along the way.\n\n34\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.820\nAnd then we'll,\nalso when we're doing this,\n\n35\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.310\njust to to put things straight for you.\n\n36\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.800\nSince some of you, again as far as the CEH\nis concerned, you may still have that\n\n37\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.062\nin your head, you may still be looking at\nthe videos for it, and studying for that.\n\n38\n00:02:16.062 --> 00:02:19.690\nWe're gonna do a little bit of compare and\ncontrast to kinda let you know, well,\n\n39\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.830\nthat's how they do it and\nthis is how we do it, just so\n\n40\n00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.110\nyou know that there is a distinction\nthere between what the two look like.\n\n41\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.100\nWhile they may be accomplishing\nthe same thing, they are different for\n\n42\n00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.970\nall intents and purposes, at least here.\n\n43\n00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.570\n>> It really reminds me of\nthe Network+ CompTIA has their\n\n44\n00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.150\nTroubleshooting model, right?\n\n45\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.902\nAnd for the exam you've got\nto know CompTIA's method for\n\n46\n00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:45.540\ndoing trouble shooting.\n\n47\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.810\nWhen you get out in the real world and\n\n48\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.390\nyou might find that you don't\ndo it exactly that way.\n\n49\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.440\nOr you read a book by some other vendor\nand they might tweak it a little bit or\n\n50\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.910\nchange some things around, or.\n\n51\n00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.320\nEven call the same thing\nby different names.\n\n52\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.650\nSame thing you've got going on here.\n\n53\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.320\nEC Council puts on that course,\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker, and\n\n54\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.310\nto pass that exam you have to understand\nwhat they consider the hacking life cycle.\n\n55\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.720\nYou've gotta understand\nthose different phases.\n\n56\n00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.940\nSame thing's gonna happen here, we're\ngonna talk about the different phases but\n\n57\n00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.980\n>> They might not be exactly the same as\n\n58\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.650\nEC council doesn't mean they're any better\nor worse, just different vendor right?\n\n59\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700\n>> Yeah, that's really it is\nthat yeah there are different\n\n60\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.580\nstandards out there as far as the way\nthe penetration testing process goes.\n\n61\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.410\nYou see Council has theirs.\n\n62\n00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.470\nThere's one I'm gonna bring up here.\n\n63\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.030\nYou can look at it as being a more\nkind of sort of generic one,\n\n64\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.400\nthat it doesn't use the specific\nterminology that EC counsel's doing.\n\n65\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.470\nBut you can really keep going out and\nout and out on this, and say, oh yeah,\n\n66\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.700\nthere's all these different forms\nof penetration testing standards.\n\n67\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.420\nIn fact, what I was doing here,\nMike, while you were talking,\n\n68\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.310\nis\n>> Just to take a look at my screen here,\n\n69\n00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.280\nthis is the website is the\npentest-standard.org, and what this is,\n\n70\n00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.180\nis this is an organization that maintains\ndocuments on the pen testing process.\n\n71\n00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.120\nSo if you were looking to\ndevelop your own process and\n\n72\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.520\nfigure out what you need to accomplish and\n\n73\n00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.090\nhow you should be going about it and all\nthat good stuff, that's what this is for.\n\n74\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.290\nIt's to kinda get you at the point\nwhere you hit the ground running,\n\n75\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.690\nor at least get very close to it.\n\n76\n00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.020\nI've seen it on numerous cases where\npeople that are starting new to it or\n\n77\n00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.800\ntrying to start up a new department\ninside the company dealing with security.\n\n78\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.710\nThey may know the tools, but now they have\nto kind of figure out what their strategy\n\n79\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.030\nis, what their plan is gonna\nlook like to use them.\n\n80\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270\nAnd so that can be a tough part.\n\n81\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.750\nI can sit here, and I can give\n\n82\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.260\nyou all these different tools to do all\nthe penetration of systems you want.\n\n83\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.820\nBut unless you have a strategy in\nhow you're gonna deploy those tools,\n\n84\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.930\nit becomes kind of a tricky\nproposition at best.\n\n85\n00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.630\nBecause you're not gonna be consistent,\nand you're gonna use a shotgun approach\n\n86\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.910\nand who knows if you're ever gonna get the\nsame results twice off the same system.\n\n87\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.650\nI mean that's not a good situation.\n\n88\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:20.680\nSo this pentest-standard.org is a good\nplace to go to get documents in there and\n\n89\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.040\nto start seeing how it's done and\nmaybe refine your own approach.\n\n90\n00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.670\nLike I said, once you're done\nwith the EC Council stuff and\n\n91\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.270\ndoing their CEA stuff, I can care less\nif you quote that to me again or not.\n\n92\n00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.740\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n93\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.650\nYou can develop your own.\n\n94\n00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.290\nThe one that you brought up, Mike,\n\n95\n00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.570\nabout the CompTia and\ntheir network troubleshooting.\n\n96\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.120\nYeah, I always looked at all\nthe CompTia troubleshooting processes\n\n97\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.410\nI'm never gonna do that that way,\nit's just too many steps.\n\n98\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.050\n>> It was so\nhard to teach some of that stuff cuz\n\n99\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.460\nyou're like I would never do that first,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.220\nThat's not the first\n\n101\n00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.340\nthing I would do, but-\n>> Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.200\n>> You had to know for\nthat particular vendors exam.\n\n103\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.010\nAnd this is gonna be great, Sean,\ncuz I know when I open up Kali and\n\n104\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.190\nI look at all those different tools in\nthere, I have no idea where to start.\n\n105\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.820\nI mean,\nI'm just like Which one do I use first?\n\n106\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.090\nI don't even know where to begin,\nso looking forward to this.\n\n107\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.910\nSo let's take a look at where do we start?\n\n108\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.210\nWhat's the first step in the process?\n\n109\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.150\n>> Well we've got different phases\nreally what it comes down to is we have\n\n110\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.290\nfive phases that we\nare gonna be going through.\n\n111\n00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.550\nSo, we have these five phases and\nagain they more or\n\n112\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.460\nless match up with what's happening.\n\n113\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.050\nWith what you've seen in other places,\nso, the first one we want to kind of take\n\n114\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.440\na look at is really going out and\ngetting reconnaissance from a target.\n\n115\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.060\nNow, on the CEH side,\nthey call this doing foot printing.\n\n116\n00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.630\nOkay, I understand what the term foot\nprinting means, I just never liked it.\n\n117\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.210\nI like reconnaissance a lot better,\ngathering intel, something like that,\n\n118\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.610\nfine, footprinting just sort of is like,\n>> Military background is\n\n119\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.580\ncoming out on you there.\n\n120\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.105\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:06:54.105 --> 00:06:54.605\n>> I don't know.\n\n122\n00:06:54.605 --> 00:06:55.333\nSo foot printing,\n\n123\n00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.200\neven before that I was like,\nfoot printing?\n\n124\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.410\nOkay, I understand it, just,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.160\n>> Never sat with me right.\n\n126\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.530\nSo in anyway that's my opinion and\nsince I wrote the book,\n\n127\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.020\nit's law so you've got to deal with it.\n\n128\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.300\nIn any case what we've got is in Kali so\n\n129\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.160\nwhat we've got is we have to have\na process for gaining information.\n\n130\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.630\nAnd how can we do that?\n\n131\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.780\nWell, if you recall from the CEH, we have\nall sorts of open source intelligence.\n\n132\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.280\nWe have ways of going through DNS.\n\n133\n00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.412\nWe have ways of mapping out, staring to\ndo an initial mapping out of networks and\n\n134\n00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:37.770\nfinding technologies that exist out there.\n\n135\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.000\nWell, it's gonna be really\nthe same thing here.\n\n136\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.990\nWhat we have in Kali is we have this\ninformation gathering pull out right here.\n\n137\n00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.120\nThat's how well they've\norganized this utility.\n\n138\n00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.920\nThey have this information\ngathering utility and\n\n139\n00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.190\nyou can see it's got quite\na few things in here.\n\n140\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.895\nIdentify services, open source analysis,\n\n141\n00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:03.948\nI mean this is open source intelligence,\nOSN that I've got open in here.\n\n142\n00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:07.964\nThe stuff in there is just,\nit's really cool.\n\n143\n00:08:07.964 --> 00:08:09.345\nYou guys will like it when we get to that.\n\n144\n00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:10.112\n>> Nice.\n\n145\n00:08:10.112 --> 00:08:14.090\n>> Because of the amount of\nstuff you can do with that.\n\n146\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.935\nSome of these sayings like a case\nfile in Maltego, you saw Maltego in\n\n147\n00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:24.290\nthe CEH course where, if you recall,\nwe did with the room we spent like what\n\n148\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.320\nalmost a whole day talking about you\nknow that foot printing process.\n\n149\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:29.994\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:32.673\n>> And then all of a sudden like\nget this and this and this and\n\n151\n00:08:32.673 --> 00:08:35.363\nthen what do I do and\nI said let me show a quick way to do it.\n\n152\n00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:40.227\nAnd I open up Maltego and click click\nclick and in like five minutes I did about\n\n153\n00:08:40.227 --> 00:08:44.179\nthree quarters of what we had\ndone over the course of that day,\n\n154\n00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.706\nI had done it in less than five minutes.\n\n155\n00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:48.110\n>> Mm-hm, so it's powerful.\n\n156\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.255\n>> Yeah and\nit was a great visualization tool.\n\n157\n00:08:51.255 --> 00:08:53.182\nSo Maltego is here.\n\n158\n00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:56.980\nCase File is another version of\nthat made by the same company.\n\n159\n00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.629\nThey make that.\n\n160\n00:08:57.629 --> 00:09:01.900\nIt does the same type of things, but then\nyou look at some of the other ones that\n\n161\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.746\nare on here,\nthat are really really fascinating.\n\n162\n00:09:04.746 --> 00:09:08.971\nThe Harvester is one that can be\nused to look for certain files-\n\n163\n00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:09.622\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:09:09.622 --> 00:09:13.789\n>> On a site, and it'll pull them down for\nyou, so you can target towards a domain.\n\n165\n00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:16.610\nGreat for information gathering\nif you wanna look for PDFs or\n\n166\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.667\nsomething like that.\n\n167\n00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:20.874\nI mean, heck,\nremember when I was talking CEH,\n\n168\n00:09:20.874 --> 00:09:24.250\nI was saying that people\ndo hide files on websites.\n\n169\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.032\nThey don't link them any place, but you\nknow that they're probably there you just\n\n170\n00:09:28.032 --> 00:09:29.879\ngotta find them, what the name of it is.\n\n171\n00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:32.896\nYou can actually take something\nlike the Harvester and say,\n\n172\n00:09:32.896 --> 00:09:34.908\nlook I know there's PDF files up there,\n\n173\n00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:38.770\nbring me all the PDF files from that\ndomain, and it will go and download them.\n\n174\n00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.315\n>> Nice.\n\n175\n00:09:39.315 --> 00:09:40.742\n>> So it'll just go right on through it.\n\n176\n00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:43.450\nSo, that's really neat.\n\n177\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:47.220\nAnother one that is interesting on here\nfor doing intelligence that we're going to\n\n178\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.280\nsee as we get further down the road,\nis this one called Metagoofil.\n\n179\n00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.730\nIt's right in the middle of that list.\n\n180\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:59.430\nAnd what's really neat about that one is\nthat one will read the attributes and\n\n181\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.220\nmetadata on documents.\n\n182\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.115\nSo it will go out there and search for\nthose things and tell you, hey,\n\n183\n00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:06.095\nthis is what I found.\n\n184\n00:10:06.095 --> 00:10:06.925\nAnd you can imagine,\n\n185\n00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:12.940\nif you can have that thing spider a\nlocation that has a bunch of files in it.\n\n186\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.995\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n187\n00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:16.542\n>> What you might be able\nto extract out of that.\n\n188\n00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:17.752\nYeah, I mean you can find, I mean,\n\n189\n00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:21.172\nwhat about these places that put,\nyou know Microsoft does a lot of this.\n\n190\n00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:24.662\nWhat if you say you're somebody\nlike Microsoft that puts\n\n191\n00:10:24.662 --> 00:10:28.012\nwhite papers up there in a word format?\n\n192\n00:10:28.012 --> 00:10:30.622\nThey do that a whole heck of a lot.\n\n193\n00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:35.487\nThose things are just filled with\nmetadata, and unless you specifically\n\n194\n00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:40.281\npull it out, and even in those cases,\nthere's still some left behind.\n\n195\n00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:41.698\nYou could use this to go and\nlook for that.\n\n196\n00:10:41.698 --> 00:10:42.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n197\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.830\n>> So,\nthat's specifically designed for that.\n\n198\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.310\nThat's something that we have right\nhere on the Linux side that can\n\n199\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.070\ndo that open-source.\n\n200\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.600\nAnd you can go through and do a lot\nof other things you can see in here,\n\n201\n00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.940\nthere's just so many.\n\n202\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.030\n>> Well, that's what I'm looking at Sean.\n\n203\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.300\nI mean, each one of those,\nyou get DNS analysis.\n\n204\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.560\nThat's not a tool.\n\n205\n00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.840\nThat's a category, and\nunderneath that there's ten tools and\n\n206\n00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.520\nyou go down to IDS and IPS.\n\n207\n00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.710\nThere's another five tools.\n\n208\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.420\nLive host identification.\n\n209\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.090\nThat's a category.\n\n210\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.320\nAnd there's several tools underneath that.\n\n211\n00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.289\nIt's just amazing to me and we haven't\neven made it out of the first phase yet.\n\n212\n00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:15.404\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:18.120\n>> So lots of stuff right here\nto do my information gathering.\n\n214\n00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.400\nNow, some of these do the same thing, so\n\n215\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.572\nit's a lot of me finding the one that\nI prefer or works best in my scenario.\n\n216\n00:11:24.572 --> 00:11:25.652\nIs that how the way this works?\n\n217\n00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:30.606\n>> Yeah, there definitely is\nsome crossover between the tools\n\n218\n00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:35.364\nin a number of cases, but\nit's one of the things we learned\n\n219\n00:11:35.364 --> 00:11:40.240\nin our CEH experience was\nthat that's not a bad thing.\n\n220\n00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.490\nWe like to run an analysis\nwith one tool and\n\n221\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.560\nthen we can also verify it with another.\n\n222\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.788\nI'm a big fan of that.\n\n223\n00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:50.820\nSo even though it would sound\nlike well you only need one,\n\n224\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.188\nsometimes I think in a lot of cases\nthat it's good to have two or\n\n225\n00:11:55.188 --> 00:11:59.651\nmore that you can cross check things,\nor if one doesn't work.\n\n226\n00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:00.640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One may not\n\n227\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.460\nget you the results that you want.\n\n228\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.564\nThat's when you can switch over to\nanother one, cuz you just never know what\n\n229\n00:12:07.564 --> 00:12:12.605\nmight get you the information you need or\nwhat information may be missing.\n\n230\n00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:16.854\nI've had plenty of tools\nwhere I've gone with one and\n\n231\n00:12:16.854 --> 00:12:20.267\nrun that test and everything looked okay.\n\n232\n00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:24.487\nBut because I had done the experimenting\nI'm telling you guys to do,\n\n233\n00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:29.310\nI ran another one and that one showed me\nother stuff that the first one didn't.\n\n234\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.146\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:32.282\n>> And so even though this one's saying,\nhey, there's everything.\n\n236\n00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:36.270\nIt's like no, it clearly isn't everything,\ncuz this showed you more stuff,\n\n237\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.020\nshowed more stuff than you\neven tried to show me.\n\n238\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.360\n>> That's been the buzzword around here,\naround the IT Pro TV studios lately,\n\n239\n00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.720\ntrust but verify.\n\n240\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.473\nTrust the tool is doing what it's\nsupposed to do, use another tool and\n\n241\n00:12:46.473 --> 00:12:47.655\nverify the results, right?\n\n242\n00:12:47.655 --> 00:12:54.056\n>> Yeah and you've gotta think,\nwith something like this especially,\n\n243\n00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:58.070\nyou're doing pen testing, or if you're\nusing these tools to do forensics,\n\n244\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.720\nespecially if you're doing\nsomething like forensics.\n\n245\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.290\nIt's your whole reputation\nif information's missing.\n\n246\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.090\nThat could be the end of your career,\nby missing something.\n\n247\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.340\n>> Missing evidence or telling\nthe customer, oh, everything's good.\n\n248\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.180\nWe did the pen test and\nyou are not vulnerable to this stuff.\n\n249\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.550\nAnd then they get attacked.\n\n250\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.405\nThat might not be so\ngood for your career either.\n\n251\n00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:17.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's going to be a bad day for\n\n252\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.970\nyou, so you definitely,\nit definitely helps to be thorough.\n\n253\n00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:26.160\nNow, just to kind of put some of\nthis stuff in here on top of this,\n\n254\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.520\nis that when you go down this list,\nI mean, yes, there's plenty of tools in\n\n255\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.110\nhere, and we'll get to talk to each one\nof these in turn, as we get through it.\n\n256\n00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.880\nOne of the things you'll notice that\nthis is where you kind of have to use\n\n257\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.590\nyour own knowledge and stuff from other\nplaces is one of the ones we looked at in\n\n258\n00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.195\nCEH was the Echosec technology.\n\n259\n00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:50.820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n260\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.948\n>> Echosec allowed us to do\nlocation based searching of\n\n261\n00:13:55.948 --> 00:14:00.848\nincredibly detailed\nlocation based searching.\n\n262\n00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:02.670\nSo that's not here.\n\n263\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.084\nThat's not a tool that\nthey can actually install.\n\n264\n00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:08.820\nThat's something that's browser based.\n\n265\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.566\nNow, it doesn't mean you couldn't\njust add that to your list of tools.\n\n266\n00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:16.807\nIt's something that you\ncould definitely get and\n\n267\n00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:19.440\nput into your list of tools and let it go.\n\n268\n00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.404\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n269\n00:14:20.404 --> 00:14:25.516\nSo, what I'll do here is I'll go ahead and\n\n270\n00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:30.160\nthis is dot net, did I get it right?\n\n271\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.976\nAnyway, hey look over there for a second.\n\n272\n00:14:34.976 --> 00:14:38.218\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] See,\n\n273\n00:14:38.218 --> 00:14:44.145\nthat's what you get when you get a team\nthat knows each other, you do that.\n\n274\n00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:48.700\nSo, what I've got is yeah,\nI've got it up now.\n\n275\n00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:55.610\nSo what I've got is, you may recall\nthis again from the CEH course.\n\n276\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:02.030\nThis is a little different than\nwhat you saw in the CEH course.\n\n277\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.610\nThe reason is is that after I did the CEH\ncourse, I was talking to the company,\n\n278\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.580\nand they said, oh well says,\ndo you want the more advanced version?\n\n279\n00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.116\nI went,\n>> Got the pro version, oh yeah.\n\n280\n00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:14.035\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah,\n\n281\n00:15:14.035 --> 00:15:20.540\n[LAUGH] I want the stuff that I can, but\nyou could see quite a bit with this one.\n\n282\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.730\nSo stuff that I was doing last time,\n\n283\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.380\nI think I typed in stuff,\nlike when I used this in the CEH course,\n\n284\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.295\nI typed in stuff like Las Vegas and\nI typed in like McCarran airport.\n\n285\n00:15:32.295 --> 00:15:34.725\nSome place where I knew\nthere'd be a lot of people.\n\n286\n00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:37.689\nSo I just usually choose that\nbecause it a tourist area and\n\n287\n00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:41.909\nI know there's a lot of people snapping\naway on their phones and stuff like that.\n\n288\n00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:44.163\nSo during a pen testing process,\n\n289\n00:15:44.163 --> 00:15:47.876\nthere's no reason you couldn't\ndo it inside of Kali.\n\n290\n00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:52.250\nI'm doing it right here in Windows\nto give you a bigger view of it.\n\n291\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.363\nBut you could do the same\nthing inside of Kali.\n\n292\n00:15:57.363 --> 00:16:00.379\nWhat you do in here is you can just,\nand I'm showing this,\n\n293\n00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:04.379\nI know some of you have seen it but I'm\nshowing it again because I know there's\n\n294\n00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:08.628\nprobably some new people in here, too, to\nshow you the type of information that we\n\n295\n00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:13.350\nshould be gathering Is, I can go and\nput my filters in there for my time range.\n\n296\n00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:18.950\nAnd then once I've done that, I mean, this\nis what's really neat about it, is I can\n\n297\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:25.559\ngrab a section of the map, and\nput just a window around it.\n\n298\n00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.950\nAnd so it takes a second and what's\nreally neat about the one I've been given\n\n299\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:40.338\naccess to now by [LAUGH]\nthe wonderful people over at Ecosec.\n\n300\n00:16:40.338 --> 00:16:42.798\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n301\n00:16:42.798 --> 00:16:44.570\n>> I'm not a paid endorser,\n\n302\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.810\nas far as you guys know.\n\n303\n00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.240\nI think the free one did, what, Twitter,\nand Instagram, or something like that.\n\n304\n00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.320\nThis one will pull Facebook.\n\n305\n00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.770\nThat one is doing Facebook.\n\n306\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.930\n>> So what you're seeing here,\nand before I scroll down,\n\n307\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.710\nI just always make the disclaimer here,\nthis is live data.\n\n308\n00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.260\nI have no idea what people post up there.\n\n309\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.633\nSo I apologize if there's\nanything a little questionable.\n\n310\n00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:13.897\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n311\n00:17:13.897 --> 00:17:16.330\n>> Anyway, great, someone posted a donut.\n\n312\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.189\nFilthy.\n\n313\n00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:19.580\n>> [LAUGH] Oh,\nwe're gonna have to delete that one out.\n\n314\n00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.820\nYeah, there you go.\n\n315\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.280\nYou've got different things.\n\n316\n00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.883\nI mean, nothing here is really exciting.\n\n317\n00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:32.860\nOkay, there's people sitting around\na pool out there and and various things,\n\n318\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.200\nbut you can see the data\nis actually pretty current.\n\n319\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.870\nI mean, this stuff is today.\n\n320\n00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.254\nI mean, this was put up here so\nprobably taken, because I\n\n321\n00:17:41.254 --> 00:17:45.837\nwas told from the company that actually\nreads the metadata out of the stuff and\n\n322\n00:17:45.837 --> 00:17:48.113\nthat's where it's getting it from.\n\n323\n00:17:48.113 --> 00:17:51.668\nSo you can see in here,\nwell back on the West Coast,\n\n324\n00:17:51.668 --> 00:17:55.475\nof course,\nit's 2:33 back in California so, and\n\n325\n00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:59.810\nNevada's in the same time zone,\nso this was ten minutes ago.\n\n326\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.500\nSo you're getting some pretty\ncurrent stuff off of this and\n\n327\n00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.620\nyou can filter this stuff down.\n\n328\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.275\nI mean, you can take a look, here's where\npeople checked in using FourSquare.\n\n329\n00:18:12.275 --> 00:18:13.830\nAnd we've got that on here so\n\n330\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.330\nI've got, and\nthis is only from the last 7 days, too.\n\n331\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:23.484\nThis is some Russian deal and ships, if\nthey had a ship going down in the middle.\n\n332\n00:18:23.484 --> 00:18:24.040\nIt is Vegas.\n\n333\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.829\nSo Vegas, if any place could do it.\n\n334\n00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:29.158\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n335\n00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:31.133\nyou can gather quite a bit of information.\n\n336\n00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:36.770\nNow, if I was to pull this part of it out,\nlet's go some place else\n\n337\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.830\njust to see if I can get some more\ninformation, I'll do Waikiki in Hawaii.\n\n338\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.290\nJust because I'm going to Hawaii Monday.\n\n339\n00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.590\nI'm using this as an excuse to check\nout where I'm going to be staying.\n\n340\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.350\nAnd I'm making you guys think\nit's actually, well, hey,\n\n341\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.835\nhe's showing us a lot.\n\n342\n00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:59.940\nBut what's happening here is so\nit reveals information.\n\n343\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.730\nI was actually trying to get it to pop up\nsome Facebook stuff, but it's not doing so\n\n344\n00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.280\nright now.\n\n345\n00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.510\nIt's still bringing some things up, I can\nsee some YouTube information up there.\n\n346\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.440\nBut you will see, in some situations,\n\n347\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.880\nyou will see Facebook\nstuff pop up on the list.\n\n348\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:22.901\nAnd so here again, I'm seeing\nstuff that is relatively current.\n\n349\n00:19:22.901 --> 00:19:29.355\nSo there you go, this type of\nstuff is the stuff that Ecosec\n\n350\n00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:35.230\ndoesn't have a tool or sorry, Kali doesn't\nhave a tool built in directly for it.\n\n351\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.000\nBut, you can get access to it.\n\n352\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.290\nSo, yeah, you've got a browser,\n\n353\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:44.820\nyou can install the browsers\nthat you want in there.\n\n354\n00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:51.130\nSo, you can get quite a bit of stuff\nout of this if you really wanted to.\n\n355\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:56.250\nSo, this is just another tool\nthat's helpful for that.\n\n356\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.320\n>> So a lot to the reconnaissance phase.\n\n357\n00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.050\nThat's when we're gathering information.\n\n358\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.469\nIf we're doing that pentest.\n\n359\n00:20:01.469 --> 00:20:05.023\nWe're being a bad guy, well,\ndepending if you're doing a white hat or\n\n360\n00:20:05.023 --> 00:20:07.250\na black hat type test or what have you.\n\n361\n00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.042\nBut you're gathering\ninformation about your target,\n\n362\n00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.550\nabout your victim, if you will.\n\n363\n00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.715\nBunch of tools built right in\nto Kali that let me do that.\n\n364\n00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:18.665\nYou've got tools outside of\nKali that I can access as well,\n\n365\n00:20:18.665 --> 00:20:22.810\nso it really makes it pretty easy to\nstart gathering that information.\n\n366\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:28.575\n>> Yeah, you're just, again, the process\nthat you're looking at, I mean, some\n\n367\n00:20:28.575 --> 00:20:33.107\nof you probably out there are probably\nlike, oh, yeah, I remember Ecosec.\n\n368\n00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:39.165\nIt was done for really a good number of\nreasons, the big ones being that, first\n\n369\n00:20:39.165 --> 00:20:43.117\nof all, I know some of you hadn't seen\nthat, because there's new names in there.\n\n370\n00:20:43.117 --> 00:20:46.355\nAnd that made, that went with us live last\ntime, maybe you watched the recordings for\n\n371\n00:20:46.355 --> 00:20:50.150\nthe CEH, I don't know,\n>> But if you hadn't seen it, okay,\n\n372\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.070\nnow you've seen it.\n\n373\n00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.030\nBut that's something that you have\navailable through reconnaissance.\n\n374\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.540\nBut you also can see that that's stuff\n\n375\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.430\nthat you can access from\nright inside of Kali.\n\n376\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.500\nIt's just gonna go ahead and enhance it.\n\n377\n00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.590\nAnd then another one that fits in\nthere is the process hasn't changed.\n\n378\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.390\nThe stuff that we taught you over in CEH,\nor stuff that you\n\n379\n00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.370\nmay already do from pentesting,\nthe process is close enough that you\n\n380\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.800\nshould know the types of things you can\nbe looking for at any specific spot.\n\n381\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.890\nIt's just what tools\nare you using to do that?\n\n382\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.510\nYou may use different tools, but\n\n383\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:28.080\nyou're trying to gather the same types\nof information at a certain spot.\n\n384\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.480\nSo when I say you are doing\nreconnaissance on a target,\n\n385\n00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.530\nyou should know what you can reasonably\nexpect to be gathering at that point.\n\n386\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:43.310\nSo that's where that fits in is that yeah,\nthings have changed into a different\n\n387\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.510\nenvironment, but it's not oh, well,\nhey, I've gotta relearn everything.\n\n388\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.030\nNo, you can still use\na lot of these things.\n\n389\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.770\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n390\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:53.400\nAll right, well, Sean,\n\n391\n00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.370\nlooking at the clock it's about\ntime to wrap up this episode.\n\n392\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.690\nI know we talked a lot about that first\nphase, we've got several phases to go.\n\n393\n00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.925\nAnything else you wanna throw in on\nreconnaissance before we wrap it up?\n\n394\n00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:08.735\n>> I'd say this was just a quick\nthing on reconnaissance.\n\n395\n00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:13.785\nWe'll talk more about the flushing\nout of the reconnaissance process and\n\n396\n00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:16.280\nlook at these tools for all these phases.\n\n397\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.199\nWe'll look more in depth at these tools,\nso don't think we're just glossing over it\n\n398\n00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:22.197\nand saying, oh, well, we're not gonna\ncover anything except yeah, here's a tool,\n\n399\n00:22:22.197 --> 00:22:24.087\nhere's a tool, here's a tool,\nhey, see you later.\n\n400\n00:22:24.087 --> 00:22:27.030\nGo look at CH,\nit's not gonna be like that.\n\n401\n00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.726\nIf I can get paid the same amount,\nI'd be out of here, right, so.\n\n402\n00:22:29.726 --> 00:22:34.780\n>> [LAUGH] Right, yeah, first, so we got\nthat high level of review going on, and\n\n403\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.160\nthen we're gonna break them down a little\nbit more in depth, as the episodes go on.\n\n404\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.390\nSo make sure you're sticking with us for\nfuture episodes, but\n\n405\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.570\nfor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n406\n00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.310\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n407\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.821\n>> And we'll see you soon.\n\n408\n00:22:47.821 --> 00:22:53.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.450\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.770\nHow are you, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.690\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.550\nHow about you?\n\n7\n00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.670\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.670\nWe got another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n9\n00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.990\ncontinuing on with our Kali Linux series.\n\n10\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.810\nAnd we left off, Sean, a previous episode\ntalking about some of the phases involved\n\n11\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.650\nin doing a penetration test,\nand doing a little compare and\n\n12\n00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.460\ncontrast between what we've got here and\n\n13\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.400\nmaybe some of the other vendor specific\npenetration models, if you will.\n\n14\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.090\n>> Yeah, and that's the thing we're\ntrying to emphasize in the previous\n\n15\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.990\nsection was that, when we talked about\ndoing that reconnaissance is that yeah,\n\n16\n00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.170\nthere's this whole process is broken\nup into steps, and each step you,\n\n17\n00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.450\nor phase, you have something specific that\nyou're trying to accomplish before you\n\n18\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.920\nmove on to the next phase of the process.\n\n19\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.809\nThe question is, which tools are you going\nto use, and how are you gonna approach it?\n\n20\n00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.770\nAnd why every vendor calls\nit something different.\n\n21\n00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.473\nSome vendors actually throw\nsome additional things into it,\n\n22\n00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.170\nthat others don't.\n\n23\n00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.390\nSome vendors you might see five steps.\n\n24\n00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.430\nThe other one might have seven steps.\n\n25\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.065\nThe other one have 12 steps,\nno 12 steps is something else.\n\n26\n00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:29.934\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n27\n00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.996\nthey'll have all different\nseries of steps in it.\n\n28\n00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:37.250\nSo like I said, I said before, and\n\n29\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.310\nI'll say it again, is just try to remember\nwhat you need to be accomplishing,\n\n30\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.220\nthe sequence that you go through.\n\n31\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.830\nIf you wanna break it into more\nsteps than that, I don't care.\n\n32\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.480\nIf it's your gig, go for it.\n\n33\n00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.317\nIf you wanna do it that way,\nnot a problem.\n\n34\n00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:58.803\nWell, going through with that,\nwith that thinking,\n\n35\n00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:03.777\nwe did reconnaissance, so\nwe've gotten information about\n\n36\n00:02:03.777 --> 00:02:08.751\nwhat our target looks like,\nwhere they might be employees,\n\n37\n00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:11.703\nthings like that- [CROSSTALK]\n>> DNS names,\n\n38\n00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:15.100\nall kinds of good stuff like that, so\nwe got a lot of information about them.\n\n39\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.950\n>> Yeah, you could have gathered,\n\n40\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.350\njust a tremendous amount,\nabout that specific target.\n\n41\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.250\nThe next question that comes in,\n\n42\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.800\nis how do you act on it, and\nthat's the scanning phase.\n\n43\n00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.650\nWhere we start really seeing what that\ninformation translates over into,\n\n44\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.010\nif you will.\n\n45\n00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.110\nWhen you go into your reconnaissance,\n\n46\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.620\nyou found ranges of IPs,\nDNS information, stuff like that.\n\n47\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.020\nNow you're going over and saying, okay\nwell let me start scanning some of those\n\n48\n00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.410\nthings that I found to see what's really\nthere, maybe narrow down the target and\n\n49\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.200\nkinda firm things up for the point where\nI'm gonna actually strike at that target.\n\n50\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.920\nSo some really, really important stuff to\ndo here, and remember there's not just\n\n51\n00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.610\none way of scanning either, there's\na myriad of ways of scanning a system.\n\n52\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.440\nYou can do port scanning,\nyou can do ping sweeps,\n\n53\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.230\nyou can do vulnerability scanning\nif you want, just to name a few.\n\n54\n00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.650\nYou have options.\n\n55\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.020\n>> Yeah, and so we're just basically\ntaking that information that we gather in\n\n56\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.000\nthe reconnaissance phase,\nthat becomes the deliverable if you will,\n\n57\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.220\nfor that next phase, and\nnow we go into our scanning.\n\n58\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.770\nLike you said that's a great example,\ntake that IP address range.\n\n59\n00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.600\nI discovered the range doing my\nreconnaissance, maybe I found out what\n\n60\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.975\nblock they had registered with the IANA,\nor something like that.\n\n61\n00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:37.705\nBut now how many do they actually use,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:38.795\nWhich ones are alive.\n\n63\n00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:41.405\nWhich ones am I actually\ngonna find on that system?\n\n64\n00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:42.865\nSo that's where the scanning\nphase comes in.\n\n65\n00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:46.125\nThis is where we start taking\nthat information we gathered, and\n\n66\n00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.635\nstart seeing what part of it's useful.\n\n67\n00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:50.995\nWhat can I get from that information.\n\n68\n00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:53.200\n>> Yeah, that's the name of the game.\n\n69\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.260\nWhere we've gotten to the point where\nwe're more actively engaging the system,\n\n70\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.120\nand we're seeing really\nwhat's behind there.\n\n71\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.730\nWe don't just have a pile of information.\n\n72\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.290\nNow we gotta sort through it, and really\nstart figuring out what that really means,\n\n73\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.280\nwhat do they have, so\nI can take it a step further.\n\n74\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.840\nYou don't just wanna go through and carpet\nbomb, cuz that's really all you could do\n\n75\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.030\nwith what you have in the reconnaissance\nphase, is you carpet bomb.\n\n76\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.590\nOr it'd be the equivalent of just\nstumbling around in a dark room.\n\n77\n00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.510\nLooking for a penny or\nsomething on the floor,\n\n78\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.278\nyou're gonna find it eventually, but.\n\n79\n00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:29.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Someone's gonna go in there and go,\n\n80\n00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.220\nwhat the heck are you doing?\n\n81\n00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.930\nSo you don't want that.\n\n82\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.040\nSo you want to be much more precise and\nreally know what you're dealing with, so\n\n83\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.430\nscanning's going to\nhelp you out with that.\n\n84\n00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.050\nFortunately, Kali has a lot\nof stuff up it's sleeve.\n\n85\n00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.290\nTo help us with that scanning process,\nkinda like what you'd expect.\n\n86\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.100\nIt has just a bunch of\ndifferent tools to help us out.\n\n87\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.530\nSo we can just quickly take a look at\nsome of the things that we're gonna see,\n\n88\n00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.950\nsome of which we're gonna see and\nwork with in a later section.\n\n89\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.220\nBut just to kind of give you an idea,\n\n90\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.340\nthe types of stuff that we have\nto address this specific need,\n\n91\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.810\nsome of the ones you've seen before,\nat least you know what they do.\n\n92\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.370\nThey just go under a different name,\nor do things a little differently, but\n\n93\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.130\nthe process overall is\naccomplishing the same task.\n\n94\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.510\nIf you go under information gathering, cuz\nscanning really is the same type of thing.\n\n95\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.200\nIt's information gathering, it's just a\nmore active form of information gathering.\n\n96\n00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.150\nSo as far as Kali's concerned,\nwhat do we have?\n\n97\n00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.620\nWell we've got, first of all\nthis live host identification.\n\n98\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.580\nWell you know what that is, that's where\nwe're doing, we have a range of IPs and\n\n99\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.570\nwe're just saying, okay, which ones of\nthose actually have something living\n\n100\n00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.710\nbehind it, so we have lots of\ntools that can do that for us.\n\n101\n00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.820\nAnd if you really look through it,\nwe've got one that we used all the time.\n\n102\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.101\nRight on down the list we have\nnmap's sitting right there.\n\n103\n00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:03.250\nI told you in the CEH, told you, you are\nnot getting away from nmap at this point,\n\n104\n00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.700\nif you don't have it in\nyour suite of tools,\n\n105\n00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.460\nit's gonna have to get there really quick.\n\n106\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.115\n>> It's kind of impressive they actually\nhave the GUI version on there too.\n\n107\n00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:13.320\nThey got Zenmap as well [LAUGH].\n\n108\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.860\n>> Yeah, I was gonna mention that, they\nhave Zenmap right there at the bottom too.\n\n109\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.460\nI scrolled the menu down,\nit's right there.\n\n110\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.770\nZenmap, so you do have that.\n\n111\n00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.910\nBut remember the limitation with Zenmap.\n\n112\n00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.200\nYou can't do everything through Zenmap.\n\n113\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.410\nSo that would be kind\nof a deal breaker on-\n\n114\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.830\n>> And we're in Kali Linux,\n\n115\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.780\nwho's gonna play with the GUI.\n\n116\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.070\nCome on break out that shell [LAUGH].\n\n117\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.050\n>> Yeah if you play with the GUI in this,\n\n118\n00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.898\nyou're a baby and\nI don't wanna talk to you.\n\n119\n00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:44.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can sit at the small table.\n\n120\n00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.180\n>> That's right, [LAUGH] you get\nthe kids table at Thanksgiving.\n\n121\n00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.620\n>> But you can see other one's that\nare useful for doing scanning.\n\n122\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.109\nWe can see stuff, we have a Ncat, Netcat.\n\n123\n00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:58.710\nWe've got just bunches and bunches,\nand bunches of things here\n\n124\n00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.355\ndesigned specifically to gather\ninformation about live hosts.\n\n125\n00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:09.260\nWhen we mentioned in the CEH course,\nbut we didn't get to do it, was Hping.\n\n126\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.790\nHping3 is the current version of that.\n\n127\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.800\nWe're gonna see that.\n\n128\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.370\nWe're actually gonna be working with that.\n\n129\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.160\nAnd see how that can do that scanning.\n\n130\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.090\nHow that can craft packets for you, to\ngain more information about that target.\n\n131\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.550\nOkay?\nSo once we've done that.\n\n132\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.860\nSo we've determined live host.\n\n133\n00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.418\nWe know we've gotta do that.\n\n134\n00:07:26.418 --> 00:07:29.410\nThat's one sub-phase of\nthe scanning process,\n\n135\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.060\nis to gather information about what\nhosts are live, and which ones aren't.\n\n136\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.390\nOkay.\nThen that takes us to what the next thing\n\n137\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.725\nis, and that's doing our,\nscanning our network.\n\n138\n00:07:37.725 --> 00:07:38.580\nOkay.\n\n139\n00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.220\nIf you do scanning our network,\nwe know what do we have here,\n\n140\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.000\nwe have a lot of the same things we\nsaw in our live host identification,\n\n141\n00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.620\nand you'll see a Zenmap right there.\n\n142\n00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.670\nIt's sitting right there,\nZenmap and nmap, so same deal.\n\n143\n00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:01.260\nAnd so we've got those guys handy and\nready for us to do what we need to.\n\n144\n00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.350\nSo that would be part of\nour scanning process.\n\n145\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.480\nSo it has a full suite of tools there for\nmapping out that nmap.\n\n146\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.560\nIt's also got one of my favorite\ntools in there, names of a tool.\n\n147\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.650\nUnicorn Scan.\n\n148\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:13.521\n>> Unicorn Scan.\n\n149\n00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:14.195\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yep.\n\n150\n00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:17.740\n>> Just in case you've got any of\nthose pesky unicorns on your network.\n\n151\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.190\nWe gotta be able to find them and\nget rid of them.\n\n152\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.090\n>> I don't know if you guys looked,\n\n153\n00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.190\nbut you joke around about\nunicorns being mythical.\n\n154\n00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.870\nIf you look in the papers,\nNorth Korea says they were there,\n\n155\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.288\nthey said they found out\nwhere they came from.\n\n156\n00:08:29.288 --> 00:08:31.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not kidding.\n\n157\n00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.790\nThey found them, cave in a mountain,\n\n158\n00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.250\nthat they said unicorns came from North\nKorea and we know how reliable they are.\n\n159\n00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.616\nSo you gotta trust it.\n\n160\n00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:39.870\n>> That's like seeing it on Wikipedia.\n\n161\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.175\nIf they say its true its true.\n\n162\n00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:42.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n163\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.689\nyou can also buy unicorn\nmeat off of Amazon.\n\n164\n00:08:44.689 --> 00:08:47.429\n[LAUGH] If you don't\nbelieve me go look it up.\n\n165\n00:08:47.429 --> 00:08:52.640\n>> [LAUGH] So scanning anyways for\nunicorns or not.\n\n166\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.820\n>> Like half these people here we\nshould just wait for a second.\n\n167\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.753\nAnd they're like no, you can't.\n\n168\n00:08:58.753 --> 00:09:01.979\n[LAUGH]\n>> They're Googling it right now.\n\n169\n00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:04.870\nSo scanning, gathering information,\nagain at a much\n\n170\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.920\nmore active level then we were when\nwe were doing our reconnaissance.\n\n171\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.250\nNow, we're typically reaching out and\ntouching the target a lot of times.\n\n172\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.560\nDoing those port scans, doing those\nnetwork scans, doing those vulnerability\n\n173\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.640\nscans, I think they got some vulnerability\nscanning tools in there as well?\n\n174\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.590\n>> Yes, they do have some vulnerability\n\n175\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.090\nscanning tools in here if you look\nthey do have vulnerability analysis.\n\n176\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.000\nThey have stuff, and\n\n177\n00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.866\nthis is how diverse they have,\nthey have ones for Cisco, Database ones.\n\n178\n00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:31.900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n179\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.400\n>> Here's some Fuzzing Tools for\napplication checks.\n\n180\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.880\nI mean, they've got just a bunch of them.\n\n181\n00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.340\nThere's nikto,\nthere's nmap showing up yet again.\n\n182\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.290\n>> One more time.\n\n183\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.570\n>> We got all these things.\n\n184\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.580\nI mean there's just so many.\n\n185\n00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:49.400\nOpenVAS, OpenVAS if you're not aware\nof that one, OpenVAS is where a Nessus.\n\n186\n00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.189\nWhat at one point was completely 100%\nfree and at one point they decided, well,\n\n187\n00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:58.450\nwe wanna start taking it to commercial\nbecause it was originally started.\n\n188\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.290\nIt was like a project and it became so\npopular, they said, well,\n\n189\n00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.690\nwe have a real product here.\n\n190\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.840\nLet's not, stop giving it away for free.\n\n191\n00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.140\nSo thing is, they made a choice, and\nthey said, they forked the product.\n\n192\n00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:16.310\nInto openVAS which is the free one and\nNessus which is the paid one.\n\n193\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.180\nSo, when they hit that fork in the road,\n\n194\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.170\nit's like you can decide which\none you want to go with.\n\n195\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:22.710\n>> Nice.\n\n196\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.625\n>> They fork to the customers.\n\n197\n00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.530\n[LAUGH] By charging.\n\n198\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.603\nBut, any case,\n\n199\n00:10:27.603 --> 00:10:32.295\nyeah, you'll notice it looks somewhat\nsimilar to Nessus in some ways.\n\n200\n00:10:32.295 --> 00:10:35.760\nIn other cases it's just\nlike way different.\n\n201\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:42.380\nSo you may actually wanna get\nsomething different than that one.\n\n202\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.400\nBut anyway, so we've got Live Host.\n\n203\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.080\nWe've done Scanning port scanning,\nstuff like that.\n\n204\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.420\nAdd DNS.\n\n205\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.140\nHere we have a vulnerability.\n\n206\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.400\nThose would be the main sub\ncategories under scanning.\n\n207\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.070\nBut then let's just mention\nit as part of this is,\n\n208\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.510\nremember when we went to the CEH\nwe said it was a scanning phase.\n\n209\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.165\nIn my book I wrote for the CEH,\nwhich you all should have and\n\n210\n00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:12.185\nif your don't I gonna be upset.\n\n211\n00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:14.700\n[LAUGH] See someone found it.\n\n212\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.499\nBut, in the CEH book I did talk about\n\n213\n00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:24.690\nthe process of doing\npenetration testing and\n\n214\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.770\nwe talked about all of\nthe phases back then.\n\n215\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.630\nBut I also took the scanning phase and\n\n216\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.730\nbroke it up into two sections because I\nfelt it was too much for one chapter.\n\n217\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.180\nIt's because that second part of\nscanning was called enumeration, and\n\n218\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.680\nenumeration was extracting\nstuff from services and\n\n219\n00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.020\nseeing what they could\nactually reveal to us.\n\n220\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.900\nSo, Kali could help you with that too.\n\n221\n00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.990\nThat would still be part\nof the scanning process.\n\n222\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.590\nIn fact, outside of doing a CEH,\nthe term enumeration is\n\n223\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.440\nused to be sure but, most people\njust consider it, it's scanning.\n\n224\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.670\nAnd that's it.\n\n225\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.760\nYou won't hear anything else.\n\n226\n00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.750\nDC council used to call it scanning and\nthen there also was enumeration phase.\n\n227\n00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.010\nBut then they started doing what other\npeople did, squishing them together.\n\n228\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.400\nWhich, it doesn't matter,\n\n229\n00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.760\nas long as it gets done in\nthe right sequence, you're fine.\n\n230\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.080\nSo what that means,\nis that when we go through and\n\n231\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.330\nwe look at what tools we have in Kali,\nwhat do we have?\n\n232\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:25.150\nWe have stuff for doing SNMP,\n\n233\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.560\nSMTP to gather user names,\nremember we could do that.\n\n234\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.755\nnmap is in there because\nnmap can help with that.\n\n235\n00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:35.285\nService fingerprinting, well we want\nto find out what service is back there,\n\n236\n00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:36.765\nthat's what this will do.\n\n237\n00:12:36.765 --> 00:12:41.040\nSo we have tools that will\nliterally help us out with that.\n\n238\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.440\nAnd in fact you can even throw in stuff\nlike your DNS analysis up top would be\n\n239\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.230\npart of scanning numeration as\nwell as the IDS and IPS stuff.\n\n240\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.160\nThat's gonna help there too because those\nthings are specifically designed to\n\n241\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.270\nhelp you target, do specific scans.\n\n242\n00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.330\nThat might be blocked or\ndetected by an IDS or\n\n243\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.665\nIPS in such a way that you can\nsee that they're in the way.\n\n244\n00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:07.790\n>> Nice.\n\n245\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.940\n>> So, some really neat stuff.\n\n246\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.520\nAnd heck, I even like, if you get down to\nthe bottom where it says we're talking\n\n247\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.060\nabout this, you go down to the bottom of\nthat of the information gathering section.\n\n248\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:21.300\nI mean, take a look,\nthey've got stuff for voiceover IP, and\n\n249\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.600\nsome other stuff in there, too, so they've\nreally brought stuff to the table on this.\n\n250\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.450\n>> Absolutely.\n\n251\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.190\n>> I mean, we're not going to do any\nvoice override IT stuff in here,\n\n252\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.170\nwhich I know you may wish we could, but\n[LAUGH] we don't have a way to do that.\n\n253\n00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.200\nBut you could technically do that\nthrough a product like this.\n\n254\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.780\nAnd it is extremely\npowerful in that sense,\n\n255\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.160\nif you had that in your environment.\n\n256\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.330\n>> All right well, a lot of tools\nthen available for scanning.\n\n257\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.690\nAnd I know this is just our high level\noverview kind of an intro to say\n\n258\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.760\nlook at all these tools\nthat are available.\n\n259\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:00.260\nAfter scanning, slash enumeration,\nwe'll kinda meld those two together there.\n\n260\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:00.980\nWhat's next?\n\n261\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.160\nWe got exploitation.\n\n262\n00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.291\n>> Yeah, exploitation is, it's what\nthey call on the CEH to kinda put\n\n263\n00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:13.520\nit in context CEH calls that gaining\naccess, getting into a system.\n\n264\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.850\nGaining and slash maintaining access\nwould be what's covered by that.\n\n265\n00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.650\nWe're going to call exploitation\nhere to get into a system.\n\n266\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:30.560\nSo we've got exploitation\nThe tools we have for that just to\n\n267\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.060\nkind of give you an idea of what's here,\nis we've got different sections of tools.\n\n268\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.180\nIf you look at it we have first of all,\nthings for attacking passwords.\n\n269\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.611\nIf you remember from CEH we\ndid talks specifically one of\n\n270\n00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:48.228\nthe first things we do,\none of the first things we might try\n\n271\n00:14:48.228 --> 00:14:52.960\nrather is tackling passwords,\nseeing if we can break any.\n\n272\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.699\nSo if you look at it, I mean we've got so\nmany different types of password\n\n273\n00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:02.595\ncrackers and these offline ones, I mean,\nlike look at how many are there,\n\n274\n00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:06.120\nand that menu scrolls back and\nforth too, by the way.\n\n275\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.960\nSo that's not showing you everything.\n\n276\n00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.810\nI mean, they've got LSA dump going after\nthe stuff on a Windows box right there.\n\n277\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.360\n>> And there's a lot of tools\nat our fingertips here.\n\n278\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.170\n>> Yeah, and we only talked about a small\nnumber of these things in the CDH.\n\n279\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.985\nI mean some of these things aren't\nmentioned anywhere in there because\n\n280\n00:15:29.985 --> 00:15:32.230\nthey're just so obscure.\n\n281\n00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:37.320\nAnd they only have so many pages they\ncan shove into, or so much information\n\n282\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.870\nthey can shove into the test and\nhave you be aware of it, but that's fine.\n\n283\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.830\nI don't care if you know the individual\ntools, I want you to know what the process\n\n284\n00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.020\nmeans, then you'll figure out\nwhat these tools are anyway.\n\n285\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.770\nOther ones.\n\n286\n00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.130\nThis one, Passing the Hash.\n\n287\n00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.134\nOkay fine, these are ones for\nactually extracting hashes and\n\n288\n00:15:56.134 --> 00:16:00.140\nstuff like that that are used\nin a lot of passwording systems.\n\n289\n00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:07.360\nSo that's just that first part of\ngaining access and doing exploit.\n\n290\n00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.130\nYou might be home free at that point.\n\n291\n00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:09.950\nAnd be oh, yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.190\nI got a password.\n\n293\n00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.440\nI can log in and go on in.\n\n294\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.200\nBut that's not it.\n\n295\n00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.310\nI mean of course, that's not it.\n\n296\n00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.190\nRight?\n\n297\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.450\nThere's other things we have in here too.\n\n298\n00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:25.127\nWe have a whole section appropriately\ncalled exploitation tools.\n\n299\n00:16:25.127 --> 00:16:27.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if we look at what's in here,\n\n300\n00:16:27.677 --> 00:16:31.080\nyou know, you've got all\nsorts of testing frameworks.\n\n301\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.940\nI mean there's beef, that's something that\nis really neat for doing some web stuff.\n\n302\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.070\nWe're going to be taking\na look at that a little bit.\n\n303\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.700\nSome Cisco stuff again, database stuff,\nI mean, all sorts of things.\n\n304\n00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.851\nMeta Sploit, the big boy, we're gonna be\ngoing and talking about that next week so\n\n305\n00:16:45.851 --> 00:16:48.060\nwe won't be doing too\nmuch about that here.\n\n306\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.537\nNetwork stuff, you know,\nif we're going through and scanning and\n\n307\n00:16:51.537 --> 00:16:55.610\nplaying around with the networks, and\neven this one's one of my favorites.\n\n308\n00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.600\nIt might not necessarily be just\nat the gaining access stage, but\n\n309\n00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.075\nthe social engineering tool kit.\n\n310\n00:17:02.075 --> 00:17:03.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n311\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:09.238\nI've mentioned this is as kind of like\na blip on the radar when we did CEH.\n\n312\n00:17:09.238 --> 00:17:12.660\nThat was it, I just said well you know\nthere's a social engineering tool kit if\n\n313\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.120\nyou want to take a look at it for\nLinux, and I just left it at that.\n\n314\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.760\nWell here, we're gonna actually\nsee what that does and\n\n315\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.880\nit's something that helps you\ncraft a social engineering attack.\n\n316\n00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.790\n>> Huh.\n>> So, we've got\n\n317\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.420\na tool here that actually.\n\n318\n00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:32.260\nWe didn't have really, in the CEH course,\nwe had access to email and\n\n319\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.810\ninstant messaging and\nstuff like that that would help us do it.\n\n320\n00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:40.390\nBut we didn't have something like this\nthat's specifically designed to craft and\n\n321\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.270\nplan these attacks.\n\n322\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.350\nSo you're gonna see that.\n\n323\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.270\nSome pretty exciting stuff there.\n\n324\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:49.310\nAnd we've got other things just all\nthrough here that can be used to\n\n325\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:53.470\nhelp us look for various pieces\nof information or gain access.\n\n326\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.331\nI mean,\nthere is stuff to go through websites and\n\n327\n00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:04.090\nto scan websites to really find all sorts\nof stuff that could be of use to you.\n\n328\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.080\n>> Lots of tools in it.\n\n329\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.120\nDoesn't stop there, right?\n\n330\n00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.150\nOur next phase, once we've exploited\nthe target, we've found our way in,\n\n331\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.940\nmaybe gather some more information, then\nwe wanna make sure we can get back in.\n\n332\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.840\nAnytime we want to.\n\n333\n00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.260\n>> And\nthat'd be our maintaining access phase.\n\n334\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.820\n>> Yeah that's the next\nlogical thing you do.\n\n335\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.530\nWell let me back up on that.\n\n336\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.440\nIt might be the next logical thing you do.\n\n337\n00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.130\nIt depends.\n\n338\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.570\nYou may be doing a quick smash and grab,\n\n339\n00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.740\nwhere you go in and you get\nthe stuff you want and you're done.\n\n340\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.760\nYou never need to come back.\n\n341\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.040\nThere are attacks that are designed\nspecifically like that,\n\n342\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.190\nthat you just smash it,\nget what you want, done.\n\n343\n00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.965\nYou ride off in the sunset and\nlet someone else clean up the mess.\n\n344\n00:18:44.965 --> 00:18:51.065\nBut, there's cases where you do want\nto come, or you do want to come back.\n\n345\n00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:55.297\nAnd that's where maintain\naccess really comes into play.\n\n346\n00:18:55.297 --> 00:18:58.997\nTo maintain access is\na delicate procedure.\n\n347\n00:18:58.997 --> 00:19:02.537\nWhat it is, is it's usually\nplanting something on the system or\n\n348\n00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:05.887\nmaking an alteration on the system\nin such a way that it's easy for\n\n349\n00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:09.547\nyou to get back in the next time,\nso you don't have to\n\n350\n00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:14.537\nessentially restart the whole penetration\nor hacking process to get right in.\n\n351\n00:19:14.537 --> 00:19:16.577\nSo, for maintaining access,\n\n352\n00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:19.452\njust to kind of give you an idea\nof what that translates into,\n\n353\n00:19:19.452 --> 00:19:24.020\nwhat we have here is, take a look, they\nhave a section right there OS back doors.\n\n354\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.050\nI mean how clear can you get?\n\n355\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:29.380\nIt's designed specifically for\nthat, to plant a back door.\n\n356\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.830\nAnd I can tell you,\n\n357\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:36.470\nthat is not even a complete list of\nthe stuff of tools you can use to do that.\n\n358\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:41.630\nYou know, tunneling tools, we've talked\nabout some of these tunneling tools,\n\n359\n00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.480\nyou know, previously in our CEH course.\n\n360\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.860\nWhat these are done, are these are done\nto bypass things like firewalls and\n\n361\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.250\nother defensive technologies covertly.\n\n362\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.660\nWe see for example, N CAT on here,\n\n363\n00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.740\nif you remember N CAT would allow me to\npop in the number of an IP address and\n\n364\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.830\nport number, attach to it remotely,\nand, I could start piping commands,\n\n365\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.788\nor force open to a command prompt and\ndo what I want.\n\n366\n00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:08.094\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n367\n00:20:08.094 --> 00:20:15.530\n>> Okay, so, but, that's all well and good\nbut problem is netcat is in the clear.\n\n368\n00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.695\nSo someone could sniff that,\nwhich means if they can sniff it,\n\n369\n00:20:19.695 --> 00:20:22.590\nIDS/IPS can pick that up.\n\n370\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.930\n>> Right.\n>> So if you want to change the nature of\n\n371\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.190\nthe game, what do we have there?\n\n372\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.070\nWe have, look up at the top of the list,\nwe have CryptCat.\n\n373\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.270\nThere's your answer.\n\n374\n00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.294\nIt encrypts that whole channel,\nso therefore you can't read, but\n\n375\n00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:34.850\nyou can't stop what you can't\nread if it's encrypted.\n\n376\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.872\nSo we just forwarded that and\nall of these go towards some way\n\n377\n00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:45.205\nof bypassing secure,\nsecurity when we tunnel them like that.\n\n378\n00:20:45.205 --> 00:20:48.985\nWhen you think tunneling,\nthink VPN, same type of deal.\n\n379\n00:20:48.985 --> 00:20:52.025\nYou look down there,\nwe even have at the bottom UDP.\n\n380\n00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:54.925\nThey have ways of wrapping them up\nin UDP packets to get it through.\n\n381\n00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:57.685\nYou can proxy stuff to other systems.\n\n382\n00:20:57.685 --> 00:21:02.470\nThey've really come to play with this one.\n\n383\n00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.140\nAnd then you know,\n\n384\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.320\nat the last one you have on this maintain\naccess stuff, we're going after websites.\n\n385\n00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.690\nYou know it's specifically got that, and\nthink about it, one of the points of\n\n386\n00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:20.020\nentries into a website would very well\nbe you know, or into a company rather.\n\n387\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.070\nCould very well be that web site.\n\n388\n00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.910\nThat web site is the very least for\n\n389\n00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.350\nmost companies,\nthe public facing resource that they have.\n\n390\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.090\nEverything else is gonna be over\nthe firewall on the other side of it.\n\n391\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.160\nSo they have that web server\nout there in some capacity.\n\n392\n00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.600\nWell now we're just gonna go after\ntheir web server, punch into that, and\n\n393\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.430\nsee if we can get through that way.\n\n394\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.902\nAnd we're going to look at some of\nthe tools used for doing web application\n\n395\n00:21:45.902 --> 00:21:49.040\nscanning so that's going to be kind\nof exciting when you see that.\n\n396\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.860\nThat we have all these\nways of going after that.\n\n397\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.820\nThat's just, again,\nthat's just the maintaining access part.\n\n398\n00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.540\nWe're still just moving right\nalong on the stuff that this has.\n\n399\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.670\nIf you've noticed, there's still quite\na few menus on there I haven't hit [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.720\n>> That's what I was thinking.\n\n401\n00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.220\n>> So, there's a button here,\nyou're like what's that what do these do.\n\n402\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.180\nYeah, we'll get to those in due time.\n\n403\n00:22:17.412 --> 00:22:20.950\n>> All right well let's hit that last\nphase then after we maintain access.\n\n404\n00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.100\nIf it's not a smash and\ngrab we wanna maintain access,\n\n405\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.458\nthen we move into that final\nphase which is reporting.\n\n406\n00:22:26.458 --> 00:22:28.230\n>> Yeah, I mean, remember,\n\n407\n00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.670\nit shouldn't come as any big surprise to\nyou that there is a reporting requirement.\n\n408\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:37.260\nIf you're doing a pen test, by its\nvery nature, if someone's asked you to\n\n409\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.470\ndo a pen test, they are your client and\nthey're paying you.\n\n410\n00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:47.580\nAnd you need to deliver reports then\non what the issues are you found, and\n\n411\n00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.380\nmake recommendations if they've asked for\nthat, you need to provide that to them.\n\n412\n00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.570\nSo.\n\n413\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:58.010\nThe really neat thing about something\nlike Kali is that they also have\n\n414\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:03.680\ntools in here that are designed\nspecifically to help you track all that.\n\n415\n00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.330\nSo you don't have to go some place else.\n\n416\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.470\nI mean, you can see they've got Maltego,\n\n417\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.790\nthey've got a bunch of other ones\nin there, documentation stuff.\n\n418\n00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.100\nI know DRADIS Is one that\na lot of people like.\n\n419\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.960\nStuff for media capture,\ntaking screenshots and videos, and\n\n420\n00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.290\nstuff like that.\n\n421\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:26.670\nSo they've tried to be, maybe they\nhaven't done everything perfectly,\n\n422\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:28.250\nof course you could argue that.\n\n423\n00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.720\nI'd say they've done a pretty good job.\n\n424\n00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.200\nThe reporting tools,\nthey may leave some to be desired, but\n\n425\n00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.480\nyou've got something\nthere to help you out.\n\n426\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.920\nAnd that's the number one thing.\n\n427\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.020\nI'd rather have something that\ngets me the nice down and\n\n428\n00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.280\ndirty way to collect the information.\n\n429\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.120\nI can pretty it up later on.\n\n430\n00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.967\nBut having something right there that I\ncan just quickly type something in and\n\n431\n00:23:51.967 --> 00:23:55.710\nmake a note, fine, it's the digital\nequivalent of a post it note, fine.\n\n432\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.610\nI can put those in the right\norder later as the case may be.\n\n433\n00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.048\n>> I'm just impressed that they have it at\nall cuz a lot of time you think of these\n\n434\n00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:07.704\nsecurity tools and things like that It's\nmore about the action part, you know,\n\n435\n00:24:07.704 --> 00:24:10.810\nthe actual doing the attack or\ngathering the information.\n\n436\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.610\nReporting is something that nobody\nwants to deal with, nobody wants to do,\n\n437\n00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.120\nand the fact that they've even got tools\nloaded up in there that let me keep track\n\n438\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.730\nof my different steps and phases and\n\n439\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.380\ninformation I'm gathering and\nreporting in the end,\n\n440\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.510\nwhen the results of my penetration test,\nI think that's fantastic.\n\n441\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.250\n>> Yeah, it's a great thing\nthat they put that in there.\n\n442\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.410\nSo, it's right there in your face saying,\nhey,\n\n443\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.080\nwe know you need to\ncollect this information.\n\n444\n00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.400\nSo, boom, right here.\n\n445\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.920\nSome of those tools in there that they,\nunder that reporting one,\n\n446\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.700\nat least one of them,\nDradis is something that people have.\n\n447\n00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.820\nA lot of people do like\nit as a reporting tool.\n\n448\n00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.330\nSo when we get further down the road,\n\n449\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.490\nwe'll bring that up to\nkinda see what that is.\n\n450\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.340\nBut it is there,\nthey do have that right there.\n\n451\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:03.150\nAnd notice they've also in Kali they've\nalso put in the Office suite too.\n\n452\n00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.050\nOr at least their version\nof an Office suite.\n\n453\n00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:11.050\nSo you've got some basic stuff\nin there to help you out.\n\n454\n00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.870\nAnd you could leave the Office or\n\n455\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.500\nsomething in there too\nif you really wanted to.\n\n456\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.630\nAnd I would recommend really doing\nsomething like that cuz those\n\n457\n00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.260\nare also good ways to keep notes and\nkeep them organized.\n\n458\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.665\nSo you've got those.\n\n459\n00:25:23.665 --> 00:25:27.265\nSomething I'll mention here when we're\ngoing through this process is that\n\n460\n00:25:27.265 --> 00:25:28.905\nwe've talked about these different phases.\n\n461\n00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:34.135\nOne of the things you'll notice that's\nmissing from the phases in here, is\n\n462\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.980\nsomething that the EC counsel stresses in\n\n463\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:46.330\ntheir body of knowledge, is clearing\nyour tracks, covering your tracks.\n\n464\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.960\nWell, they don't really,\n\n465\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.080\nthat's not something that we're\nreally even worrying about here.\n\n466\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.480\nThere's ways to do it.\n\n467\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.450\nBut it's something in the overall pen\ntesting world, it's kind of just assumed\n\n468\n00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:59.400\nthat if you're maintaining access\nit's mushed in there anyway.\n\n469\n00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.820\nThey don't have a separate phase for\nthat or broken out in such a way.\n\n470\n00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:07.970\nIt's like, you're trying to be careful\nabout what you do and try to leave as\n\n471\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:13.650\nfew tracks as possible so\npeople can't find them easily.\n\n472\n00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:19.890\nNow if you went through the CEH and\nthe forensics course, you know that\n\n473\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.740\nbecomes very tough to hide if someone\nknows what they're looking for and\n\n474\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.190\nknow the tricks, they can very\neasily find a lot of this stuff.\n\n475\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:34.100\nSo, but\nthey don't really break that out in here.\n\n476\n00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.900\nWhile we're at it, though, there\nare a couple things I wanna just point\n\n477\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.960\nout to you, to show you what,\nsome other stuff that's hiding out here.\n\n478\n00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.620\nIs yeah we went through\na good number of these,\n\n479\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.320\nthe web application stuff we looked at.\n\n480\n00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.350\nIf you keep going dow the list you'll\nsee some other stuff show up there.\n\n481\n00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.180\nI mean there's our wireless,\nwhatever it's got for wireless.\n\n482\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.330\nThis is the one that impresses\nme it's got the 802.11.\n\n483\n00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.690\nOkay, we know that, it's got Bluetooth.\n\n484\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:01.440\nOkay well that's pretty neat.\n\n485\n00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.390\nYou got the other wireless ones,\nI think this one is Zigbee.\n\n486\n00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.812\nWhat these ones do, and then RFID and NFC.\n\n487\n00:27:08.812 --> 00:27:10.240\n>> Wow [LAUGH].\n\n488\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.050\n>> It's, they've got tools designed\nspecifically to go after that, you know,\n\n489\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.110\nso they're not even messing\naround with that anymore.\n\n490\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.897\nAnd a lot of people don't even know,\n\n491\n00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:23.964\nwhat I've found is a lot of people\ndon't know what NFC even is.\n\n492\n00:27:23.964 --> 00:27:27.415\n>> Yeah, they're like,\nwhat near field, no, no like what?\n\n493\n00:27:27.415 --> 00:27:28.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n494\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.700\nIs that another division of the NFL?\n\n495\n00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.630\nYeah, so but what NFC hacked,\n\n496\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:41.460\none of the ones I just saw recently,\nI swear you can YouTube this,\n\n497\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.250\nthey had some guy that shows you\nwhat the public thinks about it.\n\n498\n00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.570\nThis guy was talking about how\nthe government was spying on him.\n\n499\n00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.740\nAnd he's trying to put his\nvideo on YouTube about it.\n\n500\n00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.120\nBut, yeah, the government's spying, we'll\ntell you how to do it cuz they caught me\n\n501\n00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.080\nwith blah blah blah blah blah blah.\n\n502\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.340\nAnd he pulls out the battery\nfrom his Samsung Galaxy,\n\n503\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.890\npulls up the battery out of the back and\npeels the label off of it and says see?\n\n504\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.670\nIt uses that little square thing for\nthe RFID stuff on there.\n\n505\n00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.620\nIn this case it was the antenna for\nthe NFC.\n\n506\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.840\nThat's where Samsung put\nit was on the batteries,\n\n507\n00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.330\nit's a simple thing they wrap it on\nthere so you can use that- Feature.\n\n508\n00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.920\nThis guy's claim, this is how\nthe government knows what you're doing.\n\n509\n00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.350\nThey can hear it from a long distance.\n\n510\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.200\nIt's like no, idiot, that's an NFC.\n\n511\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.170\nHe didn't know what it is.\n\n512\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.645\nSo just to add to that story,\nif you've got friends\n\n513\n00:28:29.645 --> 00:28:33.755\nthat their battery is all chrome because\nthey peel the battery off of it.\n\n514\n00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:36.037\nGet them a roll of tin foil for Christmas.\n\n515\n00:28:36.037 --> 00:28:39.681\n>> Their going to make hats and\nall kinds of window coverings and\n\n516\n00:28:39.681 --> 00:28:40.975\nall that good stuff.\n\n517\n00:28:42.062 --> 00:28:45.702\n>> And so going through,\nso my other tools,\n\n518\n00:28:45.702 --> 00:28:48.792\nthe categories on here,\nthere's reverse engineering.\n\n519\n00:28:48.792 --> 00:28:49.942\nWe will not be doing that.\n\n520\n00:28:49.942 --> 00:28:52.232\nThat's just way outside\nthe scope of what we do here.\n\n521\n00:28:52.232 --> 00:28:55.881\nSo, if you've gotten malware and you need\nto dissect it, you've got tools you can\n\n522\n00:28:55.881 --> 00:29:00.831\nuse this as your workbench to dissect\nthose That is a big topic area.\n\n523\n00:29:00.831 --> 00:29:03.411\nIt takes a lot of time and effort to do.\n\n524\n00:29:03.411 --> 00:29:07.231\nStress testing,\nthere is sometimes a requirement for that.\n\n525\n00:29:07.231 --> 00:29:09.471\nSo you have got that to do stuff.\n\n526\n00:29:09.471 --> 00:29:14.200\nAnd then this is the one that I just think\nis really, really neat hardware hacking.\n\n527\n00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.220\nThey've got stuff specifically in here for\nAndroid and Arduino.\n\n528\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.240\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n529\n00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.970\n>> They've gone to a whole\nother level with that.\n\n530\n00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:29.480\nYou're start to push\ninto that end of things.\n\n531\n00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.230\nAnd the reality is, you will have to\ntest those, at least the Android stuff,\n\n532\n00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.320\nyou're gonna have to test.\n\n533\n00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.485\nI mean, that's showing up every place.\n\n534\n00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.640\nSo there's that.\n\n535\n00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.380\nThe arduino, who knows.\n\n536\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.770\nBut you've got some pretty interesting\nstuff there at your fingertips,\n\n537\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.900\nopens up a whole bunch of stuff for you.\n\n538\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n539\n00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.600\n>> So, I don't know, I said I don't know\nhow it's gonna fit in your actual test,\n\n540\n00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.060\nbut it's definitely there and\navailable to you.\n\n541\n00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.230\nSo that's kind of a neat thing, I think.\n\n542\n00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.160\n>> That is a lot of\nreally good information.\n\n543\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.960\nAnd hopefully,\nthat just whet the whistle for\n\n544\n00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.640\nall the things to come in our\nfuture episodes here with Kali.\n\n545\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.160\nWe're gonna break down\neach one of those phases.\n\n546\n00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.330\nA little bit more detail.\n\n547\n00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.720\nAnd actually pull up a couple of those\ntools and show you how to use them and\n\n548\n00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.520\nshow, kind of, results you would get,\nusing those independent tests.\n\n549\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.150\nLooking at the clock, Sean though, it's\nabout time for us to wrap this one up.\n\n550\n00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.410\nAnything else you want to throw in there?\n\n551\n00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.690\n>> Well,\njust remember this is an overview.\n\n552\n00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.640\nI saw in the discussion group.\n\n553\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.740\nThat's all this is meant\nto be is an overview.\n\n554\n00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.920\nIf you're thinking, when are they\ngonna do stuff with those tools?\n\n555\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.520\nWe are gonna do stuff with those tools.\n\n556\n00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.420\nNot all of them, but we're gonna\ndo stuff with tools from each one\n\n557\n00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.420\nof those categories as we go through,\nso you will see them.\n\n558\n00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.285\nYou'll see them,\nyou'll see a lot of them in action.\n\n559\n00:30:47.285 --> 00:30:49.735\nYou'll have to do some more\nexploring on your own, but\n\n560\n00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:51.885\nyou will see them in action\nat each step of the way.\n\n561\n00:30:51.885 --> 00:30:54.565\nYou get to get a feel for them and heck,\n\n562\n00:30:54.565 --> 00:30:58.035\nif you've got your virtual machine built,\nyou can play around with it, too.\n\n563\n00:30:58.035 --> 00:30:59.822\nWhy we're doing it.\n\n564\n00:30:59.822 --> 00:31:02.452\nSo you can kind of do\nthe interactive thing with us.\n\n565\n00:31:02.452 --> 00:31:06.422\nSo, yeah, this is just the overview\nof the process and how Kali can,\n\n566\n00:31:06.422 --> 00:31:09.852\nwhat tools it has to help\nyou address that process.\n\n567\n00:31:09.852 --> 00:31:11.670\nBut more to come.\n\n568\n00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:16.440\n>> I got mine set up and\nI've got three, downloaded already.\n\n569\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:20.130\nSo I'm ready to hang out with Sean and\ndo some cool stuff here.\n\n570\n00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.540\n>> There you go.\n>> Hopefully you guys are too.\n\n571\n00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.780\nWell anyway, hope you guys enjoyed\nwatching this episode, signing off for\n\n572\n00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.980\nITProTV.\n\n573\n00:31:26.980 -->

00:00:16.670\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.560\nHow are you, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.890\n>> Doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.990\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.790\nIt's another great day here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.550\nWe're continuing on with\nour Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.590\nAnd in this particular episode, we're\ngonna take a look at reconnaissance, or\n\n10\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.860\ntalk about what reconnaissance is.\n\n11\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.730\nIn a previous episode,\nwe did a high-level overview\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.990\nof the different phases\ninvolved in a penetration test.\n\n13\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.530\nAnd we showed you some of the different\ntools that might be useful at\n\n14\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.360\nthe different phases.\n\n15\n00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.780\nBut now we're gonna take each\none of those phases, and\n\n16\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.190\ngo in a little more in depth and actually\ntake a look at some of these tools.\n\n17\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.750\nSo Sean, where do we start?\n\n18\n00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.830\nThis is phase one.\n\n19\n00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.140\nWe've gotta get our\ninformation gathering started.\n\n20\n00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.710\nWhere do we start?\n\n21\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.780\n>> Yeah, when we do recon, you know,\nthis is gonna be our first phase, so,\n\n22\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.840\nwe've got just a whole ton of tools\nthat can help us out with this and we're\n\n23\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040\ngonna show a lot of them, you're gonna\nget hit with a lot of different tools.\n\n24\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.610\nSo, first of all,\n\n25\n00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.610\nI hope you guys took time to download and\nget Kali installed yesterday,\n\n26\n00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.720\nbecause you're probably gonna wanna try\nsome of this stuff out on your own.\n\n27\n00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.290\nNow, hopefully you got that, and\nbonus points if you got metasploitable or\n\n28\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.380\nsomething downloaded, so\nyou can try some of this stuff too.\n\n29\n00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.810\n>> Woo hoo,\nI got bonus points coming my way.\n\n30\n00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.270\n>> See, there you go.\n\n31\n00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.590\nBecause we're gonna go through and\n\n32\n00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.690\ntake a look at you know\nall these different tools.\n\n33\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.550\nYou know, how to use them.\n\n34\n00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.640\nPretty much everything\nyou're going to see,\n\n35\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.120\nremember yesterday we were saying,\nyou better get used to command line?\n\n36\n00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.170\nPretty much everything you're gonna see\nhere today is gonna be command line, so\n\n37\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.970\nwe're just kinda throwing\nyou right into it.\n\n38\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.290\nWe're not slowing down with that or\nanything.\n\n39\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.680\nWe might try to slip some GUI based\nstuff in there, but don't count on it.\n\n40\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.900\n>> So in other words, we've got\nthe training wheels raised all the way up.\n\n41\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.105\nThey're still there, so if you fall\nway over, maybe they'll catch you.\n\n42\n00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:06.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you're going too fast,\n\n43\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.275\nyou're going to spill anyway.\n\n44\n00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:09.775\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:10.945\nBe prepared for it.\n\n46\n00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:12.705\nIf you're not someone that's really fluent\n\n47\n00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:14.055\nof command line.\nOr\n\n48\n00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:16.790\nif you're someone that's been a while,\nor heck,\n\n49\n00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.960\nif you're someone that hasn't been over on\nthe Linux side of the house at all yet or\n\n50\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.600\nnot that much, I'll just tell you right up\nfront, you're gonna have some frustration.\n\n51\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.970\nEverybody does, that's the way it works.\n\n52\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.700\nSo make sure you're paying close\nattention to what's going on.\n\n53\n00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.910\nIt's usually something simple.\n\n54\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.190\nWhen we go through these commands,\n\n55\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.310\nit's usually something\nsimple that screws you up.\n\n56\n00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.770\nI still do it.\n\n57\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.880\nWhen you switch back and\nforth between Windows, and Linux,\n\n58\n00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.440\nand other operating systems, they all have\ntheir own quirks on how they want stuff\n\n59\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.780\nyou know put at the command line.\n\n60\n00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.570\n>> Oh absolutely forward slash here,\nbackslash there, semi colon here,\n\n61\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110\nregular colon there but practice right?\n\n62\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.680\nAnd that's why you guys can watch\nthese recordings, go back and\n\n63\n00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.555\nwatch this thing as many times as you\nneed to, get those commands down pat.\n\n64\n00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.655\nAll right, Sean, so where do we start?\n\n65\n00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:06.745\nLet's have some fun.\n\n66\n00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:09.755\n>> Yeah, so let's just make\nsure to set the stage here.\n\n67\n00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:13.645\nWhat we have is what recon is and\n\n68\n00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:16.850\nwhat you're gonna expect to\nget out of this at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.520\nFirst of all, you know what recon is,\n\n70\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.460\nis it's gathering information about\nwhatever your target happens to be.\n\n71\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.220\nAnd you can really go to town with this,\nand\n\n72\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.060\nreally kind of go down every little rabbit\nhole and take a look at a lot of stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.760\nWe are not going to spend time doing\nall of that because, first of all,\n\n74\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.080\nif you want to see a lot of that you've\ngot the CEH course sitting out there.\n\n75\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.690\nIn the CEH course we talked\nabout that ad nauseum.\n\n76\n00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.730\nYou've already gone down that\nroad with a lot of stuff.\n\n77\n00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.700\nSo things like, we talked about EchoSec,\nI showed it yesterday again briefly.\n\n78\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.300\nI'm not gonna really worry about doing\nthat again, if you wanna see that tool,\n\n79\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.410\nand some of the other ones,\nit's in the CEH course already.\n\n80\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.360\nAnd so, some of those things\nwe're just kind of leave out.\n\n81\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.860\nI'm not going to go through and\ndo reconnaissance through job sites.\n\n82\n00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.820\nI'm going to expect you\nto be aware of that.\n\n83\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.240\nIf not, there's a lot of content in CEH\nthat talks about that whole portion of it,\n\n84\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.590\nso if you want to learn that, combine\nit with what we have here hey, great.\n\n85\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.730\nWhat we're really gonna be\nlooking at is the things\n\n86\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.270\nthat Kali brings to the table\nto help you do this process.\n\n87\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.332\nAnd even then, we're gonna show\njust kind of a small portion of it,\n\n88\n00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:38.902\ncuz there's literally so\n\n89\n00:04:38.902 --> 00:04:43.490\nmany tools that do reconnaissance in\nthis that we just can't show them all.\n\n90\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.943\nWe're gonna make an attempt to show\na whole heck of a lot of them to give\n\n91\n00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:50.518\nyou a really good idea of what's there,\nand so you can start thinking oh\n\n92\n00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:53.920\nyeah I can use this and this, and\nI can see where this is going.\n\n93\n00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.980\nYou know,\nthat's what we're going to be doing.\n\n94\n00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.020\nBut we're not going to\nbe showing everything.\n\n95\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.630\n>> A lot of the reconnaissance\nis done as we talked about.\n\n96\n00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.130\nIn our CEH episodes.\n\n97\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.760\nIf you haven't had a chance\ngo check those episodes out.\n\n98\n00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.730\nBut a lot of it is done\nthrough public sites.\n\n99\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.560\nRight?\nAs you mentioned,\n\n100\n00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.350\nlike job listings where I can see\nwhat positions they're looking for\n\n101\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.660\nwhen they ask for somebody that knows\nCisco, or a particular firewall model, or\n\n102\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.360\nsomething like that.\n\n103\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.190\nYou know, those are the kinds\nof things that are running on\n\n104\n00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.130\ntheir network obviously.\n\n105\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.670\nWe can go out, we can do DNS lookups and\nthings like that.\n\n106\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.490\nAnd we can take a look at the INA and\nall those registrars to get IP ranges,\n\n107\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.550\nthings like that.\n\n108\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.650\nSo those you can do from any browser,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.900\nCali has a browser built into it,\nwe've got Iceweasel, go to town there.\n\n110\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.730\nBut Cali does bring some really\nother cool tools to the table for\n\n111\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.020\nus that makes that information\ngathering a little bit easier, right?\n\n112\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.520\n>> Yeah, that's the whole thing,\n\n113\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.190\nthat we wanna know what this\ntool brings to the table.\n\n114\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.310\nWhy you would wanna use it.\n\n115\n00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.530\nWhat you're going to be\nable to do once we're\n\n116\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.370\ndone with the whole thing as a matter of\nfact, is you'll be able to supplement or\n\n117\n00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.630\neven replace if you don't\nwant to use WIndows,\n\n118\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.810\nto do your pen testing, you could\nuse Kali to replace a lot of that.\n\n119\n00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.270\nSome people do all their pen testing-,\nyou know, right inside of Kayle.\n\n120\n00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.220\nThey don't really worry about going to\nanother operating system unless they\n\n121\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.780\nabsolutely have to.\n\n122\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.940\nAnd so you do have that option.\n\n123\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.140\nSo this will be used to supplement that.\n\n124\n00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.950\nBut as far as, you know, getting back\nto the reconnoissance process, yeah,\n\n125\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.040\nyou've already seen\na lot of it in the CEH.\n\n126\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.000\nWe're just going to go ahead and\nenhance it.\n\n127\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.700\nAnd bring some more power to the table\nthrough what we have here and\n\n128\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.360\nsee what these things do for us.\n\n129\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.900\nReconnaissance, again, just to make\nsure we're all on the same page,\n\n130\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.080\nreconnaissance is just doing that\ninvestigation on the target.\n\n131\n00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.480\nAnd to see what they look like,\nwhat they have,\n\n132\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.860\nwho's there, really anything we can\nfind out that would be of use to us.\n\n133\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.160\nIt's going to be those technical things,\nlike the IP addresses,\n\n134\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.710\nDNS information, any administrative stuff,\n\n135\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.330\noperating system information,\nstuff on web applications if you have it.\n\n136\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.750\nWe're going to see how to pull those.\n\n137\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.880\nWe've got some utilities that are\nspecifically designed to get that sort of\n\n138\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.310\ninformation out of us,\nor out of our target.\n\n139\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:20.530\nThere's some really, really neat things\nthere we can use, get things like that.\n\n140\n00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.340\nSources that we get it from.\n\n141\n00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.200\nIt's important to talk about those.\n\n142\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.500\nSources that we have.\n\n143\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.460\nOpen source is a big, big, big part of how\nyou gather information about a target.\n\n144\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.290\nJust to make sure you're clear on that.\n\n145\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.270\nOpen source,\nthey usually shorten it to OSINT.\n\n146\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.310\nYou'll see that little abbreviation or\nacronym used all over the place.\n\n147\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.370\nIt's just open source intelligence.\n\n148\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.067\nAnd it's a way of investigating a target,\nusing stuff that they already\n\n149\n00:07:52.067 --> 00:07:55.847\nputting out there or\nstuff that had somehow got out there.\n\n150\n00:07:55.847 --> 00:07:57.553\nAnd you're not really engaging them.\n\n151\n00:07:57.553 --> 00:08:04.075\nAnd there's literally endless,\nseemingly endless ways to get that.\n\n152\n00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:09.159\nNow, I saw that in the CEH,\nwe did a lot of that and\n\n153\n00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:15.240\nI'm gonna avoid repeating a lot\nof stuff from over there.\n\n154\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.760\nDon't worry, I'm not just gonna say,\n\n155\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.887\noh well,\ngo to the CEH if you don't like it, tough.\n\n156\n00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:21.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could do that, but\n\n157\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.640\nI'm not gonna do that to you.\n\n158\n00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.680\nWhat I'm gonna do is,\nsome of the stuff I'll tell you that,\n\n159\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.640\nyeah you could use this here,\nand I'll let you do it and\n\n160\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.790\ninstead go over to CEH if\nyou need to review that.\n\n161\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.700\nAnd then there's other stuff\nI'm gonna repeat here.\n\n162\n00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.680\nBut just keep that in mind.\n\n163\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.010\nSo, as far as the Open Source stuff goes,\nOpen Source we did a lot of it in the CEH.\n\n164\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.970\nRecall that was your stuff like your\nGoogle Earth, like I said your Echosec,\n\n165\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.670\nyour job postings.\n\n166\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.690\nLooking through all those types of things,\nif it's a publicly traded company,\n\n167\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.650\nfinancial stuff, all that.\n\n168\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.680\nWell, there's a lot of other stuff that we\ncan go through that we just couldn't get\n\n169\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.530\nthe same way in Windows, or\nit's very difficult to get in Windows.\n\n170\n00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.550\nOne of the things we're gonna look at for\nOpen Source is the documents and\n\n171\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.560\nstuff like that that companies put out.\n\n172\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.190\nThese PDFs that they post on their site.\n\n173\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.920\nThese Word docs they may have out there,\nplus other stuff.\n\n174\n00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.980\nWe're gonna look at tools that can\ngather up that information and\n\n175\n00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.790\nstart reading attributes and\nstuff like that on it, meta data.\n\n176\n00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:35.560\nWe know about meta data from our CEH and\nwe're gonna encounter it again and\n\n177\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.630\nnow we're gonna see yet another way\nto get that off of something other,\n\n178\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.630\ncuz we looked at the CEH off\nimages that accept data.\n\n179\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.210\n>> Right.\n>> We're gonna look at it in the case\n\n180\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.850\nof PDFs and Words and\nother type of documents, how to get that.\n\n181\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:55.510\nSo we can start getting information, maybe\nabout machines, about people, whoever.\n\n182\n00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.570\nBecause they publish it out there and,\nboom, we got it.\n\n183\n00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.060\n>> It is amazing how much information\nis available if you know where to look.\n\n184\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.040\nIt's not like you're breaking into\nanything, you're not hacking anything.\n\n185\n00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.970\nIt's just there and if you know where\nto look, you can get that information.\n\n186\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.900\nAnd one of the problems, if people\ndon't realize that when they publish\n\n187\n00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.730\na document like that all that\ninformation is going along with it.\n\n188\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.690\nMost of them don't anyway.\n\n189\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.060\nAnd like you said, we're not really\nbreaking the law or doing anything.\n\n190\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.880\nWe're just gathering\ninformation at this point.\n\n191\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.390\n>> Yeah, all of this stuff is 100% legal,\nor the open source stuff is 100% legal.\n\n192\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.570\nI get asked that one all the time.\n\n193\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.030\nIt's kind of funny that\nyou bring that one up.\n\n194\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.870\nPeople always ask that because they're\nstunned about the amount of information\n\n195\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.010\nyou can pull here and\nI know those that went to the CEH with us,\n\n196\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.170\nyou saw the CEH just\nhow much we could pull.\n\n197\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:50.180\nWhenever I actually do that course live in\na classroom I get asked that all the time.\n\n198\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.890\nThe people that have seen that for\nthe first time they're just stunned.\n\n199\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:59.290\nSo for the Open Source stuff, it's stuff\nthat people have already put out there.\n\n200\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:05.610\nBut we're gonna find different ways to\ngather that stuff up and build a picture.\n\n201\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.910\nSo that's the Open Source stuff.\n\n202\n00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.820\nWe also have technical stuff we can get,\nlike I said.\n\n203\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.980\nThat's all your tools for\ngoing through all the infrastructure and\n\n204\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.230\nstuff like that that's out there.\n\n205\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.060\nWe're gonna look at how to gather that.\n\n206\n00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.230\nThings like DNS, our different DNS tools.\n\n207\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.510\nOne thing you're gonna see in Kali\nis that we have probably, easily,\n\n208\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.750\nprobably about a dozen specially\nbuilt tools for going through DNS.\n\n209\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.660\nAnd that's not including\nthe stuff that we already\n\n210\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.540\nhave built in the operating\nsystem by default.\n\n211\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.920\nThings like nslookup are not\nincluded in that dozen or\n\n212\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.600\nmore tools that I talked about,\nthose specially built ones.\n\n213\n00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.920\nAnd this look-up is there,\nwhether you've got Kali or not.\n\n214\n00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.040\n>> Yeah, that's part of the member's pack.\n\n215\n00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:55.000\n>> Yeah, it's there, so we don't have\nto do anything special to get that.\n\n216\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.120\nThere's other things that Kali\nbrings to the table that helps us\n\n217\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.610\ndo some neat stuff.\n\n218\n00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.310\nAnd it's another area to\npoint out by the way.\n\n219\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.090\nA lot of the tools that\nwe're gonna look just for\n\n220\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.600\nDNS, as far as DNS is concerned,\nthose aren't available on Windows.\n\n221\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.090\nSo if you're looking for a reason\nto justify really why you're gonna\n\n222\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:21.930\nget into Kali and really get command of it\ncan't do some of this stuff over Windows.\n\n223\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.240\nThere's just not an easy way to do it,\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n224\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.720\n>> Yeah and that's funny like you were\nsaying earlier about people deciding I'm\n\n225\n00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.310\njust gonna go to Kali as my go to\noperating system any time I need to do\n\n226\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.870\npenetration testing, or\nforensic investigation.\n\n227\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.680\nAnd that's probably one of the biggest\nreasons, I think, is the fact that one,\n\n228\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.580\nit's easy to use.\n\n229\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.660\nIt's all right there in the operating\nsystem for the most part.\n\n230\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.340\nBut all these tools\nare made to run on Linux.\n\n231\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.105\nSome of them I can get ports to run\non Windows, but not all all of them.\n\n232\n00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:51.765\nAnd even then,\nthose ports were sometimes kinda clunky.\n\n233\n00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:55.605\nWhereas here, I'm using it in the\nenvironment that it was developed to do.\n\n234\n00:12:55.605 --> 00:12:57.965\nWhy have the switch back and\nforth between two?\n\n235\n00:12:57.965 --> 00:12:59.505\nIt seems to me, Sean, I don't know,\n\n236\n00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:03.320\nthat it's rare I find a tool that'll\nwork in Windows, not in Linux.\n\n237\n00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.490\nIt's usually the other way around.\n\n238\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.435\nIt works on my Linux, but\nit doesn't work in Windows.\n\n239\n00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:09.810\n>> Yeah, that's an interesting point.\n\n240\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:15.976\nIf you go to certain websites, like,\nI wanna say it's that settools.org,\n\n241\n00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:19.860\nthat we brought that one up in CEH.\n\n242\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.659\nBut it's at sectools.org.\n\n243\n00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:26.890\nAnd it's [INAUDIBLE],\nit had a whole list of different tools.\n\n244\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.610\nIt's associated with the end map site,\nthe guy that does that.\n\n245\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.750\nAnd I think on that site he's got,\n\n246\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:38.580\nI know he's got one entry on there\nthat says that there's a specific\n\n247\n00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:43.512\ntool that says this is a case where\nWindows has something that Linux doesn't.\n\n248\n00:13:43.512 --> 00:13:45.589\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> One tool.\n\n249\n00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:50.779\n>> Yeah it's got one tool so they're\nmaking a dramatic come back on that.\n\n250\n00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:54.819\nAnd that's for\na number of reasons by the way.\n\n251\n00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:59.643\nSome of the stuff that you're going to\nsee during this course, the reason why it\n\n252\n00:13:59.643 --> 00:14:03.900\ncan do what it do is pretty much\nspecifically because the way Linux is.\n\n253\n00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.750\nIt's just strictly because of that,\nso if you ask,\n\n254\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.560\nwhy can't you take that tool and bring\nsome stuff over and run it on Windows,\n\n255\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.110\nbecause there are ways to do that.\n\n256\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.560\nThe reason why you can't do it is because,\njust plain and\n\n257\n00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.810\nsimple, Windows architecturally\nwill not allow it.\n\n258\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.070\nThere's, for example,\n\n259\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:27.510\ntools for doing wireless detection and\nhacking and stuff like that.\n\n260\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.539\nThere's several of them,\nyou just can't either get on to Windows or\n\n261\n00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:35.149\nif you try to compile it and\nbring it over to Windows it works but\n\n262\n00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.215\nit's kind of like [SOUND]\nit's not all the way there.\n\n263\n00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:42.390\nSo saying it loses something\nin the translation.\n\n264\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.397\nYeah, that's basically what happens,\n\n265\n00:14:44.397 --> 00:14:46.988\nit lost something when it\ngot ported over to Windows.\n\n266\n00:14:46.988 --> 00:14:49.683\nSo if you want the full power\nof a lot of these tools,\n\n267\n00:14:49.683 --> 00:14:52.946\nyou really don't have an option\nexcept to go over into Linux,\n\n268\n00:14:52.946 --> 00:14:57.230\nand that's not even including the ones\nthat just can't get over there period.\n\n269\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.550\nThere's some that are not going to show\nup over there for whatever reason.\n\n270\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.140\nSo keep that in mind that's another big,\nbig motivator.\n\n271\n00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.160\n>> And it's so easy to get Kali and\nrun it in a virtual machine,\n\n272\n00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.910\nlike we showed you guys how to do\nyesterday, or run it off a thumb drive.\n\n273\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.860\nWhy even worry about trying to force\nthis thing to work on Windows.\n\n274\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.620\nJust stick with us,\nwatch these episodes, and learn Kali.\n\n275\n00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.880\n>> Yeah and it's absolutely correct,\n\n276\n00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.700\nand something to point out is we're doing\neverything in a virtual machine here.\n\n277\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.090\nEverything we're doing,\nunless I say otherwise,\n\n278\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.390\nanything we're doing you can still run it\non a virtual machine on top of Windows.\n\n279\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.550\nSo if you're not ready to take the plunge\nand wipe a whole system clean and\n\n280\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.490\nput Kali solely on it You don't have to.\n\n281\n00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.890\nYou don't have to in every case,\nor some cases where, yeah,\n\n282\n00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.740\nyou don't have an option.\n\n283\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.167\nYou're gonna have to do that.\n\n284\n00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:52.855\nYou're either gonna have to\nrun it live off of there or\n\n285\n00:15:52.855 --> 00:15:56.093\nyou're gonna have to wipe the thing\nclean and put Kali on there.\n\n286\n00:15:56.093 --> 00:15:58.565\nDo some sort of dual boot or something.\n\n287\n00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:04.941\nBut those are specific cases and when\nthe time comes up, we'll get to those.\n\n288\n00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:10.060\nSo anyway, and we talked about open\nsource, these technical tools.\n\n289\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.467\nOther things we have that we're gonna\nget to today is social engineering.\n\n290\n00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:19.510\nNow, we're not gonna do any roleplaying or\nanything here, and do that.\n\n291\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That'd be fun but, so\n\n292\n00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.081\nI'm gonna act like a professional.\n\n293\n00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:28.975\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've all seen the Jimmy Kimmel episode\n\n294\n00:16:28.975 --> 00:16:32.070\nwhere he walks the streets and tries\nto get people to give him his password.\n\n295\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.956\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> And surprisingly he gets quite a few of\n\n296\n00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:35.816\nthem, so.\n\n297\n00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:39.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So as fun as it would be, we're\n\n298\n00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.660\nnot gonna do anything like that, but-\n>> You can try to trick our\n\n299\n00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.290\nproducer over there.\n\n300\n00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:44.990\nSay hey, Jason, what year were you born?\n\n301\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.655\nWhat's the name of your dog?\n\n302\n00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:50.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, so-\n\n303\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.136\n>> You did show us a cool tool and\n\n304\n00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:54.204\nI'm really look forward to get in that.\n\n305\n00:16:54.204 --> 00:16:55.066\nI know cuz, Cain and.\n\n306\n00:16:55.066 --> 00:16:56.020\nCain and Abel.\n\n307\n00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.630\nI'm reading our chat room over here,\nPaul was posting that.\n\n308\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.550\nThere's a social engineering\ntool built into Kali.\n\n309\n00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.930\n>> Yes there is, and that's something\nthat we're gonna take a look at.\n\n310\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.290\nIt's actually a really neat thing,\ncuz we don't really have\n\n311\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.158\nsomething exactly like that on\nthe Windows side of the house.\n\n312\n00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:17.496\nThere's things that you can do that kind\nof, if you bring enough of them together,\n\n313\n00:17:17.496 --> 00:17:18.797\nyou could kind of fill that gap.\n\n314\n00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:23.763\nBut we have actually have a one-stop\nshopping type tool in Kali that can\n\n315\n00:17:23.763 --> 00:17:25.346\nhelp us out with that.\n\n316\n00:17:25.346 --> 00:17:31.225\nAnd social engineering, being that it's\na valuable way to do recon on a target,\n\n317\n00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:35.808\nwe can use that to create our own\nsocial engineering campaign or\n\n318\n00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:37.290\nat least part of it.\n\n319\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.390\nIt's not gonna cover the whole thing.\n\n320\n00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.210\nI mean, quite frankly,\nthe social engineering toolkit here\n\n321\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:47.520\nis gonna help you deal with the electronic\nand digital side of social engineering.\n\n322\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.630\nIt's not gonna write a script,\nsome magical script, for you to go and\n\n323\n00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.720\nroleplay with someone.\n\n324\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.806\nNo.\n>> You gotta come up\n\n325\n00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:54.375\nwith your own backstory, right?\n\n326\n00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.483\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there's a prince somewhere that has\n\n327\n00:17:56.483 --> 00:17:59.060\ndied and left you money or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n328\n00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.330\n>> Yeah, you'll have to come up with it,\nyou'll have to come up with something.\n\n329\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.255\n>> Once you get your story written, this\ncan help you develop it, deliver it and\n\n330\n00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:04.980\nthings like that.\n\n331\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.125\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n332\n00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.517\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I always tell,\n\n333\n00:18:07.517 --> 00:18:10.070\nI don't if I mentioned it here\nthe last time I was here.\n\n334\n00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.080\nI got an email on one\nof my Gmail accounts.\n\n335\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.476\nI got an email from the head\nof the United Nations.\n\n336\n00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:17.489\n>> Oh, really?\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n337\n00:18:17.489 --> 00:18:18.067\n>> Nice.\n\n338\n00:18:18.067 --> 00:18:19.173\n>> That's how important I am, guys.\n\n339\n00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:22.240\n>> [LAUGH] He was looking for\nsome security tips I'm sure.\n\n340\n00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.190\n>> Yeah, if you need anything taken care\nof or anything like that, I'm the guy.\n\n341\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.906\nSo that's why I'm not here all the time.\n\n342\n00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:32.131\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But in any case, yeah.\n\n343\n00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:36.044\nWith social engineering, we have something\nin here that will help us out with that\n\n344\n00:18:36.044 --> 00:18:38.320\nfor our reconnaissance side of things.\n\n345\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.810\nAnd it is something that is incredibly\nuseful at getting information.\n\n346\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.850\nIn fact,\nas far as social engineering goes,\n\n347\n00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.450\nyou're gonna find that just\nlooking over someone's shoulder,\n\n348\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:53.640\neavesdropping, those are very,\nvery good ways to get information.\n\n349\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.540\nSo even though we're not gonna\nspend tons of time on it,\n\n350\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.880\nother than showing the social\nengineering toolkit,\n\n351\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.490\ndon't discount that as a part\nof your reconnaissance process.\n\n352\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.450\nIn fact, the information you get here,\n\n353\n00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.440\nduring the reconnaissance process that\nwe're going through, may be something that\n\n354\n00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.470\nhelps you guide your questioning when\nyou talk to someone in the flesh.\n\n355\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.720\nIt might very well help that,\nso don't forget that.\n\n356\n00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.480\nSo just FYI.\n\n357\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.436\nAnd then, I think it's important to\ntalk about the last part of this,\n\n358\n00:19:27.436 --> 00:19:32.057\nas far as, it's not really a source for\ngathering information.\n\n359\n00:19:32.057 --> 00:19:36.352\nIt's really kind of a skill\nthat you gotta develop.\n\n360\n00:19:36.352 --> 00:19:41.267\nAgain, I mentioned this one in CEH,\nbut it's something that I\n\n361\n00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:47.015\ncan't really mention enough,\nis having the skill of inference.\n\n362\n00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:52.020\nAnd what you wanna do is you do not wanna\ngo through and start looking at all this\n\n363\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.530\ninformation as disconnected, and this is\nthis and this is this and this is this.\n\n364\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.920\nYou don't wanna have that.\n\n365\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.890\nWhat you wanna do is when\nyou get the information,\n\n366\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.410\nstart seeing how it really fits\ntogether and ties together.\n\n367\n00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.930\nAnd see if you can start\nonce you lay it out, so\n\n368\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.520\nto speak, you can start seeing\nthose black holes here and there.\n\n369\n00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.110\nAnd start filling them in with stuff that\nyou know from your own experience or\n\n370\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.330\nmay be able to guess.\n\n371\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.235\nThat's a skill that I\ncan help you with here,\n\n372\n00:20:19.235 --> 00:20:20.965\nwhen we're going through all these tools.\n\n373\n00:20:20.965 --> 00:20:25.715\nBut you're gonna have to learn to do\nthat yourself, if you haven't already.\n\n374\n00:20:25.715 --> 00:20:27.875\nSome of it's just common sense.\n\n375\n00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:32.525\nOr I should say a lot of it's common\nsense, is that if you just really\n\n376\n00:20:32.525 --> 00:20:37.125\nthink about it,\nyou will be able to fill in those gaps.\n\n377\n00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:41.882\nAnd I see that being something that\npeople just have a problem with.\n\n378\n00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:44.945\nSo I'm trying to tell you, when we go\nthrough this reconnaissance stuff,\n\n379\n00:20:44.945 --> 00:20:47.900\nwhen we're going through these tools and\nI have them up here on screen,\n\n380\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.070\nyou see this stuff.\n\n381\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.260\nMake sure that when you do it in real\nlife, that you're noting that stuff and\n\n382\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.280\nwriting it down.\n\n383\n00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.180\nWhen you look at each piece it's okay,\nthat's good information.\n\n384\n00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.110\nWhen you put it together, you can see\nhow they kind of all fit together and\n\n385\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.460\nmake this whole puzzle.\n\n386\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.976\nAnd you can see the pieces\nthat might be missing.\n\n387\n00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:09.670\n>> Right, cuz we're gonna be gathering\na lot of information during this phase.\n\n388\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.390\nAnd you can't keep each piece of\ninformation in a little silo by itself.\n\n389\n00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:17.520\nIt all relates back to\nyour target at some point.\n\n390\n00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.216\nIt's like looking at\nindividual puzzle pieces.\n\n391\n00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:21.370\nYou gotta start putting\nthose pieces together so\n\n392\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.846\nthat you can see the big picture.\n\n393\n00:21:22.846 --> 00:21:26.136\nIt always reminds me of thinking of\nall these crime scene TV shows and\n\n394\n00:21:26.136 --> 00:21:30.351\nthings like that, where they take all this\ninformation, news articles, pictures,\n\n395\n00:21:30.351 --> 00:21:33.520\nclippings, what have you, and\nthey put it up on the wall.\n\n396\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.734\nAnd then they start taking\npieces of thread and\n\n397\n00:21:35.734 --> 00:21:37.614\ntying the different points together.\n\n398\n00:21:37.614 --> 00:21:38.772\nThat's kinda what we're doing here, right?\n\n399\n00:21:38.772 --> 00:21:41.500\nIt's trying to tie all\nthe information back together.\n\n400\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.755\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what it is.\n\n401\n00:21:44.755 --> 00:21:47.810\nIt's a very good analogy\nto look at it that way,\n\n402\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.430\nis you have all these little\ndisconnected pieces of information.\n\n403\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.880\nIt's just learning and to reason it out.\n\n404\n00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.390\nStart tying them together.\n\n405\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:02.880\nAnd it's a skill that you can easily\noverlook, or easily just not think about.\n\n406\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.710\nAnd it could be because you\nget too close or too focused\n\n407\n00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.590\non what a specific tool is doing, and\nyou're not looking at the big picture.\n\n408\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.820\nSo you constantly gotta keep that in mind,\nlook at the big picture.\n\n409\n00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.650\n>> It's almost like you just need\nto back up from it a little bit and\n\n410\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.210\ntake a look at all of it together.\n\n411\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.750\nLike I said, it's not a tool you\ncan use or anything like that, but\n\n412\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.880\nit is a skill you can develop.\n\n413\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.770\nBeing able to kinda step away from it and\n\n414\n00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.350\nstart to imagine different ways\nof that data fitting together.\n\n415\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:35.370\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely that way, is\nlearning exactly how things fit together.\n\n416\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.150\nLearning that it's not\njust a piece over here and\n\n417\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.310\na piece over here and a piece over here.\n\n418\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.407\nThese things do tie together in some way,\nshape, or form.\n\n419\n00:22:44.407 --> 00:22:47.404\nAnd you have to look at those things and\nsay,\n\n420\n00:22:47.404 --> 00:22:50.243\nwhat's the links between these things?\n\n421\n00:22:50.243 --> 00:22:51.816\nAnd be able to put that together.\n\n422\n00:22:51.816 --> 00:22:56.405\nAnd the one that you mentioned, as far as\nputting stuff up on a board, it's a good\n\n423\n00:22:56.405 --> 00:23:01.017\nexample, because it also shows you one of\nthe big challenges you have with this.\n\n424\n00:23:01.017 --> 00:23:05.017\nLike on one of those crime shows,\nI mean, they may be doing that for\n\n425\n00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:07.400\nthe audience to help them, too.\n\n426\n00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.560\nBut they've got some\nmethod that they're using\n\n427\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.480\nto put all this information together.\n\n428\n00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.798\nAnd the big problem we have,\nhere as well as there, is visualizing it.\n\n429\n00:23:18.798 --> 00:23:20.696\nThat's a big, big thing.\n\n430\n00:23:20.696 --> 00:23:24.003\nI mean, notice when we went to the CEH,\n\n431\n00:23:24.003 --> 00:23:29.075\nI brought up Maltego during\nthis reconnaissance process.\n\n432\n00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:31.065\nOr as we called it,\nfootprinting, over there.\n\n433\n00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:34.835\nWe went through and\nspent all this time doing footprinting,\n\n434\n00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:36.845\nshowing how to do different things.\n\n435\n00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:40.693\nAnd then after we did all this, I brought\nMaltego up, went click, click, click, and\n\n436\n00:23:40.693 --> 00:23:43.666\nit showed all these linkages and\neverything between everything.\n\n437\n00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:47.579\nOne of the things that really\nmakes a tool like Maltego so\n\n438\n00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:53.586\nvaluable is that not only can it get it so\nfast, it's the visualization aspect of it.\n\n439\n00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:57.646\nIn fact, I'd be, with a tool like that If\nit was a little bit slower I'm not telling\n\n440\n00:23:57.646 --> 00:23:59.387\nthem to make it slower, of course.\n\n441\n00:23:59.387 --> 00:24:01.754\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, man, they did make,\n\n442\n00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:05.853\nthe company makes a very, very,\nat Perturba, they make a very, very,\n\n443\n00:24:05.853 --> 00:24:10.420\nvery good product, and how it gains\ninformation, how quickly it does it.\n\n444\n00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.160\nBut the most valuable aspect of that is\nnot only can it get that information, but\n\n445\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.670\nit can bring everything together and\n\n446\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.110\nshow you the linkages and show you this\nrelates to this and this and this.\n\n447\n00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:25.930\nAnd you can even use that to\nfill in those missing pieces.\n\n448\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.620\nSo you're gonna have to learn how\nto do an inference on this and\n\n449\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.060\nbring all this information together.\n\n450\n00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.250\nNone of the stuff lives on its own.\n\n451\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.260\nAnd so that's what we're gonna be doing.\n\n452\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.300\nSo we go through these tools and\nwe're going through different sections and\n\n453\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.360\nthey were kind of doing a little bit\noverview here of what the spec of\n\n454\n00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.630\nthe reconnaissance process and\nsome things to be aware of.\n\n455\n00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.430\nWhen we go through these different\nsections we're gonna take a look at how to\n\n456\n00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:52.930\nuncover network information, and then\nwe're gonna look at doing website stuff,\n\n457\n00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:56.560\nand how to interact with that, and\nextract information from those.\n\n458\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.700\nRemember even though those are being\ndone in different segments,\n\n459\n00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.350\nthose things do relate to one another.\n\n460\n00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.280\nAnd you're gonna have to bring them and\ntie them all together and\n\n461\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.200\nsay okay yeah I can see how they fit and\nwork.\n\n462\n00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.500\n>> And when you talk about inference,\nsometimes what you're looking for\n\n463\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.980\nyou might not actually have, but\nfrom the other data that I've gathered,\n\n464\n00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.830\nI might be able to figure\nout what I'm missing there.\n\n465\n00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.970\nKind of fill in those blanks then.\n\n466\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.480\n>> Yeah, but if you get enough\ninformation, even though you're missing\n\n467\n00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:32.110\nsomething you can kind of see what's\nmissing and make a pretty good guess.\n\n468\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.930\nWay I'd look at it is that\nif you got a puzzle that\n\n469\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.930\nyou're putting together, if you want\nto have all the pieces, but, if I\n\n470\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.930\npull out one of those pieces from that\nbox and hide it and you put it together,\n\n471\n00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.300\neven thought that piece is gone you\ncan see what the hole looks like.\n\n472\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.010\nAnd you can make a guess\nfrom the colors and\n\n473\n00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.985\npatterns in the pieces around it kinda\nsorta what's on that missing piece.\n\n474\n00:25:58.985 --> 00:26:05.348\nThat's a way to visualize this whole\nthing, it's developing that skill.\n\n475\n00:26:05.348 --> 00:26:09.798\nNow the thing is, is that if I, with that\nsame puzzle analogy if I take five or\n\n476\n00:26:09.798 --> 00:26:12.305\nsix pieces or\nten pieces out of the puzzle,\n\n477\n00:26:12.305 --> 00:26:15.383\ndepending on how many pieces\nare in there of course.\n\n478\n00:26:15.383 --> 00:26:19.607\nIf I take a good number of them out of\nthere and hide them we'll now you've got\n\n479\n00:26:19.607 --> 00:26:22.577\na big chunk and\nyou can't really get sort of an idea but\n\n480\n00:26:22.577 --> 00:26:27.575\nnot as clear because you got a big thing\ninstead of something like this missing.\n\n481\n00:26:27.575 --> 00:26:32.855\n>> The more information I gather makes it\neasier to infer what the missing stuff is.\n\n482\n00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:34.265\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n483\n00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:38.275\nThe thing here is that we have so\nmany tools in Kali that can\n\n484\n00:26:38.275 --> 00:26:41.435\ndig through things and\ninvestigate things in so many ways.\n\n485\n00:26:41.435 --> 00:26:45.450\nIn fact,\nI saw the number in there last night,\n\n486\n00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.910\nthere's over 300 tools in Kali and\nI don't even think that's really fair.\n\n487\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.260\nI'm like, that seems kind of low.\n\n488\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:57.580\nCuz, and believe it or not, there's tools\nin Kali that aren't even on the menu.\n\n489\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.360\nThey couldn't even get them all\nin the menus they're just like\n\n490\n00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.680\njust throw them in there we're done.\n\n491\n00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.580\nYou picture the guy hasn't\nseen his wife in three months,\n\n492\n00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.580\nhis family, just put it in there\nthey'll find it, I'm going home.\n\n493\n00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.959\nThere are other things in there.\n\n494\n00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:15.448\nThe challenge for you is going to be with\nall these tools is which ones are going to\n\n495\n00:27:15.448 --> 00:27:18.664\nget you the most value because\nyou can spend a lot of time,\n\n496\n00:27:18.664 --> 00:27:21.953\nwaste a lot of time going\nthrough all of this information.\n\n497\n00:27:21.953 --> 00:27:27.673\nAnd getting stuff that either is not\nreally have immediate value to you or\n\n498\n00:27:27.673 --> 00:27:30.270\nreally any value at all.\n\n499\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.420\nThat does happen.\n\n500\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.060\nExpect to get some information that,\nat the end of the day\n\n501\n00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.450\nmeans nothing as far as helping you\nthrough the penetration process.\n\n502\n00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:42.130\nSo, you're gonna have to kind\nof do that with experience.\n\n503\n00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.110\nBut Kali has so many tools that's easy\nto say let me try this, let me do this,\n\n504\n00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.729\nlet me do this.\n\n505\n00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.800\n>> Experiment.\n>> You're gonna have to, yeah.\n\n506\n00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.410\nYou're gonna want to experiment,\ntry this out, a lot of these ones out.\n\n507\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.510\nBut ultimately you're going to find,\n\n508\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.700\nthere's a small number of ones you use,\nand you know what to expect, and\n\n509\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.910\nyou have those other ones\nas back ups if you need to.\n\n510\n00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:07.210\nAnd by the way, one of the things you've\ngot with Kali like you do with all\n\n511\n00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.670\nversions of Linux, there's nothing saying\nyou couldn't script this stuff to.\n\n512\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.397\nSo if you wanted to run several of\nthem at a time, you couldn't do that.\n\n513\n00:28:14.397 --> 00:28:17.105\nSo, that we're not gonna worry\nabout showing that here.\n\n514\n00:28:17.105 --> 00:28:20.155\nThat's something else we'll\ntalk at a later date.\n\n515\n00:28:20.155 --> 00:28:23.105\nBut you could do that sort of thing,\nbut still you're only gonna run\n\n516\n00:28:23.105 --> 00:28:27.585\na selected amount of tools to\nget the information you need.\n\n517\n00:28:27.585 --> 00:28:30.865\nAnd remember, if you go back to our CDH,\nwe said about setting goals.\n\n518\n00:28:30.865 --> 00:28:36.060\nOnce you set the goals and met those\ngoals, just go ahead and push on.\n\n519\n00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.440\nSo, that's what\nthe reconnaissance process is,\n\n520\n00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.720\njust to kind of get you\noriented where Kali fits in and\n\n521\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.275\nto kind of do a refresher on\nwhat we're going to be doing.\n\n522\n00:28:48.275 --> 00:28:49.860\n>> Good deal, all right.\n\n523\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.720\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nI'll tell you what looking at the clock,\n\n524\n00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.620\nwe are about out of time.\n\n525\n00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.520\nI feel like we gotta a good idea about\nwhat reconnaissance is all about.\n\n526\n00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.200\nIn episodes coming up, we are going\nto dive into reconnaissance and\n\n527\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.460\ntake a look at a few of those tools.\n\n528\n00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.160\nBoth for now,\nwe're gonna sign off from ITProTV.\n\n529\n00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.248\nSo I'm Mike Roderick and I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n530\n00:29:06.248 --> 00:29:07.862\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n531\n00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:13.320\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.350\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and with me\ntoday is none other than Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.370\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.120\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.010\nHow are you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.090\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.010\nWe are continuing with\nour Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.210\nIn this episode we're gonna take\na look at some of the information\n\n10\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.600\nthat we can uncover or discover.\n\n11\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.580\nDuring our recognizance phase and\n\n12\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.260\nin particular we're going to be looking at\nnetwork information that we can discover.\n\n13\n00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740\nOne of the big parts of\nthe recognizance phase,\n\n14\n00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.550\nis gathering information on our\ntargets and that's going to\n\n15\n00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.780\ninclude information about the network\nthat our targets running on, right Sean?\n\n16\n00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.140\n>> Yeah, that's exactly it is\nthat we're going to get in and\n\n17\n00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.505\nstart looking at what the network looks\nlike, seeing what we can discover\n\n18\n00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:56.520\nabout it because we really don't\nknow anything at this point.\n\n19\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.890\nRemember, well we could, and I guess\nit's fair to back up just a bit and\n\n20\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.560\ngive a brief explanation here\nbefore we start doing this.\n\n21\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.630\nRemember, the client could be\ngiving you a black box, grey box or\n\n22\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.270\nwhite box test,\nIf they give you a white box test and\n\n23\n00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.430\nyou've got a lot of this\ninformation as it is.\n\n24\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.430\nThe gray box, limited information, black\nbox by definition you don't get anything.\n\n25\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.220\nSo, depending on where you're starting\nyou may already have some of this.\n\n26\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.630\nNow what we're gonna kinda assume here,\n\n27\n00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.270\nis we're just kinda gonna assume we're in\nsort of a semi-quasi black box environment\n\n28\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.290\nwhen we are running these things,\nand just leave it at that.\n\n29\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.830\nBut you could have one of these other\nsituations where they've given you\n\n30\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.670\nother bits of information along\nthe way and said yeah, here you go.\n\n31\n00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.710\nBut, when you encounter that you know-\n>> Just\n\n32\n00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.040\nconsider yourself lucky and go whoa!\n\n33\n00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.650\nThere's a few things I\ndon't have to figure out,\n\n34\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.110\nthey've already given\nme some of the answers.\n\n35\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.220\nIt's good to know how to find it.\n\n36\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.630\nWhat if they don't give\nyou anything right?\n\n37\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.000\nYou've gotta start from scratch as you're\nsaying, the good 'ole black box test.\n\n38\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.050\nYou don't know anything about, hey,\nthey might give you the domain name and\n\n39\n00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.570\nthat might be it.\n\n40\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.100\n>> Yep, it's something to really think\nabout is what information might they\n\n41\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.040\nreally be giving you from the get-go.\n\n42\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400\nAnd I would also kind of caution you,\nby the way.\n\n43\n00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.830\nDon't think, just because you\nhave a white box, or gray box,\n\n44\n00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.020\nyou're completely off the hook for doing\na lot of the stuff that we have here.\n\n45\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.400\nThey may give you print outs of that or\n\n46\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.520\ngive you whatever that tells\nyou what things look like.\n\n47\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.170\nYou may still want to run these things\njust because you want to see what someone\n\n48\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.760\nthat isn't in your situation\nis going to be able to see.\n\n49\n00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.030\nYou know,\nbecause you're still responsible for that.\n\n50\n00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.480\nIf they give you a muti page Word document\nsaying this is how everything is set up,\n\n51\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.330\nhey, that's great.\n\n52\n00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.250\nYou have got the whole\nlayout of everything.\n\n53\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.910\nThat should make your job easier, but\n\n54\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.340\nyou still are going to have to run\nsome of these things to see well,\n\n55\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.940\nthis is what is behind the scenes\nthat the public doesn't see.\n\n56\n00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.540\nIf someone uses these tools, how much\nof this information could they get.\n\n57\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.810\nSo you still need to do that.\n\n58\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.140\nBut just FYI,\nthat we do have different situations.\n\n59\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.380\nWe're kinda sorta in a black\nbox environment right now.\n\n60\n00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.250\nEven though we're gonna\nbreak the rules on that and\n\n61\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.210\njump back and forth when we're talking.\n\n62\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.427\nIn the real world what we're doing\nhere would kind of fit in with\n\n63\n00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:29.345\na black box type situation.\n\n64\n00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:30.715\n>> All right.\n\n65\n00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:34.914\nYeah, so they might not give you, or\neven if they give you the information, but\n\n66\n00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:38.611\nas you said, just because they gave\nit to you, they still wanna know,\n\n67\n00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.450\ncould somebody get this if\nwe didn't give it to them?\n\n68\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.200\nThere's the idea there.\n\n69\n00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.000\n>> Exactly.\n>> All right, so\n\n70\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.810\nwe start off with nothing again.\n\n71\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.760\nBecause we're doing this as a lab\nenvironment we're gonna actually see\n\n72\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.570\nboth sides of things, but remember,\n\n73\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.450\nout there in the real world doing your\npen test, you might not have that luxury.\n\n74\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.400\nYou might be on the outside looking in and\nyou've gotta find your way,\n\n75\n00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.850\nfumble through the dark, and\nfigure out what the heck's going on.\n\n76\n00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.890\n>> Yeah, so we've gotta start\nletting the rubber hit the road and\n\n77\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.860\nstart gathering this information.\n\n78\n00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.000\nNow, we'll assume that you've already\ndone your Open Source Reconnaissance.\n\n79\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.900\nIf you recall, when we're doing\nreconnaissance phase there is\n\n80\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.800\na passive phase and\nthen there's an active phase.\n\n81\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.780\nWe're starting to kind of move more\ninto the active side of things and\n\n82\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.800\nmoving away from just\nthe purely passive stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.130\nIt doesn't mean you're not\ngoing to see any of that.\n\n84\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.850\nThere are tools I'm going to demo here\nthat are still scraping things out\n\n85\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.790\nof open source places.\n\n86\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.380\nBut you're going to see some of both.\n\n87\n00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.710\nBut we're setting the expectation here\nthat you've already gone through and\n\n88\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.400\ndone your going through job postings and\nstuff like that.\n\n89\n00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.800\nYou've already investigated\nthose sorts of things.\n\n90\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.985\nSo now you're moving into\nsomething that's a little more\n\n91\n00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:05.145\naggressively engaging the target\nto gather more information, or\n\n92\n00:05:05.145 --> 00:05:11.052\nto confirm what you got from\nyour previous piece of this.\n\n93\n00:05:11.052 --> 00:05:16.932\nRemember, just because you got something\nfrom whatever source you got it from,\n\n94\n00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:18.172\ndoesn't mean that it's correct.\n\n95\n00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:20.622\nThat could be stale data.\n\n96\n00:05:20.622 --> 00:05:24.032\nThat could be data that's\ncompletely incorrect.\n\n97\n00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:24.632\nI mean,\n\n98\n00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:29.152\nsome of these things that happens, which I\nshouldn't say some of these things, every,\n\n99\n00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:35.180\nevery place you get out there has\ninformation in it that's not correct.\n\n100\n00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.200\nEither it's completely incorrect or\nthere are little pieces of it.\n\n101\n00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.790\nSo, you really wanna make sure that\nyou're double checking everything you do.\n\n102\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.700\nThat whole idea of measure twice,\ncut once, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n103\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.280\nAnd so we may be double checking these\nthings that we had just to really\n\n104\n00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.000\nconfirm that yes we really have what\nwe expected to have at this point.\n\n105\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.990\nSo remember we did stuff in our CEH,\nstuff like net craft, and\n\n106\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.270\nwe did a lot of these online\nbrowser-based tools to check stuff.\n\n107\n00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.430\nSome of those things just pull out so\n\n108\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.970\nmuch information,\nit'd be tough to go through all that so\n\n109\n00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.150\nyou might have to rely on these to\nconfirm it and narrow it down a bit more.\n\n110\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.110\nAll those things are gonna work together.\n\n111\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.370\nAnd you really gotta be able to see\nthat big picture to make it all work and\n\n112\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.700\nget what you need to see.\n\n113\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.240\n>> Trust but verify, right?\n\n114\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.500\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Look at information and\n\n115\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.870\nthen verify that that\ninformation is accurate.\n\n116\n00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.670\n>> Yeah, don't ever just\nassume that it's 100% correct.\n\n117\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.260\nIt's funny thing.\n\n118\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:41.680\nOne of the things I mentioned in the the\nCEH course, was a situation where someone\n\n119\n00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.610\ngave their pen tester,\nthey gave them information ahead of time.\n\n120\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.519\nThey gave them almost like a gray-box\nsituation where they gave the guy IP\n\n121\n00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.051\naddresses.\n\n122\n00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:56.725\nAnd, the pen tester called the lady\nup that was in charge of this and\n\n123\n00:06:56.725 --> 00:06:58.485\nsaid well I need an IP address.\n\n124\n00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:05.890\nWell she was half asleep and\nshe was going to bed.\n\n125\n00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.660\nAnd heck, to show her state of mind,\nI remember her telling me yeah I\n\n126\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.380\njust had some medical thing done.\n\n127\n00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.880\nI'm on pain killers too.\n\n128\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.570\nI'm going down for the night.\n\n129\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.570\nI'm just popping one in.\n\n130\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.450\nThis guy calls and\nsays I gave him an IP address.\n\n131\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.140\nAnd she gave the thing to him and\nwas like okay, whatever and hung up.\n\n132\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.350\nShe gave the guy an IP\naddress that was incorrect.\n\n133\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.700\nYou know,\nthe last octet I think was off and so\n\n134\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.340\nthat was all it took as you guys\nknow to go to the wrong target.\n\n135\n00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.783\nAnd so the guy busted into another\ncompany and generated a report that he in\n\n136\n00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:47.166\nturn gave to his client, and they were\nlike well, what the heck is this?\n\n137\n00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:52.378\nSo that's, trust but verify,\nis very apt thing to say.\n\n138\n00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:55.579\nDon't just take it on the fact that\nthe information you're getting is\n\n139\n00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:56.562\na 100% correct.\n\n140\n00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:57.456\nCorrect.\n\n141\n00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.904\nI always like to do that thing and make\nsure that I've got at least two to three\n\n142\n00:08:01.904 --> 00:08:06.700\nsources that can, in some way, shape or\nform cross reference one another and give\n\n143\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.665\nme confidence, whenever possible, that is,\nthat I'm where I'm supposed to be.\n\n144\n00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:15.005\n>> You ever find that a company\nhires a PEN tester and\n\n145\n00:08:15.005 --> 00:08:17.755\nthen knowingly gives\nthem false information?\n\n146\n00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:20.605\nOr is it typically,\nI'm going to get what I'm paying for, so\n\n147\n00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:22.315\nI'm gonna give you accurate information?\n\n148\n00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:23.545\n>> It does happen.\n\n149\n00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.215\n>> Yeah.\n>> It does happen,\n\n150\n00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:28.625\nwhere they'll stick some stuff in\nthere to see just how good you are.\n\n151\n00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:30.405\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> To test you out.\n\n152\n00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:33.420\nThat does indeed happen.\n\n153\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.830\nBut don't expect it.\n\n154\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.110\nMost of the time they're paying\nthrough the nose already.\n\n155\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:44.730\n>> Don't want you wasting time on wrong\nIP address ranges or anything like that.\n\n156\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:51.320\n>> Yeah, if you're paying me for checking\nand finding these mistakes in here.\n\n157\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.780\nOkay, go ahead.\n\n158\n00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.820\nIt took me an hour or\n\n159\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.460\ntwo of sorting through stuff to figure out\nthat this was a dead end that you planted?\n\n160\n00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.540\nHey.\n\n161\n00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.775\n>> It's still billable hours.\n\n162\n00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:02.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, guess what?\n\n163\n00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.250\nThat's going to be a line\nitem on my invoice.\n\n164\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.010\nI'll be like, yeah, you know,\nchasing the white rabbit, right there.\n\n165\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.535\nSee that?\n\n166\n00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:11.176\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but anyway,\n\n167\n00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.608\nwe'll even take that out\nof the equation too,\n\n168\n00:09:14.608 --> 00:09:20.860\nthat someone is knowingly giving you\nbogus information though it does happen.\n\n169\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.090\nIt is probably not a common occurrence.\n\n170\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.660\nAnyway, like I said we got\nour Open Source stuff done.\n\n171\n00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.370\nNow we're moving in to\nfiguring out the network.\n\n172\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.490\nSo, let's think about what we can get.\n\n173\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.830\nAs we start moving over and gathering it.\n\n174\n00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.180\nThings we can get and\n\n175\n00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.590\nwe wanna have is we wanna have things\nlike IP ranges, subnet ranges.\n\n176\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.980\nThose are great things to have and\nyou're gonna need them for our next phase,\n\n177\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.610\nwhich is gonna be the scanning which\nwe're gonna be seeing that and\n\n178\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.060\nall the different options\nwe have available there.\n\n179\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.900\nWe're gonna see that in a later segment.\n\n180\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.060\nSo we want to have IP ranges.\n\n181\n00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.460\nWe want to have DNS information,\nwherever it's available.\n\n182\n00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.140\nSo there's plenty of tools,\nboth right built into the Linux\n\n183\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.390\noperating system that we can use, as well\nas stuff that Kali brings to the table.\n\n184\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.220\nSo we're gonna look at that.\n\n185\n00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.510\n>> And when you say DNS info,\n\n186\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.480\nare you talking about like\nwho is hosting their DNS?\n\n187\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.530\nWhether it's in-house, whether it's\nexternal and things like that?\n\n188\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.110\n>> That, plus other stuff.\n\n189\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.450\nYou can do a lot of things and\n\n190\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.790\nI'm definitely gonna show\nyou the different options.\n\n191\n00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.680\nSome of the stuff,\n\n192\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.988\nyou'll be really surprised that you can,\nreally surprised by what's really there.\n\n193\n00:10:30.988 --> 00:10:34.310\nSo, anyway, and\n\n194\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.160\nlet me tell you by the way even some of\nthe stuff I'm going to show you in here.\n\n195\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.240\nSome of the stuff isn't\ngoing to be really specific.\n\n196\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.580\nWell, at least the first one isn't\ngoing to be specific to Kali,\n\n197\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.010\nI'm just going to stick it in there\nto show you here is what you can do.\n\n198\n00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.760\nThen I'm going to show you some stuff that\nKali can do that can add to it So, but\n\n199\n00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.230\nin the real world don't expect, even\nthough this whole discussion here is based\n\n200\n00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.690\non, well, we're talking about Kali.\n\n201\n00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.580\nDon't get stuck on the fact that if\nyou used it in the real world to do\n\n202\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.850\nyour pen testing.\n\n203\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.420\nDon't start thinking that, oh,\n\n204\n00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.720\nwell if I'm using Kali I have to use only\nthe stuff that's in Kali to do things.\n\n205\n00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.410\nSome people, they're just gonna do that,\nthey're gonna go through the menus and\n\n206\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.580\nlook at things and\nthat's the only stuff we'll ever consider.\n\n207\n00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.588\nThis is design, the stuff we have\nhere in Kali is just to add on and\n\n208\n00:11:22.588 --> 00:11:25.060\nenhance your existing capabilities.\n\n209\n00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.590\nIt shouldn't be,\noh I'm just gonna stick with the tools in.\n\n210\n00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.060\nIf it's something in an underlying\noperator system that\n\n211\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.230\ncan bring to the table and\nit works for it, use it.\n\n212\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.310\nYou know absolutely use it.\n\n213\n00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.290\nSo, just FYI.\n\n214\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.930\nSo let's start going through and\ngathering information.\n\n215\n00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.250\nSo I'm gonna start with\nthe first one in here,\n\n216\n00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.130\njust to kind of put us in the right frame\nof mind, is one of the things you could do\n\n217\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.300\nright at the beginning, is just to\ndo an to do an NSLookup in here.\n\n218\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.940\nSo NSLookup, this is definitely\npart of the operating system,\n\n219\n00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.140\nit's not something specific that\nKali brings to the table, but\n\n220\n00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.640\nit's one of the things that I will\ndo initially to kind of position me\n\n221\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.730\non the information I'm gonna be getting\nwith doing some of the other stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.450\nYou know, so, and what I'm wanna do\nis I am going to just set it up so\n\n223\n00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.560\nI can look for really any type of record.\n\n224\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.500\nSo set type means I'm,\n\n225\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.850\nwell what I did is I started up NS lookup,\nthen I said set and the type any, so\n\n226\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:32.290\nit should return any type of records\nis what this is gonna do when I ask it.\n\n227\n00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.330\nSo I set that up and\nnow I can just type in a domain.\n\n228\n00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.740\nSo I can go back and\nuse the same one I used for\n\n229\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.430\nmy previous forays into this and\nour CEA to use Microsoft.\n\n230\n00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.530\nIf I hit Enter on that, you can see, and\nI know probably a lot of you are familiar\n\n231\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.380\nwith it, but just like I said, I'm using\nthis to kind of set the stage here for\n\n232\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.350\nsome of the stuff we're going to be doing.\n\n233\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.710\nIf you go through and\nyou look at this, we've got\n\n234\n00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.870\nsome of the information that we're\nactually, whoops that was a previous one,\n\n235\n00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:10.740\nyou can see in here that yeah,\nI've got information.\n\n236\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.260\nNameserver information,\nI've got address information.\n\n237\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.330\nI mean, take a look at that.\n\n238\n00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.970\nThese are things, details, again,\n\n239\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.140\nI'm running NSlookup, standard thing,\nyou've seen it before.\n\n240\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.110\nBut there are some things here that\nI wanna kind of just point out for\n\n241\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.490\nright now, then we're going to straighten\nsome of this out with a later tool,\n\n242\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.460\nor figure out how we ca do this.\n\n243\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.560\nIf you look at for example\n\n244\n00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.400\nthose two address I mean we\nhave the 134.70.blahdyblah.\n\n245\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.750\nYou know, we see two addresses there.\n\n246\n00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.530\nYou guys may recall when we went to\nin the CEH, when we did net craft.\n\n247\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:52.968\nWe typed in www.microsoft.com and\nit would bring up\n\n248\n00:13:52.968 --> 00:13:59.570\ninformation about Microsoft.com, pretty\nmuch similar to what we've got here,\n\n249\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.150\nbut it would bring up these\nmultiple IP addresses.\n\n250\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.410\nWell, we learned by looking\nat netcraft that we can\n\n251\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.830\ninfer that that more than\nlikely with the stuff,\n\n252\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.820\nwith the results you were getting,\nwe brought it all together.\n\n253\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.350\nYou could say yeah,\nthere's a load balancer there.\n\n254\n00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.840\nIt just didn't match up.\n\n255\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.850\nSo, we already kind of know that\nfrom pervious experience but\n\n256\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.810\nis there other ways if we were just using\nKali and we saw that, is there a way\n\n257\n00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.250\nthat we could actually determine that\nthere really is load balancing in there.\n\n258\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.940\nCuz we don't have information\nbeing presented the same way.\n\n259\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.150\nSo right now, what I would do is\nI would note this information.\n\n260\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.209\nAnd by the way,\nwhen you run a command in Kali,\n\n261\n00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:49.934\nyou can do the same thing in Windows,\nbut when you run a command in Kali.\n\n262\n00:14:49.934 --> 00:14:53.157\nYou can put the commands\nout on a single line and,\n\n263\n00:14:53.157 --> 00:14:58.040\njust like I could have done here,\nyou can put the command on a single line.\n\n264\n00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.480\nAnd then just do space and do the little\ngreater than sign and then space and\n\n265\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.595\nthen put a file name and you can dump\nall the results, not to the screen, but\n\n266\n00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:06.935\nto the text file.\n\n267\n00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:11.695\nSo you don't have to, if you're really bad\nat writing, you don't have to scribble\n\n268\n00:15:11.695 --> 00:15:15.165\neverything out and try and decipher all\nof those chicken scratches later on.\n\n269\n00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.142\n>> That's good.\n\n270\n00:15:16.142 --> 00:15:17.162\n>> I'm in that boat.\n\n271\n00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:19.172\nSounds like you're in that boat.\n\n272\n00:15:19.172 --> 00:15:22.242\nSo just FYI, it's a little trick.\n\n273\n00:15:22.242 --> 00:15:27.812\nI use it a couple times in here, where\nI'm demonstrating a couple of things.\n\n274\n00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:31.192\nBut you could really do that\nanywhere if you wanted.\n\n275\n00:15:31.192 --> 00:15:36.222\nSo just a little tip if you're\nunaware of that going in.\n\n276\n00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.500\nSo, I go through.\n\n277\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.580\nAgain, I've got the servers up top.\n\n278\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.320\nI have the IP addresses that go with it.\n\n279\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.940\nAs I scroll through,\nthere's my DNS stuff, great.\n\n280\n00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.016\nThere's my DNS information.\n\n281\n00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:54.251\nI've got the information about\nthe zone on there where its hosted.\n\n282\n00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:56.214\nSo that's some good stuff.\n\n283\n00:15:56.214 --> 00:16:01.310\nI would tell you, take note of these\nserver names and all that in here.\n\n284\n00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:06.810\nBecause there are some of the DNS tools\nthat come up later on that do specifically\n\n285\n00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:12.440\nask for DNS server names or IP addresses,\nwhich, once you've got the name,\n\n286\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.090\nI mean you can get the IP address\npretty easily at that point.\n\n287\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.190\nThat's a simple thing to do.\n\n288\n00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:24.760\nBut you're gonna want to at least have\nthat stuff noted as the case may be.\n\n289\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.910\nAnd let me scoot this over a bit.\n\n290\n00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.200\nIt's just so\nyou guys can see everything on there.\n\n291\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.410\nWhat I have underneath that,\n\n292\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.830\nis I have stuff relating to\nrecords that are in there.\n\n293\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.300\nYou can see mail exchanger records and\nall that good stuff.\n\n294\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.920\nText records,\nall those things are sitting in there.\n\n295\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.250\nSo I've got a good amount of information.\n\n296\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.420\nStuff I would expect to see.\n\n297\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.580\nSo that's a good start to the process.\n\n298\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:00.570\nAgain, just a very simple NSLookup,\nnothing really fancy there.\n\n299\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.660\n>> Setting that type to any so you get\nthat SOA information, those exchangers,\n\n300\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.810\nbecause you're not really sure what\nyou're looking for at this point,\n\n301\n00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.160\nyou just want to get all of it.\n\n302\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.310\nThat worked well.\n\n303\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.420\n>> Yeah.\nI usually just choose to do a set\n\n304\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.110\ntype to any when I start because it\njust pukes up all this stuff for me.\n\n305\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:22.230\nAnd while it may be a mess\nwhen I initially look at it,\n\n306\n00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.530\nit still give me a good amount\nof information right there.\n\n307\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:31.090\nSo I can say, okay, well,\nI wanna kinda narrow it down.\n\n308\n00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.740\nThat set type, you can set it equal\nto specific types of records.\n\n309\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.330\nSo, if you don't want to see all this.\n\n310\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.840\nYou can set to look at\nvery specific things.\n\n311\n00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.930\nAnd when it does that query, it will come\nback and just give you what you asked for.\n\n312\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.730\nSo, [CROSSTALK]\n>> You wanna look for just like the SOA or\n\n313\n00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.440\njust exchanger records [CROSSTALK]\n>> Exactly.\n\n314\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.440\n>> Or servers or mail servers?\n\n315\n00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.150\nOr even just A records if you\nwanted host records or something.\n\n316\n00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.910\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n317\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:01.410\nSo you don't need to take all of this\nin one shot, that may be overwhelming.\n\n318\n00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.590\nWhat you can do is you can actually\nlimit it to say just specific types.\n\n319\n00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.430\nYour call, some people might look\nat the way I do it when I say hey,\n\n320\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.480\ndump all this stuff out to the screen.\n\n321\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.320\nThey might look at that\nas being kinda messy.\n\n322\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.240\nOkay.\nThat's fine.\n\n323\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.970\nThis is just way I roll.\n\n324\n00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.290\nYou guys want to do it differently?\n\n325\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.780\nWhatever.\n\n326\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.150\nSo, we've got NSO.\n\n327\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.250\nWe've got NS look-up.\n\n328\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.980\nSo, we've got that information.\n\n329\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.100\nLike I said, you can go ahead and\n\n330\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.270\nconfirm this stuff by going\nthrough NetCraft, if you want.\n\n331\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.410\nIf you remember that one,\nthat's totally fine.\n\n332\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.960\nSo, there we go.\n\n333\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.230\nNow, the question is,\nwhere do we go from here?\n\n334\n00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.570\nSince we're done with that, you know?\n\n335\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.140\nWhere do we go?\n\n336\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.390\nYou know, where do we go [INAUDIBLE] here?\n\n337\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.225\nWe've got, we'll just assume that\nwe've got the NS lookup stuff noted.\n\n338\n00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:46.600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n339\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.860\n>> And we're ready to start moving on.\n\n340\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.640\nSo, there's gonna be some different\nsteps to do at this point.\n\n341\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.450\nSo, we got DNS, what else could we do,\nwhat would be useful?\n\n342\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:04.820\nIP ranges, perhaps, getting more\ninformation than what we've got here.\n\n343\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.100\nStuff I would consider doing is,\nI could do,\n\n344\n00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.880\nlet me go out of this in here.\n\n345\n00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:17.270\nOne of the things that you can\ndo is you do have your whois.\n\n346\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.970\nI do pull this usually right\naround the same thing.\n\n347\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.170\nThis is right around the same time.\n\n348\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.640\nThis is one of the things, by the way,\nwhois just kinda set the stage for\n\n349\n00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.920\nit as we did go through it in CEH but\nwe didn't do it this way.\n\n350\n00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.850\nAnd we did it by going through a web page.\n\n351\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.920\nWe opened up the browser and when we\nopened up the browser we went to the whois\n\n352\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.390\nwebsite and popped the stuff in and\ncalled it a day.\n\n353\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.320\nThat's totally fine to do it.\n\n354\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.920\nOne of my things I don't like to do, is I\ndon't like to rely too much on tools and\n\n355\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.422\nthis is just me,\nI liked wherever possible at least,\n\n356\n00:19:56.422 --> 00:20:01.343\nhave tools that I can use without\nhaving to go to websites.\n\n357\n00:20:01.343 --> 00:20:05.960\nCuz that website may be down, may be\nunreliable, may be filtered, whatever.\n\n358\n00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.470\nSo I liked it wherever possible have\ntools local that I could use to do this.\n\n359\n00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.100\nSo we used whois.\n\n360\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.950\nAnd in Windows,\nwe just use that browser-based tool.\n\n361\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.230\nHere, you have whois built directly\ninto the operating system.\n\n362\n00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:27.290\nSo what I can do is, who is, just in case\nyou do not recall that specific tool.\n\n363\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:31.040\nI can do whois and it will do a query.\n\n364\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.430\nAnd what it's going to do is it's\npulling record out for that host name.\n\n365\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:43.080\nIt's pulling that out\nof our public records.\n\n366\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.690\nNow what's kind of funny is that when\nyou go through it, it's got, whoops,\n\n367\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.242\ngoing up way too far on there.\n\n368\n00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:55.738\nI have, so there's my whois for\nMicrosoft.com.\n\n369\n00:20:55.738 --> 00:20:56.783\nLet me expand that out.\n\n370\n00:20:56.783 --> 00:20:58.750\nSo there's my whois.\n\n371\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.590\nSo okay well I've got\nsome profanity going on,\n\n372\n00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.270\nwhat would the day be without profanity?\n\n373\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.160\n>> Yeah right?\n\n374\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.030\n>> All right, so\nthere's some stuff going on.\n\n375\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.310\nIt looks like their records have\nmaybe been altered or busted or\n\n376\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:22.090\nsomething like that but in any case\nwhat I have here is information\n\n377\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.952\nabout that specific domain.\n\n378\n00:21:27.952 --> 00:21:28.825\nSo.\n\n379\n00:21:28.825 --> 00:21:30.521\nNow here you can see who\nthey registered with.\n\n380\n00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:31.171\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n381\n00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:34.155\nthere's different\nregistrations going on here.\n\n382\n00:21:34.155 --> 00:21:37.105\nI'm not sure what's happening over here,\nit looks like someone's busted it,\n\n383\n00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:41.865\nis playing some sort of prank or\njoke, or has an axe to grind,\n\n384\n00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:46.335\nbecause you go up through\nseveral of these and\n\n385\n00:21:46.335 --> 00:21:49.880\nthere's some stuff going on.\n\n386\n00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.890\n>> They really do have some fake records,\nit looks like,\n\n387\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.450\ninserted in there, don't they?\n\n388\n00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.170\n>> Yeah, so\nit's causing some issues with this.\n\n389\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.980\nSo, this isn't a problem on our end, but\n\n390\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:07.520\nthis is something that\nwe're seeing is in here.\n\n391\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.180\nThis is actually not bad this is\nhappening, that we pulled up as it's\n\n392\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.440\npulling up some of these different pieces\nof information where if we looked at this,\n\n393\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:21.150\nI mean, common sense says it's\nprobably these are not legit here.\n\n394\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.040\nMicrosoft's not gonna, I hope Microsoft's\nnot gonna do some of this stuff,\n\n395\n00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.480\nbut wow, that's an interesting one.\n\n396\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.108\nSwinging community and hacks and\n\n397\n00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:36.244\nwe're just gonna stay away\nfrom the rest of that.\n\n398\n00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:38.055\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, good.\n\n399\n00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:38.555\nYeah.\n\n400\n00:22:39.651 --> 00:22:42.600\n>> Is just over there censoring\nthe stuff out, like great.\n\n401\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.230\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n402\n00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.810\n>> There's gonna be black boxes\nover all that stuff later on.\n\n403\n00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.680\nBut that one is actually\ngood that that happened,\n\n404\n00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.620\nbecause you can see that stuff in\nthere and that's pretty obvious.\n\n405\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.530\nBut what if you saw other\nstuff that wasn't so obvious?\n\n406\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.170\nYou could use the very tools we have there\nto start separating it, to say okay,\n\n407\n00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.850\nlet's analyze this different ways\nto see what's going on here,\n\n408\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.230\nyou know what's the real thing?\n\n409\n00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:14.500\nSo any case, this is information\nlike I said on their domain.\n\n410\n00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.150\nYou can see, you know, different\nthings that are going on with it.\n\n411\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:22.948\nBe prepared when you look at something\nlike this that sometimes you might have\n\n412\n00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:29.160\na less information that's in\nhere than you would expect.\n\n413\n00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.760\nYou have a truncated record.\n\n414\n00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.530\nHere I happen to have\na fully populated record.\n\n415\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.940\nI have who registered it, and\n\n416\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.670\nhave information in there, you can see the\nadmin information who's responsible for\n\n417\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.400\ndoing the paperwork and\ntechnical information.\n\n418\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.320\nYou have all that good stuff and\nemail address.\n\n419\n00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.346\nSo that's again not a bad start to have.\n\n420\n00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:52.372\nAnd it's confirmed some of the stuff\nwe saw by doing an NSlookup,\n\n421\n00:23:52.372 --> 00:23:54.693\nbecause we see name server\ninformation in there.\n\n422\n00:23:54.693 --> 00:23:59.561\nSo this would be a source that kinda\nconfirmed that So we're doing pretty good.\n\n423\n00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:01.339\nWe got that who is stuff.\n\n424\n00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:07.254\nNow let me just kind of point out, I won't\nworry you about all the stuff in here,\n\n425\n00:24:07.254 --> 00:24:11.240\nbut let me just point out\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n426\n00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.860\nI mentioned at the beginning we\ndid use this in a CEH course and\n\n427\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.730\nwe did all the stuff through Windows.\n\n428\n00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:23.370\nWell, WhoIs, like I said in Windows,\nsince it's not built in.\n\n429\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.570\nThere is no WhoIs client in Windows,\nyou have to go to a website or\n\n430\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.410\nsomething to do this,\nor download a utility.\n\n431\n00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.820\nYou actually can get WhoIs for\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n432\n00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.530\nMicrosoft does make it, but for whatever\nreason it's not part of the system.\n\n433\n00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.180\nYou actually have to go up to\ntheir site and download it.\n\n434\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.220\nIt's for free.\n\n435\n00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.620\nAnd then you can shove it in there.\n\n436\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.970\nAnd then you can use it.\n\n437\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.190\nIt works the exact same way.\n\n438\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.310\nSo if you do wanna have\nthat same thing over there.\n\n439\n00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.180\nI just figure it's something I'd throw in.\n\n440\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.810\nThat you don't have to do that.\n\n441\n00:24:54.810 --> 00:25:01.090\nYou can use one of those special tools we\nhad over in that class that does that.\n\n442\n00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.850\nOr you can just download\nthe WhoIs client for it.\n\n443\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.470\nInstead of using a browser-based tool.\n\n444\n00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.485\n>> Because it's all in that\nsame registrars database.\n\n445\n00:25:09.485 --> 00:25:11.620\n>> Yeah,\nit's all coming form the same place.\n\n446\n00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.450\nThe thing I would tell you when you\nlook at that information like I said.\n\n447\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.050\nDon't necessarily expect it always\nto be complete when you look at it,\n\n448\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.850\nwhen you see it comes from\nthe same registrar's database.\n\n449\n00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.550\nOne of the things that we do get\nsometimes is some of the registrars that\n\n450\n00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.980\nyou go through,\nthey actually will sanitize it.\n\n451\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.560\nAlthough there's one main\ndatabase that they all go to.\n\n452\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.510\nBut it's not uncommon for them to sanitize\nit and they only give you like a small\n\n453\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.350\npiece of it because people may be\ntrying to do what we're doing here.\n\n454\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.310\nBut for evil purposes,\nI guess if you wanna put it that way.\n\n455\n00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.610\nSo that's something that\nsometimes that may not be there.\n\n456\n00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.390\nSo be prepared for that.\n\n457\n00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.325\nWhat you should be seeing is something\nlike you just saw on screen here from\n\n458\n00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:57.130\nMicrosoft, with the who registered it.\n\n459\n00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.730\nThe admin and technical.\n\n460\n00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.950\nWe should always know that\nthose are gonna be there.\n\n461\n00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.340\nPlus the name server, stuff like that.\n\n462\n00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.890\nIf that stuff's not there,\nthey're pretty much hiding it from you, so\n\n463\n00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.320\nyou're gonna have to go\nsomeplace else to get it.\n\n464\n00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.910\nThat's one of the things I don't\nlike about those websites.\n\n465\n00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.810\nSome of the websites you go to for\nWhoIs will not display that.\n\n466\n00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.430\nAnd some people,\nwhen they go to the WhoIs websites,\n\n467\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.632\nthey'll go to something like GoDaddy or\none of those hosting providers.\n\n468\n00:26:24.632 --> 00:26:26.090\nAnd they'll go there and\n\n469\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.990\nlook up a domain name with the intent\nof getting that information.\n\n470\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.582\nWell, some of the registrars will not\ndisplay that stuff because they just wanna\n\n471\n00:26:34.582 --> 00:26:35.820\ntell you.\n\n472\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.090\nHey, that domain is\nregistered to somebody, and\n\n473\n00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.285\nhere's the information on when it was\nregistered and when it was expired and\n\n474\n00:26:41.285 --> 00:26:44.410\nblobbity-blah, and it won't tell\nyou any other detailed information.\n\n475\n00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.640\n>> Because they're just trying to sell you\na domain name, so they're gonna say, well,\n\n476\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.300\nthat one's taken.\n\n477\n00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.450\nHere, wouldn't you like this one,\nhere's one's similar.\n\n478\n00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.200\nThat kind of thing.\n\n479\n00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.658\n>> Yeah.\n\n480\n00:26:51.658 --> 00:26:56.120\nSo again,\nthat's kind of like knowing your stuff,\n\n481\n00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.450\nknowing that if those things aren't there,\nthey're supposed to be there.\n\n482\n00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.850\nSo something's happened\nbetween point A and point B.\n\n483\n00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.710\nFortunately something like this in Kali,\n\n484\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.830\nwhen it does a WhoIs like this, it's\nvery rare to see it truncated like that.\n\n485\n00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.210\nThat's one of the benefits\nof using a command line one.\n\n486\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.900\nIf you're using a browser based one,\n\n487\n00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.590\nyou're using a script that actually\nchops that stuff out and gets rid of it.\n\n488\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.090\nSo, we don't have to\nworry about that here,\n\n489\n00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.460\nnecessarily, but be vigilant about that.\n\n490\n00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.640\nSo we're off to a pretty good start.\n\n491\n00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.338\nWe've got name servers,\nwe've got DNS info,\n\n492\n00:27:29.338 --> 00:27:32.180\nwe've also got something\nthat's interesting.\n\n493\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:38.230\nAnd we already know what the situation\nis based on prior experience.\n\n494\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.155\nWe know that, we look at\nMicrosoft's record in NS lookup,\n\n495\n00:27:42.155 --> 00:27:44.200\nwe saw two IP addresses for it.\n\n496\n00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.310\nAnd so we know from before that\nthat's a load balancing situation.\n\n497\n00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:53.652\nBecause it you recall the way we\ndetermined that is there's nothing that\n\n498\n00:27:53.652 --> 00:27:55.940\ntold us that that was load balancing.\n\n499\n00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:01.100\nBut we could tell by again doing\nthat inference cuz what did we do.\n\n500\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.601\nIf you recall, we looked at Netcraft,\nsaw his IP addresses, and\n\n501\n00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:07.610\nthen I was telling you guys,\nhey look over to the right.\n\n502\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.380\nAnd I was telling you about\nthe importance of platform knowledge early\n\n503\n00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.530\non in that course.\n\n504\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.250\nJust like it's gonna apply here.\n\n505\n00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.583\nI was telling you that when\nyou look at that information,\n\n506\n00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:21.736\nyou have an operating system\nshowing in Netcraft, and\n\n507\n00:28:21.736 --> 00:28:25.090\nthen you also have web server information.\n\n508\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:31.670\nAnd you saw in some of those,\nyou saw a version of IIS,\n\n509\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.190\n7, 7.5 or 8 or 8.5.\n\n510\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.945\nAnd then you saw Linux or\nsomething else over, and\n\n511\n00:28:37.945 --> 00:28:40.920\nyou know that those\nthings don't go together.\n\n512\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.310\nThat's not happening.\n\n513\n00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.330\nSo there's something.\n\n514\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.910\nIt's fingerprinting the operating\nsystem at the network stack level.\n\n515\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.630\nAnd then it's identifying the web\nserver at the application level.\n\n516\n00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.100\nIt's getting the two results,\nand that's fine to do that, but\n\n517\n00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.290\nthose two results,\nthere's more to them than that.\n\n518\n00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.170\nThey can't exist in that combination.\n\n519\n00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.060\nSo, we knew there was\nsomething else there.\n\n520\n00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.400\nOnce we did a little more research and\ndid some inference on the whole thing.\n\n521\n00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.830\nWe knew that there has to be Windows under\nthat IS version so why is it saying Linux?\n\n522\n00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.940\nSo we looked a little more,\nlooked for some other sources.\n\n523\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.160\nWe were eventually able to determine\nthat that was a network appliance.\n\n524\n00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.220\nSo, we did that there, but\nall we have at this point,\n\n525\n00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.260\nif we take that stuff off the table,\nwe've got a couple of IP addresses.\n\n526\n00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.520\nWell, what does that mean,\nwe've got a couple of IP addresses?\n\n527\n00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.810\nYou might be aware of, and\n\n528\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.770\nI would hope if you're at this point\nyou know what load balancing is.\n\n529\n00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.210\nAnd by the time you're\ndoing this sort of thing,\n\n530\n00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:47.310\nyou might already be able to infer\nthat that is load balancing.\n\n531\n00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.620\nBut you don't know for sure because\nyou don't have enough information.\n\n532\n00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:56.770\nSo right now, you've just dumped\na couple things out to a text file,\n\n533\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.470\nor you've written it down in Excel\nspreadsheet or however you do it.\n\n534\n00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.200\nYou've got that documented.\n\n535\n00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.170\nWell, now we've gotta start building\non top of this information so\n\n536\n00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:06.750\nwe're starting to get a foundation.\n\n537\n00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:12.170\nThe next thing is now going into Kali's\nown tools and start mixing those in.\n\n538\n00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.824\nAnd just in case you're wondering,\nwell, he's starting with\n\n539\n00:30:16.824 --> 00:30:21.485\nstuff that I already know or\ncan already do without having Kali.\n\n540\n00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:23.615\nThat's fine.\n\n541\n00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:26.664\nThat's not uncommon,\nwhen you're doing a pen test,\n\n542\n00:30:26.664 --> 00:30:28.530\nto start with some of the basics.\n\n543\n00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.000\nYou can jump right in,\nuse some of the Kali tools.\n\n544\n00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.470\nAfter you see some of the stuff that\nI'm gonna use, that's totally fine.\n\n545\n00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.840\nYou want to go in and jump in and\n\n546\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.620\nuse those things right off the bat,\nI'm not going to tell you no.\n\n547\n00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.870\nI'm not going to say you are being dumb.\n\n548\n00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.490\nDon't do that.\n\n549\n00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.470\nIf that's how you choose to do it and\nyou are aware of it, hey, go for it.\n\n550\n00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.110\nI am not going to argue with you one bit.\n\n551\n00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:55.990\nI found using some of these things and\nthen I just build on it and\n\n552\n00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.290\nget some of this stuff.\n\n553\n00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.240\nIt works for me.\n\n554\n00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.200\nUsing some of these tools,\nI've used them for years.\n\n555\n00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.260\nThey're really nice and\nquick and simple to use.\n\n556\n00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:08.109\nGive me precisely what I want and I don't\nhave to go through a bunch of hoops.\n\n557\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.040\nFine.\nI get to what I need here and\n\n558\n00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.900\nthen I feed that to those later tools.\n\n559\n00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.630\n>> It's almost, to me it's almost\nlike a good starting point.\n\n560\n00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.160\nIt's easy.\nYou don't have to think a lot.\n\n561\n00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.840\nThey're available in any operating system.\n\n562\n00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.000\nKali is what I'm going to use\nto do most of my tests so\n\n563\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.050\nit might as well be in there.\n\n564\n00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.460\nBut you got to start somewhere.\n\n565\n00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.000\nYou got to get that first\nbit of information, right?\n\n566\n00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.240\nAnd even if those IP address, we don't\nknow if it's a load balancer or not.\n\n567\n00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.160\nWe can still take those addresses and\npin them up on our board.\n\n568\n00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.270\nAgain, I keep thinking back\nto those crime scene shows.\n\n569\n00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:35.790\n>> It works.\n\n570\n00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.780\n>> Maybe there's a big question\nmark next to that one.\n\n571\n00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.510\nYou know how they do that?\n\n572\n00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.110\nThey'll have, we're not really sure.\n\n573\n00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.640\nWe're thinking maybe this\nis where it's going, but\n\n574\n00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.270\nwe're gonna put it up on the board so\nthat we don't forget about it.\n\n575\n00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.060\nPut a question mark by it.\n\n576\n00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.700\nStill got a little more research to go.\n\n577\n00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.350\nSo we're getting there.\n\n578\n00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.360\nWe're getting our feet wet.\n\n579\n00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.440\nWe're starting to get some of\nthe information that we need, but\n\n580\n00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.710\nlooking at the clock Sean,\nwe're about out of time.\n\n581\n00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.305\nSo why don't we take a break here.\n\n582\n00:31:57.305 --> 00:32:01.635\nAnd when we come back, we'll dive even\nfurther into some of the tools we can use\n\n583\n00:32:01.635 --> 00:32:04.025\nto uncover that network information.\n\n584\n00:32:04.025 --> 00:32:06.765\nSo ladies and gentleman,\nhope you enjoyed this episode.\n\n585\n00:32:06.765 --> 00:32:08.575\nWe're signing off for now for ITProTV.\n\n586\n00:32:08.575 --> 00:32:10.075\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n587\n00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:10.965\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n588\n00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:12.685\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:17.295\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.250\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.960\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.400\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.380\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.320\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.090\nAnother exciting day\ntoday here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.160\nWe're continuing on with\nour Kali Linux series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.970\nAnd in this episode,\n\n11\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.400\nwe're actually continuing something\nwe started in a previous episode.\n\n12\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.030\nAnd that was uncovering\ninformation about the network.\n\n13\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.580\nTrying to figure out where\nour target resides and\n\n14\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.620\ngetting as much information as we can.\n\n15\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.960\nIf you missed the previous episode,\ngo back and check it out.\n\n16\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500\nWe took a look at a couple\ntools like whois and nslookup.\n\n17\n00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.620\nThese are tools that you should be\nfamiliar with it at this point in your\n\n18\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.210\ncareer, anyway.\n\n19\n00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.110\nWe've talked about them in\nseveral different classes.\n\n20\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.370\nBut now, we're gonna continue on and\nsee what other tools we can use, and\n\n21\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610\nwhat kind of information we can uncover.\n\n22\n00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.340\nSo, where do we want to start today, Sean?\n\n23\n00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:01.950\n>> Well, you know,\nwhat we're gonna take a look at is,\n\n24\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.670\nwe've already done quite\na bit of investigation.\n\n25\n00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.900\nNow, the next thing is, is that, after we\nhave that information, I mean, to revisit\n\n26\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.050\nwhat we have is, we have that stuff from\nour open source intelligence gathering.\n\n27\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.140\nCuz we said prior that we're\nnot gonna do all of that here.\n\n28\n00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.150\nWhere we do all the Google hacking and\nall that.\n\n29\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.220\nThat hasn't changed one bit, so\nwe cover that well enough some place else.\n\n30\n00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.520\nBut we're gonna do here is,\n\n31\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.970\nwe're gonna assume you have\nthings like DNS, information.\n\n32\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.580\nThat you have some of the stuff\nthat's available on WhoIs,\n\n33\n00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.150\nwe'll assume that you've got IP ranges.\n\n34\n00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.444\nIn there, so we will just kind of take and\nchalk it up that yeah,\n\n35\n00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:50.390\nthose things have already been done,\nand those things are present.\n\n36\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.134\nSo, now, the next thing to do is\nto start seeing if we have any,\n\n37\n00:01:55.134 --> 00:01:57.600\nwhat types of systems we have out there.\n\n38\n00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.490\nIf they're live or not, and so\nwe have ways of doing that.\n\n39\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.270\nOne of the ways we can do that is by\ndoing what's called a ping sweep.\n\n40\n00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040\nJust in case you do not remember\nthat from before, we can,\n\n41\n00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.260\na ping sweep is a way of just\ngoing across an IP range and\n\n42\n00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.650\nfinding those hosts that\nare actually live on there.\n\n43\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.120\nRemember, you can have a pretty\nsubstantially sized range of IPs and\n\n44\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.800\nthere may only be a small portion\nof that that's actually being used.\n\n45\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.690\nDoesn't have to be the whole thing.\n\n46\n00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.080\nYou could have a hundred and\nonly have ten being used.\n\n47\n00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.490\n>> Yeah, some of these\ncompanies went out early on and\n\n48\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.920\ngrabbed a class B block of addresses.\n\n49\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.000\nAnd know there's what, 65,000 some odd\nhosts addresses available on that.\n\n50\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.640\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthey have 65,000 hosts, right?\n\n51\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.080\nSo we don't wanna waste our time\nhitting IP addresses that aren't live.\n\n52\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.180\nSo, we can run these kind of tools and\nfind your live hosts and\n\n53\n00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.230\nthen focus our energies on those.\n\n54\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.450\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n55\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.560\nThat's the whole name of the game,\nis trying to refine what we're doing.\n\n56\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.110\nRefine our tac, instead of just carpet\nbombing, which is what we'd be doing if we\n\n57\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.460\njust acted on the IP ranges\nthat we already have.\n\n58\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.530\nWe want to narrow that down.\n\n59\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.990\nSo, you're going to take that IP range and\nyou're gonna perform a ping sweep or\n\n60\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.160\na sweep across it to see\nwhich ones are live.\n\n61\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.990\nFortunately, we've got\nplenty of tools that could\n\n62\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.310\nhelp us out with that specific task.\n\n63\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.280\nNow, you may recall the Windows\nside we had things like Angry IP\n\n64\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.280\nwas a custom built one that did just that.\n\n65\n00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.292\n>> Mm.\n>> There's other ones nmap, which we have\n\n66\n00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:40.440\nthat we have available over here on\nthe Linux side as well, it will do that.\n\n67\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.448\nBut, there are others to be sure that\ndo the exact same type of thing, and\n\n68\n00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:47.395\nmay do it a little faster,\na little bit better.\n\n69\n00:03:47.395 --> 00:03:48.735\nI mean, you'll find that in a Linux side.\n\n70\n00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:52.915\nThere are some things that do ping sweeps\nand they can do them just incredibly fast.\n\n71\n00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:59.085\nSome of the claims you even think about\nare just, there's no way it's doing that.\n\n72\n00:03:59.085 --> 00:04:01.935\nBut, we'll take it with a grain of salt.\n\n73\n00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:06.173\nI don't know how big a grain of salt\nthat's gonna be, but we'll assume that.\n\n74\n00:04:06.173 --> 00:04:11.935\nI know there was one I looked at,\nthat's on the list of tools in Kali and\n\n75\n00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:16.723\nthe creators of it claim that\nyou could hit every IP address\n\n76\n00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:20.648\nthat's available on\nInternet in six minutes.\n\n77\n00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:21.841\nOkay.\n\n78\n00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:26.091\n>> [LAUGH] That might be a stretch.\n\n79\n00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:28.600\n>> Whatever.\n\n80\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.104\n>> Maybe.\n\n81\n00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:30.650\n[LAUGH].\n\n82\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.230\n>> I don't know how you can confirm that,\nyou know, but whatever.\n\n83\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.000\nJust like, for the record,\njust to bring it out,\n\n84\n00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.670\nsince we can't measure that,\nI can swim faster than Michael Phelps.\n\n85\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:43.480\nI just don't time myself.\n\n86\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.302\nSelf, so we don't really know.\n\n87\n00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.628\nSo anyway, but -.\n\n88\n00:04:47.628 --> 00:04:49.890\n>> There are claims to the side.\n\n89\n00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.130\nAs long as we can get the information\nfast, that's a good thing,\n\n90\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.120\nwhether it can get every IP address out\nthere in the world in 6 minutes, eh.\n\n91\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.245\nI've seen you swim, you're pretty fast.\n\n92\n00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:04.900\n[LAUGH]\nSo, what we wanna do is,\n\n93\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.250\nwe wanna do that whole ping sweep,\nwhere we wanna identify live hosts.\n\n94\n00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.770\nNow, what I'm going to use is,\nI'm going to use a tool called F-ping.\n\n95\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.210\nAnd you do have ping,\nby the way, available in Kaylee.\n\n96\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.490\nIt's not the fact that it's not there,\n\n97\n00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.750\nit's just ping's designed to be a one of\nutility that you go on a one by one basis.\n\n98\n00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.150\nIt's got it's own options and\nall that to do it's stuff,\n\n99\n00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.800\nbut it's not really ideal for\ndoing a ping sweep.\n\n100\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.750\nYeah, you could script it to do that,\n\n101\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.275\nbut why go through all that\ntrouble if we have another way?\n\n102\n00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:46.510\nF-ping gives us that other way.\n\n103\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.245\nSo, what I have here in my virtual\nmachine is, I have a command put up here.\n\n104\n00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:54.500\nAnd what that command is doing,\n\n105\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.870\nI'm not going to worry about\nthe switches right now.\n\n106\n00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.960\nThose switches are basically\ntelling us about the range and\n\n107\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.900\nstuff like that that it's going to do.\n\n108\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.630\nSo, what you're seeing is F-ping and\nthen if we skip over this switches,\n\n109\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.450\nwe can see that we have a couple\nIP addresses defined there.\n\n110\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.950\nWhat that is,\nif you look really closely at it,\n\n111\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.430\none of them's the start of that range and\none's towards the end.\n\n112\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.630\nSo, we've got that.\n\n113\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.500\nThe next thing I have in there is, I have\nthat little greater than symbol, and\n\n114\n00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.630\nit says host.txt.\n\n115\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.270\nSo, what that's gonna do is that's\ngoing to run that F-ping command.\n\n116\n00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.010\nAnd it's gonna sweep across\nthat whole range, and\n\n117\n00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.710\ndump the stuff out to that host.txt.\n\n118\n00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.940\nAnd then I'll be, you know?\n\n119\n00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.920\nSo, I'll have a file that I can,\nyou know, go ahead and use.\n\n120\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.360\nSo, what I'll do is I'll go ahead and\nhit enter on that.\n\n121\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.710\nAnd it can take some time to do.\n\n122\n00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.230\nOnce it's done, what I will see\nsitting over here in my home folder,\n\n123\n00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.760\nlet me open up my home folder here,\nis I will see a host.txt pop up.\n\n124\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.330\nAnd it's sitting there\njust in this folder.\n\n125\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.980\nSo when I open that host.txt up, it will\nstart dumping information into that.\n\n126\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.370\nNow, it looks like, okay,\nlooks like it's done.\n\n127\n00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.720\nLet's see if it found anything.\n\n128\n00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.170\nI just dumped in a range.\n\n129\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.670\nSo, it didn't find anything live on there.\n\n130\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.205\nWell, that range, I didn't wanna\nuse the IP range that's here.\n\n131\n00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:26.739\n[LAUGH].\n\n132\n00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.210\n>> I don't know what's gonna show up.\n\n133\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.980\n>> Let's see, how about this.\n\n134\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:40.050\nLet me find you a range\nreal quick that we can use.\n\n135\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.740\nEh, it's just F-ping.\n\n136\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.980\nWe can't get in to too much trouble.\n\n137\n00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.670\nWe say that now.\n\n138\n00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.390\nIf we lose broadcast,\nyou'll know what happened.\n\n139\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.392\nLet's do a 10.1.230 network.\n\n140\n00:07:52.392 --> 00:07:57.097\nThat's a class C, so from one to 255 or\nwhatever you want to scan in there.\n\n141\n00:07:57.097 --> 00:07:58.476\n>> Okay, fair enough.\n\n142\n00:07:58.476 --> 00:08:02.897\nWe will do that, so\nwe'll just dump this in.\n\n143\n00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:07.938\nWell I'll do 250 just to make it there,\nand\n\n144\n00:08:07.938 --> 00:08:14.200\nI'll put in itpro.txt so\nwe can differentiate it.\n\n145\n00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.380\nIn there so what I should see when\nI hit that is it'll take a moment.\n\n146\n00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.330\nSo, there we go.\n\n147\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.070\nIt's spitting out information.\n\n148\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.600\nIt couldn't contact the other ones so\nit didn't really do much on there.\n\n149\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.440\nBut this one so, it's going through and\nyou can see host unreachable so,\n\n150\n00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.990\nthat's telling us,\nwell there's nothing living behind those.\n\n151\n00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.670\n>> That's a good chunk of it.\n\n152\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.300\nThat's a class C range.\n\n153\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.700\nThere's 255 addresses.\n\n154\n00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.640\nWe've got about 10, 15 hosts on there.\n\n155\n00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.422\nSo most of them are gonna be empty,\nI would imagine.\n\n156\n00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.291\n>> Yeah, so we've got that.\n\n157\n00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:51.340\nNow it went ahead and it stopped.\n\n158\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.890\nLet's see if it dumped anything\ninto our file this time.\n\n159\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.060\nLooks like it's still kinda\nworking on some stuff there.\n\n160\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.170\nSo let me see if I can open this up.\n\n161\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:07.100\nOkay, well, it went through and,\nyeah, you're not using them all but\n\n162\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.390\nyou can see it has definitely said that\nthere are some live hosts back there,\n\n163\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.120\nso those are a list of our live hosts.\n\n164\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.610\n>> Yeah and that's pretty impressive\nbecause even I'm on this network and\n\n165\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.220\nI didn't realize we had\nthat many hosts out there,\n\n166\n00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.200\nso already gathering information\nthat I was unaware of.\n\n167\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.890\n>> And look at how quick that was.\n\n168\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:30.270\nThat was a very,\nvery easy way of gathering that data.\n\n169\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.160\n>> All right.\n\n170\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.090\n>> So let's say and because I added\non that little bit on the end it went\n\n171\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.280\nright directly to a file and\nit's, I'm ready to go.\n\n172\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.220\nI can use that some place else.\n\n173\n00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.270\nAnd remember, that syntax at the end,\n\n174\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.960\nyou can see that Mike's put\nit in the chat room for you.\n\n175\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.960\nIf you drop the first part of that,\nand you look at the greater than sign,\n\n176\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.310\nand then the .txt, I can replace that\nhost.txt with any text file name you want.\n\n177\n00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.840\nYou could put host.txt.\n\n178\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.500\nYou could put something else if you want.\n\n179\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.180\nWhatever you put in there, it'll just\ndump it directly into that file.\n\n180\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:17.460\nSince when I open my shell in Kali,\nit opens it up in my Home folder.\n\n181\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.895\nWhat I can do is when I write\neverything out to a file.\n\n182\n00:10:20.895 --> 00:10:25.335\nYou can see all I had to do was go to my\nplaces menu and hit my home folder and\n\n183\n00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:28.155\nall my stuff just shows up right there.\n\n184\n00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:33.265\nSo, I'm making it really,\nreally easy for myself to get this data.\n\n185\n00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:38.765\nSo, there you go that's fping,\nyou can use another tool if you want.\n\n186\n00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:43.425\nThere are other tools in Kali\nthat do a similar thing,\n\n187\n00:10:43.425 --> 00:10:45.060\nif not the exact same thing.\n\n188\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.860\nSo, if this isn't to your liking\nyou've got the other ones.\n\n189\n00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.140\nAnother one is mask scan.\n\n190\n00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.320\nThat you can use to do\nthe same type of thing.\n\n191\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.230\n>> And if I forget any of these\ncommands at least I know for fping.\n\n192\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.700\nIf you do fping space dash dash help.\n\n193\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.070\nYou'll get some syntax help on it.\n\n194\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.620\nSo you can see what\nthose other switches do.\n\n195\n00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.350\nLike A, generating that list of\nlive hosts, and what was G, Sean?\n\n196\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.890\nGenerates the target list.\n\n197\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.700\nSo lots of different switches.\n\n198\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.490\nYou can even throw a Q in\nthere to do a quiet, so\n\n199\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.500\nyou don't have to look at that output.\n\n200\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.850\nIf you're putting it out to a file anyway,\n\n201\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.750\nmaybe you don't wanna see that\nstuff scrolling across your screen.\n\n202\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.010\nSo, we have fping, we've got a couple of\nother tools we can use, and we're just\n\n203\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.960\ngathering information about that target\nnetwork, finding those live hosts.\n\n204\n00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.530\n>> Yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.300\nYou're gathering a good\namount of information, so\n\n206\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.140\nwe're doing pretty good at this point\nwith the information that we have, so.\n\n207\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.910\nIf we start looking back,\nwe have our, like I said,\n\n208\n00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.570\nour DNS info, we've got our WhoIs info.\n\n209\n00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.290\nNow what do we have?\n\n210\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.960\nWe have our IP stuff, and by the way,\nwhen you start adjusting those switches,\n\n211\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.930\nthe reason why we look at that stuff that\nwe have in the chat room that dash g in\n\n212\n00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.160\nthere, it shows you just\nthe hosts that were live in there.\n\n213\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.650\nYou could dump a lot more out\nto that file if you wanted\n\n214\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.360\nby sticking on more switches on\nthere to get different results.\n\n215\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.650\nI just didn't see fit to do that here to\nmuddy the waters, but you could definitely\n\n216\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.880\ngo ahead and bring in more into the mix\nif you really, really want to do it.\n\n217\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.870\nI would tell you to play around with it.\n\n218\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:26.450\nThat's what the whole purpose of getting\nthis in a sandbox environment and\n\n219\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.668\npoking around with it,\nis that's what it's designed to do.\n\n220\n00:12:29.668 --> 00:12:36.820\nOkay, so, other tools that we have\navailable, so we want to start\n\n221\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:42.380\ndigging into DNS a bit more,\nwe have some other tools sitting out here.\n\n222\n00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.210\nWe have the DNS tool sitting out here.\n\n223\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:52.620\nSo, if we look at this one,\nwe have this DNS enumerate one.\n\n224\n00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.440\nThis is one of those things,\nby the way, when you do this,\n\n225\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.310\nis that when you bring up somebody's\ntools, you pick them of the menu.\n\n226\n00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.990\nNotice how this thing just puked\na bunch of stuff out for me.\n\n227\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.780\nIt can be a little messy.\n\n228\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.400\nSometimes when you look at this,\nall of a sudden it's like boom.\n\n229\n00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.690\nA bunch of stuff comes out and you're\nlike, oh, what the heck just happened?\n\n230\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:21.170\nWell, it's bringing up\nall this extra stuff.\n\n231\n00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.600\nIf you haven't used this stuff before,\n\n232\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.830\nthen I would definitely go ahead and\ntake a look at it.\n\n233\n00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:35.330\nBut, it's running that dash dash\nhelp you were talking about.\n\n234\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.070\nSo, I am going to do a DNS enumerate.\n\n235\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.650\nWhat this is going to do is\nI'm going to tell it to start\n\n236\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.495\nto look at a specific domain and\nto look at the ones underneath it.\n\n237\n00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:53.920\nYou'll notice one of\nthe options up top in there\n\n238\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.630\nsays it can even do a WhoIs lookup on\nthese things, as it's pulling them up.\n\n239\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:04.560\nYou may wanna consider do whether or\nnot that's worthwhile for you to do that.\n\n240\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.730\nBut once you do that, yeah it will puke\nout all the stuff that we had seen before,\n\n241\n00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.930\nso I'm putting a dash r in there.\n\n242\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.110\nYou can see that I can write\nthe stuff out to a file in here,\n\n243\n00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.990\nI can tell it to do\nreverse lookups in here.\n\n244\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.180\nYou'll see, where is it?\n\n245\n00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:29.793\nIf you can do this --noreverse and\nit won't do a reverse lookup for\n\n246\n00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:33.746\nyou, so that's actually kind of neat.\n\n247\n00:14:33.746 --> 00:14:36.924\n>> It might make it go a little faster, it\ndoesn't have to spend all that time trying\n\n248\n00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:38.863\nto resolve the DNS name\nfrom those IP addresses.\n\n249\n00:14:38.863 --> 00:14:44.490\n>> Yeah, it can do just a lot for you.\n\n250\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:51.880\nSo what I'll do is I'll just limit it\nto those options and this should work.\n\n251\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.970\nSo if I put in, well, let me just do www.,\n\n252\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:01.270\noh, I'll do microsoft.com,\nwhat the heck, why not?\n\n253\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.610\nSo.\n>> They don't mind.\n\n254\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.590\n>> So.\n\n255\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.770\nWhat it did here,\nit went by really quickly so\n\n256\n00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:12.400\nif you didn't catch all that just\nrewind and pause the remote.\n\n257\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.880\nI won't put you through that of course.\n\n258\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.570\nWhat I've got here is,\nthere's where the go right there.\n\n259\n00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.250\nThere's where I started my command.\n\n260\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.350\nSo it's a perl script.\n\n261\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.660\nYou can see there,\nit's actually a script that's running.\n\n262\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.950\nSo it is going from Microsoft.com.\n\n263\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.510\nWhat we have is we can see\nthat it's got some records.\n\n264\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.510\nSo there's the A records.\n\n265\n00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.003\nSo boom, we've got that.\n\n266\n00:15:41.003 --> 00:15:44.720\nYou can see the IP address,\nit is wrapping for me, so\n\n267\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.605\nthat's just a resolution thing there.\n\n268\n00:15:47.605 --> 00:15:51.323\nThere's the name servers,\nwith their IP addresses.\n\n269\n00:15:51.323 --> 00:15:52.683\nRemember what we had before.\n\n270\n00:15:52.683 --> 00:15:57.838\nWe had the name servers From a previous\nthing, and I said I was showing you some\n\n271\n00:15:57.838 --> 00:16:03.060\nof those things just so you could see\na baseline of it as well as get started.\n\n272\n00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.710\nWell, here's a way we can\nget the name servers, and\n\n273\n00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.860\nwe can get the IP addresses that go\nwith that, so we've knocked that out.\n\n274\n00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.204\nAnd so we've got that, but\n\n275\n00:16:13.204 --> 00:16:16.960\nif we go down the list we can see some\nother stuff going on with these records.\n\n276\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.840\nThere's the mail server records.\n\n277\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.060\nSo, boom.\n\n278\n00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.500\nWe've got those things their IP addresses.\n\n279\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.650\nSo we've got a target list, and\nnow here's the really cool one, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.940\nIs we get to the bottom of this\n\n281\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.410\nyou can see it saying trying a zone\ntransfers and bind versions.\n\n282\n00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:42.040\nWell, let's just kind of\ndo a little quick overview\n\n283\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.625\nof a zone transfer just to make sure\nwe're we're all on the same page with it.\n\n284\n00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:50.785\nA zone transfer is where one\nDNS server gives a copy of\n\n285\n00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:56.755\nit's database or what it's got in there\nto another one to keep it up to date.\n\n286\n00:16:56.755 --> 00:17:02.690\nSo in that zone file is the IP or\nnamed IP mappings and vice versa.\n\n287\n00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.960\nSo zone transfers are normal\npart of DNS that just happens.\n\n288\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.750\nWhat we don't want to see is we don't want\nto see a zone transfer happening to just\n\n289\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.940\nanybody that requests it.\n\n290\n00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.200\nIt should only go from one DNS\nserver to another DNS server that is\n\n291\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.570\nauthorized to have it.\n\n292\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.740\nIt shouldn't be to anyone\nelse just as they see fit.\n\n293\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.600\nIf you have that situation where\nit can go wherever it wants and\n\n294\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.260\nI find that situation exists.\n\n295\n00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.680\nI have the potential to go and\ntransfer a copy of your zone file to\n\n296\n00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.360\nmy system and we have plenty of tools that\nare designed specifically to do that.\n\n297\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.577\nAnd once they transfer that zone file,\nI can browse that zone file and\n\n298\n00:17:42.577 --> 00:17:44.650\nI have a map of your network now.\n\n299\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.340\n>> Absolutely.\n\n300\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.190\nIf you guys remember back to\neither your Microsoft training or\n\n301\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.570\nany basic network plus training, right?\n\n302\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.740\nThat DNS zone file has all\nthe host records for that network.\n\n303\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.890\nSo, that means every machines name and\nIP address both IPv4 and IPv6 has all\n\n304\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:05.370\nof your MX records, your NS, your name\nserver records, your start of authority.\n\n305\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.020\nI'm thinking all your SRV records, right?\n\n306\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.440\nWhich machines are running which services?\n\n307\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.510\nTo a bad guy,\nthat's beautiful, that is it.\n\n308\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.910\nLike you said,\nI'm mapped to the entire network.\n\n309\n00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.150\nI now know which machines I\nwanna target in future attacks.\n\n310\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.530\nSo we really gotta make sure we're\ncontrolling who's allowed to receive his\n\n311\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.535\nown transfer, and this is a good way to\ntest whether or not they've got that DNS\n\n312\n00:18:25.535 --> 00:18:28.980\nserver set up properly and and\nlimiting that appropriately.\n\n313\n00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.170\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n314\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:37.720\nSo, by doing this here,\nI've seen that we had four name servers.\n\n315\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.380\nSo, four DNS servers taking care of this\nspecific domain for Microsoft.com and\n\n316\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.310\nyou can see that all four of\nthem refused a zone transfer.\n\n317\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.660\nThey were, we attempted one or\n\n318\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.750\nthis tool attempted one and\nit got a response back of no go.\n\n319\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.340\nThat's what you want to see.\n\n320\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.710\nIt doesn't mean that those servers\naren't doing zone transfers.\n\n321\n00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.350\nIt absolutely does not mean that.\n\n322\n00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.880\nIt just means it won't do a zone\ntransfer to you and that's fine.\n\n323\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.480\nI should not have it where, just as\na random requester out here, say yeah,\n\n324\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.650\nyou want a copy of the zone files?\n\n325\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:13.940\nSure, welcome to the party.\n\n326\n00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.430\nIt should not do that.\n\n327\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.180\nSo, here I see that and\nthat's good information.\n\n328\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.700\nAlso, saves you some time\nwith stuff later on because\n\n329\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.840\nthere are other ways you can\ndo zone transfers to be sure.\n\n330\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.370\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff you can\ntype into the command line to do this.\n\n331\n00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.650\nThere are things like NS look up.\n\n332\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.280\n>> Yes.\n>> And stuff like that.\n\n333\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.410\nYou can also do port scans and\nfind out if port 53 TCP is open,\n\n334\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:44.660\nthat will tell you that the door is open\nfor a potential zone transfer situation.\n\n335\n00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.220\nBut those things,\ngetting them at that point is all well and\n\n336\n00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.120\ngood or\ndoing it at manual command line is good.\n\n337\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.560\nBut here you, boom.\n\n338\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.470\nRight away, we've seen yeah,\nwe can't do it.\n\n339\n00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.056\nWe have that information.\n\n340\n00:19:56.056 --> 00:20:01.044\nSo we know if we're looking for what is\nin those zone files, we're gonna have\n\n341\n00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:05.523\nto find another way to get it because\nthis is not gonna fly right here.\n\n342\n00:20:05.523 --> 00:20:07.239\nSo this is really good.\n\n343\n00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.186\n>> Now we know it changes the path we\nmight be going to get more information.\n\n344\n00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:12.037\nWe know zone transfer is\nnot gonna be an option.\n\n345\n00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:15.630\n>> Yeah, that's been taken\noff the table at this point.\n\n346\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:21.850\nSo you can't do it, it's telling\nyou right now this is not possible.\n\n347\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:25.860\nRight now, just with a few simple things,\nI mean you can\n\n348\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.040\nsee that DNS enum command in that\nchatroom and the one I put up here,\n\n349\n00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.880\nthat DNS enum -r and then you just put\nwhatever domain name you want in there.\n\n350\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.670\nYou can see just off of that I\nacquired quite a bit of information.\n\n351\n00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:43.070\nIt's definitely not the end all do\nall of information that's in there.\n\n352\n00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:49.256\nI mean, you can see that there are a lot\nof things that you can pull out of this.\n\n353\n00:20:49.256 --> 00:20:53.762\nI mean, you can see in here it's\ngot stuff to even go through and\n\n354\n00:20:53.762 --> 00:20:58.113\nlook at Google, it can query\nstuff through Google in there.\n\n355\n00:20:58.113 --> 00:21:00.841\nYou could adjust how long it waits for\n\n356\n00:21:00.841 --> 00:21:06.670\nsomething if you have a slow network\nperhaps, you can do quite a bit with this.\n\n357\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.050\nSo that is a pretty neat thing for\nus to have.\n\n358\n00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:15.880\nI mean, if we look at, let's see,\nlet's try just for kicks down here,\n\n359\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:22.660\nwe'll put in over here for Microsoft.\n\n360\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.550\nLet's see if we put in the -p for\nlooking up the Google stuff,\n\n361\n00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.070\nlet's see if it brings anything out for\nus.\n\n362\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.864\nWell, it didn't.\n\n363\n00:21:28.864 --> 00:21:30.586\nI guess I've got to put\nmore options in there.\n\n364\n00:21:30.586 --> 00:21:34.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I hadn't tried that one before, but\n\n365\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.750\nhey, whatever.\n\n366\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.718\nBut you can see it's got different options\nin there you can go ahead and use.\n\n367\n00:21:40.718 --> 00:21:44.480\nGot the -w that's probably not\ngoing to bring me too much.\n\n368\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.130\nAnyway, so that's DNS enum it's a very,\n\n369\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:53.950\nvery nice tool for\nyou to have in your arsenal.\n\n370\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.440\nYou just done a lot of intelligence\ngathering right there off of that.\n\n371\n00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.840\n>> Absolutely, that's a great one there.\n\n372\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.200\nSo we've got their IP address ranges,\nwe've seen how we can do ping sweeps,\n\n373\n00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.790\nwe've got our who is that we did earlier.\n\n374\n00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.961\nOf course we've got all our open source\nintelligence gathering that we've done.\n\n375\n00:22:12.961 --> 00:22:19.131\nNow we've got our DNS ENUM,\na great tool there.\n\n376\n00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:20.026\nWhat else we got here?\n\n377\n00:22:20.026 --> 00:22:24.135\nI know I've got one on your list\nthat I was unfamiliar with, POF.\n\n378\n00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:24.890\nIs that how we say that one?\n\n379\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.399\n>> Yeah, POF.\n\n380\n00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:28.984\nThis is one of the things\nI guess the hackers,\n\n381\n00:22:28.984 --> 00:22:31.238\nthey had to do the elite speak in there.\n\n382\n00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:32.422\nIt's actually P zero F.\n\n383\n00:22:32.422 --> 00:22:33.264\n>> P zero F.\n\n384\n00:22:33.264 --> 00:22:35.916\n>> So if you type POF at the command\nline it's gonna sit there and\n\n385\n00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:37.482\nbe like what are you talking about?\n\n386\n00:22:37.482 --> 00:22:39.834\nIt's like, oh P zero F, okay.\n\n387\n00:22:39.834 --> 00:22:43.816\nSo the way this works is what\nI'm gonna do is go ahead and\n\n388\n00:22:43.816 --> 00:22:47.192\nrun it, and\nthen I'm going to do some stuff and\n\n389\n00:22:47.192 --> 00:22:53.130\nshow you exactly what it's doing because\nit makes it just that much easier.\n\n390\n00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.828\nSo the way this utility works\nis I do P zero F, you do\n\n391\n00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:02.720\n-I and\nyou should remember from yesterday we were\n\n392\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.839\ntalking about the interface names, we\nwent through and did the interface names.\n\n393\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:14.000\nI went in and I did an ifconfig,\nand remember we have,\n\n394\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.740\nthere's my interface names, eth0 and\nlo for the loopback address.\n\n395\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.974\nSo, we're not going to use that one,\nthe loopback adapter, that virtual one.\n\n396\n00:23:22.974 --> 00:23:24.539\nSo I've got eth0.\n\n397\n00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:26.479\nSo what I want to do is, I have that.\n\n398\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.720\nI'm gonna put the name of the interface\nin here, I'm gonna do eth0.\n\n399\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.560\nBoom, got that right there,\nand what that's telling us,\n\n400\n00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:43.250\nit's telling this utility to listen\non the interface named eth0.\n\n401\n00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.440\nSo I go ahead and\nI start that up, and boom.\n\n402\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.730\nI get that on screen, and okay.\n\n403\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.929\nNow what?\nNothing interesting's happening right now,\n\n404\n00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:53.170\nso what's it doing?\n\n405\n00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.113\nWell, to really see what this thing's\ndoing what you gotta do is you gotta open\n\n406\n00:23:57.113 --> 00:23:59.101\nup something, like your web browser.\n\n407\n00:23:59.101 --> 00:24:03.187\nSo I'm gonna open up my web browser\nright here and it brings up this page.\n\n408\n00:24:03.187 --> 00:24:07.466\nBut this isn't really gonna help me too\nmuch cuz this page is locally hosted.\n\n409\n00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:13.849\nSo what I can do is I can do www.,\nI'll do itpro.tv.\n\n410\n00:24:13.849 --> 00:24:17.853\nI'll do that and I should be able\nto connect to it through here,\n\n411\n00:24:17.853 --> 00:24:21.290\nwhich it goes ahead and\nit's connecting to it.\n\n412\n00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.230\nOkay, so we've just proven\nthat the website's up, right?\n\n413\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.300\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.294\n>> There's more to it than that,\n\n415\n00:24:27.294 --> 00:24:29.527\nI'm not setting the bar that low.\n\n416\n00:24:29.527 --> 00:24:30.642\n>> [LAUGH] Good.\n\n417\n00:24:30.642 --> 00:24:33.769\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, what I've got here is,\n\n418\n00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:41.750\nif I look back, this is the screen where I\nwas running, the console was running p0f.\n\n419\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.040\nSo, what's happening\nis I'll go right back,\n\n420\n00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.900\nlots of DNS and num stuff,\nlet me go right there.\n\n421\n00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:56.170\nSo there's my p0f stuff\nstarting at the bottom of this.\n\n422\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:01.428\nSo if you go through this, and\nmore than likely if you're doing this\n\n423\n00:25:01.428 --> 00:25:06.360\nsort of thing, you're gonna be\npiping this out to a text file.\n\n424\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.195\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n425\n00:25:07.195 --> 00:25:11.818\n>> I didn't do that here, but\nyou could very well just dump this out to\n\n426\n00:25:11.818 --> 00:25:14.723\na text file to make it a lot easier for\nyou.\n\n427\n00:25:14.723 --> 00:25:19.357\nSo what I've got is you can\nactually see the conversation,\n\n428\n00:25:19.357 --> 00:25:23.810\nif you will, between this system and\nanother system.\n\n429\n00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:29.008\nAnd if we go over and\nlook at the IP address of my system,\n\n430\n00:25:29.008 --> 00:25:32.069\nmy system's, ends in 128.\n\n431\n00:25:32.069 --> 00:25:35.870\nIf I go back over to here,\n\n432\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:41.843\nyou can see my system is making a request\n\n433\n00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:47.280\nout to another system on port 80.\n\n434\n00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:54.460\nSo that's the ITPro server out there,\nso it's identifying the client.\n\n435\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.210\nSo, I see that, you can even see\nthe flag being set, by the way.\n\n436\n00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.160\nNotice that, the [syn] flag, so\nit's a TCP connection that's going out.\n\n437\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.390\nSo, if I keep going down the list,\nwhat do we see?\n\n438\n00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:12.680\nWe see another thing coming out\nfrom my system or down here.\n\n439\n00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.620\nI see actually the remote\nsystem down here,\n\n440\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.510\nmy system making another connection\nto the remote system down here.\n\n441\n00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.037\nAnd as you scroll through that,\nyou'll notice that there's\n\n442\n00:26:26.037 --> 00:26:30.575\ncommunication going back and\nforth between the two systems.\n\n443\n00:26:30.575 --> 00:26:31.261\nAnd p0f,\n\n444\n00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:36.530\nwhat it's doing is it's actually looking\nat the traffic as it goes by passively.\n\n445\n00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.680\nIt's basically a kind of sniffer.\n\n446\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.380\nAnd so, it's looking at\ntraffic going back and forth.\n\n447\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.380\nBut instead of actually displaying\nlike the raw traffic and\n\n448\n00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.280\nall the stuff that's inside there,\nit's formatting it and telling you hey,\n\n449\n00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.560\nthis is based on what I see and\nwhat I know from my own database.\n\n450\n00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.602\nNotice, and you can still see\nit on the top of my screen.\n\n451\n00:26:57.602 --> 00:27:03.481\nYou can notice that it has it there,\nit says loaded 320 signatures from p0f.fp.\n\n452\n00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.570\nIt's got that, and\nit's saying it's listening on this one and\n\n453\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:09.610\nit's ready to go.\n\n454\n00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.452\nSo what it's doing is when it\nsees that traffic come by,\n\n455\n00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:15.838\nit's looking at it and saying,\nokay, that traffic as it goes by,\n\n456\n00:27:15.838 --> 00:27:18.873\nI am finger printing with what I know and\nwhat I have on file.\n\n457\n00:27:18.873 --> 00:27:22.589\nAnd it's saying, boom,\nthis is what I know that is.\n\n458\n00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:23.494\n>> Nice.\n\n459\n00:27:23.494 --> 00:27:25.186\n>> So, that's where it's getting that,\n\n460\n00:27:25.186 --> 00:27:28.250\nit's telling you this is exactly\nwhat the operating system is.\n\n461\n00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.410\nSo as you keep going through,\nand it's not gonna be 100%.\n\n462\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.770\nI mean,\nthere's something where it says the OS,\n\n463\n00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.320\nit's got question marks there,\nit doesn't know what that is.\n\n464\n00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.350\nThat very well could happen,\nbut there you see,\n\n465\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.580\nthere's something going\nright from my browser.\n\n466\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.170\nWhat I see down there, that is more than\njust a, the requests we saw earlier,\n\n467\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.460\nwhere it had the raw stuff down there and\nsome whatever after it.\n\n468\n00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.790\nThat's the actual browser\nsending out a request.\n\n469\n00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.000\nYou can see it's a http request.\n\n470\n00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.690\nAnd if I look at that, down there you can\nsee user, agent, information, language.\n\n471\n00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.096\nYou can see a bunch of stuff\nin here that it's telling you.\n\n472\n00:28:07.096 --> 00:28:13.350\nIt's telling you information about\nthat specific browser, such as it is.\n\n473\n00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.870\n>> And it continues to listen the whole\ntime, while you've got that running.\n\n474\n00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.480\nSo as you go to different web pages,\nthat information just keeps scrolling by.\n\n475\n00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.460\n>> Yeah, you keep going out,\ndoing your stuff.\n\n476\n00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:27.230\nAnd by the way, it doesn't even have to\nbe just web pages, it can be anything.\n\n477\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.820\nAny type of traffic that moves over\nthat interface while that's listening,\n\n478\n00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.815\nit will fingerprint it, or\nat least attempt to fingerprint it.\n\n479\n00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.191\n>> So if I go to a file server, email or\n\n480\n00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:39.265\nsomething like that,\nthat would be there as well.\n\n481\n00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:40.550\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n482\n00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.882\nIf you were to transfer a file back and\nforth or something like that,\n\n483\n00:28:44.882 --> 00:28:49.062\nit would try to identify that traffic\nas it goes back and forth, so\n\n484\n00:28:49.062 --> 00:28:52.111\nyou're just seeing\nthe results of all of that.\n\n485\n00:28:52.111 --> 00:28:54.996\nI mean, heck, even look on here,\nif you scroll through and\n\n486\n00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:58.719\nstart taking a look at it, it's even\nbringing up stuff like up time in here.\n\n487\n00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:01.610\nI mean, 17 hours, 18 minutes,\n\n488\n00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:06.290\nit's got those types of things\nall going right on through.\n\n489\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.940\nThere's another browser request,\nanother browser request.\n\n490\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.645\nI can't say I've ever seen\na parameter called dishonest, but-\n\n491\n00:29:13.645 --> 00:29:14.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n492\n00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:14.990\n>> It says that.\n\n493\n00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.635\nWouldn't it be great if\nthe real world was like that?\n\n494\n00:29:17.635 --> 00:29:20.700\n>> Yeah, right,\n[LAUGH] it's called the Scarlet Letter.\n\n495\n00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.629\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n496\n00:29:21.629 --> 00:29:24.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n497\n00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.229\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you're seeing right there,\n\n498\n00:29:27.229 --> 00:29:28.710\nI mean it's just going right through this.\n\n499\n00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:34.620\nThis is just essentially a log\nof our communication process.\n\n500\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.520\nYou can see stuff back and forth, back and\nforth, back and forth, back and forth.\n\n501\n00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.630\nI mean there's some [syn+ack]s going, so\n\n502\n00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.400\nwe're seeing the three-way\nhandshake in play.\n\n503\n00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.120\nThere's the response.\n\n504\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.058\nI mean, so just a really neat utility,\nand I didn't really do much.\n\n505\n00:29:50.058 --> 00:29:57.150\nI mean notice, just typed it out,\nstarted it up and opened up a browser.\n\n506\n00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.590\nTyped in an address and\nflipped back over and had what I want.\n\n507\n00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.760\nYou don't have to do anything\nreally other than that.\n\n508\n00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.500\n>> Except stop it.\n\n509\n00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.269\nHow do we stop once we got it gong there?\n\n510\n00:30:07.269 --> 00:30:08.494\n>> Ctrl+C.\n\n511\n00:30:08.494 --> 00:30:09.031\n>> Oh, there we go, good.\n\n512\n00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:10.748\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK] too.\n\n513\n00:30:10.748 --> 00:30:12.751\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah that's a good thing,\n\n514\n00:30:12.751 --> 00:30:13.670\nreboot the system.\n\n515\n00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.112\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n516\n00:30:15.112 --> 00:30:18.159\nAll right, then you got another\none on the list called dnswalk?\n\n517\n00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.330\n>> Yeah, that's another one\nthat we have available to us,\n\n518\n00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.140\nand let me do a, well,\nlet me clear that out.\n\n519\n00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:33.880\nSo, if you do a dnswalk on here, so what\nit's gonna do is, you can see in here.\n\n520\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.180\nSo, I just went ahead,\nyou can pull it off the menu if you want.\n\n521\n00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.740\nI just went ahead and did it the simple\nway, since it's already here.\n\n522\n00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.140\nYou can do dnswalk,\nyou can see the format of it.\n\n523\n00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.670\nYou do dnswalk and then you put\nin a domain name in after that.\n\n524\n00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:52.107\nSo once you type in the domain name,\n\n525\n00:30:52.107 --> 00:30:57.502\nit should just pop right back up,\nnot bring it up for me.\n\n526\n00:30:57.502 --> 00:30:59.420\n>> It wants that-\n>> Oh, there we go, yeah.\n\n527\n00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.233\nThat's right,\nthis is the one that always screws me up.\n\n528\n00:31:01.233 --> 00:31:05.060\n>> the truly, fully qualified domain name\nwith that dot at the end of the name.\n\n529\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.760\nIt's gonna be really picky about that.\n\n530\n00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.340\n>> Yeah this is one of those ones,\nit gets me on this a lot.\n\n531\n00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.556\nAnd all the time it gets me on this,\nit tells you, right, it's like,\n\n532\n00:31:12.556 --> 00:31:14.868\nwell that's the right one, idiot,\nand I don't know what's going on.\n\n533\n00:31:14.868 --> 00:31:20.120\nOh the dot, no one thinks about that so-\n>> It told me what to do and\n\n534\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.060\nI still didn't put it in.\n\n535\n00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.233\nAnd I see error and\nI'm like, oh yeah, okay.\n\n536\n00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:26.246\n[LAUGH]\n>> So what we're seeing here is,\n\n537\n00:31:26.246 --> 00:31:30.421\nyou're seeing some of the same type of\nstuff I did previously with DNS and num,\n\n538\n00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:32.840\nbut this is just a much\ntighter version of it.\n\n539\n00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.270\nSo if you just need the CFU,\nif your able to transfer something,\n\n540\n00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.180\nthis could be a way to accomplish that.\n\n541\n00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.074\n>> Or to verify results when\nwe've got that other tool-\n\n542\n00:31:42.074 --> 00:31:42.855\n>> Yeah, you can do it that way too.\n\n543\n00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:44.527\n>> So you can always just try and\nrun two different tools, yeah.\n\n544\n00:31:44.527 --> 00:31:49.427\nYeah, so we've confirmed\nthat we definitely cannot do\n\n545\n00:31:49.427 --> 00:31:52.460\na zone transfer with this domain.\n\n546\n00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.897\nBut who knows,\nyou could go some place else and find it.\n\n547\n00:31:56.897 --> 00:32:01.113\nThere's nothing saying that we can't\nfind a zone transfer someplace,\n\n548\n00:32:01.113 --> 00:32:02.366\nit's not uncommon.\n\n549\n00:32:02.366 --> 00:32:09.294\nIf I typed in something like\njust some Random stuff in here.\n\n550\n00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:13.375\nWhen I type in www.usatoday.com, and\n\n551\n00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:17.100\nit went ahead and refused it as well.\n\n552\n00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:24.740\nBut don't be surprised,\nif you do see that being available.\n\n553\n00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.990\nI would tell ya,\nwe're randomly doing it here.\n\n554\n00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.840\nBut if you in your initial recon stuff,\n\n555\n00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.760\nyou had found a Windows 2000 system,\nwhich they are out there.\n\n556\n00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.620\nYou find a Windows 2000 system.\n\n557\n00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.200\nIt's not uncommon, or\nit wasn't uncommon to see those systems,\n\n558\n00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.010\nwhere zone transfers,\nanybody that requested it, was configured.\n\n559\n00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.670\n>> Yeah\n>> So if you see that,\n\n560\n00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.160\nI might very well just make a leap\nof faith here for a second,\n\n561\n00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.090\nand go let's see if I can do a zone\ntransfer, it might very well work.\n\n562\n00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.850\nIt wasn't til 2003 and later, that\nMicrosoft made the default, to only go to\n\n563\n00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.330\nspecific ones, and not just hey, you ask\nand you'll receive, and they changed it.\n\n564\n00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:13.660\nSo it's that little bit of knowledge,\nagain, to hit that whole\n\n565\n00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.190\nplatform knowledge that is so vital for\nus to do pen testing successfully.\n\n566\n00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.880\nThat's one of those old details\nthat's really gonna get you mileage.\n\n567\n00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.020\nYou can say, oh, well if that's there,\nlet me try this.\n\n568\n00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.440\nWho knows, maybe the person was smart\nabout it, and turned that option off.\n\n569\n00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.571\nBut, it's also just as\nlikely that they didn't,\n\n570\n00:33:30.571 --> 00:33:33.160\nbecause it wasn't something\nthat you really thought about.\n\n571\n00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.951\n>> Absolutely, or some lazy admin\ncan't get his DNS transfers to work\n\n572\n00:33:36.951 --> 00:33:38.693\nbetween authorized servers.\n\n573\n00:33:38.693 --> 00:33:42.492\nAnd he just says, I'm just gonna turn this\nallowed zone transfers to any server on,\n\n574\n00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:45.325\nand try to fix the problem, and\nthen forget to turn it back off or\n\n575\n00:33:45.325 --> 00:33:47.810\njust think that's the way\nyou're supposed to fix it.\n\n576\n00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.448\nSo, definitely worth a try,\n\n577\n00:33:49.448 --> 00:33:53.305\ncuz you could gain a whole lot\nof information, if it does work.\n\n578\n00:33:53.305 --> 00:33:55.970\n>> And that's another good point.\n\n579\n00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:01.300\nNot only would they have never touched it,\nin some cases, and just left it on.\n\n580\n00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.400\nThere's also the ones that, I do\nrecall in some cases people would try.\n\n581\n00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.770\nThey couldn't get it working, and\nwhen it would just go to specific ones.\n\n582\n00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.073\nSo they said just turn it\non when it requests, and\n\n583\n00:34:11.073 --> 00:34:14.959\nit works all the sudden magically, and\nthey're like I don't wanna mess with it.\n\n584\n00:34:14.959 --> 00:34:16.474\nIt works, I'll leave it alone.\n>> Yeah, don't touch it if it's working.\n\n585\n00:34:16.474 --> 00:34:17.898\n[LAUGH]\n>> And they're not thinking\n\n586\n00:34:17.898 --> 00:34:19.330\nabout there's that.\n\n587\n00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.610\nThere's that other side of things,\nthat you just open it up for everybody.\n\n588\n00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:28.650\nAnd just remember little,\ngot yous, like that.\n\n589\n00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n590\n00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.770\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\n\n591\n00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.690\na lot of great information on\ninformation gathering, right?\n\n592\n00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.700\nDoing our recon process,\na lot of cool tools there.\n\n593\n00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:44.070\nWe looked at fping, and DNS ENUM, and\nwell, POF and DNS walks, so a lot of cool\n\n594\n00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.330\ntools that I can start using to help me\nwith that reconnaissance process, right?\n\n595\n00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.330\nGather all that information.\n\n596\n00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.340\nWell, looking at the clock,\nwe're about out of time for\n\n597\n00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.860\nthis episode, but don't fret.\n\n598\n00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.640\nWe've got more information\ngathering episodes coming your way.\n\n599\n00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.950\nWe're gonna take a look at gathering\ninformation about web servers, right?\n\n600\n00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.760\nThat public presence that\nalmost every company has,\n\n601\n00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.580\nit's gotta be a good\nsource of information.\n\n602\n00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.030\nSo we're gonna take a look at some of the\ntools that we can use to get that info.\n\n603\n00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.320\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n604\n00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.388\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n605\n00:35:14.388 --> 00:35:15.711\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n606\n00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:22.260\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.663\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:18.930\nHow are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.790\n>> I'm feeling pretty good,\nhow are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.010\n>> I'm doing really well,\nthanks for asking.\n\n7\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.640\nWe're here at ITProTV doing another\nepisode on our Linux series, and in\n\n8\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.450\nparticular in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at website reconnaissance.\n\n9\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.280\nSo I'm thinking,\n\n10\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.220\nSean, just from that title,\nthat we're gonna be looking to see what\n\n11\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.890\nkind of information we can gather from\nsomebody's website that they're hosting.\n\n12\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.350\n>> Yes, that's exactly right.\n\n13\n00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.830\nAnd is that we're looking\nat that point to see, well,\n\n14\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.790\nwhat is available on someone's site.\n\n15\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.210\nWhat can we potentially\ngather from that site.\n\n16\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.525\nAnd remember, the website may very\nwell be the entry point that you're\n\n17\n00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:03.320\ngonna have into that organization,\nwhatever or whoever it is.\n\n18\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.180\nThat's the public face\nof the organization,\n\n19\n00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.126\nthat's where they want\nto share information.\n\n20\n00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:13.414\nAnd it also consequently happens to be,\nwith all the web applications and\n\n21\n00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:18.324\nstuff that are out there, and how complex\nthese things can be that it's not uncommon\n\n22\n00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:23.360\nfor the things to be misconfigured or\nhave some sort of screw up in there.\n\n23\n00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.570\nAnd that's what you're trying to prey on.\n\n24\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.820\nAnd we have plenty of tools that\nhelp us find those weaknesses,\n\n25\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.870\nor at least get us down the right path.\n\n26\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.100\nAnd so that's what we're doing.\n\n27\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.850\nWe're trying at least to start mapping the\nthing out first and make note of things.\n\n28\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.510\nAnd then the next step would be,\nin a later step would be exploiting those.\n\n29\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.240\n>> Yeah, these new web servers can be\na real good source of information as you\n\n30\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.390\nsaid, Misconfigure them, I mean they have\nto be available to the public, right?\n\n31\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.130\nBecause we want what most web sites,\nanyway we public to come to them and\n\n32\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.950\nbuy our product or find out about\nour company, The question is,\n\n33\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.050\nhow much information are they\ngiving up on that web server,\n\n34\n00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.610\nbecause a lot of time admins\ndon't do things properly.\n\n35\n00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.985\nThey take shortcuts or they're just\nunaware that the web server has given up\n\n36\n00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:09.571\nsome of this information, and with these\ntools that you're gonna show us Sean,\n\n37\n00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.387\nwe're gonna find it if they\nhaven't taken care of it, right?\n\n38\n00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:16.710\n>> Exactly, and think about this just for\na moment, by the way.\n\n39\n00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.200\nThis is something I'd said\nbefore in other places.\n\n40\n00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.070\nBut remember,\nwhen you look at web servers nowadays,\n\n41\n00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.170\nwhen they're used, a lot of times it's\na case of where you install something,\n\n42\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.180\nand that requires the Web server,\nat least in the case of Microsoft,\n\n43\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.990\nwhich there are a ton of those out there,\nof course.\n\n44\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.360\nIn the case of Microsoft,\nit says well you install this product,\n\n45\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.290\nthis product requires the web server.\n\n46\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.540\nIt checks in all the boxes for you that\nit needs, and it shoves it on there.\n\n47\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.060\nAnd that's it.\n\n48\n00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.540\nThe person that is installing this\nproduct that requires the web service is,\n\n49\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.120\noh yeah if you need it go ahead and\ninstall it.\n\n50\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.520\nAll their concern was\nthis product over here.\n\n51\n00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.290\nThey're not concerned with the web server.\n\n52\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.020\nThey'll let this product manage\nthe web server for them.\n\n53\n00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.260\nCuz the product's not concerned with\nsecuring, it's concerned I need the work.\n\n54\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.340\nIt's looking to you to do that.\n\n55\n00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.300\nAnd that's where you get within this\n\n56\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.610\nintimate knowledge of how web servers\nwork and the little do's and don'ts.\n\n57\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.910\nI'm starting to find that it's almost\nkind of like a lost body of knowledge for\n\n58\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.630\nthe most part.\n\n59\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.790\nIt's getting to be forgotten because\nother things are handling it.\n\n60\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.710\n>> It is so common to see just about\nall these different applications\n\n61\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.820\nthat you install have that dependency.\n\n62\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.120\nA lot of the roles, for example, in a\nMicrosoft World have a dependency on IIS.\n\n63\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.460\nAnd so, as you said, these admins\nare installing these other roles.\n\n64\n00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.460\nIt's got an IIS dependency, so it throws\nthat on in the background, but they've\n\n65\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.870\nnever once go into that IIS management\nconsole and do anything to secure it.\n\n66\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.960\nAs long as the application or\n\n67\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.740\nrole that they need is working properly,\nthat's all they really care about.\n\n68\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.260\n>> Yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.710\nThat's exactly right.\n\n70\n00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.070\nI mean,\nyou probably know people that do that.\n\n71\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.265\nI mean, hopefully,\nthe person you know isn't you.\n\n72\n00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:54.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> that does that but\n\n73\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.380\npeople out that install those things.\n\n74\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.549\nThey get something like a SharePoint,\nwhen they think about it and\n\n75\n00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.565\nit's all SharePoint and\nSharePoint requires the web server.\n\n76\n00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:07.111\nAnd all they do is they go through the\ncheck list, say we need this, this, and\n\n77\n00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:08.858\nthis, and then install SharePoint,\n\n78\n00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:11.716\nand then let SharePoint handle\neverything from there on out.\n\n79\n00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:16.603\nAnd so, in fact, SharePoint is one of\nthose products that even has listed some\n\n80\n00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:19.565\nof the documents that\nMicrosoft puts out says,\n\n81\n00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:24.697\ndon't manage the system through IS,\nmanage through the share point interface.\n\n82\n00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:29.669\nThat's not to mean that you shouldn't take\nsome of the security precautions that\n\n83\n00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.330\nyou would anyway.\n\n84\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.820\nIt's just saying SharePoint isn't managed\nthrough here, it's managed through here.\n\n85\n00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.660\n>> For the Share Point site,\nuse that Share Point [INAUDIBLE]\n\n86\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.310\n>> Of course.\n\n87\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.155\n>> But you still have a server in the\nbackground Another one that I always think\n\n88\n00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:46.775\nof, Sean, is WSUS, the Windows Server\nUpdate Services, it's all HTML based or\n\n89\n00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:50.285\nHTTP based, and that's one that will\nthrow that web server on there, and\n\n90\n00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:52.165\nyou might not even know you're\nrunning it in the background,\n\n91\n00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:54.305\nif you're not paying attention\nto what you're doing.\n\n92\n00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:56.485\n>> Yeah, certificate services,\nyou can go on and on and\n\n93\n00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:59.930\non and on,\nthere's lots of them that do that, And\n\n94\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.860\nyou really gotta be aware that that's\nsomething that's getting put out there\n\n95\n00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.220\nbecause it's starting to be kind of\njust installed as a matter of fact,\n\n96\n00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.400\nit's not something that you're making\nthis conscious decision anymore.\n\n97\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.380\nThat's part of the reason\nwhy you get this, well,\n\n98\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.830\nI don't know how to manage the web server,\nI don't need to care care,\n\n99\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.950\nsomething else is doing it something\nelse isn't doing all the management.\n\n100\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.730\nIt's taking care of its end of things.\n\n101\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.400\nYou still need to be on your\n\n102\n00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.440\ngame to make sure things are getting\ndone the way they are supposed to.\n\n103\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.980\nSo don't be surprised if the tools\nthat we see plus other ones,\n\n104\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.630\nreveal stuff that may make you feel\nuncomfortable that you found it.\n\n105\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.010\nBut, of course, you want to find it and\nnot someone else.\n\n106\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.910\n>> Right, yeah, and not just Microsoft.\n\n107\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.130\nYou know, IIS being one.\n\n108\n00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.860\nBut Apache, the same way, right?\n\n109\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.630\nIf you're gonna go install that on\na Linux server to support something else,\n\n110\n00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.930\ndon't forget that you have\nto secure that web server.\n\n111\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.380\nSo what kind of tools we got here, Sean?\n\n112\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.350\nWhat's gonna give us, how do we go about\ngetting information about this website?\n\n113\n00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.810\nI can visit their webpage.\n\n114\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.720\nWe know from our previous episodes and\neven back into CEH,\n\n115\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.620\nthere's a lot of information\nI can get a lot of times,\n\n116\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.660\nright off of the website itself because,\npeople put way too much info on there.\n\n117\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.650\nBut now we wanna go a little\nbit deeper and we wanna say,\n\n118\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.600\nwhat kind information is back there\nthat they might not think we can get to.\n\n119\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.700\nI know we got some tools to do that.\n\n120\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.490\n>> Yeah.\nWe do have a kind of a laundry list of\n\n121\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.180\ntools.\n\n122\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.010\nAnd to think about it for a moment,\nthe type of stuff we already have already\n\n123\n00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.250\ngetting to this point, if you look at\nsome of the tools that we did just in our\n\n124\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.080\nprevious segment, P0F It was able to ID,\n\n125\n00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.780\non the communications, it was able\nto ID what the remote system was.\n\n126\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.250\nIt has the capability of doing that so\n\n127\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.770\nthat's giving us something\nabout the system.\n\n128\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.470\nIf we look at the results a little closer\nfrom previous things we can see the agent\n\n129\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.760\nstrings and stuff like that.\n\n130\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.650\nAnd that will give us information\nabout what's being exchanged.\n\n131\n00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.400\nWe're already starting to kind of fill in\nsome of those things with the web server.\n\n132\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.830\nWe just haven't directly targeted it yet.\n\n133\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.930\nWe've got things like IP addresses.\n\n134\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.620\nWe've got things like\ndifferent types of records.\n\n135\n00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.920\nWe've got a lot of stuff.\n\n136\n00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.300\nWe just haven't really turned\nour attention fully towards\n\n137\n00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.580\ngaining information out of that website,\nso that's what we gotta do.\n\n138\n00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.080\nAnd so, the question is, specifically,\n\n139\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.560\nwhat types of things should you be doing\nor expect to be doing at this point?\n\n140\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.480\nWell one of them that is done that people\ndo like doing is mirroring the website.\n\n141\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.760\nNow if you're on the Windows side, you've\ngot utilities like Black Widow, for one.\n\n142\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.115\nThat's one that you can just go ahead and\nXerox, as I like to say.\n\n143\n00:07:40.115 --> 00:07:40.650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A website.\n\n144\n00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.500\nBring it down to your local system,\nand start browsing it.\n\n145\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.435\nBut there are other ways to do that,\n\n146\n00:07:46.435 --> 00:07:49.532\nyou don't have to have that\nBlackWidow utility to do it,\n\n147\n00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:54.190\nor you don't have to have one of the other\nGUI-based tools you installed in Windows.\n\n148\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:59.819\nYou have these other ones One of the ones\nthat we have available right in Linux,\n\n149\n00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:04.083\nnot native to Kali,\njust Linux period, that's useful for\n\n150\n00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.000\nmirroring a website is one called Wget.\n\n151\n00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.442\nWget is a way of pulling down content.\n\n152\n00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:14.741\nIn this case,\nwe're gonna be pulling it from a website.\n\n153\n00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:18.934\nAnd what I have here is,\nI have up on my screen,\n\n154\n00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:23.275\nI have a shot of Wget with\nthe switches in there.\n\n155\n00:08:23.275 --> 00:08:24.695\nAaron, I'll let you look up the switches.\n\n156\n00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:25.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n157\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.110\nnot gonna worry about going\nthrough all of those.\n\n158\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.870\nBut what we're gonna do is,\nI have Wget and\n\n159\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.590\nthen I'm gonna put the domain\nname in at the end.\n\n160\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:38.670\nAnd the domain name I put in, and\nI'll choose a domain to put in here.\n\n161\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.120\nWhat I'd like to do is I'd like to try\n\n162\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.140\na domain that I know is probably\nnot gonna generate a lot of stuff.\n\n163\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.780\nI don't wanna go and point it out\nto some large website, not for\n\n164\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.830\nthis, because I don't wanna\nhave it take a long time.\n\n165\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.680\nI think I could probably do\nthe ITPro website right now.\n\n166\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.510\nWhat this is gonna do is it's just\ngonna make a bunch of requests and\n\n167\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.600\npull down the actual content.\n\n168\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.430\nI will tell when you looking\nat that Wget command,\n\n169\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.870\npay close attention to\nwhat's going on there.\n\n170\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.640\nThis is one of the gotchas that\n\n171\n00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.795\nwe have in Linux that you don't\nhave necessarily in Windows.\n\n172\n00:09:15.795 --> 00:09:19.615\nWindows does have it to a certain degree,\nbut it's kind of inconsistent.\n\n173\n00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:23.050\nIf you look at that Wget command\nnotice there is some stuff\n\n174\n00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.698\nin there that's uppercase too.\n\n175\n00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:31.040\nUppercase and lowercase are not the same\nthings in the Linux operating system.\n\n176\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.760\nSo if you've got one or the other,\nit means two different things.\n\n177\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.570\nAnd look how easily that\ncould mess you up right here.\n\n178\n00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.890\nYou've got K in there twice.\n\n179\n00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.080\nBoth those Ks mean something different.\n\n180\n00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.310\nThey don't mean,\nit's not me saying the same thing twice.\n\n181\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.755\nIt's not stuttering or something there.\n\n182\n00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:49.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's got a lowercase and an uppercase.\n\n183\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.540\nIt's two different things, so\n\n184\n00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.420\ndo pay attention to that when\nyou're doing anything in Linux.\n\n185\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.150\nIf you do not get the result that you\nwant, and you're getting frustrated\n\n186\n00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.640\nat doing something,\nmake sure you've got the case right.\n\n187\n00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.505\nThat's one of the first things\nI tell people to check.\n\n188\n00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:04.345\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah,\n\n189\n00:10:04.345 --> 00:10:07.350\nbecause it's an easy thing to screw up on.\n\n190\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.360\n>> It is.\nYeah, I'm from a Windows world and\n\n191\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.360\ncase never seems to matter when\nyou're at the command prompt.\n\n192\n00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.770\nBut in a Linux environment,\nit definitely is.\n\n193\n00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.520\nA lot of those switches are reused because\nthere's so many different options, so\n\n194\n00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.290\nthey'll use like you see here.\n\n195\n00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.650\nLowercase k means one thing, an uppercase\nK means something completely different.\n\n196\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.136\nYou gotta pay attention to that.\n\n197\n00:10:26.136 --> 00:10:29.648\n>> Yeah, the problem with it,\nif you come from a Windows world,\n\n198\n00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:34.555\nis that where they really messed you up is\nthey're just really inconsistent with it.\n\n199\n00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:36.830\nIs that you'll look at stuff like netstat.\n\n200\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.510\nNetstat's got a lowercase A and\na uppercase A, but there's plenty of other\n\n201\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.690\ncases in the system that don't\ncare about the case at all.\n\n202\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.450\nSo, it's like they enforce it in\nsome places and not the other.\n\n203\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.540\nHere, it's on Linux, Unix, any of those,\n\n204\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.030\nit's all enforced,\nit doesn't mean the same thing.\n\n205\n00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.630\nSo you're gonna have to maybe\n\n206\n00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.980\npart with some old habits that you\ndeveloped when you come over to Linux.\n\n207\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.480\nSo any case what I have\nis I put that up there.\n\n208\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.760\nAnd will do is I will hit enter.\n\n209\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:14.130\nAnd what it's doing is it's gonna go\nout and look at the ITPro website.\n\n210\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.760\nAnd it did a quick thing.\n\n211\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.710\nIt did a quick deal with it.\n\n212\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.840\nAnd looks like it pulled down just\nthe index page and didn't take it long.\n\n213\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.025\nIt downloaded one file and that was it.\n\n214\n00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:31.000\nA reason why it probably did that is that\nyou've gone through and you're here so\n\n215\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.250\nyou've gone through the ITPro website.\n\n216\n00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:39.820\nIt's some of those ones I'm presuming\nare dynamically generated or using some\n\n217\n00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.130\nserver side technology like PHP,\nsomething like that,\n\n218\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.398\nor Active Server Page, something like\nthat, they're using on of those.\n\n219\n00:11:49.398 --> 00:11:52.830\nThose things,\nWget's going to have trouble getting\n\n220\n00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.890\nthose because those are dynamically\ngenerated when they're requested.\n\n221\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.780\nSo don't expect those things to come down.\n\n222\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.360\nSo if you have a website,\nyou're clicking around and\n\n223\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.130\nyou clearly see a lot of pages,\nwell, you see all these pages.\n\n224\n00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.067\nThose pages may not actually exist.\n\n225\n00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:13.740\nThey may be created dynamically out of\na database someplace, or off query.\n\n226\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.860\nIt confuses people all the time.\n\n227\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.610\nI think back when I used to do my\nSharePoint classes a long time ago.\n\n228\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.851\nYou would get people that weren't\nused to that type of system.\n\n229\n00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:30.691\nAnd they would move to SharePoint and\nthey'd have a problem with the way\n\n230\n00:12:30.691 --> 00:12:34.150\nsomething looked and they said,\nwhere are those pages stored?\n\n231\n00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.780\nAnd you'd have to tell them that's not\nthe way it works, you have to explain it.\n\n232\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.770\nIt's like,\nwell it has to be stored someplace.\n\n233\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.700\nIt's like,\nthat's not the way it works, you know?\n\n234\n00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.110\nYou had to really get into it, and\n\n235\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.010\nbecause it was just so foreign to them,\nno matter how many times you explained it\n\n236\n00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.150\nthey were used to having static web pages\nwith some scripts on the client side.\n\n237\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.630\nThey weren't used to them having\na database that pulled those things out of\n\n238\n00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.410\nthere and generated stuff off of that.\n\n239\n00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:03.780\nSo, that would cause confusion.\n\n240\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.550\nNow, if you have that type of site and\n\n241\n00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.225\nyou use a tool like this,\nthis is exactly what I expect to see.\n\n242\n00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.645\nCuz I have dynamically generated webpages.\n\n243\n00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:17.574\nI got one page, and\nif I was to go over to my home folder I\n\n244\n00:13:17.574 --> 00:13:21.629\nwould see in my home folder,\nyou would see,\n\n245\n00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:26.573\nhere's the IT Pro website,\nor what I did off of that.\n\n246\n00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.090\nAnd it's just got\na couple things in there.\n\n248\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.760\nIt's got the original,\na copy of the HTML page, and that's it.\n\n249\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.530\nOkay.\nIn fact,\n\n250\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.240\nthe reason why it's got two\nis one of the switches in\n\n251\n00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.450\nthere says to download one\nthat's been altered to\n\n252\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.340\npoint to it if there was like\ngraphic files embedded in there.\n\n253\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.970\nIt will alter it so it points to\nthe graphic files that it pulled down and\n\n254\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.270\nstored in your hard drive.\n\n255\n00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.900\nThe other one is just the original\none that says where everything\n\n256\n00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.610\noriginally was when it was sitting\nout there on the server someplace.\n\n257\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.620\nBut that's all that is.\n\n258\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.497\nWe're seeing some pages there, boom, done.\n\n259\n00:14:03.497 --> 00:14:08.829\nAnd that's a very, very effective,\nvery simple way to Xerox a website,\n\n260\n00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:11.910\nor mirror a website, as they call it.\n\n261\n00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.640\nOnce you've downloaded that,\n\n262\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.920\nyou can start looking through it to\nsee what type of content's there.\n\n263\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.680\nYou can start scraping stuff out of\na website that may not even be linked,\n\n264\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.702\nin some cases, using Wget.\n\n265\n00:14:24.702 --> 00:14:26.740\nAnd Wget, by the way,\nis not the only way to do this.\n\n266\n00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.550\nThere are other tools that are used\nto harvest stuff out of a website\n\n267\n00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.470\nthat will gather stuff that's\nnot linked in anywhere.\n\n268\n00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.130\nIt will just go through and\nlook at a website and say,\n\n269\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.490\nokay, tell me what you want to look for,\nor I'll look for everything.\n\n270\n00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.510\nAnd it'll just go right on through and\nboom, got it.\n\n271\n00:14:46.857 --> 00:14:48.241\n>> All right.\n>> All right, so\n\n272\n00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:51.275\nthat is mirroring the website.\n\n273\n00:14:51.275 --> 00:14:54.830\nSo, if that was successful\nwe've got a copy of\n\n274\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.120\nthe website that we can dig through.\n\n275\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.015\nYou might be looking for comments and\nstuff like that, so we've got that done.\n\n276\n00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:05.300\nThe question is now that we're done with\nthat, and what's the next thing to do?\n\n277\n00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.277\nSo, we move on to\nthe next command on here.\n\n278\n00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:14.760\nSo what was the next one\nI had on my list here?\n\n279\n00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.050\n>> Oh, let's see here, I got,\nLBD or IVD administer.\n\n280\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.210\n>> LBD, okay.\n\n281\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:29.330\n>> All right so let me show you\nthat one is LBD what that one does.\n\n282\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.434\nOkay.\nWell, let's just for a second back up and\n\n283\n00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:40.800\ntalk about what we had when we looked at\nour records back in our previous segments.\n\n284\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.090\nWe looked at our records,\nremember we went to our who is.\n\n285\n00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.439\nOur who is, we had those two IP\naddresses for Microsoft.com.\n\n286\n00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:50.910\nOkay?\n>> Mm-hm\n\n287\n00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.310\n>> That's a concern of ours.\n\n288\n00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.960\nNow we know, like I said,\nfrom previous experience, we know that.\n\n289\n00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:02.230\nThat's a load balance situation, there's\nnot just some crazy thing going on.\n\n290\n00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:07.060\nThere's two servers, or\ntwo IP addresses, but they're going\n\n291\n00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.550\nthrough a load balance so it can deal\nwith the volume and all that good stuff.\n\n292\n00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.230\nOkay, so\nprior experience we know that's there.\n\n293\n00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:20.320\nBut if we take out that prior experience\nand we're not sure at this point, or\n\n294\n00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.390\nwe might be a little confused if\nthere's load balancing going on,\n\n295\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.990\nthat's where you have this thing called,\nthe lbd.\n\n296\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.170\nLbd is short for load balancing detector,\n\n297\n00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.025\nwhich if you entered in,\nyou can tell exactly what it does.\n\n298\n00:16:35.025 --> 00:16:36.587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hm, what does load balancing\n\n299\n00:16:36.587 --> 00:16:37.870\ndetector do?\n\n300\n00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.740\nSo anyway, what you do is you do lbd, and\n\n301\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:48.210\nthen what you do is you type in a name or\nan IP address, you can type that in.\n\n302\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.090\nAnd you go ahead and\nhit Enter on that, and what this does,\n\n303\n00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.180\nyou can see it scanning that site.\n\n304\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.240\nAnd look how quick it is,\nit tells you right away, looking for\n\n305\n00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.930\nDNS load balancing.\n\n306\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.270\nFound, boom, found it right there.\n\n307\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.460\n>> Nice.\n>> And it's still checking for\n\n308\n00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.130\nsome other stuff.\n\n309\n00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.350\nIt's checking for HTTP, to see if it's got\nany load balancing going on there Now,\n\n310\n00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.280\nnotice that it says in kind\nof the disclaimer up top,\n\n311\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.520\nit says it's a proof of concept,\nmight get false positives.\n\n312\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.850\nBut, again,\nthat's why you double check this stuff.\n\n313\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.620\nSome of these sayings, I mean,\nat least this guy's telling you that.\n\n314\n00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.000\nSome of these people wrote some\nof these tools in the Linux side,\n\n315\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.865\nthey wrote it just as kind of something\nthat they did way back when or whatever,\n\n316\n00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:32.490\nand they've never maintained,\nor updated it.\n\n317\n00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.747\nSo it's smart for you to go and\ndouble check these things.\n\n318\n00:17:37.747 --> 00:17:43.301\nAnd so,\nthere's it's found some date information\n\n319\n00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:49.000\non when this was relating to HTTP,\nso it's got that.\n\n320\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.450\nNow it's looking for\ndifferences information,\n\n321\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.378\nthe way the information is synced.\n\n322\n00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.580\nSo I mean it's really kind\nof digging through this,\n\n323\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.220\nbut we've already answered\nour big questions, though.\n\n324\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.500\nIs that a load balance?\n\n325\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.522\nWell, it is.\n\n326\n00:18:02.522 --> 00:18:04.580\n>. Yeah. >> Right there,\nwe answered that question.\n\n327\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.202\n>> Nice, I like that.\n\n328\n00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:07.325\nI like that.\n\n329\n00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:11.980\n>> No, I mean like I said, I would still\nlook at some of these other things,\n\n330\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.660\nbut you can very quickly and\neasily tell this one.\n\n331\n00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.640\nI mean if you go lbd on other\nsites you can see the types\n\n332\n00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.520\nof results you'll get\noff these other sites.\n\n333\n00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.420\nI mean, you can see, here's another one.\n\n334\n00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.800\nVery quickly,\nits not load balanced on DNS, so\n\n335\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.260\nit didn't find anything going on there.\n\n336\n00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.140\nSo it looks like they're\nnot doing it which,\n\n337\n00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.630\nI don't know, I find that kind\nof questionable that something\n\n338\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.205\nlike USA Today wouldn't have that because\nthat's a big site, but who knows?\n\n339\n00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:46.670\n>> Right.\n>> There could be something\n\n340\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.920\ndifferent going on there.\n\n341\n00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:55.600\nBut anyway, you can try variations,\nor not try variations, but you\n\n342\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.510\ncan try it against different sites and see\nwhat you can actually pull up with this.\n\n343\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:07.250\nI mean, I could put in ITPro's website,\nand hey, right there.\n\n344\n00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:12.520\nIt came up right away saying\nthat the DNS is load balanced.\n\n345\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.800\nIt's got some other stuff\nthat's going through.\n\n346\n00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.380\nSo it's telling us that these\ntechnologies are in place,\n\n347\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.110\nwhich you would expect, with the millions\nof people that subscribe to this service.\n\n348\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.270\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n349\n00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.050\n>> And so [LAUGH].\n\n350\n00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, I tell you,\n\n351\n00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.590\nit's another way to get all\nthe DNS server addresses there.\n\n352\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.545\nAnd also a way to figure out if, hey,\nis that the IP address for that website,\n\n353\n00:19:33.545 --> 00:19:35.330\nis that the actual web server?\n\n354\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.616\nBecause that's gonna change\nmy attack method, right.\n\n355\n00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:42.497\nIf that's a load balancer that I'm\nhitting and not the actual web server,\n\n356\n00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:46.770\nit's gonna make a difference in\nthe next steps, I would assume.\n\n357\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.410\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, so, we have ways.\n\n358\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.785\nNow we've gone through, and\nwe verifed quite a bit,\n\n359\n00:19:51.785 --> 00:19:53.890\nquite a bit of data at this point.\n\n360\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.930\nAnd so, this one's still grinding away,\ndoing its stuff.\n\n361\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.070\nAnd it could take a while, it does all\nspecial types of queries to get it, but\n\n362\n00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.960\nit will always return something, and\ntell you is this load balanced, and\n\n363\n00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.442\nto what degree is this load balanced.\n\n364\n00:20:08.442 --> 00:20:13.180\nSo this one's saying, well, it didn't\nfind any load balance in there, but\n\n365\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.900\nwe could look up that information there,\nthe security cloud proxy.\n\n366\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.240\nI mean, you've got information,\n\n367\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.975\nyou can look that up and\nthat may very well answer your question.\n\n368\n00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:22.590\n>> Right.\n\n369\n00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:29.163\n>> It may be a form of load balancing and\nprotection that this tool can't detect.\n\n370\n00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:29.830\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n371\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:34.260\n>> So it's possible if that happens.\n\n372\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:41.210\nSo, there you go, you've got some good\ndata right there with this utility.\n\n373\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.080\n>> And I like the name of the next one,\n\n374\n00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.905\nthis sounds like it's gonna give me\nlots of good stuff, the Harvester.\n\n375\n00:20:45.905 --> 00:20:46.430\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n376\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.270\n>> Ooh, the Harvester.\n\n377\n00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.110\n>> It sounds really awesome, I like it.\n\n378\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.783\nThat would be a great\nprofessional wrestling name.\n\n379\n00:20:54.783 --> 00:20:56.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I was ever going to do it,\n\n380\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.080\nI would go with that name.\n\n381\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.880\nAll right, so\nwhat I've done here is I went ahead and\n\n382\n00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.865\nI preset this one up for us so you don't\nhave to watch me type the thing up.\n\n383\n00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:10.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is one that you can\n\n384\n00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.805\nselect right off the Menu.\n\n385\n00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:16.036\nSo, I've just gone through and\nput it in for you.\n\n386\n00:21:16.036 --> 00:21:20.310\nWhat this one is doing is, you see\nthe Harvester, it's saying, dash D,\n\n387\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.554\nthat means domain, and you see\nthe domain I'm targeting after that.\n\n388\n00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:31.140\nDash L tells you just how much\ninformation it's gonna pull out of this.\n\n389\n00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.850\nThat's the thing with some of these tools,\nby the way, when you look at\n\n390\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.690\ngetting information off a website, things\nlike Wget, plus a bunch of other ones,\n\n391\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.880\nthat really kind of dig in and get into\nthe nooks and crannies of a website.\n\n392\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:50.450\nBe aware when they get in there, be\ncareful of how aggressive you are with it.\n\n393\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.590\nYou might say, well,\njust turn it up, I want everything.\n\n394\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.030\nDo you really want\neverything off that site?\n\n395\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.748\nI mean, cuz when you think about it,\n\n396\n00:21:57.748 --> 00:22:00.187\na normal website you have\nthe main landing page, and\n\n397\n00:22:00.187 --> 00:22:04.137\nthen you have some pages underneath that,\nand then you add pages underneath those.\n\n398\n00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:06.930\nAnd if it's a big enough site,\nthat keeps going down.\n\n399\n00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.241\nAnd that's almost like\na geometric expansion of stuff.\n\n400\n00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:10.991\n>> [LAUGH].\nAbsolutely.\n\n401\n00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:15.772\n>> So if you go down four or five levels,\nthat doesn't sound like a big deal, but\n\n402\n00:22:15.772 --> 00:22:19.740\nthat can be hundreds and\nhundreds of web pages very quickly.\n\n403\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.435\nAnd that's just the pages, that's not the\nimages and other stuff that goes with it.\n\n404\n00:22:24.435 --> 00:22:25.340\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> So\n\n405\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.270\nyou may seriously want to\nconsider how aggressive you get.\n\n406\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:33.120\nI would say, if you're not sure,\njust slowly amp it up.\n\n407\n00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.040\nTypically what you like to do is\ngo down about three levels and\n\n408\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.520\nchop it right there.\n\n409\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.580\nBut going any further than that\nis really gonna expand it out.\n\n410\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.400\nBut they have other switches\nlike this here, too,\n\n411\n00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.310\nthat tell you how much it's gonna return.\n\n412\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.100\nSo it's going through so many levels.\n\n413\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.370\nThen it's also telling you at the end\nwhat it's going to search against.\n\n414\n00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.110\nSo, I am gonna run this.\n\n415\n00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.215\nSo, it's going to target that site,\nand you can see it's looking at stuff.\n\n416\n00:22:57.215 --> 00:23:02.010\nIt's searching the site,\nit's going out to Microsoft, and\n\n417\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.270\ngoing through that search and\nresults against Google for that site.\n\n418\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.030\nAnd let's see what it's returning.\n\n419\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.670\nAnd so, okay, the thing's done.\n\n420\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.440\nOkay, let's go back and see what\nthe Harvester actually got for us.\n\n421\n00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.410\nIf we go back and we look at this, Google,\nit didn't find anything useful for\n\n422\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.360\nus in Google, but\nlook at the emails it found.\n\n423\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.980\nThe email it found just by\ngoing through those pages,\n\n424\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.580\nit found four email addresses.\n\n425\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.040\nNow we know there's more than that at\nMicrosoft, but those are actually listed\n\n426\n00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.810\nsomeplace, in some public area\nwhere it was able to find them.\n\n427\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.300\n>> So somewhere on their webpage in\nthe source code for that webpage, or\n\n428\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.620\nsomething like that?\n\n429\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.700\n>> It's somewhere,\ncould very well be in source code.\n\n430\n00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.098\nIt could be maybe it somehow got into\na discussion group really quickly through\n\n431\n00:23:49.098 --> 00:23:50.240\nthat and pulled it.\n\n432\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.000\nCould be some contact or\nemployment form, who knows?\n\n433\n00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.590\nIt could be something like that.\n\n434\n00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.776\nBut then we look down even further,\n\n435\n00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:04.670\nnow it's finding other stuff,\nother hosts it found.\n\n436\n00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.310\nSo, it's saying I found an IP address.\n\n437\n00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:12.131\nAnd the DNS name that goes\nwith the two that go together,\n\n438\n00:24:12.131 --> 00:24:15.319\nso now you've got the association.\n\n439\n00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.425\nI can see IP address,\nI can see the host name that goes with it.\n\n440\n00:24:18.425 --> 00:24:22.881\nSo, I've gone through and\ngenerated that really, really quickly, so\n\n441\n00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:27.130\nit just went through and scanned\nthe website and found these things.\n\n442\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.827\nNow, you can try different locations.\n\n443\n00:24:30.827 --> 00:24:33.519\nLet's see, let's try another one.\n\n444\n00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:37.470\nI'm trying to think of another good one.\n\n445\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.520\nI try news sites sometimes to\nsee if it does anything for me.\n\n446\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.690\nBut, you will see that it's the harvester,\n\n447\n00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:50.490\nit goes through and it is trying\nto extract data from that site.\n\n448\n00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.720\nAnd see what it can find.\n\n449\n00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.520\nDidn't find as much but\n\n450\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:01.830\nit did find some stuff so\nyou can play around with that and\n\n451\n00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:07.140\ntry different ones or try your own\ncompany's website and see what it finds.\n\n452\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.150\nSometimes it's gonna pull out quite\na bit other times it might not pull\n\n453\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.070\nreally anything at all.\n\n454\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.760\nThis one's not really that much.\n\n455\n00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.930\nIt pulled out some information.\n\n456\n00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.740\nI got a Nintendo, what the heck?\n\n457\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.678\nSo, we're going through here and\n\n458\n00:25:22.678 --> 00:25:29.020\nI searched Nintendo.com\nto see what's pulling.\n\n459\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.930\n>> It's one of those commands that as\nan admin you're almost scared to run it\n\n460\n00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.000\nbecause you're like, okay,\nlet's see how bad it is.\n\n461\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.842\nLet's see what I have\nnot secured properly.\n\n462\n00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:37.523\n>> Yeah.\n\n463\n00:25:37.523 --> 00:25:42.990\nAnd to be honest, this stuff at\nthe bottom, the hosts it found.\n\n464\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.410\nAs you can see, it went through\nsearch engines and found that.\n\n465\n00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.770\nWell, it finds those\nthings in search engines.\n\n466\n00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.400\nOkay, well, that would be something\nthat you can't really secure too much.\n\n467\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.570\n>> Can't control that, yeah.\n\n468\n00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.320\n>> Okay, so I'm okay with that,\nI understand that.\n\n469\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.350\nBut then if you scroll up in here,\nthese email addresses.\n\n470\n00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.680\nNow you gotta ask yourself,\n\n471\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.750\nthose email addresses, are they all really\nstuff that should be public like that?\n\n472\n00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.910\nOr is there, or should they be hidden?\n\n473\n00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.090\nI mean,\nI can see this thing like this noalegal,\n\n474\n00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.550\nthat's a Nintendo of\nAmerica legal department.\n\n475\n00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.230\nWell, they probably want\nto have it out there for\n\n476\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.090\npeople to report stuff or\nif you have problems with their website.\n\n477\n00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.750\nMight even be on their privacy\npolicy on their website.\n\n478\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.520\nThey may have that.\n\n479\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.280\nThat may be where they got that from.\n\n480\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.050\nSo who knows?\n\n481\n00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:39.825\nBut that's, you do have information being\nextracted from here that is useful.\n\n482\n00:26:39.825 --> 00:26:44.147\nSo, yeah, you might wanna consider if this\nis something that should be out there.\n\n483\n00:26:44.147 --> 00:26:46.430\nSo, there you go.\n\n484\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.192\nThat's what the harvester does for you.\n\n485\n00:26:48.192 --> 00:26:52.980\nAnd like I said,\ntry your own company site.\n\n486\n00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.710\nIt's a lot of times, I've seen people\nrun this one, and it's like it's.\n\n487\n00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.470\nOne of those things that's an eye opener,\nyou're like,\n\n488\n00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.760\nwell how did it know that and\nit causes you to go through.\n\n489\n00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.310\nEspecially in the email addresses by\n\n490\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.242\nthe way,\n>> Yeah.\n\n491\n00:27:02.242 --> 00:27:04.359\n>> I've never seen that out there and\n\n492\n00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:07.939\nthey've spend some time going\nthrough looking at it, and\n\n493\n00:27:07.939 --> 00:27:12.781\nthey find in one place it's hidden in\na source code, or a text file someplace.\n\n494\n00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:16.670\nIt's somewhere, and\nI'm like, I had no idea.\n\n495\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:20.270\n>> That's where all that spam has\nbeen coming in, that email address.\n\n496\n00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.190\n>> Yeah, it very well could be.\n\n497\n00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:27.060\nThat absolutely could be a reason, so\nyou're seeing the stuff right there.\n\n498\n00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:34.800\nThis stuff, it's not something that had to\ngo through any underhanded manner to get.\n\n499\n00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.470\nThis is just using normal\nsearch methods and\n\n500\n00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.670\nstuff like that to find\nout what's going on.\n\n501\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.190\nAnd so, we pulled some information\noff a website pretty easily and\n\n502\n00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.020\neven got the subdomain stuff on there too.\n\n503\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.780\nSo, yeah, it is a pretty nice\npiece of information to have.\n\n504\n00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.410\nSo that's the harvester.\n\n505\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.790\nA little gotcha, I'll tell you,\n\n506\n00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.100\nis to be careful if you're\ngonna look up the harvester.\n\n507\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.440\nIf you're gonna go out and\nGoogle some of these commands.\n\n508\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.640\nI've seen it where when\nthey put the harvester,\n\n509\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.740\nthat command line stuff in there,\nthe command for the harvester,\n\n510\n00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.930\nthey'll do, T-H-E and\nthen they'll put capital H.\n\n511\n00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.260\nI don't know why someone did that,\nbecause if you do that,\n\n512\n00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.810\nthat thing will break every time.\n\n513\n00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.100\nIt will not work.\n\n514\n00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.360\nYou can do that whole command line and\nput a capital H in there,\n\n515\n00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.140\nand it's probably gonna break on you.\n\n516\n00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.496\nIt won't work.\n\n517\n00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:27.093\n>> Command not found.\n\n518\n00:28:27.093 --> 00:28:29.192\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it'll say that,\n\n519\n00:28:29.192 --> 00:28:30.760\nit's like what are you talking about?\n\n520\n00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.570\nI don't know what that is.\n\n521\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.700\nAnd if you weren't aware of\nthat little detail I told you,\n\n522\n00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.740\nthat case sensitivity is a big issue\nhere on the Linux side of the house.\n\n523\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.560\nYou'll sit there and you'll be spitting\nnails and everything else going,\n\n524\n00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.205\nwhat's going on.\n\n525\n00:28:46.205 --> 00:28:48.660\nI'm doing this right, stupid Linux,\nI hate Linux and all.\n\n526\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.920\nIt's like, no, some idiot put it wrong on\ntheir page and it doesn't work that way.\n\n527\n00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.350\nYou have to get the case right.\n\n528\n00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.240\nOr it will absolutely break.\n\n529\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.080\nAnd you'll be surprised how\neasy it is to miss that.\n\n530\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.490\nIt just, we've been trained to do that.\n\n531\n00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.960\nThat's with all the Windows desktops\nout there have been trained to do that.\n\n532\n00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.820\nSome of us that haven't\nbeen around long enough,\n\n533\n00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.490\nokay, we don't necessarily\nhave that habit.\n\n534\n00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.289\nIt's just not something\nwe use all the time.\n\n535\n00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:21.040\nAnyway, I just thought I\nwould point that out to you.\n\n536\n00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.263\n>> All right Sean, I know we have\na couple more tools we want to go over.\n\n537\n00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:24.573\nWe got time to do that you think?\n\n538\n00:29:24.573 --> 00:29:29.441\nI know I wanna see that metagu fill and-\n>> Those ones are big ones,\n\n539\n00:29:29.441 --> 00:29:31.850\nso maybe we want to break this one up.\n\n540\n00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.683\nCuz those are some really nice ones\nthat we've got to talk about it.\n\n541\n00:29:35.683 --> 00:29:36.578\n>> You don't want to\nrush through anything.\n\n542\n00:29:36.578 --> 00:29:38.342\n>> Yeah, not at all.\n\n543\n00:29:38.342 --> 00:29:39.954\n>> All right I tell you what ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n544\n00:29:39.954 --> 00:29:44.150\nThis is gonna be a good place for\nus to go ahead and wrap this episode up.\n\n545\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.864\nBut don't worry, we're going to\ncome back with another episode and\n\n546\n00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:52.490\nmore information or more tools that we can\nuse to gather information off of websites.\n\n547\n00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.740\nBut for now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n548\n00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.631\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n549\n00:29:56.631 --> 00:29:57.820\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.310\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.160\nHow are you, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.850\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.560\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.446\nGetting ready to do another\nepisode here at ITProTV,\n\n8\n00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:24.766\ncontinuing on with our Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:29.497\nAnd in this episode, in particular,\nwe're also continuing on because we've\n\n10\n00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:32.300\ngot more to do when it\ncomes to web site recon.\n\n11\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.778\nWe took a look at a couple tools already,\nWget and Lbd, my load balance detector.\n\n12\n00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:40.359\nWhat did we look at?\n\n13\n00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.560\nThe harvester was a cool one.\n\n14\n00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.460\nWe're not going to stop there.\n\n15\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.554\nWe've got even more tools we can use,\nagain, to gather information.\n\n16\n00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:52.290\nWe're still on that recon phase, and we're\nusing the company's website as our target,\n\n17\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.981\nreally, of that information\ngathering process.\n\n18\n00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:58.150\nSo Sean, what's next on our\nlist of tools we can use?\n\n19\n00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.540\n>> Well, we've got two left that\nwe want to take a look at and\n\n20\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.320\nspend some time with.\n\n21\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.751\nOne is Metagoofil and\nthe other one is the URLcrazy.\n\n22\n00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.456\nI don't know if you can\nsay that a different way.\n\n23\n00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:15.277\nUR El Crazy or-\n>> Yourl Crazy.\n\n24\n00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.179\n>> URL and then Crazy I don't know.\n\n25\n00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.630\n>> Nice play on words there.\n\n26\n00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.757\n>> Yeah.\n\n27\n00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:23.750\nYou choose the one that you like.\n\n28\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.160\nSo those two both are,\n\n29\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050\none of them is kind of interesting\nin what it does and offers to you.\n\n30\n00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.017\nThe other one is really, really cool and\nI know you'll really like it.\n\n31\n00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:44.638\nSo let's just go ahead and\ntalk about these two to see what they do.\n\n32\n00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.627\nThe first one I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:52.700\nbring up here on my screen\nis that URLcrazy utility.\n\n34\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.060\nWhat you can do with this is\nthis is a way of helping you\n\n35\n00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.240\nfind different spellings of domain names.\n\n36\n00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.068\nSo if there's different little\nthings going on, you can use this.\n\n37\n00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:10.519\nAnd so what I have here,\nI've typed out the command name.\n\n38\n00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.381\nThe -k is specifies a keyboard layout.\n\n39\n00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:18.326\nThis is one of those utilities you\ntell it what keyboard name you\n\n40\n00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:22.915\ncan put out if you live in\na different region or something.\n\n41\n00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:28.284\nSo, I just put the dvorak,\nit's a different format of keyboard.\n\n42\n00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:32.111\nAfter the -r I'm gonna tell it\nwhat it's gonna resolve to.\n\n43\n00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:36.294\nSo that would be your website\nthat you wanna take a look at.\n\n44\n00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:40.717\nSo you could type in,\nif I type in microsoft.com.\n\n45\n00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:44.384\nAnd let's see what the results are.\n\n46\n00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:46.070\nIt goes ahead and just boom.\n\n47\n00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.610\nIt goes ahead and\nshoots a lot of stuff out there.\n\n48\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.340\nSo what I am going to do is I am going\nto go ahead and scroll up on this guy.\n\n49\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.360\nSo what did it find?\n\n50\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.185\n130 host names.\n\n51\n00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.332\nWow, that is a lot more\nthan you expected right?\n\n52\n00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:00.517\n>> Absolutely.\n>> 130.\n\n53\n00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:07.290\nSo, and that's just the top level stuff,\nthe Microsoft dot.\n\n54\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.325\nThat's not subdomains underneath that.\n\n55\n00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:12.515\nSo, what we have here\nis we take a look at,\n\n56\n00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:17.996\nwe have the first number of them on there,\nit says character omission.\n\n57\n00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:22.578\nAnd indeed if you look over at\nall those domain names in there\n\n58\n00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:27.253\npeople have intentionally\nregistered those domain names in\n\n59\n00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:31.301\nsuch a way that they are,\nclose, but not the exact.\n\n60\n00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.693\nAnd you think of what's going to happen.\n\n61\n00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:37.237\nThis is something to detect domain\nsquatting and re-directions,\n\n62\n00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:41.698\nstuff you might not necessarily\nimmediately think you need to do or\n\n63\n00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:43.386\nlook for as a pen tester.\n\n64\n00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:48.108\nBut you really should, cuz this is\nsomething that could cause the company\n\n65\n00:03:48.108 --> 00:03:52.374\nproblems, your client problems,\nif people happen to mistype and\n\n66\n00:03:52.374 --> 00:03:56.053\ngo to a site that looks familiar but\nit's not their site.\n\n67\n00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.743\nThey may not notice that\nthey've mistyped something.\n\n68\n00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:01.584\nSo they mistype something,\nthey go to a site that looks the same and\n\n69\n00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:03.840\nthey start providing information to it.\n\n70\n00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.578\nNow they got identity theft and\nwho are they gonna blame?\n\n71\n00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.606\nThey're gonna blame the company.\n\n72\n00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:09.278\nIt takes a long time before\nit's all straightened out and\n\n73\n00:04:09.278 --> 00:04:12.185\nit's just not gonna look bad,\nor it's not gonna look great.\n\n74\n00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.091\nSo you wanna be aware of\nthese types of things.\n\n75\n00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.236\nHeck, in some cases, you can actually\ntake legal action against this.\n\n76\n00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:19.635\nAnd I'm not a lawyer, but\n\n77\n00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:23.716\nI do know there's ways to pursue some\nof these things, cuz it has been done.\n\n78\n00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:24.935\n>> I thought you were gonna say,\nI played one on TV.\n\n79\n00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:26.340\n>> I played one on TV.\n\n80\n00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.222\n>> [LAUGH] You knew that was coming.\n\n81\n00:04:27.222 --> 00:04:31.667\n[LAUGH] But yeah, absolutely, I mean,\nthat is a serious problem right?\n\n82\n00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.472\nPeople making, they know the common\ntypos that people make, and so\n\n83\n00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:39.636\nthey'll try to set up a website, and\ndo those phishing scams, or worse.\n\n84\n00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:44.194\nIt's just something that, as you said, is\nslanderous towards the actual company, or\n\n85\n00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:48.135\nit's just something that doesn't line\nup with the morals of your company,\n\n86\n00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:49.386\nif you know what I mean.\n\n87\n00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:52.006\nThings like that you don't want\npeople going to accidentally so\n\n88\n00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:55.161\nmaybe there's some kind of legal recourse,\nbut first you have to find them,\n\n89\n00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.343\nyou have to know they exist.\n\n90\n00:04:56.343 --> 00:04:59.200\nGreat tool,\nI tried it without the keyboard option and\n\n91\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.133\npulled up all kinds of information.\n\n92\n00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:06.913\nI was going to try it with QWERTY as\nwell to see what that does for me.\n\n93\n00:05:06.913 --> 00:05:09.941\n>> You can do different\nvariations of this,\n\n94\n00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:15.317\nyou can have a lot of fun with this\njust looking at different domain names.\n\n95\n00:05:15.317 --> 00:05:17.857\nYou can find that there's\nprobably stuff already out there.\n\n96\n00:05:17.857 --> 00:05:22.092\nBeen a lot of cases where you find\nsomething has been registered that you're\n\n97\n00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:22.827\nunaware of.\n\n98\n00:05:22.827 --> 00:05:27.973\nIf any of you watching this or\nhear it in the chat room, you work for\n\n99\n00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:34.446\na larger company or work for a company\nthat's become more, got a higher profile.\n\n100\n00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:38.467\nIt becomes more and more likely that\nthis type of shenanigans is happening.\n\n101\n00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:43.912\nSo, you see stuff like omissions in here,\nyou see character repeats in there,\n\n102\n00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:48.200\nthat people have intentionally\ndoubled up on a letter.\n\n103\n00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.040\nYou know, character swap, so\nall the letters are there but\n\n104\n00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.690\nthey're flipped around.\n\n105\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.430\nReplacing characters.\n\n106\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.545\nI mean, look at your keyboard.\n\n107\n00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:01.321\nThese character replacements,\nsome of these are just, look at one's got,\n\n108\n00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.670\nwhat is it?\n\n109\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.374\nI saw it in there.\n\n110\n00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:08.500\nIt's Mucrosoft, and if you looked at it\nthe U and I are right next to one another.\n\n111\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.830\nSomeone thought that out saying\nsomeone could have fat fingers, or\n\n112\n00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.070\nwhatever they call it, and\nslip over and type that one.\n\n113\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.780\nThen we have other characters\nbeing put into it.\n\n114\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.920\nSo you've got a lot of\nstuff missing dots in here.\n\n115\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.936\nJust a lot of different things so you can\nkeep going through looking at that and\n\n116\n00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:33.867\nI'm sure a lot of you are running this.\n\n117\n00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:37.442\nThen you get at the end\nyou see the homoglyphs,\n\n118\n00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:42.117\nsomeone's put in instead of\nputting in a normal character,\n\n119\n00:06:42.117 --> 00:06:46.076\nthey've replaced something\nthat looks the same.\n\n120\n00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:50.798\nSo you can see that you have with\nMicrosoft on there on the top\n\n121\n00:06:50.798 --> 00:06:51.939\none of those.\n\n122\n00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.161\nWhat's someone has done is taken\nthe O's out and put 0's in there.\n\n123\n00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:58.332\nSo it looks the same.\n\n124\n00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:04.331\nAnd if you look on the keyboard, the O and\n0 are right next to one another.\n\n125\n00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.054\nBut someone may not be counting on,\n\n126\n00:07:06.054 --> 00:07:09.852\nif you mistype that they might be putting\nthat in a URL or in email or something.\n\n127\n00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:10.537\n>> Right.\n\n128\n00:07:10.537 --> 00:07:12.267\n>> And someone's like,\noh, It looks close, click.\n\n129\n00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:14.008\nAnd they don't pick that up.\n\n130\n00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:17.075\nAnd then you see at the bottom,\nthe wrong top level domain name.\n\n131\n00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:22.641\nWell what it did is someone registered\nMicrosoft and some of these other TLD's\n\n132\n00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:27.890\nout there for different countries,\nhoping that someone will type it in.\n\n133\n00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.890\nYou see Microsoft.ru, that's for Russia.\n\n134\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.580\nYou see some of these other ones,\nMicrosoft.edu for educational stuff.\n\n135\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.980\nSomeone's gone through and\nregistered that.\n\n136\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.580\nSo it's a lot of little things,\nclever or otherwise,\n\n137\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.883\nthat people have done to capture traffic\nthat was intended for Microsoft.\n\n138\n00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:52.289\nIt's not an uncommon thing for people\nto either mistype click on an URL and\n\n139\n00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.923\njust see the URL and click on it really\nquick, and assume that that's right.\n\n140\n00:07:56.923 --> 00:08:01.188\nAnd without really\ngoing,hey that's not an O,\n\n141\n00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:05.980\nthat's zero, so\nthat's what that would be used for.\n\n142\n00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.460\nA good way of helping you\nlocate these things and\n\n143\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.590\npotentially seeing if you\nneed to do anything about it.\n\n144\n00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.760\n>> Yeah, that's a fantastic\nlittle tool and very easy to use.\n\n145\n00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.840\nI limited mine,\nbecause I use the QWERTY keyboard.\n\n146\n00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.000\nSo, switch it over to QWERTY,\nand there you go.\n\n147\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.340\nYou get all the, or you can leave\nthat keyboard option out, and\n\n148\n00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.410\nyou can get all the different options,\nno matter where your keys are laid out.\n\n149\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.870\nSo it's really, really cool,\nand easy to use.\n\n150\n00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.340\n>> Yep, there you go.\n\n151\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.272\nI mean, and just to think where this would\ncome in from another angle is not only\n\n152\n00:08:34.272 --> 00:08:36.742\nprotecting the company's identity,\n\n153\n00:08:36.742 --> 00:08:41.635\nit's also protecting a company's\nintellectual property and all that too.\n\n154\n00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:47.550\nIntellectual property is a trade mark and\na copyright and all that type of stuff.\n\n155\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.673\nSo if you've got something in here like,\nif you're Microsoft and\n\n156\n00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:55.281\nsomeone's got something that\nlooks pretty close to you or\n\n157\n00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:59.423\nis trying to mislead somebody,\nyou could have a legal case there.\n\n158\n00:08:59.423 --> 00:09:04.240\nBecause there could be some confusion\nbeing called or come into play.\n\n159\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.700\nI know there was one that happened, and\n\n160\n00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.485\nyou could make a case either way, we're\nnot here to start big arguments with this.\n\n161\n00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:18.260\nBut there was an individual\nactually lived in Washington state.\n\n162\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.290\nMicrosoft's there, he's there and\nhe was a high school student, and\n\n163\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.210\nhe started a company that made software.\n\n164\n00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.990\nHe only made one software\nproduct at the time.\n\n165\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.710\nMicrosoft jumped in and says,\nyou better knock it off.\n\n166\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.460\nSo he made this one software product and\nhe called his company Microsoft.\n\n167\n00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.850\nBut he called it, his name was Mike and\nhis last name was Rowe.\n\n168\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, he just added Soft on the end,\n\n169\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.938\nhe goes, that's my name.\n\n170\n00:09:46.938 --> 00:09:50.938\nAnd they're like yeah, it may be your name\nbut you can't call it that because it's-\n\n171\n00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:51.919\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:53.504\n>> You're gonna say you're MikeRoweSoft\n\n173\n00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:56.560\nand people are gonna know what you're\ntrying to cause confusion with.\n\n174\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.133\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:09:58.133 --> 00:09:59.693\n>> He probably could have done that for\n\n176\n00:09:59.693 --> 00:10:03.021\na school project or something, but\nsoon as he made profits off of it, yeah,\n\n177\n00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:04.920\nthey jumped on him really quickly.\n\n178\n00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.890\nAnd I guarantee you Microsoft\nprobably knew what the joke was too.\n\n179\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.100\nThey were like, yeah we understand.\n\n180\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.810\nBut they are compelled to\neither take legal action or\n\n181\n00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.480\nlose control of that trademark.\n\n182\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.002\nAnd that's what people don't [LAUGH]\nunderstand is that these companies have\n\n183\n00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:19.550\nto do that.\n\n184\n00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.318\nAnd so you may be required to help\nthem with that sort of thing by\n\n185\n00:10:23.318 --> 00:10:25.840\nfinding stuff like this.\n\n186\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.910\nI know that Disney World had that here.\n\n187\n00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.970\nI remember hearing about some nursery\nthat had Disney characters on the walls.\n\n188\n00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.090\nAnd Disney's lawyers came in and\nwere like, we're gonna sue you and\n\n189\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.610\neverything else.\n\n190\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.180\nAnd people were like, man,\nthe mouse has gone rabid.\n\n191\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.040\nAnd they were like, no, they have to do\nit, that's their intellectual property.\n\n192\n00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.260\nThey had to go through and\ndo it, they had no choice.\n\n193\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.960\n>> You let one person get away with it and\npretty soon you lose control of it, and\n\n194\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.830\nthat's not gonna be a good thing for\nany business.\n\n195\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.760\n>> Yeah, and so they had to take action.\n\n196\n00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.510\nIt made them look bad for a while,\npeople still remember that.\n\n197\n00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.891\nI do remember, they said, what,\nHanna-Barbera or something jumped in and\n\n198\n00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:05.462\nsays, well,\nwe'll let you use our characters for free.\n\n199\n00:11:05.462 --> 00:11:07.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Disney should have done that.\n\n200\n00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.686\nI don't know why the mouse didn't\nthink of that one but, whatever.\n\n201\n00:11:11.686 --> 00:11:17.050\n>> [LAUGH] All right, and then the one\nwe've been waiting to see, Metagoofil.\n\n202\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.610\nI know this is one of your faves.\n\n203\n00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.140\n>> Yeah, Metagoofil,\nI've got that sitting right over here,\n\n204\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.910\nqueued up and ready to go.\n\n205\n00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:32.120\nWhat I did to make this easy is,\nI have the URL already typed out.\n\n206\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.480\nSo I have that at the bottom.\n\n207\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.760\nWhat the command line\nhas going on there is,\n\n208\n00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.570\nI see Metagoofil command,\n-d, that's the domain again.\n\n209\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.180\nThen I go -t, that's telling me what\ntype of files it's looking for.\n\n210\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:52.310\nYou could actually go, say pdf comma doc\ncomma this comma that, you could go that.\n\n211\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.120\nNext thing is to limit the results,\nthen you can see\n\n212\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.780\nother information on how\nfar it's gonna go down.\n\n213\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.600\nAt the end I'm kind of\ndrawing a blank right now.\n\n214\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.307\nThe output is gonna go to\nthat kalipdf folder and\n\n215\n00:12:10.307 --> 00:12:14.580\nthe file is gonna be the kalifiles.html.\n\n216\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.790\nSo you've got all those things\nbeing spelled out there.\n\n217\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.940\nSo that's our command line.\n\n218\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.900\nLet's take a look at what this does.\n\n219\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:32.370\nIn fact, let me shorten this up just\na bit to make it a little simple.\n\n220\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.830\nI'll just call it kali,\nyou can name it whatever you want.\n\n221\n00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.100\nI'm just gonna shorten it down just a bit.\n\n222\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.600\nSo I've got that command line for\nMetagoofil.\n\n223\n00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.610\nI am gonna go a head and hit Enter on\nthat, and it's gonna do its thing.\n\n224\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.210\nAnd do not be surprised if this thing\npukes out some errors on it, it happens.\n\n225\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:58.175\nSo it's going through and it's taking\na look and see what it's doing,\n\n226\n00:12:58.175 --> 00:13:00.841\nit says 100 results, 25 files.\n\n227\n00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:05.400\nSo that -n 25 told you how many files\nit's gonna download to my system.\n\n228\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.775\nWhat this is gonna do is this is actually\ngonna look at those files, and it's\n\n229\n00:13:10.775 --> 00:13:15.530\nlooking for, bringing them down local, and\nit's gonna look for them for metadata.\n\n230\n00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:23.300\nSo it's slowly going through this,\nas it does its job,\n\n231\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.930\ndepending on the parameters you've set and\ntold it how many files to download and\n\n232\n00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.380\nhow far down to drill,\nthis could take a while.\n\n233\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.920\nSo you can see we've got a pretty\ngood connection here, and\n\n234\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.370\nthis is taking some time.\n\n235\n00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.480\nWell, while that's running,\nI have already taken the liberty,\n\n236\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.490\nI ran this before, and\nso I have my browser up.\n\n237\n00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.900\nIt will actually generate an HTML file.\n\n238\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:54.060\nRemember there was something there\ncalled kali.html I stuck at the end,\n\n239\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.550\nthat's the output file.\n\n240\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.220\nSo what we're seeing here is,\nthis is the output file.\n\n241\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.776\nSo it's saying here's what it found.\n\n242\n00:14:01.776 --> 00:14:04.825\nSo it's saying okay, well,\nhere's what I've got.\n\n243\n00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:08.642\nYou see the little graph up top,\nyou can see it found some user names.\n\n244\n00:14:08.642 --> 00:14:12.411\nIt found one user name, some software,\nsome email information,\n\n245\n00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:14.190\nthat's interesting.\n\n246\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:20.130\nSo, when I look down here, software\nversions found, well, looks like it\n\n247\n00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.900\nfound a couple versions of PDFs in there,\nit looks like, that's what it identified.\n\n248\n00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.700\nIt's probably the same version.\n\n249\n00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.230\nIt's probably that some of the documents\nthat it tried to extract that data off,\n\n250\n00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.760\nsome of them didn't have the version\nnumber on it, some of them did.\n\n251\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.953\nSo it just said two different versions.\n\n252\n00:14:34.953 --> 00:14:37.220\nOkay, so I'm fine with that.\n\n253\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.440\nEmail addresses, so\nit was able to look at those files and\n\n254\n00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.152\nable to pull stuff that either is an email\naddress or resembles an email address.\n\n255\n00:14:49.152 --> 00:14:52.730\nSo we're seeing that right\nthere in this report.\n\n256\n00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.020\nAnd it said that it found a bunch of them,\nand some of these things, they're not\n\n257\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.121\nnecessarily, you've kind of got to mix\nin some of your own intelligence and\n\n258\n00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:04.541\ncommon sense into this,\ncuz those may not be email addresses.\n\n259\n00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:07.943\nSome of those things I look at, and\nyou would look at too and go yeah,\n\n260\n00:15:07.943 --> 00:15:09.518\nthere's something missing.\n\n261\n00:15:09.518 --> 00:15:13.510\nBut they might be something else,\nI wouldn't just chuck it out.\n\n262\n00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:18.420\nSome of those things could be usernames\nand passwords or stuff like that, for\n\n263\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.120\nuse later on.\n\n264\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:25.340\nSo files that it analyzed, there you go,\nso it pulled all those down.\n\n265\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.830\nMetadata that it was able to pull, so it's\ndownloading those files in the background.\n\n266\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.550\nThis came off the exact\nsame query that I'm running\n\n267\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.725\nin that window that I showed you.\n\n268\n00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:40.265\nSo what I see here is I see\nthe attributes that it was\n\n269\n00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:42.485\nable to extract off these things.\n\n270\n00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:48.266\nAnd so it found out who made it, well,\nOffensive Security wrote these things.\n\n271\n00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:52.176\nAnd Offensive Security, of course, is\nthe people that are responsible for Kali.\n\n272\n00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:53.756\nSo it makes kinda sense.\n\n273\n00:15:57.006 --> 00:16:00.761\nI think these are instruction\nmanuals in different languages,\n\n274\n00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:04.020\nhence the dash two-character\nthing at the end.\n\n275\n00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.440\nSo, we're seeing all of these things.\n\n276\n00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.030\nIt's not necessarily gonna pull\nthem off of every last one.\n\n277\n00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.670\nSometimes, the formatting in the document\nmay be a little off, or something.\n\n278\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.500\nBut usually it's pretty successful at it.\n\n279\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.170\nIt will extract this meta data off\nof it and tell us what it finds.\n\n280\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.390\nSo there you go, we're just going through\nand we're seeing a lot of stuff from\n\n281\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:30.610\noffensive security and different versions\nof it, different addressed attached to it.\n\n282\n00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.870\nThen you see down here it found that some\nof the stuff it wasn't able to do it,\n\n283\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.640\nit failed for some reason.\n\n284\n00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.660\nWhich, okay.\n\n285\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.910\nNot necessarily a deal breaker.\n\n286\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:47.670\nI've got three cases where something\njust didn't go through correctly.\n\n287\n00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.430\nBut you've already got\nsome good information.\n\n288\n00:16:51.883 --> 00:16:57.925\nSo, what Metagoofil is designed to do,\nis it's designed when you put that whole\n\n289\n00:16:58.995 --> 00:17:05.865\ncommand together it's going to, and\nyou can see this one has finished.\n\n290\n00:17:05.865 --> 00:17:08.945\nWhat this one's gonna do\nat the end of the day.\n\n291\n00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:15.650\nSo, there you go, there's all the stuff\nthat went on behind the scenes.\n\n292\n00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.320\nSo we see all these things happening.\n\n293\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:26.532\nAt the end of the day you've got some good\ninformation to pull out of that metadata.\n\n294\n00:17:26.532 --> 00:17:30.310\nThe format of using this tool\nis actually pretty easy.\n\n295\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.350\nThe biggest problem for\n\n296\n00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:37.480\nyou is gonna be determining how\nmany files you really want to grab.\n\n297\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.740\nBecause, if you don't know how much you're\ngonna grab, and you go crazy with it,\n\n298\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.700\nyou could be sitting there for a while\ndownloading file after file after file,\n\n299\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.000\nbecause they're gonna bring\nthose things local and\n\n300\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.170\nanalyze them there on your system.\n\n301\n00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.086\nSo it's gonna be doing some stuff.\n\n302\n00:17:53.086 --> 00:18:00.090\nAnd then just not only\nknowing what types of file\n\n303\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.500\nyou're looking for, but are there\nother types that might be useful?\n\n304\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:11.210\nI could change that PDF or\nadd the PDF rather and say a DOC or\n\n305\n00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.380\nDocX file, those ones it will also read\nthe attributes off of, if they're there.\n\n306\n00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.820\nAnd then there's one other\nlittle detail to note.\n\n307\n00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.640\nYou notice how it said the person\nthat wrote it was offensive security?\n\n308\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.450\nThat's not a user.\n\n309\n00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.100\nWe know that.\n\n310\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.420\nWe know that's not a user with\nthe name offensive security.\n\n311\n00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.790\nOr not a person at least,\nwith the name offensive security.\n\n312\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.175\nThe software is probably\nregistered to them, and\n\n313\n00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:37.570\nthat created the PDF in the first place.\n\n314\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.570\nSo if someone wrote the document, gave\nthe copy, editing process and all that,\n\n315\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.710\nand it was given to somebody\nto do the file review on and\n\n316\n00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.950\nshove it in a PDF and\npost it up there and that was it.\n\n317\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.880\n>> Some people are better at sanitizing\ntheir documents before they post\n\n318\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.470\nthem up there.\n\n319\n00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.230\nA lot of our processing programs\nkind of allow you to go through and\n\n320\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.780\nremove personal information,\nbut a lot of people don't,\n\n321\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.290\nand they throw that stuff out there.\n\n322\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.310\nAnd it might depend on who\ntheir program is registered to.\n\n323\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.780\nLike, if My Office Suite is registered to\nme then it probably puts my name somewhere\n\n324\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.700\nin that meta-data and Metagoofil's\ngonna be able to grab that stuff.\n\n325\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.030\nSo, another one of those programs too,\nSean, that Seems like, then, better to\n\n326\n00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.539\nstart off with a small number and get a\nsampling of seeing what you're gonna get.\n\n327\n00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:21.865\n>> Yep.\n>> Don't start off with a thousand or\n\n328\n00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:22.702\nsomething like that.\n\n329\n00:19:22.702 --> 00:19:25.047\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:29.800\nIt's a game of numbers here,\nyou gotta start off\n\n331\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.790\nbeing patient and start with low\nnumbers and work your way up.\n\n332\n00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.060\nYou may have a couple hundred pdfs,\nlet's say on that site.\n\n333\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.960\nThere could be way more\npdfs up there than this.\n\n334\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.490\nBut I may only need 10, 20,\n\n335\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.260\n30 to give me enough of a pattern to move\nfurther on with my pen testing process.\n\n336\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.680\nI don't care about\nwhatever else is on there.\n\n337\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.140\nIt's just not useful.\n\n338\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.190\nBut then again, there may be cases\nwhere you do need that information.\n\n339\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.970\nAnd you're right.\n\n340\n00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.660\nPeople do not remove this.\n\n341\n00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.180\nIn a lot of cases they\ndon't know it's there.\n\n342\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.610\nAnd the ones that do know it's there,\nthere is only a small\n\n343\n00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.510\nnumber of those that actually take\nthe next step of removing it.\n\n344\n00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.580\nThey still have that issue\nin Microsoft's Office Suite,\n\n345\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.890\nthat they still leave\nattributes behind in there.\n\n346\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.970\nAnd there's a utility that you can get\nthat actually strips those things out.\n\n347\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.890\nAnd there was a big stink about that,\nand Microsoft fixed some of it,\n\n348\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.240\nbut a lot of those\nattributes are still there.\n\n349\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.220\nAnd people don't remove them, they\ndon't know that those things are there.\n\n350\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.560\nOh, okay, go ahead and send it out,\nthere's nothing that can be done with it.\n\n351\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.250\nWell, this will find it.\n\n352\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.180\nAnd the files that this one finds don't\nnecessarily have to be linked any place.\n\n353\n00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.830\nYou just point to a domain and\nit will go right through it.\n\n354\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.160\n>> Again, people putting stuff on\ntheir web server that maybe was\n\n355\n00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.960\nlinked at one point and\nis no longer linked.\n\n356\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.435\nOr just put it up there so\nthat they might be able to access it but\n\n357\n00:20:52.435 --> 00:20:55.790\ndon' t think anybody else can access\nit because it's not an actual link.\n\n358\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.250\nYou'd have to type in the URL to be\nable to get to it, so they think,\n\n359\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.440\nnobody can get to it.\n\n360\n00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.725\nWell something like this, it's going\nto find it because it's searching those\n\n361\n00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:05.698\ndirectories and\nif it's there it will find it.\n\n362\n00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:10.969\n>> And it's worth it to kind of\nput a little extra bit on that.\n\n363\n00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:15.466\nBe aware that we haven't seen it yet,\nit hasn't made its appearance yet, but\n\n364\n00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:16.970\nit will.\n\n365\n00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.580\nThere's a tool that will show up in\nhere later on in our discussions,\n\n366\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.918\nthat can actually find or read\nthe robot.txt that you have in websites.\n\n367\n00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:29.410\nAnd that robots.txt if you're unaware,\n\n368\n00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.770\nit tells search engines where they can\ngo on the site and where they can't.\n\n369\n00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.970\nWhat this one will do,\nis this one can go into that robot.txt and\n\n370\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.195\nlook at it to see where you don't want\nsearch engines to go, and it will say,\n\n371\n00:21:43.195 --> 00:21:46.935\nyeah, I know all these folders you\ndon't want me to take a look at.\n\n372\n00:21:46.935 --> 00:21:50.240\nThey're off the map,\nyou don't want me playing around in.\n\n373\n00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.450\nI'll just go right on into those now,\ncuz I know where they are.\n\n374\n00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.960\nSo\n>> I mean I'm picturing the old\n\n375\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.330\nWarner Brothers cartoon,\nwhere you got Bugsy and\n\n376\n00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.630\nthere's a big old neon sign outside,\nthis is the bad guy's hideout, you know?\n\n377\n00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.980\nYou're basically saying I don't\nwant search engines to look here.\n\n378\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.933\nBut to the bad guys it's like, this is\nwhere I wanna look for all the good stuff.\n\n379\n00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:10.827\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n380\n00:22:10.827 --> 00:22:15.517\n[LAUGH]\n>> And with that file specifically\n\n381\n00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:19.530\nthere's still a lot of people.\n\n382\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.980\nI'm surprised, because that\nrobots.txt is not a new thing.\n\n383\n00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.710\nIt's been around for ages, there's\nstill people that don't know about it.\n\n384\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.420\nThere's still people,\n\n385\n00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.960\nwhen you teach them how to do this\nintelligence gathering that we're doing\n\n386\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.400\nhere, they immediately are asking, and\nshould be asking, how do you stop that?\n\n387\n00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.640\nAnd tell them, oh,\nwell add that to your robots.txt.\n\n388\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.309\nAnd they're like, what's that?\n\n389\n00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:41.637\nThey've just never been\ntold about that one and\n\n390\n00:22:41.637 --> 00:22:45.185\nit's not something we are trying to\nding them on or anything, it's just\n\n391\n00:22:45.185 --> 00:22:49.340\nthe fact that that still is one of those\nthings that's not common knowledge.\n\n392\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.320\nAnd it's easy money to stop a lot of this,\nbut in this case,\n\n393\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.740\nthe defensive measure that someone's put\nup to stop people from going into those,\n\n394\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.990\nstop certain tools like we have\nhere from going into those.\n\n395\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.630\nWe've got another tool that will\ngo specifically after that and\n\n396\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.200\nsee where you don't want me to go,\nand then I'll go there anyway.\n\n397\n00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.470\nSo there's always a way to get around it.\n\n398\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.370\n>> There really is.\n>> Yeah.\n\n399\n00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:12.303\nWhat can we say?\n\n400\n00:23:12.303 --> 00:23:14.438\n>> All right, I'll tell you what Sean,\n\n401\n00:23:14.438 --> 00:23:18.990\na lot of great information there on recon,\nright?\n\n402\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.060\nWeb server recon in this case.\n\n403\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.100\nHitting that public interface\nwith the company and\n\n404\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.160\ntrying to see what kind of information\nI can use using these different tools.\n\n405\n00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:34.150\nWe looked at in a previous episode\nWget and LBD and the harvester.\n\n406\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.150\nThis episode we look at Medigoofil and\nURLcrazy, so\n\n407\n00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.230\njust a lot of tools, and\nof course as we've said several times,\n\n408\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.640\nthere's more in there if you\nwant to take a look at them.\n\n409\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.780\nThese are just kind of those,\nthe go to tools for Sean here.\n\n410\n00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.950\nSo, anything else we\nwant to throw in in our\n\n411\n00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.580\nwebsite recon before we call this a day?\n\n412\n00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.560\n>> I can't think of any.\n\n413\n00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.690\nOf course, anytime I hear the word\nharvester that's when I always wanted to\n\n414\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.165\nflex like the Hulkster.\n\n415\n00:23:59.165 --> 00:24:00.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Harvester.\n\n416\n00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.450\n>> All right.\n\n417\n00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.280\nMakes me think of an old Metallica song.\n\n418\n00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.158\nI don't know, so [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n419\n00:24:06.158 --> 00:24:07.195\n>> All right Well, ladies and\n\n420\n00:24:07.195 -->

00:00:15.820\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.080\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.440\nI'm doing great, how are you?\n\n6\n00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.620\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.260\nWe are having another episode in our\nKali Linux series here at ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.300\nAnd in this episode,\nwe are going to be looking at scanning.\n\n9\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.917\nSo we are going to be talking about\ndifferent types of scanning that can be\n\n10\n00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:32.000\ndone during that scanning phase.\n\n11\n00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.780\nAs well as, take a look at some\nof the tools in later episodes\n\n12\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.790\nthat we can use to accomplish scanning.\n\n13\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.790\nSo Sean,\n\n14\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.220\nscanning is really when we're starting and\nwe've done our reconnaissance.\n\n15\n00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.030\nWe've gathered all that information\nusing our open-source intelligence, and\n\n16\n00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.970\nsome other places we've looked\nto get that information.\n\n17\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.470\nNow we move into the scanning phase,\nthat we start reaching out and\n\n18\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.290\nactually touching our target, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.920\n>> Yeah, we're gonna be\ngetting into a lot deeper now.\n\n20\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.090\nWhat scanning's gonna do is really start,\nit's gonna encompass two things.\n\n21\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.470\nFirst of all, it's gonna be\nthe scanning and the numeration.\n\n22\n00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.237\nRemember, we're pushing\nthose both together and\n\n23\n00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:09.810\nnot really making too\nmuch of a distinction.\n\n24\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.170\nBut enumeration does, if you do want\nto put kind of a fine point on it.\n\n25\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.910\nWithin the scanning phase,\nwe have the actual scanning part, and\n\n26\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.090\nthen we have enumeration\ncomes right after that.\n\n27\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.390\nSo there is a definite sequence to it.\n\n28\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.970\nBut the whole thing itself\nis called scanning.\n\n29\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.730\nSo they really only use the first part of\n\n30\n00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.120\nthose two pieces to give you\nthe name of the whole phase overall.\n\n31\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.840\n>> It's always confused me a little bit.\n\n32\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.080\nBecause I know certain curriculum\nwill break those two out.\n\n33\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.740\nBut scanning gives you, in the end,\na list of things that it found.\n\n34\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.490\nEnumeration is,\nto enumerate is to list, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.380\nSo there's nothing,\nthey kinda should be put together.\n\n36\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.470\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they do make sense,\n\n37\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.595\nas one leads directly into the other.\n\n38\n00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:00.030\nAnd if you just go scanning,\nenumeration, and\n\n39\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.440\nthen gaining access to a system,\nyou can see the progress being made there.\n\n40\n00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.300\nBut, yeah, I would agree with you.\n\n41\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.900\nIt does tend to be,\nmakes sense to have scan enumeration.\n\n42\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.560\nJust join them together, and say gaining\naccess is an excellent app for that.\n\n43\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.770\nYou found you target, found information\nabout a target, let's get into the target.\n\n44\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.760\n>> Let's do it.\n\n45\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.530\nAll right, so\nwhen it comes to scanning then,\n\n46\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.030\nwe've got different things we can scan or\nscan for.\n\n47\n00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.920\nWhat kind of different\nscanning options do we have?\n\n48\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.526\n>> Yeah, there is actually a whole lot\noptions on the table at this point,\n\n49\n00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.812\nas far as scanning goes.\n\n50\n00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:38.500\nWe have the ability to scan and\nlook for live hosts, so\n\n51\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800\nwe can see what's up or down.\n\n52\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.630\nAnd there's plenty of tools that do that.\n\n53\n00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.050\nSome of them we've already seen,\nother ones we are gonna kinda reintroduce.\n\n54\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.800\nAnd we do have some new ones that\nare gonna start coming in to the picture\n\n55\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.910\nonce again.\n\n56\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.990\nSo we're gonna look for those live hosts,\n\n57\n00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.535\nthe hosts that we really want to kinda\nfocus our attention more tightly on.\n\n58\n00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.990\nBecause if we have a whole range of IPs,\nthere's no reason on spending time\n\n59\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.755\nmonkeying around with IPs that\nthere's nothing behind them.\n\n60\n00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:10.255\nThere's nothing there, so\nyou're just wasting time.\n\n61\n00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:13.831\n>> 65,535 packets to an IP\naddress that doesn't have a host\n\n62\n00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:15.450\non the other end of it.\n\n63\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.540\nThat's kind of a waste, right?\n\n64\n00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.136\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and\n\n65\n00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:21.143\nall it's gonna do is tell someone,\nat first, that you're there and second,\n\n66\n00:03:21.143 --> 00:03:22.151\nyou're an idiot.\n\n67\n00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So-\n\n68\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.478\n>> Not too worried about that hacker,\n\n69\n00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:25.260\njust let him do his thing.\n\n70\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.640\n>> Yeah, it's like oh, come on.\n\n71\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.590\nGet some chips, and\nsit there and just start.\n\n72\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.850\nIt's not gonna really get you that far.\n\n73\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.190\n>> And as a pin tester, not going\nto make me look very efficient or\n\n74\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.225\nvery smart to my customers, right.\n\n75\n00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.760\n>> Yeah, so don't do that.\n\n76\n00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040\nSo that's the first thing, is finding out\nwhat hosts are actually gonna be live and\n\n77\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.160\nhave something back there.\n\n78\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.930\nOnce you find that, then that's when you\nare going to start getting in deeper and\n\n79\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.260\nseeing what ports are open on that system.\n\n80\n00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.760\nAnd then even getting further into that\nand seeing what lives behind those ports.\n\n81\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.366\nAnd that's where numeration really starts\ncoming in, is we're starting to probe\n\n82\n00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:06.048\nthose ports to see what information\nwe can extract out of them, and\n\n83\n00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:08.090\nsee what the nature of that is.\n\n84\n00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.180\nAnd this is one of those points where\n\n85\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.208\nyou are goingg to see more towards\nthe enumeration section of this.\n\n86\n00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:18.390\nYou are gonna see that Kali\n\n87\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.760\nhas a really broad range of tools at\nthat point, that can help you out.\n\n88\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.270\nOne of the things that we saw in the CEH\ncourse is that we could extract stuff out\n\n89\n00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.830\nof Windows specifically, and\nstart looking for user names,\n\n90\n00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.820\nshare names, machine names.\n\n91\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.240\nI mean, there's a great number of\nthings we could pull out of that.\n\n92\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.170\nBut when we get over to Kali, Kali\nintroduces another set of tools that we\n\n93\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.920\ncan use to do even additional\nthings that we haven't seen before.\n\n94\n00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.122\nFor example,\none of the things you can do is,\n\n95\n00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.875\nduring enumeration, you can extract\nthings specifically from Oracle.\n\n96\n00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:59.010\nThere's tools specifically in Kali\nthat target the Oracle database.\n\n97\n00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.397\nSo if you find that system present\nby looking at the ports and\n\n98\n00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:07.211\nsee that there's something sitting behind\nthat, that indicates Oracle is there,\n\n99\n00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:11.546\nyou have a tool that you can now bring to\nbear and extract stuff with Oracle and\n\n100\n00:05:11.546 --> 00:05:13.810\nfind all sorts of interesting things.\n\n101\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.860\nSo they put that into the mix.\n\n102\n00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.580\nSo now once you find the live ones, and\nyou start finding what ports are open and\n\n103\n00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.310\nwhat the nature of that system is,\nnow you start digging behind that and\n\n104\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.280\nseeing what those services and\nall that actually mean.\n\n105\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.720\nMaybe fingerprinting the OS.\n\n106\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.790\nWe definitely have tools that can do that\nfor us, plenty of ones in that category,\n\n107\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.900\nas a matter of fact.\n\n108\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.255\nThat's probably one of the easiest\nthings to do is to fingerprint an OS.\n\n109\n00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.870\nCuz there's so\nmany different ways to do it.\n\n110\n00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.450\nOnce we have that, then yeah,\n\n111\n00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.250\nwe figure out what we specifically\nwant to target in that system.\n\n112\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.490\nAnd then bring the tool that\nwe want to use to bear.\n\n113\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.470\nWhether it's Oracle or Sequel Server, or\n\n114\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.580\nsome other web application,\nor what have you.\n\n115\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.180\nIt could be, for example,\ncould be NetBIOS.\n\n116\n00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.630\nI mean NetBIOS is one that we\nhad spent some time discussing\n\n117\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.790\nover in the CEH course.\n\n118\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.510\nIt hasn't gone away.\n\n119\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.240\nJust because things like Kali do\nnot use NetBIOS, doesn't mean that\n\n120\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.150\nit can't utilize it to\ninvestigate another target.\n\n121\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.120\nIt definitely has that capability to go\nout and investigate a Windows system and\n\n122\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.960\nsay, okay, well,\nthere's NetBIOS running there.\n\n123\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.350\nEven though Kali doesn't use\nit on a day-to-day basis,\n\n124\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.320\nit does have the ability to sweep it and\nscan it and say yeah, it's there.\n\n125\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.660\nAnd let me see if I can open\nup an old session to it.\n\n126\n00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.980\nAnd if you have that,\nthen a whole other can of worms opens.\n\n127\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.686\nSo there's quite a few things\nthat could happen at this\n\n128\n00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:48.070\nscanning phase to really\nget into the system.\n\n129\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.110\nAnd then later on even, get in even\nfurther when you start punching in, and\n\n130\n00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.575\nkicking in the front door, or back door,\nor whatever it is, and get into there.\n\n131\n00:06:57.575 --> 00:06:58.790\nAnd so-\n>> Nice.\n\n132\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.350\n>> You won't believe the range\nof tools that you have here.\n\n133\n00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.900\nThere's a good chunk of tools that can\ndo quite a bit of information gathering\n\n134\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.320\nduring the scanning phase.\n\n135\n00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.130\nThere's ones in here that extract\npolicy information if you're\n\n136\n00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.200\njoined to Active Directory.\n\n137\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.020\nThere's ones that can do, like I said,\nstuff with different data bases.\n\n138\n00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.060\nThere's ones up and\nabove what we have there.\n\n139\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.060\nThere's ones targeted for\nspecific applications.\n\n140\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.160\nThere's even tools in here\ndesigned to collect information\n\n141\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.720\nas it relates to network authentication.\n\n142\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.200\nIt's specifically designed for that.\n\n143\n00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.470\nIt scans for that, and you see,\nyeah, I know what that is.\n\n144\n00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.040\nAnd it can start pulling\ninformation out of that too.\n\n145\n00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.520\nSo they've really equipped\nyou quite well at this point.\n\n146\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.100\n>> Yeah, so\nyou've got a lot of different scanners.\n\n147\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.790\nYou've got some general purposes scanners\nthat we can use, do host scanning,\n\n148\n00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.590\ndo network scanning.\n\n149\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.320\nAnd then we've got scanners that\nare specific to applications.\n\n150\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.806\nAnd that just means they understand\nthat application very well.\n\n151\n00:07:56.806 --> 00:08:00.679\nThey're designed to work against that\napplication, be it a database, or\n\n152\n00:08:00.679 --> 00:08:01.481\nwhat have you.\n\n153\n00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.735\nWhich means it can pull\na lot more information back,\n\n154\n00:08:03.735 --> 00:08:05.178\nbecause It's been programmed.\n\n155\n00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:07.194\nIt knows what to look for\nand where to look for\n\n156\n00:08:07.194 --> 00:08:09.220\nthe information within that application.\n\n157\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.435\nOr a specific type of traffic\nthat's going across the network.\n\n158\n00:08:12.435 --> 00:08:16.400\nIt's fine tuned to look for just that,\nwhich can make our life a lot easier.\n\n159\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.700\nSometimes when you're doing this type of\nscanning, you get so much information,\n\n160\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.850\nsome of it maybe you didn't\nwant at this point, or\n\n161\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.050\nyou've already gathered with other tools.\n\n162\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.320\nNice to be able to have some tools\nthat really focus in on your target.\n\n163\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.218\n>> Yeah, it saves you a lot of time and\njust think of with the amount of systems\n\n164\n00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:36.089\nout there, the amount of\nenvironments out there rather,\n\n165\n00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:39.100\nthat do have something\nlike Oracle present.\n\n166\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.212\nI mean, you've got the Oracle database is\nvery popular just like SQL server as well,\n\n167\n00:08:44.212 --> 00:08:48.230\nwe're equipped to deal with both\nof those now at this point.\n\n168\n00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.620\nTo see what we can extract out of there.\n\n169\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.890\nIt's actually a scary amount of\ninformation if those are present,\n\n170\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.000\nthat it can get out of it.\n\n171\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.100\n>> Absolutely and I'm hard pressed to\nfind a website nowadays that's not\n\n172\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.610\ntied to some type of\nback end to store data.\n\n173\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.685\nAn n-tier, a multi-tier type system.\n\n174\n00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:07.710\n>> Yep.\n>> Cuz we love those dynamic web pages and\n\n175\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.610\nwe love to make that user feel like\nthey are recognized when they come back.\n\n176\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.700\nWell, all that information\nis stored somewhere and\n\n177\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.170\nthese kinda tools might help\nme dig some of that out.\n\n178\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.720\n>> Yeah.\nPeople definitely expect\n\n179\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.360\ncertain experiences and\ncertain things to happen and\n\n180\n00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.670\nit's databases are part of\nthe technological landscape now.\n\n181\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.580\nThey expect to be delivered, certain types\nof content, expect them to deliver it\n\n182\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.780\na certain way, and\nthat's just become something's that there.\n\n183\n00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.430\nSo, we have these tools that can help\nus out with extracting that data and\n\n184\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.117\nseeing what's going on.\n\n185\n00:09:43.117 --> 00:09:47.510\nIt's kind of mind numbing in a way\nwhen you see what it can do.\n\n186\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.780\nSo we're gonna start introducing\nthose into the picture.\n\n187\n00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:56.470\nAnd we're also gonna be talking,\nprobably more when we get to a few future\n\n188\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:02.520\npieces of Kali over the next couple days.\n\n189\n00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.300\nWhen we get into specific sections dealing\nwith databases we'll start really getting\n\n190\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.880\ninto that portion of it.\n\n191\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.450\nBecause even up above,\njust kind of see what is down the road,\n\n192\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.640\nnot only can we scan and\nlocate a database if its present,\n\n193\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.765\nwe also have the ability at\na later point do SQL injections.\n\n194\n00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:24.930\nThere's tools specifically in Kali,\n\n195\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.130\nthat are designed to help\nyou do SQL injections.\n\n196\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.820\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, so\n\n197\n00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.570\nthey've brought that to bear as well.\n\n198\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.740\nSo, you've got a fair amount of\ntools in there to help you out.\n\n199\n00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.800\nThat's how cool this really is.\n\n200\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.795\n>> Okay, now I was gonna say, Kali, it\nreminds me of the old swiss army knife but\n\n201\n00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:43.945\nI don't even know if that does it justice.\n\n202\n00:10:43.945 --> 00:10:46.175\nIt have to be one of those really wide,\n200 tool-\n\n203\n00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:47.655\n>> Yeah, a pretty big one.\n\n204\n00:10:47.655 --> 00:10:49.495\n>> Swiss army knives\nthat'll fit in your pocket.\n\n205\n00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:52.889\nIt really does just about\neverything we need as\n\n206\n00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:55.595\na pen tester all wrapped up into one.\n\n207\n00:10:55.595 --> 00:11:01.395\n>> It's got so many in there, you're never\nreally going use all the tools in there.\n\n208\n00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:05.820\nI mean you're going to go and\ninvestigate this stuff undoubtedly, but\n\n209\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.970\nyou're probably never\ngoing to use them all.\n\n210\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.070\nIn fact if you look at that list of tools,\n\n211\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.240\nthe one you were showing\nyesterday on the Kali website.\n\n212\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.060\nSome of those you still\nhave to actually load.\n\n213\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.320\nSo, not even all those are present,\nso you can load those.\n\n214\n00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.360\nThen there's even ones that aren't even\nthere, that you can grab from other\n\n215\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.340\nplaces, there's plenty of places that have\nlittle packages that you can download and\n\n216\n00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.050\ninstall on the system to\nenhance the security or\n\n217\n00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.790\nenhance the capabilities up above that,\nbut it's kinda questionable.\n\n218\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.712\nDo you really need all those\nother packages, when you have so\n\n219\n00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:40.560\nmuch capability right out of the box?\n\n220\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.436\n>> I would think only if you\nneeded a specific tool for\n\n221\n00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:47.064\na specific target, or\nyou just had a favorite that you really,\n\n222\n00:11:47.064 --> 00:11:50.510\nreally liked above some of\nthose that are built in.\n\n223\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.610\nIt's got all the good ones\nin there already just about.\n\n224\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.750\n>> Yeah, some people have an affinity,\nlike you said, for a specific tool.\n\n225\n00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.900\nAnd if that's the case,\n\n226\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.155\nthen you're gonna have to figure\nout a way to bring that over.\n\n227\n00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:01.975\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But,\n\n228\n00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:04.792\nif you are someone that\nlikes to be more flexible,\n\n229\n00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:08.700\nyou've already got quite a bit of\ntools in here that can help you out.\n\n230\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.740\nAnd the cool thing about it is\nsome of these tools are ones that\n\n231\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.360\n>> You can use here on this system,\n\n232\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.150\nyou can use on another system,\nyou know, on a Windows box.\n\n233\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.610\nNMap is one of the ones I\nthink about right upfront.\n\n234\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.110\nNMap is something that's cross-platform.\n\n235\n00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.580\nThey've got it pretty much NMap\nis on everything nowadays.\n\n236\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.510\nIt seems like they've got it on the\nWindows platform, they've got it on Linux,\n\n237\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.410\ngot it on UNIX.\n\n238\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.930\nIt's available for Mac OS,\nit's even on Android.\n\n239\n00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.120\nSo you've got it on all those\ndifferent platforms now,\n\n240\n00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.340\nand I know I'm missing some.\n\n241\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.140\nThey've got all these different things, so\n\n242\n00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.500\nyou are really well\nequipped with that one.\n\n243\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.320\nYou can just take your skills from place\nto place to place to place because\n\n244\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.780\nthe syntax is the same.\n\n245\n00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:59.140\nIn fact if you recall from our CEH course,\nif we're gonna talk about NMap,\n\n246\n00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.160\nwhen we look at our CEH course, all the\nstuff that I showed you in there during\n\n247\n00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.450\nthe CEH, you can use every last one\nof those you can use them here.\n\n248\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.200\nSo you're not losing anything.\n\n249\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.690\n>> Now when we look at scanning,\nwe've got host based scanning we also have\n\n250\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.720\nnetwork based scanning where we're looking\nat- The network as a whole I guess and\n\n251\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.580\ntrying to find out what's going on there?\n\n252\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.570\n>> Yeah, when you do network scanning\nyou're maybe looking at not only what is\n\n253\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.880\nbeing hosted there but\nalso what the structure of it looks like.\n\n254\n00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.348\nYou may also be looking for\ndifferent services that are present.\n\n255\n00:13:33.348 --> 00:13:35.490\n>> DHCP, DNS.\n\n256\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.860\nYou could be trying to locate\nthose specific assets.\n\n257\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.980\nThere's a bunch of\nthings you can do there.\n\n258\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.990\nBut yeah, you're trying to get a better\npicture of what the landscape looks like,\n\n259\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.070\nmaybe even find different pieces\nof hardware, access points,\n\n260\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.620\nrouters, switches.\n\n261\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.250\nYou could start trying to look around\nto see if those things actually exist,\n\n262\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.300\nwhich you know\n>> At least two of those exist on\n\n263\n00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.950\nmost networks, the routers and switches.\n\n264\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.180\nThe access point is probably there too but\n\n265\n00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.760\nthere's no guarantee those\nare there in every case.\n\n266\n00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.940\nSo yeah, that's what a network\nscan would do, is find,\n\n267\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.040\nonce we found out what's live,\nfind out what's behind those things,\n\n268\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.580\nbehind those IP addresses, and\nsee what that device looks like.\n\n269\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.280\nAnd maybe you try to\nfinger print that device.\n\n270\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.390\nYou know?\nDo banner grabs and stuff like that.\n\n271\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.320\nWhich we can definitely do in here.\n\n272\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.140\n>> No when it comes to scanning,\nI'm assuming that it\n\n273\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.460\nmight be different based on where\nI'm doing the scanning from.\n\n274\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.130\nRight?\nIf I'm doing a pen test and\n\n275\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.010\nI'm outside the network, that might be\na different set of results whereas if I\n\n276\n00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.960\ngain access to the network either\nbecause they've let me in or\n\n277\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.040\nbecause I've compromised a machine,\nbut that can change my scan results?\n\n278\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.430\n>> It definitely can, you definitely can\nget different results or you can have\n\n279\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:56.610\ndifferent, I guess different levels of\nsuccess depending on where you are.\n\n280\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:02.100\nIf you're on the outside looking in,\nthen you do have to do some adjusting.\n\n281\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.110\nYou're probably going to have to figure\na way to punch a hole some place Or to get\n\n282\n00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.680\nsomething like a key logger or something\nlike that to compromise the system.\n\n283\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.550\nTo be able to get inside and see that.\n\n284\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.815\nUnless the range you're looking\nat is something on the outside.\n\n285\n00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:18.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n286\n00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.160\n>> That's a different story.\n\n287\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.100\nIf it's something that's over the wall and\n\n288\n00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.350\ninside then you're going to have\nto get some kind of access there.\n\n289\n00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.640\nThat may mean that you're doing that\nsocial engineering aspect or that\n\n290\n00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.120\nphysical penetration where you walk in\nwith a notebook or something someplace or\n\n291\n00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.450\nuse something like one of those little\ndropboxes I showed in the CEH course and\n\n292\n00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.690\npop one of those in\nsomeplace to help you out.\n\n293\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.270\n>> Like, Wi-Fi pineapple or turtle.\n\n294\n00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.820\nI mean all those names were great.\n\n295\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.430\n>> Yeah.\n\n296\n00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.520\nWe've got a whole zoo running here.\n\n297\n00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n298\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.880\nWell, I tell you Sean.\n\n299\n00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.403\nI know we want to dive into some of\nthe tools and do some of the scanning, so\n\n300\n00:15:57.403 --> 00:16:01.483\nanything else we wanna throw in\non just the concepts of scanning,\n\n301\n00:16:01.483 --> 00:16:02.682\nbefore we move on?\n\n302\n00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:07.950\n>> There are some things that you might\nactually consider doing at this point.\n\n303\n00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.910\nAnd bringing into the whole mix\nis they're using packet crafters.\n\n304\n00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.365\nPacket crafters are something that\nwe talked about in the CEH course.\n\n305\n00:16:17.365 --> 00:16:20.967\nA packet crafter,\nif you haven't guessed from the name,\n\n306\n00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:25.907\nit's a utility we use to create a custom\npack with specific flags and settings.\n\n307\n00:16:25.907 --> 00:16:28.470\nDesigned to detect certain things or\n\n308\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.827\nto allow us to act on certain hunches,\nis a way I would kinda put it too.\n\n309\n00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:37.329\nIs that you craft a packet,\nyou sensor it and flag,\n\n310\n00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:42.224\nit says certain size on it and you fire\nit off and see how a system reacts.\n\n311\n00:16:42.224 --> 00:16:45.789\nAnd that could mean that when\nit reacts with a certain\n\n312\n00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:50.488\nway you can say well okay I fired at\nthat port with these settings, and\n\n313\n00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:55.697\nit reacted in a way counter to what I\nexpected or in line with what I expected.\n\n314\n00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:59.880\nWell that tells me that this is\nthe situation that exists there.\n\n315\n00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.760\nSo that's something that we're starting to\nbring into the mix as well, and then we\n\n316\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:11.590\nhave tools to help us bypass certain\ntechnologies like firewalls and IDSs.\n\n317\n00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:17.000\nWe have things to help us defragment,\nso if we need to use scan around\n\n318\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.580\none of the those systems, we have ways of\nfragmenting our traffic to bypass those.\n\n319\n00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:30.290\nAnd there even is stuff that we have, just\nto kind of mention it, inside of Kali.\n\n320\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:36.550\nWe have stuff to identify different\nIDSs and IPSs at this point in time too.\n\n321\n00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.707\nSo, those are specifically designed,\nif you think those devices are present and\n\n322\n00:17:40.707 --> 00:17:43.057\nyou gotta assume,\nuntil you know otherwise,\n\n323\n00:17:43.057 --> 00:17:45.180\nyou gotta assume that they're present.\n\n324\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.512\nWe actually have stuff there\nthat can probe those and say,\n\n325\n00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:52.592\nyeah, I know there's an IDS there or\nI suspect there's one there based\n\n326\n00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:55.936\non how this traffic or\nhow this specific packet is moving.\n\n327\n00:17:55.936 --> 00:17:58.720\nOr how it didn't move, as the case may be.\n\n328\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.365\n>> Yeah, and\nthat brought me to another question,\n\n329\n00:18:01.365 --> 00:18:05.530\nthen is when I'm doing this scanning,\nhost-based or network-based,\n\n330\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.300\nthat is one of the things that\nI've gotta worry about, right?\n\n331\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.460\nIs triggering some type of alarm.\n\n332\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.186\nIf I'm doing penetration testing,\n\n333\n00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:13.643\nthat could halt my tests\nif they see that I'm there.\n\n334\n00:18:13.643 --> 00:18:17.471\nSo, techniques that we might use,\nslowing scans down, or\n\n335\n00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:23.220\nusing those IDS type detection tools, so\nat least we know what we're up against.\n\n336\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:28.381\n>> Yeah, that's something else\ndefinitely to bring into play here is,\n\n337\n00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:33.628\ndon't forget one of the core things\nthat was brought up in the CEH that is\n\n338\n00:18:33.628 --> 00:18:38.884\ndefinitely important to bring up here\nis that you do need to be patient.\n\n339\n00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:42.705\nSo you do need to start thinking\nabout how you can adjust scans.\n\n340\n00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:47.740\nCuz if you try to get something right now,\nthe chances are if you come in hard and\n\n341\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.715\nheavy like that someone\nis gonna pick that up,\n\n342\n00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:53.329\nyou're releasing up a lot of red flags.\n\n343\n00:18:53.329 --> 00:18:57.395\nYou're gonna wanna be more mindful of\nthe fact that you need to be a little more\n\n344\n00:18:57.395 --> 00:18:59.875\nconservative in how you do things.\n\n345\n00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:04.105\nWe're not doing so\nmuch of that with the stuff we've done so\n\n346\n00:19:04.105 --> 00:19:06.895\nfar, but those options are there.\n\n347\n00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:11.072\nWe're kind of counting on you since you've\n\n348\n00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:15.290\nprobably been through the CEH already,\nknow a lot if you have.\n\n349\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.060\nIf you haven't, again,\nyou should take a look at that.\n\n350\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.482\nBut we're counting the fact that you're\ngonna take that into the mix when you\n\n351\n00:19:23.482 --> 00:19:27.293\nstart actually doing your pen\ntesting with this or anything else,\n\n352\n00:19:27.293 --> 00:19:32.076\nis that you don't just start doing things\nthat could really reveal your presence.\n\n353\n00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:36.896\nOnce they revealed your presence, your\ngame is pretty much over at that point.\n\n354\n00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:39.782\nYou're at their mercy,\nthey can stop you or\n\n355\n00:19:39.782 --> 00:19:43.684\nin some cases they'll be really\nmasochistic or sadistic.\n\n356\n00:19:43.684 --> 00:19:48.423\nThey'll let you keep doing it while\nyou dig yourself a bigger and\n\n357\n00:19:48.423 --> 00:19:50.278\nbigger and bigger hole.\n\n358\n00:19:50.278 --> 00:19:52.845\nAnd they're meanwhile tracking\nyou back to where you are,\n\n359\n00:19:52.845 --> 00:19:55.990\njust having fun watching you until\nthey have enough evidence to get you.\n\n360\n00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:00.040\n>> Until you hear the [SOUND]\n>> Yeah right.\n\n361\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's happened.\n\n362\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.219\nSo, you could have those sorts of things.\n\n363\n00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:11.123\nSo, you wanna remember not to\ngo at this hard and heavy.\n\n364\n00:20:11.123 --> 00:20:14.351\nAnd then the other thing we have\nis until you know otherwise,\n\n365\n00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:19.090\njust assume that those defensive devices\nare there, and someone's watching.\n\n366\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.540\nThat will kind of help you\nput things in perspective.\n\n367\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.381\nYou wanna assume that yeah,\nsomeone's watching, and therefore,\n\n368\n00:20:27.381 --> 00:20:32.723\nyou need to really stealthy and really\nkind of careful when you walk around so\n\n369\n00:20:32.723 --> 00:20:35.154\nthey don't pick these things up.\n\n370\n00:20:35.154 --> 00:20:36.090\nSo there's that.\n\n371\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.110\nAnd then I guess there's one more thing we\ncan mention as far as scanning goes and\n\n372\n00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.840\nthat's the vulnerability scanning.\n\n373\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.040\nVulnerability scanners,\nas far as Kali is concerned,\n\n374\n00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.880\nwe have Open Vase right in there.\n\n375\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.520\nWe will leave that to you to go ahead and\n\n376\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.490\ntake a look at really because its\njust another vulnerability scanner.\n\n377\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.010\nWe did vulnerability scanners in the CEH,\nso\n\n378\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.140\nwe don't really need to look at another\none that does pretty much the same thing.\n\n379\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:12.330\nBut just a quick review on as\na general thing on what they do.\n\n380\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.998\nThey look for weaknesses, that's why they\ncall them vulnerability scanners, right?\n\n381\n00:21:15.998 --> 00:21:19.508\nYou target them towards a range of IPs or\na single IP and\n\n382\n00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:21.930\nit tries to get information for you.\n\n383\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.751\nTelling you what that system is,\nand what weaknesses may be present,\n\n384\n00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:29.850\nwithout actually violating any of\nthose weaknesses or vulnerabilities.\n\n385\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.960\nAnd then you decide what your\nplan of attack is gonna be.\n\n386\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.899\nYou do have one Right\nout of the gate in Kali.\n\n387\n00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:43.546\nIf you wanna use one of\nthe other big ones, like Nessus,\n\n388\n00:21:43.546 --> 00:21:47.590\nthen you're gonna have to go and\ngrab that and put it in there.\n\n389\n00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.804\nBut it will work with what we have.\n\n390\n00:21:49.804 --> 00:21:52.098\n>> Alright, so a lot of different\ntypes of scanning that we can do.\n\n391\n00:21:52.098 --> 00:21:54.891\nWe've got host-based scanning,\nlooking for live systems.\n\n392\n00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:58.858\nOr port scanning where we're\ntrying to examine that host and\n\n393\n00:21:58.858 --> 00:22:03.810\nsee what services it's running or\nOS fingerprint-type scanning.\n\n394\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.006\nWe've got network scanning.\n\n395\n00:22:05.006 --> 00:22:07.236\nWe've got vulnerability scanning.\n\n396\n00:22:07.236 --> 00:22:10.250\nLots of scanning going on, I like it.\n\n397\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.499\n>> And wait, there's more.\n\n398\n00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:12.420\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n399\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:19.560\nYeah, there is more scanners up above what\nthe Open VOZ, that vulnerability scanner.\n\n400\n00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.970\nThere's stuff for\nhardware in form of the Cisco devices.\n\n401\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.161\nThere are tools in Kali\nspecifically designed for Cisco, so\n\n402\n00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:32.937\nthey've got that taken care of,\nat least a little bit taken care of.\n\n403\n00:22:32.937 --> 00:22:36.666\nYou're still gonna have to do some\nmore investigation on top of it, so\n\n404\n00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:40.474\nthat means your Cisco knowledge is\ngonna have to be ramped up just a bit.\n\n405\n00:22:40.474 --> 00:22:44.204\nSo we have that, but\nwe also have other tools for\n\n406\n00:22:44.204 --> 00:22:48.880\nother different types of hardware as well,\nand scanning.\n\n407\n00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.263\nOne of the ones I was gonna point out,\nis they even have scanners\n\n408\n00:22:53.263 --> 00:22:57.895\nthat you can use during this whole\nscanning phase that picks up, or\n\n409\n00:22:57.895 --> 00:23:01.881\ndetects if voice over IP is\neven present on that network.\n\n410\n00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:04.156\nSo that's there as well.\n\n411\n00:23:04.156 --> 00:23:07.149\nSo if you suspect there's that,\nyou've got a tool for\n\n412\n00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:11.649\nthat that can say I've got some stuff out\nhere that looks like it's voice over IP.\n\n413\n00:23:11.649 --> 00:23:16.975\nAnd that's where scanning and\nenumeration really come together.\n\n414\n00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:21.823\nOnce it finds that, that tool has\nthe ability to attach to that voice over\n\n415\n00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:26.126\nIP system and extract numbers and\nnames and everything from it.\n\n416\n00:23:26.126 --> 00:23:29.585\nThey have tools that ,that\ntool will do that, as well.\n\n417\n00:23:29.585 --> 00:23:31.120\n>> Wow.\n>> So, yeah.\n\n418\n00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.820\nI located it, bang.\n\n419\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.900\nNow I'm gonna start seeing what I can\npull out of the directory that's in that\n\n420\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.350\nsystem, itself.\n\n421\n00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.430\n>> So they're not really playing around,\nanymore.\n\n422\n00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.019\n>> No, and I know you've mentioned,\nlike, application scanners as well,\n\n423\n00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:43.265\nthere's specific applications.\n\n424\n00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:44.615\nI think the only thing we're missing is,\n\n425\n00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:46.168\ndo we have scanners that can scan for\nscanners?\n\n426\n00:23:46.168 --> 00:23:47.399\n>> Well, that's the next one.\n\n427\n00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:48.560\n>> Or, that SIDSs and IPSs.\n\n428\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.694\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, we got those covered.\n\n429\n00:23:51.694 --> 00:23:54.155\nAll right, well lots of good\ninformation about scanning.\n\n430\n00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:56.520\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n431\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.660\nBut stay tuned cuz we are gonna\nhave more episodes on scanning.\n\n432\n00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.450\nWe're gonna start taking a look\nat some of these tools and\n\n433\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.040\nactually doing some scanning.\n\n434\n00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.841\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n435\n00:24:07.841 --> 00:24:08.909\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n436\n00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:10.395\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n437\n00:24:10.395 --> 00:24:16.260\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.760\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyana.\n\n4\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.670\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.320\n>> Doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.020\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.126\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.201\nIt's another exciting day here at ITProTV.\n\n9\n00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.786\nWe're continuing on with\nour Kali Linux series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:29.267\nAnd in this segment we are going to\ntalk about scanning for live hosts,\n\n11\n00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.689\nyou know Sean we've done a lot of\ntalking about scanning in general,\n\n12\n00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.240\ndifferent types of scanning.\n\n13\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.620\nThis is where we're gonna focus\nour efforts on, on looking for\n\n14\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.560\nthose live hosts cuz that's a big part\nof the penetration test process right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.990\n>> Yes indeed it is.\n\n16\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.680\nWhat we wanna do is we've located\nquite a few thing coming in.\n\n17\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.190\nWe've got ranges of IPs we have ideas\nof what the environment looks like,\n\n18\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.960\nbut now we wanna go in further and\nsee what systems we wanna focus on.\n\n19\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.560\nSpecifically, which systems\nalong a range of IPs.\n\n20\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.890\nWhich IPs actually do have\na system that's behind it and\n\n21\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.110\nis actually turned on would be\nthe real way to look at that.\n\n22\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.540\nSome systems are either going to be\nin a state where they are, you know,\n\n23\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.150\npowered off or there may not even\nbe anything connected to it.\n\n24\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.530\nIn some cases, you may even have that wake\non land deal that even goes through and\n\n25\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.130\ninterferes with these scans.\n\n26\n00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.400\nAt least the wake on land,\n\n27\n00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.270\nwe do have a way of dealing\nwith that one right with Kali.\n\n28\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.590\nBut the other stuff, yeah,\nit's definitely gonna be a concern.\n\n29\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.840\n>> Like here at ITProTV\nland we've got a class\n\n30\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.715\nC that gives us 250 something\npossible hosts on that class C.\n\n31\n00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.905\n>> The networker subnet,\nwe don't have 250 hosts.\n\n32\n00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:51.625\nSo if you're sitting there scanning each\none of those IP addresses, maybe you're\n\n33\n00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.435\ndoing a port scan and scanning all 65,535\nports on each one of those IP addresses,\n\n34\n00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:59.615\nwell, you're wasting a lot of time because\n\n35\n00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.135\nhalf of those IP addresses\ndon't have a host on them.\n\n36\n00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:05.655\nThe other half might be unplugged and\ngone, or, like you said, turned off.\n\n37\n00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:08.440\nSo important that we figure out\nwhich hosts are up and running so\n\n38\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.880\nwe're not wasting our time and\nwasting our,\n\n39\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.410\nwhoever's paying us to do this penetration\ntest, and wasting their money as well.\n\n40\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.430\n>> Yeah, and so we wanna do this\nthe most efficient way possible so\n\n41\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.280\nwe have to locate those live systems.\n\n42\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.540\nThe really cool thing\nabout it is that we have,\n\n43\n00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.290\njust like we kinda had on the Windows\nside, we had things like Angry IP for\n\n44\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.820\nexample that could do this very,\nvery quickly.\n\n45\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.250\nWe have single use tools\nthat do that on Kali,\n\n46\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.650\nwe also have these multi-purpose tools\nthat can do the same type of thing.\n\n47\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.810\nIt's just a question of\nwhich one you want to use.\n\n48\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.910\nWhich ones will really get the job done?\n\n49\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.540\nWhich one's the fastest in some cases?\n\n50\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.150\nYou've got a lot of possibilities here.\n\n51\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.390\nSo we're going to show\nyou in this segment,\n\n52\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.130\nsome of these different tools that you\nhave and what you can expect from them.\n\n53\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.510\nAnd you can choose later on\nwhich one is gonna be best for\n\n54\n00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.570\nyou in any particular situation.\n\n55\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.740\nYou're probably gonna end up using\na combination of them, to be honest.\n\n56\n00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.970\nSome are gonna work in some situations and\nbe ideal for that.\n\n57\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.180\nOther ones will be better for\nyet other situations,\n\n58\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.480\nso once you see them, you can make\nthe determination which one is which and\n\n59\n00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.680\nof course you can experiment with them,\ntoo.\n\n60\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.210\nThat's the name of the game there.\n\n61\n00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.270\n>> That's the great thing about Kali.\n\n62\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.290\nYou really do have a lot of options\nwhen it comes to the tool I want to use.\n\n63\n00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.540\nThey've got a lot of tools\nbuilt into the system.\n\n64\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.370\nAnd as you've said several times,\nI can even go out and\n\n65\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.790\nget ones that aren't built in, so\n\n66\n00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.270\nno shortages of choices as to what I want\nto use to do our live system scanning.\n\n67\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.670\nSo Sean what you got for us first?\n\n68\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.330\nI know we've seen one,\nfping I think it was, we've seen once.\n\n69\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.200\n>> Yeah, fping we have definitely\nencountered it before and\n\n70\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.320\njust to kind of do a little refresher\nhere I've got it up on my screen.\n\n71\n00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.440\nWhat fping does is, fping, if you recall,\nyou remember that syntax I have up there.\n\n72\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.200\nThat syntax is just gonna tell\nit to sweep that range of IPs.\n\n73\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.110\nYou can see that I have a starting IP and\n\n74\n00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.880\nan ending IP, and\nI'm piping it out to a .txt file.\n\n75\n00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.100\nSo that's just gonna go through and\nrip through that range of IPs and\n\n76\n00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.750\ntell you, hey here you go.\n\n77\n00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.730\nHere's the list of IPs that are live and\nI know there's a machine behind it\n\n78\n00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.330\nbecause they responded to my ICMP request,\nmy ping request.\n\n79\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.680\nSo, if you recall,\nthat I could now go over,\n\n80\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.230\nonce I ran this I can go\nover to my home folder.\n\n81\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.820\nAnd just grab that text file\nout of there and go through it.\n\n82\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.240\nAnything that's in a text\nfile is a live system and\n\n83\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.360\nmy job is done right there at that point.\n\n84\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.280\nThat's one really simple and\neasy way to do it.\n\n85\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.860\nTools like this, fping can do more\nthan what we're showing here.\n\n86\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.090\nAnd we are gonna get into some\nother functionality as we start\n\n87\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.710\ngoing into other areas.\n\n88\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.210\nBut, this is really great at doing\n\n89\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.120\nthis ping sweep because it's really\nlightweight and it's very, very quick.\n\n90\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.130\nSo that's a big benefit because it\ncan go right across the whole range\n\n91\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.260\npretty quickly.\n\n92\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.140\nAnd we like that because it gives us less\ntime that we're kinda sitting around.\n\n93\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.310\nWe can go just quickly go across it,\nhave that list, and be bang,\n\n94\n00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.310\noff to something else.\n\n95\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.040\n>> That wasn't bad.\n\n96\n00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.260\nI mean, a total of like what,\n15 seconds or so there?\n\n97\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.750\nAnd you scanned 250 addresses and\nfound the live host.\n\n98\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.780\nThat's pretty efficient.\n\n99\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.210\n>> Yeah, it was pretty quick,\npretty quick.\n\n100\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.840\nSo we do like that but again, it's not\nthe only one we have available to us.\n\n101\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.480\nThis is just one of many.\n\n102\n00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.570\nJust FYI when you look at fping, we have\n\n103\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.480\na good number of options\nyou can do with this.\n\n104\n00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.610\nSo you aren't just stuck with\ndoing what we were doing here.\n\n105\n00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.970\nYou can add in other things to\ncustomize that scan just a bit more.\n\n106\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.460\nSo, and the reason why I am kind of\nputting this out there for you, is just so\n\n107\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.580\nyou know that you've got other\nways of customizing this and\n\n108\n00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.930\nthis tool can do a lot of\nother things here too.\n\n109\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.940\nSo, you can explore a lot of\ndifferent things in here.\n\n110\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.600\nYou can see in here it will retry\nthings for you if you want to,\n\n111\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.250\nit can see if a host is not responding,\nyou know,\n\n112\n00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.390\nkeep trying you can tell it how\nmany pings sent to each one.\n\n113\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.180\nWhat sizes they are.\n\n114\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.670\nSo there's a lot of little\ninteresting tweaks you can do to it.\n\n115\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.310\nA lot of them are dependent\non yeah delays.\n\n116\n00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.180\nDelay might actually be a good\none because you're spacing it and\n\n117\n00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.230\nspacing out scan a bit more and that way,\n\n118\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.610\nit doesn't look as aggressive so maybe-\n>> Try to avoid those IDSs yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.030\n>> So you've some really cool\nthings that you can do with this so\n\n120\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.360\nyou can play around that.\n\n121\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.380\nA lot of those options up and\n\n122\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.640\nabove what I put here on screen\nwith fping, doing it like\n\n123\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.530\nI have at the bottom, a lot of these other\nones will be on a case by case basis.\n\n124\n00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.530\nYou'll have to know the network and what\nthe nature of that environment is, and\n\n125\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:18.450\ndecide if it's better to leave it as it is\nor to go a little more advanced than this.\n\n126\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.310\nNotice, you can even give it a list.\n\n127\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.610\nThis thing even has an option to get\na list of IPs that you want to scan and\n\n128\n00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.810\nyou can feed those directly into it and\n\n129\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.970\nit will narrow it down to\na specific range if you want.\n\n130\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.968\n>> Yeah so if you had a class B but you\nknew they weren't using the entire 65,535,\n\n131\n00:07:34.968 --> 00:07:38.700\nmaybe the first 1,000 are in use or\nyou think somewhere ballpark.\n\n132\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.820\nYou could skip some of those address and\njust scan certain ones.\n\n133\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.484\n>> Yeah, exactly, you wouldn't\nhave to do all the extra stuff.\n\n134\n00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:51.487\nAnd like I also said, remember that little\ndeal at the end, that little greater than\n\n135\n00:07:51.487 --> 00:07:56.489\nin the text file cuz that's a great way of\nsaving yourself Sudden yourself time later\n\n136\n00:07:56.489 --> 00:08:01.730\non, especially you're gonna wanna go and\nwrite this stuff down, I'm not doing that.\n\n137\n00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.084\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n138\n00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:05.290\n>> So, got a text file you can take and.\n\n139\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.141\n>> The scroll [CROSSTALK] by so\nfast, I can't write that fast.\n\n140\n00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.901\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's like just\n\n141\n00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:13.685\nhold your camera phone up and\nhit enter and hope you get it.\n\n142\n00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:16.230\n>> [LAUGH] All right so, we got F ping.\n\n143\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.990\nWhat's some other tools that Kali offers\nus to do some live host scanning?\n\n144\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.820\n>> Well there are other ones and\nI've got them\n\n145\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.750\npretty much the whole deal,\nall of the running up here.\n\n146\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.170\nBut you know, here's another one.\n\n147\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.890\nI mean, you should recognize\nthat right from the get go is,\n\n148\n00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:43.030\nthere's our old friend NMap\nthat's doing a simple ping sweep.\n\n149\n00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.625\nThat's nothing special about that,\nyou know?\n\n150\n00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.295\nSo if I go ahead and I run that.\n\n151\n00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:53.495\nIt's gonna do the whole thing that we saw,\nyou know, NMap do countless times before.\n\n152\n00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:54.020\nYou know, remember,\n\n153\n00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.715\nNMap can do other types of scans\nthan what we're seeing here.\n\n154\n00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:59.911\nWe're just not using it\nto do any sense scans.\n\n155\n00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.253\nWe're not using it do so\nany pins, or anything like that.\n\n156\n00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:06.150\nWe are just using it to quickly and\neasily.\n\n157\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.630\nYou know, boom, go right across that list,\nright across that range and\n\n158\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.520\ntell us what to find, what it finds.\n\n159\n00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.170\nSo, we've got that information.\n\n160\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.830\nYou should be able to,\nwith this one, do the same deal,\n\n161\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.700\nbe able to pipe that out to a text file.\n\n162\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.850\nThat should be able just to go ahead and\n\n163\n00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.350\nrun that scan for us, and\nit's should be doing that right now.\n\n164\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.330\nAnd so yeah, it went ahead and\nit wrote that out to a file, so\n\n165\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.280\nI just gone ahead and\ncollected that, so there's a.\n\n166\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.670\n>> You were talking earlier about maybe\nsetting up some scripts that run multiple\n\n167\n00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.790\ntools and not sit here and\nenter these commands in one after another.\n\n168\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.430\nAnd this way, if I pipe it out to a file,\nI don't even see that output.\n\n169\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.550\nI can just run my script, each one's\nrunning in the background nice and\n\n170\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.041\nquiet, just generating a bunch of files\nfor me, storing all that information.\n\n171\n00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:48.660\nThat's fantastic.\n\n172\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.300\n>> Yeah, you might as well\nleverage the power of this.\n\n173\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.270\nI definitely would.\n\n174\n00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.240\nAnd for the record, if you don't\nlike using NMap for whatever reason,\n\n175\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.150\nthey'll like use it at the command line.\n\n176\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.220\nYeah, their Zenmap is in there.\n\n177\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.300\nIf you look at the list you'll see Zenmap.\n\n178\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.600\nIt is usually at the bottom some place,\nEndmap and\n\n179\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.830\nZenmap is down there if you want it.\n\n180\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.660\nBut, it's good for you to know it\nthis way, how to customize and\n\n181\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.425\ntweak stuff this way just so\nyou know what the mechanics of it are.\n\n182\n00:10:19.425 --> 00:10:24.590\nBut, you have Zenmap available to you too.\n\n183\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.380\n>> Nmap is just one of those I think\nthey call it the Swiss army knife of\n\n184\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.190\nhacking tools.\n\n185\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.430\nAnd it just does so much.\n\n186\n00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.930\nBut it does a really good job of\ndoing the ping sweeps as well.\n\n187\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.230\nVery customizable there.\n\n188\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.440\n>> Yeah, it's a very powerful tool so\n\n189\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.410\nit's definitely worth getting\nto know that command line.\n\n190\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.560\nBecause there's stuff you can't even\ndo with NMap through the Zenmap gooey.\n\n191\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.292\nIt's just not possible,\n\n192\n00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:52.420\nyou have to jump through a lot of hoops\nto accomplish it or it's not possible.\n\n193\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.272\nYou have to go down to\nthe command line to do it so.\n\n194\n00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:02.320\nIt's really beneficial for\nyou to do it that way.\n\n195\n00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.530\n>> It's not like that\ncommand is all that complex.\n\n196\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.690\nIt's a pretty straightforward one.\n\n197\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.770\nNMap, your range, and a couple switches,\nand you guys remember the switches if you\n\n198\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.800\ntook CEH or you can always use\ndash help from the command line.\n\n199\n00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.170\nTo see the different switches,\nbut basically just doing it.\n\n200\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.650\nThat capital P, remember these\nare case-sensitive commands,\n\n201\n00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.210\nwe've talked about that,\nSean's mentioned that a couple times.\n\n202\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.230\nYou've got that capital P there, so\ndash s for scan and a capital P for\n\n203\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.720\ndoing a pink scan.\n\n204\n00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.770\nPretty straightforward.\n\n205\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.790\n>> Yup, absolutely.\n\n206\n00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:36.380\nAll right, we got NMap, we got Fping, good\ntools, but we're not done yet, are we?\n\n207\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.360\n>> Yeah, there's still a lot of other\nthings in here that can help you\n\n208\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.980\ngo across a range of IPs.\n\n209\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.400\nOne that I wanted to show that\nyou can also use to do this and\n\n210\n00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.390\nI'm just gonna show it against one IP\nbecause I wanna save time on this one,\n\n211\n00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.190\nI can use something called masscan.\n\n212\n00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.070\nI'm gonna tell you, right now,\nbefore you go crazy and\n\n213\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.480\nstart sending me bad stuff through the\nchat room, yeah, this isn't something that\n\n214\n00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.920\nyou, this is not installed by default,\nbut they reference it.\n\n215\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.590\nAnd a lot of the help docs and\nstuff like that for\n\n216\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.640\nKali, why they wanna reference and\nall that.\n\n217\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.620\nAnd then they're like,\nwe're not installing it.\n\n218\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.830\nYou'll figure it out.\n\n219\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.690\nYou're gonna have to go install it so\nyou can use an app kit to get install and\n\n220\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:33.150\ndo masscan that way or you can simply\ngo through the whole system here.\n\n221\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.730\nGo under System Tools and\nAdd/Remove Software, and\n\n222\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.810\njust type in masscan right up here.\n\n223\n00:12:42.175 --> 00:12:47.253\nAnd it will, once you go and\nlook for it, it'll bring it up.\n\n224\n00:12:47.253 --> 00:12:49.297\nI've already installed it so\nyou can see it's checked in.\n\n225\n00:12:49.297 --> 00:12:51.205\nYou're gonna have to do that in yours.\n\n226\n00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:55.405\nSo, be prepared for that.\n\n227\n00:12:56.725 --> 00:13:01.430\nWhat it can do is,\nI can give it a range of IPs and\n\n228\n00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.750\nI can tell what ports,\nthat's what that switch over here does.\n\n229\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.370\nIt says the dash P means ports, and it's\ngonna scan every port from one to 1024.\n\n230\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.570\nI don't wanna do anything\noutside the well known ports.\n\n231\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.050\nI'm just gonna try to make this quick and\neasy.\n\n232\n00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.290\nAnd this is gonna be against my other\ntest system, that Metasploitable system.\n\n233\n00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:25.210\nI still have that running back there so\nI'm just gonna make it nice and\n\n234\n00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.910\neasy and have it target that one.\n\n235\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.715\nSo, if I run it, you can see,\nit's just gonna go through and\n\n236\n00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:34.965\ndo a scan against this.\n\n237\n00:13:34.965 --> 00:13:38.155\nIt's really kinda a neat thing because\n\n238\n00:13:38.155 --> 00:13:42.822\nit's another scanner just like Inmap is,\nbut\n\n239\n00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.082\nthere's some other options in here that\nare worth mentioning and kind of neat.\n\n240\n00:13:47.082 --> 00:13:51.192\nOne of them is that you can tell it\nto randomize how it's going to scan.\n\n241\n00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:56.452\nSo it won't just walk right through\nthe whole list one after the other,\n\n242\n00:13:56.452 --> 00:13:58.012\nit will jump around.\n\n243\n00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:01.430\nThat way it makes it\na little less obvious.\n\n244\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.840\nYou'll even notice when you go look\nat those lists of ports at scan,\n\n245\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.420\nthose are not in order.\n\n246\n00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.610\nIt just went ahead and got them all but\nit didn't do it all in order.\n\n247\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.600\nIt just said hey, here's the ones I found.\n\n248\n00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.990\nNow obviously,\nit did not just puke out a 1,024 ports\n\n249\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:25.270\non this thing, but\nit only showed the ones that are open.\n\n250\n00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:31.760\nBut, you can tell very quickly that those\nare not in order, it just jumped around.\n\n251\n00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.150\nSo, it just doesn't look as obvious.\n\n252\n00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.670\n>> And that helps trying to avoid\nsome of those intrusion detection or\n\n253\n00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.840\nintrusion prevention systems or setting\noff those alarms when you see this.\n\n254\n00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.720\nMassive ping sweep going on.\n\n255\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.510\nThat's pretty good indication\nthat something's gone wrong.\n\n256\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.470\n>> Yeah, that would be a dead\ngiveaway if you saw it just go right\n\n257\n00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.040\non down from one to 100 in one shot.\n\n258\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.040\nIt went right on down in sequence.\n\n259\n00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.460\nThere's not a ton of network\ntraffic that's gonna emulate\n\n260\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.910\nthat type of behavior\non a day to day basis.\n\n261\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.810\nSo, if they see that it's like that's\nunusual, you're now got eyeballs on you.\n\n262\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:13.250\nBut if it's random, that's closer the way\na normal network traffic is gonna look.\n\n263\n00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.590\nSo, it's a little less conspicuous.\n\n264\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.220\nNot saying it can't be picked up.\n\n265\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.070\nI'm just saying it's\na little less conspicuous.\n\n266\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.050\nSo, we're trying to kinda hide there.\n\n267\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.750\nSo, that's masscan and\nyou'll notice that masscan again,\n\n268\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.830\njust to kinda bring up all the options.\n\n269\n00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.990\nI mean it doesnt have a ton of options.\n\n270\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.128\nBut you can see in there that it also\ncan share information with NMap,\n\n271\n00:15:36.128 --> 00:15:39.761\nso you can export stuff\nfrom NMap into masscan for\n\n272\n00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:43.854\nfurther analysis or\nto manipulate it a different way.\n\n273\n00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:51.553\nYou can also see how you can tell it to\nscan a whole subnet by doing the slash.\n\n274\n00:15:51.553 --> 00:15:53.248\nThat's the slash format.\n\n275\n00:15:53.248 --> 00:15:56.637\nAnd you can see it can read banners and\nall sorts of things out of this.\n\n276\n00:15:56.637 --> 00:16:00.537\nIt's some pretty, you know,\ngood stuff for you here.\n\n277\n00:16:00.537 --> 00:16:01.221\n>> Very good.\n\n278\n00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.118\nVery good.\n>> That's and\n\n279\n00:16:03.118 --> 00:16:06.017\none of the really cool things about it.\n\n280\n00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:11.775\nThat when it goes across a range of IPs,\nit is pretty quick.\n\n281\n00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:13.018\nIt is pretty quick.\n\n282\n00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:16.698\nThey, this is the one they\nmake some wild claims about.\n\n283\n00:16:16.698 --> 00:16:24.180\nThat they'll say can go across the whole\nInternet in like no time at all.\n\n284\n00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.290\nIn fact if you look really closely at it,\n\n285\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:33.350\nat the description you can see\nat the bottom, the description.\n\n286\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.430\nIf you can't read that, it says,\nthis is the fastest Internet port scanner.\n\n287\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.980\nIt can scan the entire\nInternet in under six minutes,\n\n288\n00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.020\ntransmitting 10 million\npackets per second.\n\n289\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.635\n>> That's it, we gotta test it now.\n\n290\n00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:46.190\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna break out my timer.\n\n291\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.290\nYeah, if the Internet\ndoesn't work tomorrow.\n\n292\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's cuz we were\n\n293\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.086\nputting it to the test.\n\n294\n00:16:51.086 --> 00:16:55.550\n[LAUGH]\nSo that's,\n\n295\n00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.620\nwe really don't have\na way of testing that.\n\n296\n00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.520\nBut, okay.\n\n297\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.880\n>> Yeah, it's a good claim, anyway.\n\n298\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.400\n>> It sounds nice, you know?\n\n299\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.930\nBut.\n[LAUGH] Anyway, that's masscan.\n\n300\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:09.670\nAgain, you have to install that,\nbut it's right there for\n\n301\n00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.710\nyou to bring the bear\nwhenever you need it.\n\n302\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.640\nBut who knows, maybe you decide this\nis not the one you wanna use it.\n\n303\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.010\nMaybe you wanna stick with Nmap.\n\n304\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.720\nA lot of people have that warm fuzzy\nfeeling when they think of Nmap and\n\n305\n00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.850\nthey wanna stick with it.\n\n306\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.990\nI can't blame you because it does\njust about everything we need to do,\n\n307\n00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.640\nunless it scanned the whole Internet.\n\n308\n00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.367\nThen of course, it does it in under\nseven minutes so it's a little slower.\n\n309\n00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:31.203\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n310\n00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:34.388\nIt takes [INAUDIBLE],\nit's not even worth my time.\n\n311\n00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:37.230\nYeah, but Nmap is one of those ones that a\nlot of people are comfortable with because\n\n312\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.520\nit's been around for a while,\nso people are familiar with it.\n\n313\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.880\nIt's so straightforward I think and, as\nyou said, it's several different ports so\n\n314\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.390\nWindows people have probably played with\nNmap even if you weren't a Linux person.\n\n315\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.720\nIt's a really good one.\n\n316\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.680\nIt's a good one to use.\n\n317\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.260\nBut masscan it, we'll give it try.\n\n318\n00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.070\nAnd then we're not stuck there either,\nright?\n\n319\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.370\nWe have other options we can do.\n\n320\n00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.190\nWe saw fping, what about,\nwhat's another we can try there, Sean?\n\n321\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.260\n>> Yeah,\nwe've got a lot of other things in here.\n\n322\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.125\nSo, we did fping so we've got that\none covered, we've got NMAP, so\n\n323\n00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:10.955\nhere's another one called Unicorn Scan.\n\n324\n00:18:10.955 --> 00:18:15.885\nI don't know where they get these\nnames from, but in any case,\n\n325\n00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:17.605\nwe'll go ahead and\nwe'll start this one up.\n\n326\n00:18:18.717 --> 00:18:23.677\nWhat this one does, is this one\ngathers other types of information.\n\n327\n00:18:23.677 --> 00:18:24.647\n>> Like having a unicorn?\n\n328\n00:18:24.647 --> 00:18:27.607\n>> Yeah, how many unicorns you've got.\n\n329\n00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:32.907\nWhat you can do with this one is,\nI go to, and\n\n330\n00:18:32.907 --> 00:18:40.670\nI went through and I told it to, well I\nhad it looking at a specific interface,\n\n331\n00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.350\nlooking at specific interfaces.\n\n332\n00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:49.060\nIf you look all the way at top\n\n333\n00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.390\nhere, there's the interface it's using and\nit went through and\n\n334\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.240\nit's targeting this IP address,\n\n335\n00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.540\nwhich happens to be the other one,\nmy metasploitable system.\n\n336\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:09.300\nSo, what I have is I have it\nwhere it did another port scan.\n\n337\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.060\nYou can with this one\ntell it to scan a range\n\n338\n00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.070\nof IPs looking to see what it can find.\n\n339\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.660\nIt can look to see if they're just\nawake or it can look to see if there\n\n340\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.880\nactually is something more there\nthan it needs to take a look at.\n\n341\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.560\nIn this case, I told it to go ahead or\ndidn't put any limitations on it.\n\n342\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.650\nI said just go ahead and look at this IP\naddress and tell me what ports you find.\n\n343\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.730\nAnd that's what it did.\n\n344\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:35.520\nAnd you can see this one,\n\n345\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.180\nit's actually telling me that\ncertain ones are closed and open.\n\n346\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.780\nSo I'm getting a good\namount of information.\n\n347\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.680\nStuff we would expect from a port scan.\n\n348\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.780\nI'm not gonna say we'd\nexpect all these ports, but\n\n349\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.940\nyou can see stuff that's open and\nclosed right on down the list.\n\n350\n00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.988\nYou know, so we are, and I'll just\nscroll through it really quickly.\n\n351\n00:19:55.988 --> 00:19:58.940\n>> I tell you, one of the things I noticed\nright off the bat that's good about\n\n352\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.740\nputting the actual protocol name\nout there next to the port.\n\n353\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.120\nA lot of those scanners kind\nof leave that up to you.\n\n354\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.160\nYou gotta go back and\nfigure out what that port is.\n\n355\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.330\nIt tells you it's open.\n\n356\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.960\nThat's got that protocol right next to it,\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n357\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.580\n>> Yeah.\nYou'll see on this one when it can see\n\n358\n00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:19.290\nsomething about it, when it actually\nknows what it is it will put it there.\n\n359\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.940\nBut when it gets up to a certain point\nyou have, what, the well known and\n\n360\n00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.220\nthe registered and the dynamically.\n\n361\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.740\nThe dynamic ones, it ain't gonna.\n\n362\n00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.440\nIt shouldn't be putting\nanything out there.\n\n363\n00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.230\nUnless you're told to do banner grabs,\nthen it might.\n\n364\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.880\nBut it should for\nthe most part in the register.\n\n365\n00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.730\nIt should put the service\ninformation out there.\n\n366\n00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.070\nSo we see that, and\nwe see some of them in the register.\n\n367\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.320\nBut outside of that, yeah it's unknown.\n\n368\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.190\nSo yeah, if that port that says unknown,\n\n369\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:57.730\nsaid it was open and all we're doing when\nwe start doing a scan against a port,\n\n370\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.780\nwhen we bounce a packet off of it it\nwill tell us whether if it's open or\n\n371\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.470\nclosed regardless of what's behind it.\n\n372\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.770\nIt doesn't matter, if the door's unlocked,\nthe door's unlocked.\n\n373\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.340\nIf it's closed it's closed.\n\n374\n00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.900\nI don't care if there's anything\nin the room behind it or not.\n\n375\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.860\nThat doorknob turns or it doesn't.\n\n376\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.200\nSo that's where it can be unknown and\nstill say open.\n\n377\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.290\nIt means that now if you see\nsomething here that says open,\n\n378\n00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.170\nthen you're gonna have\nto do a banner grab and\n\n379\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:30.160\ndo some closer examination to see\nexactly what the nature of that is.\n\n380\n00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.710\nYou know how to do some of that already.\n\n381\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.880\nAgain from the CEH and we're going to\nsee some other stuff here that we can do\n\n382\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.240\nto make that more useful to us.\n\n383\n00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.020\nAnd so that is our unicorn scan.\n\n384\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.810\nLike I said interesting name.\n\n385\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.520\n>> It is.\n\n386\n00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.390\nIt is there.\n\n387\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.320\nYou know.\nBut hey, you gotta name it something, and\n\n388\n00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.650\nall the other good names were taken.\n\n389\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.205\nSo unicorn scan it is.\n\n390\n00:21:53.205 --> 00:21:55.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> See, we should start doing,\n\n391\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.840\nlike give aways or contests for every.\n\n392\n00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.570\nThis one could have been like\na can of that unicorn meat.\n\n393\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.290\nFrom Amazon.\n\n394\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.540\nFirst I did guy care with a keyword or\nsomething, or whatever.\n\n395\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.025\nYou could say, hey,\nhere's a can of unicorn meat.\n\n396\n00:22:08.025 --> 00:22:11.540\n>> [LAUGH]\nAll right, so\n\n397\n00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.720\nlots of really cool tools that we can\nuse again to scan for live systems.\n\n398\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.010\nImportant part of that scanning and\nnumeration phase because\n\n399\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.000\nwe've gotta figure out what systems\nare up and what systems are turned on.\n\n400\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.160\nIf they're turned off,\nyou can't really do anything against them.\n\n401\n00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.869\nYou gotta figure out which ones are live.\n\n402\n00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.220\nAny other tools we want to\nthrow out there for this one?\n\n403\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.650\nI know there's a ton, but anything\nwe want to demo or do anything with?\n\n404\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.730\n>> This is just one I'm also throwing out\nhere because it's another way of finding\n\n405\n00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.040\nstuff that's live.\n\n406\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.390\nThis is NetDiscover.\n\n407\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.850\nAll you gotta do is just\ntype in netdiscover, or\n\n408\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.080\nyou can grab it off\nthe pull downs if you want.\n\n409\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.660\nSo what this does is that you can see in\nhere I've got two virtual systems on here.\n\n410\n00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.870\nIt's not picking anything up outside\nthose virtual systems cuz they're both\n\n411\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.960\nrestricted to this specific host.\n\n412\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.980\nSo it's only seeing those two\nthat are in the VMware and\n\n413\n00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.140\nthat's why you can see it the MAC vendor.\n\n414\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.160\nIt's looking at the OUI,\nthe first section of the MAC address and\n\n415\n00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.400\nsaying well that's\nidentified with VM ware and\n\n416\n00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:22.240\nthe 130 is my metasploitable system and\nthe DOT 2 is this system.\n\n417\n00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.750\nSo it's telling me that those two\nare here, and it's another way of,\n\n418\n00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:32.320\nyou could put something out there and\npick up these art broadcasts and\n\n419\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.335\nstart locating things on that at networks.\n\n420\n00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:40.997\nSo it could be another useful way of doing\nit if you can't do some of the other\n\n421\n00:23:40.997 --> 00:23:41.516\nstuff.\n\n422\n00:23:41.516 --> 00:23:42.721\n>> Okay.\n\n423\n00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:46.691\n>> So that's just another one\nI kind of wanted to throw out.\n\n424\n00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.945\n>> And it just grabs whatever\nnetwork you're hooked up to?\n\n425\n00:23:48.945 --> 00:23:50.482\nYeah.\n>> You just say netdiscover and\n\n426\n00:23:50.482 --> 00:23:50.987\nit goes and.\n\n427\n00:23:50.987 --> 00:23:58.019\n>> Yeah, it'll just monitor what's\nactually there on the network.\n\n428\n00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.343\nI can't recall.\n\n429\n00:23:59.343 --> 00:24:06.150\nWhat I can do it right here, so\nyou can do some tweaking with it.\n\n430\n00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:10.370\nSo you can tell it to do some things.\n\n431\n00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.410\nYou can go arrange by [INAUDIBLE].\n\n432\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:12.980\nYou can see up top.\n\n433\n00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.800\nBut because it is netdiscover,\n\n434\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.070\none of the things it does is\nlook at those ARP requests.\n\n435\n00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.230\nYeah, you'd be limited to\nwhatever subnet that that's on.\n\n436\n00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.150\n>> It defaults to whatever\nnetwork you're on.\n\n437\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.770\nIf you wanted to try to\ndo something different,\n\n438\n00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.111\nyou could give it a range or something.\n\n439\n00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:33.270\n>> Yeah, and if you're working with IPs,\nthen yeah, you could go off that subnet.\n\n440\n00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.960\nBut since ARP request, the broadcast's\nare gonna go, there's not much you can do.\n\n441\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.611\nIt's stuck with just that-\n>> Unless you got a bunch of hubs on your\n\n442\n00:24:40.611 --> 00:24:42.340\nnetwork, and maybe don't use switches.\n\n443\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.169\nCuz I know a lot of networks\ndon't use switches.\n\n444\n00:24:44.169 --> 00:24:45.461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding.\n\n445\n00:24:45.461 --> 00:24:47.793\n>> Yeah, if you've got hubs on\nyour network, I will come over and\n\n446\n00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:50.087\nI will smack the computer out of\nyour hand and go, go fix that!\n\n447\n00:24:50.087 --> 00:24:53.207\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but, anyway, so those are just-\n\n448\n00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:54.872\n>> Shh, don't tell Shaun,\n\n449\n00:24:54.872 --> 00:24:58.342\nwe've got a lot of nodes\non my network here.\n\n450\n00:24:58.342 --> 00:25:01.070\nAll right, well, Shaun,\na lot of great information there.\n\n451\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:06.810\nScanning for live hosts, an important part\nof our scanning and enumeration phase.\n\n452\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.090\nWe talked about scanning and\ndifferent types of scanning.\n\n453\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.520\nLive host scanning is a big part of this.\n\n454\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.400\nSo anything else we want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n455\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.900\n>> Well, we covered a whole\nbunch of ground in here.\n\n456\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.080\nIf you look under\nthe information gathering menu,\n\n457\n00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:27.060\nyou'll see that there's some other ones\non here that we just didn't get to.\n\n458\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.900\nThere's other ones for\ndoing stuff with DNS.\n\n459\n00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.980\nOf course, they have some, well,\n\n460\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.900\nthe only ones we haven't\ncovered are the ones with DNS.\n\n461\n00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.230\nAnd there's one called Dmitry on there,\nso you could try those ones out too.\n\n462\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.170\nThose ones are different methods\nof doing network scanning,\n\n463\n00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.710\nso it brings so much stuff to bear,\nand there's just\n\n464\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.000\ninformation gathering with the network\nscanners, that's just a few of them.\n\n465\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.300\nThere's other ones that are stuck\nin other submenus that also do\n\n466\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.710\ndifferent forms of scanning.\n\n467\n00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.220\nSo it all depends on really what\nyou're trying to accomplish.\n\n468\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.780\nI mean, you've got so many, that's why\nI said, it may take you some time,\n\n469\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.100\nbut you really should start experimenting\nwith some of these different tools to see\n\n470\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.140\njust what they offer you.\n\n471\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.390\nYou might actually find something that's\na lot better than what you're using.\n\n472\n00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.310\nSo there you go.\n\n473\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.220\n>> Yeah.\nExplore.\n\n474\n00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.160\nWe can sleep when we're dead.\n\n475\n00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.140\nWe got tools to explore in here.\n\n476\n00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.460\nAll right, well, tell you what, Shawn,\nthat's probably a good place for\n\n477\n00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.660\nus to call it wrap on\nthis particular episode.\n\n478\n00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.090\nLot of good information there.\n\n479\n00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:31.270\nScanning for live hose.\n\n480\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.520\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n481\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.630\n>> And I'm Shawn Arellano.\n\n482\n00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.734\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:14.935\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nand with me today, is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:16.910\nSean Oriyano, how are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.749\n>> Doing pretty good, how are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.800\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.930\nGot another exciting\nepisode coming your way,\n\n8\n00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.860\ncontinuing on with our Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.040\nAnd in this episode we're\ngonna look at enumeration.\n\n10\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.019\nNow I know, Sean, earlier we were talking\nabout scanning and enumeration and\n\n11\n00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.685\nkinda combining them together\ninto this one phase.\n\n12\n00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:39.010\nBut they aren't quite the same thing,\nthey're similar.\n\n13\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.190\n>> Yeah, they're closely linked but\nthey're not exactly the same thing.\n\n14\n00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.350\nBut they're very, very closely linked,\n\n15\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.630\nI think that's probably\na fair way to put it.\n\n16\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.623\nSo you will do scanning which is where\nyou are kind of doing, in comparison\n\n17\n00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:58.960\nto enumeration at least, it's more of\na superficial type look at things.\n\n18\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.550\nEnumeration is now going a little deeper.\n\n19\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.640\nSo they're very closely related, but\nyeah, they're not the exact same thing.\n\n20\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.746\n>> It's like scanning for live system and\nthen once I found that live system,\n\n21\n00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:13.817\nmaybe enumerating all the local user\naccounts that exist on that system.\n\n22\n00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:19.368\n>> Exactly, yeah you're definitely\ndrilling in a lot deeper at this point.\n\n23\n00:01:19.368 --> 00:01:23.186\nSo scanning would be akin\nto finding a target and\n\n24\n00:01:23.186 --> 00:01:26.531\nenumeration is going after that target.\n\n25\n00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:32.196\nSo, yeah, they both definitely are very,\nvery closely linked but,\n\n26\n00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:37.201\nyeah, there is some differences,\nso pay attention to that.\n\n27\n00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:41.056\n>> And I'm sure Kali gives us plenty of\noptions when it comes to enumeration,\n\n28\n00:01:41.056 --> 00:01:43.257\ngives us choices of what\ntools we can use and\n\n29\n00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:47.400\nprobably depending on what we're\nreally trying to enumerate as well.\n\n30\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.721\n>> Oh yeah, I mean again, we've been\ndown this road that Kali has all these\n\n31\n00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:58.250\ntools that it can make available to\nyou and does make available to you.\n\n32\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.450\nIt's just a question of which ones you're\ngonna use, so this is really no exception.\n\n33\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.109\nI mean, there's stuff that's in\nKali that I really don't have\n\n34\n00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:12.437\nan effective way to demo it here,\nbut I am gonna bring it up.\n\n35\n00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:15.945\nAnd I'm gonna show you today,\nin this segment,\n\n36\n00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:21.520\nI'm gonna show you some tools that\nare good for doing enumeration, period.\n\n37\n00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.210\nSo we're gonna hit the big ones,\nwe're gonna talk about some other ones.\n\n38\n00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.710\nAnd you can decide which ones\nare gonna be of use to you.\n\n39\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.850\nSo that's what we're gonna go,\nwe're gonna do some enumeration and\n\n40\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.695\nsee what we can extract out of those\ntargets that we've previously selected.\n\n41\n00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:42.110\nCuz we did do a lot with scanning\npreviously to find targets.\n\n42\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.763\nI mean, just think of what we did\nwith things like math scan, and\n\n43\n00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:48.930\nNmap, all those other ones.\n\n44\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.490\nWe've gotten quite a bit of\ninformation we're sitting on and\n\n45\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.120\nwe can just carry that\nforward to the next step.\n\n46\n00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.160\nAnd just to kind of mention it, to show\nyou how closely linked scanning and\n\n47\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.360\nenumeration are, some of the tools\nthat you use to do enumeration\n\n48\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.280\nare the exact same ones\nyou use to do scanning.\n\n49\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270\nYou're just tacking on\na few more switches,\n\n50\n00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.900\nto make it do the enumeration process.\n\n51\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.920\nNmap would be a great example of that.\n\n52\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.430\nNmap can do banner grabs and\nsome other stuff.\n\n53\n00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.210\nYou just have to know what switches to\ntack on there to get it to do that.\n\n54\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.450\nBut it's very capable of\ndoing port scanning and\n\n55\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.560\nscanning ports across ranges of IPs and\neven doing a simple ping scan.\n\n56\n00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.880\nSo it's popping up in three\ndifferent areas quite easily.\n\n57\n00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.360\nSo, we definitely have\noptions here to help us out.\n\n58\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.050\n>> I love multipurpose tools.\n\n59\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.290\nThat just means I've got one tool\nto learn and I can use it for\n\n60\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.150\nall different things versus some\nof those single purpose tools.\n\n61\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.830\nAnd those single purpose tools,\nobviously, have a place.\n\n62\n00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.124\nSome of them do their one thing a little\nbit better cuz that's what they focus on.\n\n63\n00:03:53.124 --> 00:03:56.803\nBut I tell you, when I find a tool\nthat can do lots of different stuff,\n\n64\n00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:58.458\nI usually grab that one quick.\n\n65\n00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:02.418\n>> Yeah, it's always good to\nhave those in your pocket,\n\n66\n00:04:02.418 --> 00:04:04.925\nto have those multipurpose ones.\n\n67\n00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:09.626\nYeah, Nmap, that's one of the reasons why\nit's such a favorite is that it's that\n\n68\n00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.060\nSwiss Army knife.\n\n69\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.048\nIt's got so\nmany different things it can do,\n\n70\n00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:18.936\nand does well, that it's found a place\nin all these different tool kits.\n\n71\n00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:23.373\nBut like I've stated before,\nmake sure that you, A,\n\n72\n00:04:23.373 --> 00:04:29.460\nunderstand what you're looking for\nno matter what tool you're using.\n\n73\n00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.701\nSo you should understand\nwhen you're doing scanning,\n\n74\n00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.890\nwhat types of things you expect to get.\n\n75\n00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.790\nJust like enumeration, what type of\nthings are you expecting to accomplish?\n\n76\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.640\nYou have to have those down.\n\n77\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.600\nOnce you've got those down,\n\n78\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.690\nthen you can start looking at\nwhat tools you want to use.\n\n79\n00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.800\nAnd if you decide that Nmap's the one that\nyou like cuz it does so much, go for it.\n\n80\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.880\nBut still,\nI strongly recommend that you know\n\n81\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.770\ntwo to three other tools on top of\nthat that do the same type of thing.\n\n82\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.600\nAt a minimum that do the same type\nof thing because it gives you\n\n83\n00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.270\nmore flexibility.\n\n84\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.794\nAnd, who knows?\n\n85\n00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:07.310\nMaybe there's gonna be\na point in time where\n\n86\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.230\nthat tool that's your\nfavorite just doesn't work.\n\n87\n00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.290\nIt happens to every one of these tools.\n\n88\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.560\nEvery last one of them will\nhave its off day where, for\n\n89\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.700\nsome reason, it's just not gonna work.\n\n90\n00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.475\nAnd then you need to switch over to\nsomething else, you have to be flexible.\n\n91\n00:05:23.475 --> 00:05:25.945\nSo have your favorite, your go-to, but\n\n92\n00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:28.709\nalso be prepared to switch\nif the need arises.\n\n93\n00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.001\n>> Oh, good, all right so,\nwith this list of tools we can use,\n\n94\n00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.500\nwhere the heck do we start?\n\n95\n00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.060\nWhat's the first one you want to show us?\n\n96\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.090\n>> We've got a number of\ntools we can show, but\n\n97\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.990\nI've kinda tried to narrow it down to\nabout three of them for right now that I\n\n98\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.730\nthink are stand outs or have something\nof value that is worth pointing out.\n\n99\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.380\nOne of the ones I kinda wanna\nmention right out of the gate,\n\n100\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.880\nit kinda fits in the whole idea\nof scanning and enumeration.\n\n101\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.710\nIt kind of straddles the line between\nthe two, which is kinda weird,\n\n102\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.620\nbut it does do it, is one called Miranda.\n\n103\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.615\nMiranda, I have it up on my screen here\njust to kinda show you what it looks like.\n\n104\n00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:15.890\nS, I've got Miranda sitting up there.\n\n105\n00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.300\nIf you go ahead and hit Enter on it,\nwhat this one does is you can\n\n106\n00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.570\ntype in msearch which will\ntell it to go out there and\n\n107\n00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.100\nlook for universal plug and play devices.\n\n108\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.930\nSo if there is anything in range on this\nnetwork that is a universal plug and\n\n109\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.480\nplay, it will go out and find it.\n\n110\n00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.648\nRight now,\nthis is actually doing that scan.\n\n111\n00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:42.214\nIt says it's restricted to this\nmachine because of the way\n\n112\n00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:44.580\nthe virtualization's set up.\n\n113\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.660\nIt's not gonna go out on the network\n\n114\n00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.300\nout here that we have running [LAUGH]\nin ITPro and start looking for things.\n\n115\n00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.052\nWe don't really need that\ntype of problem today.\n\n116\n00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:59.240\nBut [COUGH] if this was a network that we\nwere pen testing, this thing, it would be\n\n117\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.834\nsending out these probe requests looking\nfor those universal plug and play devices.\n\n118\n00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:08.070\nAnd then it would start\ndisplaying them as it found them.\n\n119\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.810\nIt'd be a continuous process\nuntil I just went over here and\n\n120\n00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.023\nhit Ctrl+C and killed it.\n\n121\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.120\nSo that's kind of, you can see it's\na scan, but also because the way it would\n\n122\n00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.240\nfind devices it would give you\ninformation about that device.\n\n123\n00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.320\nIt's also doing a very,\nit's doing enumeration,\n\n124\n00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.430\na very cursory level of enumeration,\nbut it is doing it nonetheless.\n\n125\n00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.470\nSo that would help you\nlocate these devices.\n\n126\n00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.600\nUniversal plug and play is one of those\nthings that's kind of interesting.\n\n127\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.588\nIf you look around,\nit's one of those things that,\n\n128\n00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:48.040\nit's been said that it is a problem,\na big security risk.\n\n129\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.933\nBecause of the fact that you can\nfind the devices quite easily on\n\n130\n00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:56.174\nyour network using something like this.\n\n131\n00:07:56.174 --> 00:08:00.972\nSo, it's been in Windows for,\nI think since XP, it's been around.\n\n132\n00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:05.366\nAnd it's one of those things that you\ncan easily block it just by shutting off\n\n133\n00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:08.630\nthe service in Windows so this won't work.\n\n134\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.415\nBut, a lot of people don't do that, yeah.\n\n135\n00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:15.480\n>> Yeah, It's one of those darn services\nthat, we talk about it like in our\n\n136\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.280\nsecurity plus classes and other\nsecurity related shows that we've done.\n\n137\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.840\nWe draw that triangle, we put ease\nof use at one point, security at\n\n138\n00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.620\nthe second point of the triangle, and\nfunctionality at that third point.\n\n139\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.432\nWell, universal plug and play is\nconvenient, easy to use, right, and so\n\n140\n00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:35.519\nthat means as we move towards\nthat point of the triangle, and\n\n141\n00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.930\nat that point of the triangle,\nwe're moving away from security.\n\n142\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.790\nSo it's great because it makes\nit very easy to find devices,\n\n143\n00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.060\nto configure devices to talk together.\n\n144\n00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.780\nBut because it's so easy, there's not\na lot of security built in to it and\n\n145\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.690\nalso it means it could be a vulnerability.\n\n146\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.740\nSo one of those things you gotta decide\nif it's really worth using or not.\n\n147\n00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.520\nAnd here's a tool that shows you how easy\nit is to find those on your network.\n\n148\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.510\nSo, if you are using that, bad guys,\nor pen testers, or what have you,\n\n149\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.130\ncan find them pretty easily.\n\n150\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.050\n>> Yeah, you can start picking up\ndevices that have been plugged\n\n151\n00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.910\nin without too much effort.\n\n152\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.170\nSo that's what this would be useful for.\n\n153\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:21.870\nSo be aware of this, this is one even at\nif, those of you who follow Steve Gibson.\n\n154\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.539\nThis is one that he actually talked to\nMicrosoft about was universal plug and\n\n155\n00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:29.687\nplay, and that it was a vulnerability and\nit was something that just wasn't needed.\n\n156\n00:09:29.687 --> 00:09:32.990\nBut Microsoft went with it anyway.\n\n157\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.510\nAnd so\nwe've had to deal with some of the mess.\n\n158\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.770\nAnd he wasn't the only one,\njust to be fair, that pointed it out.\n\n159\n00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.370\nMicrosoft didn't really worry about,\nlisten to anybody on it.\n\n160\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.720\nLike, yeah, whatever, we don't care.\n\n161\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.490\nThat type of deal,\n\n162\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.550\nso this is something that's specifically\ndesigned to locate those devices.\n\n163\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.230\nAnd like I said, it straddles that line,\nthere's scanning and enumeration.\n\n164\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.006\nIt's literally doing both of\nthese things at the same time.\n\n165\n00:09:59.006 --> 00:09:59.702\n>> Nice.\n\n166\n00:09:59.702 --> 00:10:05.600\n>> So, that's Miranda and\nyou can choose to use that.\n\n167\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.630\nThis is something that, to be honest, you\ncan probably, if you're doing your sandbox\n\n168\n00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:15.038\ntype experimentation,\nif you've got Windows boxes on there.\n\n169\n00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:20.005\nThis would probably be very useful for\nyou and to try on that home network that\n\n170\n00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:24.390\nyou've got set aside or that lab you have\nat work that has Windows devices on it.\n\n171\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.350\nBecause they definitely have that running\nunless you've shut it off otherwise.\n\n172\n00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.810\nYou can turn this on and\n\n173\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.580\nstart locating those devices\nusing universal plug and play.\n\n174\n00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.330\n>> And I know Roku devices will show up\non there, some of those wireless access\n\n175\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.890\npoints, if you haven't disabled\nthose type of features.\n\n176\n00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.740\nThat push button, connect type thing,\nthose all rely on that universal plug and\n\n177\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.910\nplay, and they're gonna show up,\n\n178\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.710\npeople are gonna be able\nto find them pretty easy.\n\n179\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:55.020\n>> Yeah, so it would be a really\ninteresting exercise for you to try and\n\n180\n00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.440\njust see that, hey,\nthis opens up a huge can of worms for you.\n\n181\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.199\nSo, that's Miranda, but we do have other\ntools available that can do stuff for us.\n\n182\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:14.829\nI've got, so I'll close out Miranda,\nthis is another one called DMitry.\n\n183\n00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:19.420\nDMitry is another way of extracting\ninformation, and what I'm doing here is\n\n184\n00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.260\nI'm actually targeting, again,\nmy Metasploitable system.\n\n185\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.190\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I will turn\nthis thing on, and it goes through and\n\n186\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.810\ndoes a quick, just boom, right on through.\n\n187\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:36.576\nBut I am going to go ahead and move right\nup, we're gonna have it right there.\n\n188\n00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:38.915\nThere's DMitry.\n\n189\n00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:40.130\nI like it.\n\n190\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.671\nThere be some deep magic going on,\nall right.\n\n191\n00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:44.590\n>> [LAUGH] That is nice.\n\n192\n00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.480\nAnd what is that right after?\n\n193\n00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.550\nI'm trying to get that command for\nour users out there.\n\n194\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:53.290\nLet's see, it's dmitry -winsep-\n>> W-I-N-S-E-P-F-B.\n\n195\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.610\n>> F-B, okay.\n\n196\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.881\n>> What those are,\nif you run DMitry with the dash help,\n\n197\n00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:02.911\neach one of those is a flag you can use\nthat's revealing something in the results.\n\n198\n00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:06.563\n>> Okay.\n>> So this one is using multiple flags, so\n\n199\n00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:11.780\nall you really have to remember\noff that is look at the format.\n\n200\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.762\nYou can do dash and just string\na bunch of flags together, and boom.\n\n201\n00:12:15.762 --> 00:12:21.640\nAnd so anyway,\nwhat we have is we have DMitry running,\n\n202\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.750\nand when we start going to look,\nwhat does it have?\n\n203\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.570\nIt has, well, who is information.\n\n204\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:30.260\nWell, okay, well, that's good information.\n\n205\n00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.450\nIn fact, if you look at that right up top,\nI mean look at what we have here.\n\n206\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.450\nThis is something that\nif we really wanted to,\n\n207\n00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.330\neven though it's technically\ncategorized as an enumeration tool.\n\n208\n00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.002\nIt's something that is giving us,\n\n209\n00:12:43.002 --> 00:12:46.791\nsomething that we could have used back in\nour, way early on in our reconnaissance\n\n210\n00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:49.930\nphase cuz there's an address block\nsitting right up there up top.\n\n211\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.880\nSo that would be something that'd be,\nhey, that's really nice for us to have.\n\n212\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.380\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n213\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.900\nWe keep going through,\nwe can see other information.\n\n214\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.930\nThis is Internet assigned names and\nblah blah blah.\n\n215\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.090\n>> Through their registrars\nare with their DNS names?\n\n216\n00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.620\n>> Yeah.\n\n217\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.690\nSo, we're getting that.\n\n218\n00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.670\nThen we have a port scan, but\n\n219\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:19.140\nyou'll notice that this port scan\nisn't just a regular, old port scan.\n\n220\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.570\nThere's more to it here than\njust doing a regular port scan.\n\n221\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:24.710\nWhat is it doing?\n\n222\n00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.340\nYou can see that it's going beyond that.\n\n223\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.010\nIt hasn't just done a banner grab.\n\n224\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.640\nIt's pulled information off that\nservice and it's fingerprinted it.\n\n225\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.535\n>> Wow.\n>> And so,\n\n226\n00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:39.140\nyou can see right there off that system,\nit knows.\n\n227\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.170\nIt not only knows it's got some\nbasic stuff and what ports are open.\n\n228\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:48.610\nIt's telling it knows about SSH on there,\nit's got version information after it.\n\n229\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:54.350\nIt has that, it's got other\nstuff on there with looks like\n\n230\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:14:00.030\nan ESMTP information for\nyour link to the mail service.\n\n231\n00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.070\nThere's FTP sitting in there.\n\n232\n00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.390\n>> Wow.\n>> I mean it's really identified stuff,\n\n233\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.000\nthat's not just a port scan.\n\n234\n00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.110\nA port scan is below this,\nthis has gone to the next level and\n\n235\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.060\nsaid, okay, I'm going to extract\nsome more information for you.\n\n236\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.662\nSo it's got a good amount\nof information for us, and\n\n237\n00:14:21.662 --> 00:14:24.808\nso that's just the same scan I ran.\n\n238\n00:14:24.808 --> 00:14:29.565\nNow if we do, let me just go and\ntake all of that off,\n\n239\n00:14:29.565 --> 00:14:35.212\nif you run it, those flags that\nyou saw after that winsepfb,\n\n240\n00:14:35.212 --> 00:14:39.120\nyou can see right there what they all are.\n\n241\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.460\nYou can see that it's\ngot all of them running.\n\n242\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.950\n>> Okay.\n\n243\n00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.470\n>> We just strung all of those\ntogether to get a result.\n\n244\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.860\nYou can use just a portion of those,\nif you want.\n\n245\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.330\nYou don't have to use them all.\n\n246\n00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.950\nYou can even see that we can\nadjust the timing on that, too.\n\n247\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.120\n>> Nice, so you don't have to do a -i,\na -w, a -n, you can just string all\n\n248\n00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.010\nthe parameters that you want for that\ncommand right there in that one command.\n\n249\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.810\n>> Yeah, so\nit makes it a little more easier,\n\n250\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.421\na little more readable too, I guess.\n\n251\n00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just don't think that's like a,\n\n252\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.030\nwhen you look at that and see the dash and\nsee how it's stringed together,\n\n253\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.510\nyou're kinda like,\nwhat's that an abbreviation for?\n\n254\n00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.080\nIt's not.\n[LAUGH]\n\n255\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.190\n>> [LAUGH] I'll tell you that's\n\n256\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.212\nexactly what I was doing.\n\n257\n00:15:18.212 --> 00:15:24.390\nI was looking at that and going, I wonder\nwhat winsepfb actually stands for.\n\n258\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.890\nThat's an odd switch to throw out there,\nbut\n\n259\n00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.432\nthat's actually several switches\njust combined together.\n\n260\n00:15:29.432 --> 00:15:31.411\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know I had a feeling that that's,\n\n261\n00:15:31.411 --> 00:15:33.550\nwhen you were going let's tighten up.\n\n262\n00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.470\nThat's why we were saying was like okay,\nwell,\n\n263\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.110\nlet me show you what\nthat actually goes to.\n\n264\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.580\nBecause I could see where\nyou could make that mistake.\n\n265\n00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.639\nI looked at it the first time and\ngo, that's kind of, oh, okay,\n\n266\n00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.152\nnow I see where they're going.\n\n267\n00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:47.972\n>> [LAUGH] Nice, nice.\n\n268\n00:15:47.972 --> 00:15:56.348\n>> But that's DMitry, and you can see the\nenumeration on that worked, Pretty well.\n\n269\n00:15:56.348 --> 00:15:59.301\nSo we're good on that.\n\n270\n00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:04.874\nNow, one more tool to take a look at\nhere is, I will go right over here,\n\n271\n00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:08.936\nis one that, this one,\nif you've been to the CEH,\n\n272\n00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:15.910\nit's not the first time you'll have seen\nit, because it was mentioned in the CEH.\n\n273\n00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.900\nHowever, we didn't run at the CEH,\n\n274\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.740\nso we're gonna take a look\nat it here just to be fair.\n\n275\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.830\nThis is definitely designed\nto be an enumeration tool.\n\n276\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.040\nI mean,\nit says enum right there in the name.\n\n277\n00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.970\nIt says enum4linux.\n\n278\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:34.380\nWhat this is, is I am going to\njust put the -help out there for\n\n279\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.670\nit, and\nI am going to go up to the top of this.\n\n280\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.020\nSo it's got enum4linux -help.\n\n281\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:49.080\nIf we start scrolling through it, take\na look what we can do under the options.\n\n282\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.160\nThose options you can put right after.\n\n283\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.232\nWhen you type in enum4linux you can put\nspace and you can put these things,\n\n284\n00:16:56.232 --> 00:17:00.561\nyou can put this information in and what\nthat will do is it will reveal additional\n\n285\n00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.490\ninformation when it's\nrunning this actual script.\n\n286\n00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:09.520\nSo if you wanna see more than what it does\nby default you can definitely do that.\n\n287\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.815\nWhat you do is you'll type enum4linux\nspace and put the flags in that you want.\n\n288\n00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:17.630\nDo notice that they're all case sensitive.\n\n289\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.300\nThat should not be brand new to you.\n\n290\n00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.530\nThat's old hat, by now hopefully.\n\n291\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.190\nSo we've got all the flags sitting there.\n\n292\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.720\nThen once we have all\nthe flags sitting there\n\n293\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.330\nwe put space after our last\nflag then put the IP in.\n\n294\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.260\nSo that means when we go down here,\n\n295\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:41.875\nif I do an enum4linux there is a -U and\n-M.\n\n296\n00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:45.980\n-M being for a machine name.\n\n297\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.750\nI can also put in some other stuff.\n\n298\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.439\nI can put in,\nthere was a -G in there for groups.\n\n299\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.610\nI could pop that one in, and\nyou could do as many as you want,\n\n300\n00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.970\nI think you get the idea.\n\n301\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:09.180\nSo what's happening here,\nis that IP address is for my other system.\n\n302\n00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.770\nSo what I wanna do is, the other system,\n\n303\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.350\nthis is designed to extract\nstuff from Windows.\n\n304\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.810\nWell, my other system,\nmy meta-sploitable system ain't Windows,\n\n305\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.890\nso that's not gonna be really handy and\nbeneficial.\n\n306\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.320\nSo, I mean, if I do that, yeah,\nit's like, oh, look at what it did.\n\n307\n00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.150\nIt just puked out a bunch of stuff,\nbut is that really helpful?\n\n308\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.140\nYeah, it's giving me stuff.\n\n309\n00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.230\nIt is giving me this great information.\n\n310\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.450\nIt's not giving me all the stuff that\nit would be if it was a Windows box.\n\n311\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.980\nBut if you look at it, I mean,\nyeah that's not bad information.\n\n312\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.080\nI mean, if you take a look at it, I've\ngot some account information in there.\n\n313\n00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.680\nI've got some other\nstuff sitting in there.\n\n314\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.020\nI'm not disappointed,\nyou know, by seeing this,\n\n315\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.440\nbut it may not be as\nuseful as I really wanted.\n\n316\n00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.140\nSo there's some other user information\nright down there, you know,\n\n317\n00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.769\nthat we're seeing, so that's not bad.\n\n318\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.170\nAnd we're seeing some IDs that are IDs.\n\n319\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.680\nThe sketch you'll remember,\nthat 0x in front of it,\n\n320\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.620\nthat's telling me that's\na hexadecimal value.\n\n321\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.653\nAnd so then we have that machine I guess,\nI guess this script isn't able to\n\n322\n00:19:18.653 --> 00:19:23.990\ndo that so they haven't completely\ndone that in this one, but whatever.\n\n323\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.680\nWhat I'm going to do is, after I've got\nthat one, it can't get domain groups and\n\n324\n00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.230\nstuff like that because, first of all,\nit's not a member of domains,\n\n325\n00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.330\nsecond of all, that feature's\nreally geared towards Windows.\n\n326\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:42.443\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto grab my IP address out of here,\n\n327\n00:19:42.443 --> 00:19:46.368\nso there's my IP address back there,\n\n328\n00:19:46.368 --> 00:19:52.160\nof my local system, and\nso I'll do 10.1.230.\n\n329\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.895\nWhat is that?\n\n330\n00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:58.680\n.167, so I'm gonna go ahead and\nrun that and see if it gives me anything\n\n331\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.070\ndifferent than I had with my Linux box,\nand I would expect it to be different.\n\n332\n00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.760\nBut this one, did it give me really\nanything that was gonna help me out?\n\n333\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.600\nWell, take a look.\n\n334\n00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.860\nIt gave me a little less\nthan the Linux box did.\n\n335\n00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.550\nBut, granted, don't take that as oh\nWindows is more secure than Linux or\n\n336\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.580\nanything like that.\n\n337\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.310\nThat Metasploitable box is\nmade to be vulnerable, so\n\n338\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.878\nwe're not comparing, being fair there.\n\n339\n00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:32.210\nSo, anyway.\n\n340\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.160\nYou can see in here it\ndid get some information.\n\n341\n00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.250\nWe could actually use those switches\nto get it to give more or less and\n\n342\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.600\ndo some other stuff.\n\n343\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.669\nWe won't worry about that right now,\nwe'll let you do that.\n\n344\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.900\nBut what you see there as you\ncan see it's the target stuff.\n\n345\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.630\nTake a look.\n\n346\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.030\nThe RID range.\n\n347\n00:20:53.638 --> 00:20:57.650\nWell, that's interesting because\nif we look at the RID range,\n\n348\n00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.570\nremember it was something that we\ntalked about back in our CEH stuff and\n\n349\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.360\nin our forensics course we\ntalked about it as well.\n\n350\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.530\nThat in Windows we have special\nIDs assigned to user accounts.\n\n351\n00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.446\nThere's meaning attached to that.\n\n352\n00:21:14.446 --> 00:21:18.090\nWell, it's telling us RID range, 500 to\n550, remember we have our administrator\n\n353\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.890\nand our guest account are in there, and\nthen 1000 on up it's got those ones.\n\n354\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.720\nIt only checked a small range of them.\n\n355\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.650\nThose are where everything\nelse resides and\n\n356\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.010\nthen you can see in there it's\nalso got known usernames and\n\n357\n00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.050\nstuff like that it's looking for and\nsee if they would actually pop up.\n\n358\n00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.630\nThere's the workgroup information and\nthen it's saying,\n\n359\n00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.780\noh here, it's saying okay I got\nthe workgroup but then look at the bottom.\n\n360\n00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.370\nThat says a server doesn't allow\nsession using username and\n\n361\n00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.180\npassword and it's saying it's\nkilling all the rest, okay.\n\n362\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.970\nThat one is actually significant.\n\n363\n00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:56.040\nWe do know why it's causing that.\n\n364\n00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.920\nYou may not actually pick it up right\noff the top of your head, you know.\n\n365\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.650\nBut it is something that\nwe have seen in the past.\n\n366\n00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.590\nAnd we can look at it,\n\n367\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.500\nif we do enum4linux, and\njust you know, bring the thing up.\n\n368\n00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.700\nYou can see right here at the bottom,\nI can highlight this right here.\n\n369\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.530\nRemember that setting,\nrestrict anonymous in the registry?\n\n370\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:25.290\nIf that value is set the right way,\nwhat will happen is that it will not\n\n371\n00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.725\nallow a null session to happen, and that's\nwhat it was attempting for that last bit.\n\n372\n00:22:29.725 --> 00:22:34.320\nThat enum4linux was attempting\nto establish a null session.\n\n373\n00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.420\nIf it was able to successfully do that, it\nwould have spit out a whole bunch of other\n\n374\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:45.370\ninformation that would have been\nuseful as a pen tester, as a defender.\n\n375\n00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.920\nIf you know what's going on there, that\nshould make you quake in your boots there\n\n376\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.270\nbecause they're getting something from\nyou that they shouldn't be doing.\n\n377\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.840\nSo I shouldn't be able to get.\n\n378\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.290\nThat's why Microsoft went from the setting\nof zero and one and then added on a two on\n\n379\n00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.430\nthere as well to prevent that from being\nenumerated through a tool like this.\n\n380\n00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.750\nThis is a good way to see, first of all,\ndo you have that setting configured?\n\n381\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.610\nAnd second of all,\nwhat could you get out of that system?\n\n382\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.020\nHere we see on my system here\nit's turned up all the way.\n\n383\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.590\nWhen it tried to pull that information to\nget password policy like it says in here\n\n384\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.855\nand user information and\nall that, it can't do it.\n\n385\n00:23:26.855 --> 00:23:30.790\nEnum4linux said I can't\nestablish a null session so\n\n386\n00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.060\nthat's it there's no other\ntest I can do at this point.\n\n387\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.930\nBecause that setting isn't\nconfigured the right way, I'm done.\n\n388\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.840\nAnd its test for it was,\ncan I type in that whole,\n\n389\n00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.005\nthat whole net use command, with all\nthe blank user, and stuff in there.\n\n390\n00:23:45.005 --> 00:23:47.662\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It tried that out, didn't work, and\n\n391\n00:23:47.662 --> 00:23:48.967\nsaid, we're done.\n\n392\n00:23:48.967 --> 00:23:51.188\nI tried an alt session,\ncouldn't establish it, so\n\n393\n00:23:51.188 --> 00:23:53.720\nthe rest of the stuff is a moot point,\nI can't do anything.\n\n394\n00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.926\nYeah, those null sessions\ngive up a lot of information.\n\n395\n00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:57.678\nThat was a big problem in Windows for\na long time.\n\n396\n00:23:57.678 --> 00:24:00.162\n>> Yeah, it definitely was and\n\n397\n00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:04.930\nit was a big deal when they\nkilled that functionality.\n\n398\n00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.480\nI mean, it's still there if you\nwanna see what that does, yeah,\n\n399\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.780\njust look up restrict anonymous and\nchanging your registry.\n\n400\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.280\nLook up what the values are and\nturn it all the way down to zero and\n\n401\n00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.560\nthen run this and you'll see\nexactly what is spit out of this.\n\n402\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:25.230\nIt's not a bad thing to actually try if\nyou've never attempted a null session or\n\n403\n00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.060\nyou've never seen what comes out of it.\n\n404\n00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.930\nIt's an eye opener to see why you want\nto have that setting set that way and\n\n405\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.040\nleave it that way.\n\n406\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.430\nBecause there's really no reason for\n\n407\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.360\nit to be any other way except\njust to leave it there.\n\n408\n00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.590\n>> I remember it scared the,\nout of me, way back when.\n\n409\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.570\nI think I was doing CEH training, and\nat that time Windows 2000 server,\n\n410\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.760\n2000 professional, and boy the server\nwould just spit out everything you wanted.\n\n411\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.620\nAnd I remember thinking,\nas an admin, this is not good.\n\n412\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.210\n>> Yeah.\n\n413\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.020\nIt would tell you his it's story.\n\n414\n00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.390\nIt's like oh, great.\n\n415\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.650\n>> Thankfully they've fixed that or\npatched it up.\n\n416\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.320\nBecause it was a useful thing, right?\n\n417\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.230\nWe could list shares and things like that,\nthat master browser list.\n\n418\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.170\nBut we don't need to give enough\ngroups and user names, and\n\n419\n00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.930\nall of that good stuff.\n\n420\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.270\nAnother great tool in our suite of\nutilities that we have here available\n\n421\n00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.350\nin Kali Linux.\n\n422\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.510\nAnd again, not all that difficult to use,\n\n423\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.190\njust a matter of learning\nthe different switches.\n\n424\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.843\nAnd I think the help is built right in\nthere, so all we've got to do is type in\n\n425\n00:25:22.843 --> 00:25:27.670\nthe name of the thing, a new for\nLinux and do a dash help.\n\n426\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.420\nAnd it's all right there, fantastic.\n\n427\n00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.870\n>> And as Ben pointed out here, and\nthanks for pointing that out Ben,\n\n428\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.730\nis that you do have the -a, I scrolled up,\nit's at the top of the screen on this one.\n\n429\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.730\nThe -a yeah, well also if you\nwanna simplify it you could just\n\n430\n00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:48.770\ndo dash lower-case a and\nit will try all the enumerations for you.\n\n431\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.270\nI just did it this way because I\nkinda wanted to illustrate some of\n\n432\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.180\nthe different enumerations and\nwhat they look like to talk about them.\n\n433\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.570\nBut yeah, if you know you wanna do\nthem all, yeah you can do the -a.\n\n434\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.490\nSo, thanks for pointing that out.\n\n435\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.500\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n436\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.860\nAll right, well another great set\nof information on enumeration.\n\n437\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.660\nThe ability to, once we've gone\nthrough that scanning phase and\n\n438\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.930\nwe've found our live systems,\nmaybe we've done our port scans, and\n\n439\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.220\nwe wanna take it a step further.\n\n440\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.170\nThe next step, start enumerate\nthings off of those live systems.\n\n441\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.920\nList out groups, list out users,\nlist out password policies.\n\n442\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.700\nWhatever the case may be and\nwe've gotta a few tools.\n\n443\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.030\nAnd as always,\nthat's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n444\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.270\nThere are other tools in there\nthat you might like better.\n\n445\n00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.760\nThese are the ones that we've\nchosen to demo for you here.\n\n446\n00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.620\nSo a lot of choices, a lot of great stuff.\n\n447\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.430\nWell, Sean, I tell you what.\n\n448\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.410\nLooking at our clock, it's about\ntime to wrap up for this episode.\n\n449\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.058\nAnything we wanna add to\nour enumeration episode?\n\n450\n00:26:47.058 --> 00:26:49.622\n>> I can't really think of anything,\n\n451\n00:26:49.622 --> 00:26:53.302\nexcept to tell you guys this\nis a good point for you.\n\n452\n00:26:53.302 --> 00:26:58.436\nIf you haven't already, to get those\nvulnerable systems downloaded and\n\n453\n00:26:58.436 --> 00:27:02.409\ntry some variations of it\nbecause you are really seeing,\n\n454\n00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:06.910\nI know the information is kind of\nflying by at fast at this point.\n\n455\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:10.079\nI've heard that and\nseen that comment several times today.\n\n456\n00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:14.944\nSo, just start practicing trying different\nvariations and see what you can get.\n\n457\n00:27:14.944 --> 00:27:18.284\nThat's really what the name of\nthe game is and see what comes out,\n\n458\n00:27:18.284 --> 00:27:20.670\nsee what you can do to\nmanipulate the results.\n\n459\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.990\nI mean,\nwe're really kinda hitting it hard.\n\n460\n00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.100\nAnd try the other tools.\n\n461\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.730\nYou're not gonna break anything,\nof course, so some really good stuff.\n\n462\n00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.940\nI think you probably saw just\na lot of really good stuff today.\n\n463\n00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.830\nHopefully you get to go ahead and use it.\n\n464\n00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.400\n>> Absolutely.\nI know I'm gonna be up all night\n\n465\n00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.041\nplaying with half of these tools already,\nso.\n\n466\n00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:42.361\n[LAUGH] All right,\nwell ladies and gentlemen,\n\n467\n00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.458\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n468\n00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:45.960\nSigning off for ITProTV.\n\n469\n00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.340\nI am

00:00:16.630\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.670\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.650\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.180\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.420\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.580\nGetting ready for another exciting\nepisode in our Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460\nIn this episode we're gonna be\ntalking about gaining access.\n\n10\n00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.520\nIn previous episodes we've been\ngoing through our different phases.\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.360\nWe went through our\ninformation gathering phase.\n\n12\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.370\nWe went through our scanning\na numeration phase.\n\n13\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.470\nAnd now with all that information\nthat we've gathered up,\n\n14\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.270\nit's time to start gaining access, right?\n\n15\n00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.260\nOr start accessing these systems.\n\n16\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.970\n>> Yeah, that's where we've come.\n\n17\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.010\nWe've come a long way\nthrough this process, and\n\n18\n00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.340\nnow we're getting to the point where\nwe are going to penetrate the system.\n\n19\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.176\nAnd start seeing what we\ncould do at that point.\n\n20\n00:00:55.176 --> 00:01:00.389\nSo all that information you've gathered\nand you've kind of sorted through\n\n21\n00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:05.611\nalong the way and analyzed, that's\ngonna come in real handy at this point.\n\n22\n00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:10.555\nCuz it's gonna help you really kinda find\nthe best approach for getting further\n\n23\n00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:14.930\ninto the system, and obtaining\ninformation or access that you want.\n\n24\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.180\nSo this is, all this is is just that\nexploitation phase we talked about in\n\n25\n00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.360\na earlier segment.\n\n26\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.440\nBut it's just gonna be gaining access and\nthen getting in deeper and\n\n27\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.090\ndeeper after that.\n\n28\n00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.170\n>> Nice, nice, alright.\n\n29\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.620\nSo where the heck do we even start?\n\n30\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.990\nWe've got all this information we've\ngathered from these different phases.\n\n31\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.670\nPick a system and just go at it?\n\n32\n00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.710\nOr some kind of rhyme or reason to it?\n\n33\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.910\nWhat do we do?\n\n34\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.100\n>> You know it could be\na lot of things that\n\n35\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.720\ndetermine which system\nyou're going to go after.\n\n36\n00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.060\nSometimes it could be just a gut feeling\nthat if I tell you that this is the one\n\n37\n00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.370\nthat you want to target.\n\n38\n00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.810\nYou kind of have a hunch that this one\nseems like a good place to start, or\n\n39\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.610\nyou may be a little more\nstructured than that.\n\n40\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.410\nYou may be going through things and\n\n41\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.810\nsee that a system when you did your\nbanner grabs and stuff like that.\n\n42\n00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.470\nYou found that a system has\nsome things running on it that\n\n43\n00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.780\nmight make it a little better\ntarget than another one.\n\n44\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.970\nBecause remember what we did\nyesterday when we did our scan,\n\n45\n00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.170\nsome of those things we're\nactually pulling out,\n\n46\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.230\nautomatically pulling out full banners for\nthat without any effort whatsoever.\n\n47\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.870\nSo just having those banners come out and\n\n48\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.350\nthen maybe even going as far as some of\nthem did and fingerprint the service, and\n\n49\n00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.990\nnot just tell you what the service was,\nbut even specifics about it.\n\n50\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.770\nThat might give you enough to say,\n\n51\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.880\nokay, this is my target of opportunity\nwhere I'm gonna step in and\n\n52\n00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.400\nstart seeing if I can work on this and\nget further into that environment.\n\n53\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.980\nSo you really kind of got to see\nwhere your opportunities are.\n\n54\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.800\nAnd some of that's going\nto come with experience,\n\n55\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.130\njust kind of seeing which ones are really\ngoing to be the prime targets.\n\n56\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.230\nAnd then interpreting\ninformation on top of it and\n\n57\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.460\nseeing what that\ninformation is telling you.\n\n58\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.660\nI mean,\ndon't be surprised if you're going through\n\n59\n00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.600\nyour whole scan enumeration process and\n\n60\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.360\nyou start finding default settings in\na lot of them on a specific system.\n\n61\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.750\nThat might tell you right there,\n\n62\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.390\nwell, this person left all\nthese defaults in place.\n\n63\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.100\nWell, I'm gonna kinda roll the dice, and\n\n64\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.380\nsay this is probably the one that they've\nleft some other default things in place,\n\n65\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.600\nthat make it a good system to prey\nupon to gain that entry point.\n\n66\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.640\nSo you really gotta kinda figure it\nout and put the information together.\n\n67\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.300\n>> You either found a really dumb admin or\nlazy admin or\n\n68\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.780\nyou found your honey pot, right?\n\n69\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.520\n>> Yeah, exactly, and\nwe haven't even got to that yet, but\n\n70\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.060\nyeah you're absolutely right.\n\n71\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.880\nAnd again, that's also gonna come with\nlearning the tools a bit better so\n\n72\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.410\nyou can start identifying if\nthat's a legitimate target or\n\n73\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.090\nit's something that someone actually\nput out there enticing you.\n\n74\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.530\nCuz you're right,\nthat could be hiding out there.\n\n75\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.490\nThat's definitely a technique\nthat they like to use,\n\n76\n00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.610\nso you've got to be careful\nwhen you do this sort of thing.\n\n77\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.530\n>> All right, so we want to gain access to\nthe system, so we've got an ip address, or\n\n78\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.430\nwe now our target, maybe we found\na DNS server, a domain controller,\n\n79\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.770\na particular client that we think\nmight have access to other systems.\n\n80\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.290\nWhere do you really start, what do you do\nif you want to gain access to that nodes,\n\n81\n00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.990\nseveral different ways we can go about it,\nseveral different tools we can use.\n\n82\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.220\nWhat's our logical process at that point?\n\n83\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.060\nWe try to break passwords first, or\ntry use, I don't know, what do we do?\n\n84\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.390\n>> You know this is one of those things\nthat kind of depends on who you ask.\n\n85\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.930\nBecause everyone seems to have a different\nlittle opinion on this, as far as when you\n\n86\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.120\nget to the point when you have all that\nscanning information and all that stuff.\n\n87\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.450\nIt's like now what do you do?\n\n88\n00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.880\nI know I want to get into the system,\nbut where's my starting point?\n\n89\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.380\nWell, it's really your choice.\n\n90\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.300\nNow in the CEH we talked about a really\nspecific order, and the reason why that\n\n91\n00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.880\norder was there is that's just the way\nthey like to cover council stuff.\n\n92\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.260\nBut I do recall that if you go back,\nI made a point of this in the CEH course,\n\n93\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.300\nI said that why we're covering\nthem in a specific order for\n\n94\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.790\ngaining access to a system.\n\n95\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.970\nThere's nothing saying that you\ncan't shake those things up and\n\n96\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.690\nchange the order of it.\n\n97\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.861\nSo you gotta kind of bring that same thing\nover here and put it into context and\n\n98\n00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:32.480\nsay, well, even though we're\ncovering them in a certain order,\n\n99\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.800\nit doesn't mean that you are restricted\nto that order as far as gaining access.\n\n100\n00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.520\nYou might find that you\ncan swap things around.\n\n101\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.800\nAnd get a better result or\nget a quicker result.\n\n102\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.280\nSo do have that flexibility, when we,\nbut we are still gonna go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.750\ntalk about them in a specific\norder You can do what you want.\n\n104\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.930\nOnce you know the techniques, if you\nsee an opening, go ahead and take it,\n\n105\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.650\ndon't say well, I see an opening over\nhere but let me do these things first.\n\n106\n00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.340\nNo, if you see an opening,\nby all means, take it,\n\n107\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.990\ndon't wait if your opportunity's there.\n\n108\n00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.690\nSo, but,\n\n109\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.400\nwhat can you do is the question when\nyou're trying to gain access to a system.\n\n110\n00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.830\nWell, one of the things that\nwe traditionally like to do\n\n111\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.240\nis we like to see if we\ncan obtain a password.\n\n112\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.255\nAnd there can be a lot of ways\nthat you can obtain a password and\n\n113\n00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.560\nKali helps you out with that.\n\n114\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.120\nKaylee is got a lot of tools packed\ninto it that approach the problem of\n\n115\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.200\nobtaining passwords in all different ways.\n\n116\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.150\nSome of them are similar actually.\n\n117\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.030\nThey've got groupings of\ntools that work the same but\n\n118\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.590\nthe made the mechanics under the hood\nmaybe just a little different.\n\n119\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.355\nBut they do group into specific families.\n\n120\n00:06:55.355 --> 00:07:00.145\nBut then they have some other ones out\nthere that may be a little different than\n\n121\n00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:04.815\nanything you've seen, that might be\ngood for a very specific instance.\n\n122\n00:07:04.815 --> 00:07:09.390\nAnd then to even have tools and\nKali that can generate wordlists for you.\n\n123\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:15.550\nWhich if you need that,\nyou can go ahead and just create your own.\n\n124\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.910\nAnd you could stick your\nown information in it.\n\n125\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.610\nAnd, say, generate a wordlist or\n\n126\n00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.290\na dictionary file with all\nthose lists of passwords.\n\n127\n00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.360\nYou can generate it just by\ngiving it some basic inputs.\n\n128\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.670\nAnd it will say okay,\n\n129\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.470\nI'll just generate a bunch of stuff\noff the characters you gave me.\n\n130\n00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.700\nI'll do all this stuff and then save\nit to a text file and here you go, and\n\n131\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.638\nyou can go ahead and use it with\nyour favorite password cracker.\n\n132\n00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:40.653\nBut we've got the password thing covered.\n\n133\n00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:43.590\nThe one thing we're not gonna,\nI guess we should mention,\n\n134\n00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.371\nwe're not gonna worry about here.\n\n135\n00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:49.259\nIt was mentioned in the CEH,\nand I'll mention it here as\n\n136\n00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.727\nwell Is the whole idea of having\na default password on a system and\n\n137\n00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:59.190\nhaving those websites you can go to\nto see what the default password is.\n\n138\n00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.520\nThat's not something that's unique to\nKali so there's really no reason for\n\n139\n00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.730\nme to sit here and say oh here's\na website with all the default stuff.\n\n140\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.920\nYeah, you can Google that and find sites\nthat have lists of default passwords and\n\n141\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.770\nconfigurations that I'll let you go ahead\nand Google that, whatever as you see fit,\n\n142\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.180\nbut it's not something we're\ngonna really worry about here.\n\n143\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.020\nWe're gonna worry about\nusing other techniques\n\n144\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.330\nto obtain the password other than\nsomeone just left it as a default and\n\n145\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.180\nwe can go find it just by doing\na quick web search on it.\n\n146\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.740\n>> Always a plus and always a possibility\nthat somebody has left those defaults,\n\n147\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.890\nespecially on some of those internet\nworking devices, like my routers and\n\n148\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.880\nmy wireless access points.\n\n149\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.510\nThings like that.\n\n150\n00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.460\nOr maybe even SMTP, or\n\n151\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.380\nnot SMTP, but my management protocols,\nmaybe those passwords.\n\n152\n00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.840\n>> But not a guarantee.\n\n153\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.100\nAnd sometime's we are gonna need\nto be able to track passwords or\n\n154\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.180\nto be able to get into a system when\nthey have done some hardening on it.\n\n155\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.820\nAt least those basics there, right?\n\n156\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.260\nSo, we've gotta have the tools and\n\n157\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.490\ncapabilities of dealing with that\nif we're gonna do a good ping test.\n\n158\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.480\n>> Yes, and there is a very, very robust\nset of tools available to you and\n\n159\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.410\nI would encourage you, even though we're\ncovering a small portion of these and\n\n160\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.390\ndiscussing what options you have.\n\n161\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.250\nI'm definitely, again this is one of those\ncases where I'm going to encourage you to\n\n162\n00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.160\ntake a look at all the different ones out\nthere, and see which ones work for you.\n\n163\n00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.200\nThere's some of them in here that\nyou may not have expected to find.\n\n164\n00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.340\nAnd the passwords, by the way,\nthat we can retrieve off of this,\n\n165\n00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.820\nthey aren't just the ones that\nhelp you log in to a system.\n\n166\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.440\nWe all know there's other types,\nthere's passwords that are used for\n\n167\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.570\nother things other than\njust hey here's username,\n\n168\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.340\nhere's my password,\nboom I'm into a system.\n\n169\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.880\nThere are other cases.\n\n170\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.970\nAnd so we do have tools that\nare specifically designed for that.\n\n171\n00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.310\nSo just remember that and\n\n172\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.560\nthen we have stuff even outside what\nwe are going to talk about here.\n\n173\n00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.960\nWe're going to leave that for\nanother time later on.\n\n174\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.150\n>> We also have password cracking tools\nthat are customized towards databases and\n\n175\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.300\nspecific applications.\n\n176\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.640\nSince we're just talking about\nbusting into a system right now and\n\n177\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.600\nnot looking at the applications yet,\nwe're not really gonna worry about those.\n\n178\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.320\nThose we have coming up, but yes they do\nhave password crackers that are designed\n\n179\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.330\nfor things like Oracle and\nother applications\n\n180\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.390\nof that nature that you probably\nare gonna wanna get into if you find.\n\n181\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.010\nYou find Oracle on a system,\nyou know what Oracle does.\n\n182\n00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.030\nYou know what people\nare probably storing in it or\n\n183\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.560\nhave an idea there's stored information.\n\n184\n00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.850\nThey wanna know what the nature\nof that information is.\n\n185\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:44.290\nSo now you can use these tools to break\nin and start getting more information\n\n186\n00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.810\nout of those systems to see if it's\nworthwhile for you to go any further.\n\n187\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.180\nSo like I've said, they've really\ncome to brought a lot of stuff\n\n188\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.160\nto the table to put you in the game.\n\n189\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.070\n>> Nice.\nSo let's say we're at this point we're\n\n190\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.190\njust doing our high level overview as we\nusually do, talking about gaining access.\n\n191\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.210\nWe're gonna crack those passwords and\nthat could be done in an offline format.\n\n192\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.040\nCould be done in an online format,\n\n193\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.810\ndepending like if we maybe got\ntheir password information or their\n\n194\n00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.180\nfiles that contained their passwords,\nwe can try to break them offline.\n\n195\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.370\nOr we could try to do it online if\nit's a system's got an input field,\n\n196\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.870\nsomething like that or a log on screen.\n\n197\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.530\n>> Yeah, absolutely the offline\nhas its benefits where you're\n\n198\n00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.700\ngetting something off the system and\nyou're going through it that way.\n\n199\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.110\nWe have online ones that you're engaging\nthe system directly which can give\n\n200\n00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.110\nyou results a little\nquicker in some cases, but\n\n201\n00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.190\nthey're more visible then we have,\nin addition to the ones here,\n\n202\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.060\nwe also have a social engineering\nmethod to gain passwords.\n\n203\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.180\nAnd we're really not going\nto worry about showing that\n\n204\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.330\nhere in this exploitation part.\n\n205\n00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.280\nAnd the reason for that is, it doesn't\nmean we're not gonna cover that and\n\n206\n00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.560\nwe're not gonna see the tools that, or\n\n207\n00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.930\nI should say tool,\nthat Kali has that can help you with that.\n\n208\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.470\nIt's just that, since that tool for\nsocial engineering is really kind of so\n\n209\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.470\ncool on its own, and got a lot of stuff\ngoing on, we're gonna dedicate its\n\n210\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.400\nown section or module to that so\nyou can see what that is.\n\n211\n00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.840\nThat's something called,\nin case you're wondering,\n\n212\n00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.620\nthat's something called SET,\nthe social engineering toolkit.\n\n213\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.060\nSo we're gonna get to\ntake a look at that one.\n\n214\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.700\nI think you'll find that one pretty cool.\n\n215\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.850\nSo, better than just saying, oh,\nwell you can eavesdrop or do phishing.\n\n216\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.760\nWell, let me show you\nhow this thing works,\n\n217\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.840\nso you've got another full-blown tool\nthat you can use as part of your arsenal.\n\n218\n00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.602\n>> Nice.\n\n219\n00:12:41.602 --> 00:12:46.020\nAll right, so we crack a password, and\nthen in that process we're going through,\n\n220\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.600\nthat password we crack might or\nmight not be an admin account, right?\n\n221\n00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.950\nMight not have the rights or privileges\nthat I need or want so then the next\n\n222\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.930\nphase and exploitation usually involves\ntrying to bump that up a little bit?\n\n223\n00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.600\n>> Yes indeed.\n\n224\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.900\nThat's what you're gonna wanna do,\nis once you've cracked the password,\n\n225\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.340\nat some point you're\nprobably gonna wanna say,\n\n226\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.960\nthat exactly doesn't have\nthe stuff that I want.\n\n227\n00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.340\nSo I need to acquire more\nprivileges than I currently have.\n\n228\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.390\nAnd the question at that point is really,\nhow you're gonna do that.\n\n229\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.670\nAnd you do have plenty of\noptions there as well,\n\n230\n00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.410\nit's just as an overall process\nyou gain access to the system.\n\n231\n00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.880\nProbably, it's not uncommon for\n\n232\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.550\nthis account not to have what you need or\nyou to target the one that's kinda\n\n233\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.920\nlike the low hanging fruit that's\nmaybe not being monitored.\n\n234\n00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.860\nMaybe it's something that because of where\nit sits on the system it's not given\n\n235\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.030\nthe same attention that the other ones\nare, so it makes it a good, ripe target.\n\n236\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.970\nSo that's good from that standpoint,\nthat it's a good target.\n\n237\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:56.100\nOn the other hand, that account, when you\ncrack it, may not have the access that\n\n238\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.800\nyou need, so you now you have to go about\nacquiring that access, so that's where you\n\n239\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.910\ndo a privilege escalation, because you\nmight want to run something at that point.\n\n240\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.850\nYou might want to do something specific.\n\n241\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.000\nIf that's the case,\nthen what do you gotta do?\n\n242\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.890\nYou gotta have privileges to do so.\n\n243\n00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:18.000\nSo that would be a logical next step\nafter getting a password on the system.\n\n244\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.070\n>> Okay, so\nonce we get access to the system,\n\n245\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.600\nwe might break in some password somehow,\neither offline or online.\n\n246\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.650\nWe escalate our credentials so\nthat we can do what we wanna do.\n\n247\n00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.740\nAnd then the fun begins, right?\n\n248\n00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.550\n>> Yeah that's where you can start really\nopening the door and presumably at that\n\n249\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:42.340\npoint you can now have your fun and game\ntime to really kinda play around in there.\n\n250\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.200\nBecause it probably is\nthat count that you first\n\n251\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.640\ngot since it doesn't\nhave those privileges.\n\n252\n00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.180\nYou may not be able to run\nthe stuff that you want.\n\n253\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.520\nSo now, you're gonna have to figure out\na way to run those things that you want.\n\n254\n00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.460\nSo we do that by,\nonce we got to do that proves escalation,\n\n255\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.718\nwe bump it up, we get the level of\naccess to run what we need to run\n\n256\n00:15:04.718 --> 00:15:10.020\nthen we start doing that next step.\n\n257\n00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:17.580\nWhat your running hey that's really\nanybody's thing at that point.\n\n258\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.670\nIf you can run it on that system and\nit's available,\n\n259\n00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.400\nyou pretty much can run it at that point.\n\n260\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.080\nThe question is,\n\n261\n00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.890\nis it something that's going to get you\nto the next logical step in your process?\n\n262\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.619\nIf you recall from CEH, one of the things\nwe did when we gained access, Is we\n\n263\n00:15:33.619 --> 00:15:39.328\ntargeted an individual system, cracked the\npassword on it, escalated the privileges,\n\n264\n00:15:39.328 --> 00:15:43.633\nand then we executed a program just\nlike we're talking about here.\n\n265\n00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:47.698\nBut the reason why we executed\na program in that and the CEH,\n\n266\n00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:52.493\nthe one we discussed and we kinda gave\nan example of In order to demo of,\n\n267\n00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:56.230\nis we want to install\na keylogger on that system.\n\n268\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:00.690\nSo what we want to do is once we\ncompromise that system, we know it's we've\n\n269\n00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.950\nonly compromised that one box, we haven't\ncompromised the network as a whole.\n\n270\n00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.570\nWe targeted the system that we can\nget a keylogger on so we're hoping at\n\n271\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.450\nsome point when someone comes by and\nstarts typing away on that system,\n\n272\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.300\nthat keylogger will intercept those key\nstrokes and now we grab their credentials.\n\n273\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.700\nAnd so now if you really look at it, what\nwe've done is done a privilege escalation,\n\n274\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.180\nand then we run something, and\nwe grab another accounts credentials.\n\n275\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.930\nAnd then we basically escalated again to\na middle level and expanded our scope.\n\n276\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.550\nAnd then you might have another\nround of escalation at that point.\n\n277\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.860\nWho knows,\nyou could have several rounds of that.\n\n278\n00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.120\n>> Now as a pin tester,\ndo we stop once we've gained access?\n\n279\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.410\nOr does that really depend on what\nthe company's hired us to do?\n\n280\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.090\nOr do we try to move on from that point?\n\n281\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.640\n>> It's really kind of up to\nwhat the scope of the test is.\n\n282\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.460\nThey might decide once you have that.\n\n283\n00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.080\nIt's like, okay, we're done.\n\n284\n00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.020\nYou've proven your point.\n\n285\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.830\nWe wanna stop this but they might say\nthey want you to take it further.\n\n286\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.400\nIt's their call.\n\n287\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.310\nAnd don't be surprised if you\nare pin testing and if you are work\n\n288\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:13.130\nin this long enough, don't surprised if\nyou are doing a pen test and because you\n\n289\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.970\nfound a hole are able to get into\na company's infrastructure so quickly.\n\n290\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:24.090\nThey might have an ultimate goal in mind,\nand because you got into the first few\n\n291\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.330\nsteps so quickly, they may just say, you\nknow what, just stop the test right here.\n\n292\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.510\nWe've got problems.\n\n293\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.640\nYou just sliced right through\nit like a knife through butter.\n\n294\n00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.970\nThey might say, done.\n\n295\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:32.850\nJust stop.\n\n296\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:33.350\nWe're cool.\n\n297\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.930\n>> We were pretty\nconfident with that part.\n\n298\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.750\nWe were worried about this part back here.\n\n299\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.720\nYou just made it through that first part,\nand holy crap.\n\n300\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.468\nWe got some work to do.\n\n301\n00:17:39.468 --> 00:17:44.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I remember the one I used in one\n\n302\n00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:51.500\nof our other courses, was talking about\nthe dropboxes that you put in place.\n\n303\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:57.630\nAnd I remember telling a story here\nabout an individual was doing a pentest\n\n304\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.730\nand went in as a employee\nof the power company, and\n\n305\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:05.210\nsaid oh, I gotta check the power in\nthe lines and was doing a pentest for\n\n306\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:08.750\na bank, and he was able plug these things,\ntour the bank by the bank manager,\n\n307\n00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.810\nand then plug these things in and\nhook them up to the network.\n\n308\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.220\nHe did it to three banks and\nthey just said, oh, just stop.\n\n309\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He was able to do that\n\n310\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.720\n>> In a single morning,\n\n311\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.150\nwere like okay stop.\n\n312\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.090\nThey figured at that point they\nhad other goals for the test.\n\n313\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.160\nBut this was able to get done so quickly\nand so successfully, was like, no done.\n\n314\n00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.950\nWe need to address some other\nthings first before we do that.\n\n315\n00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.120\nWe've got once those are taken\ncare of then we'll look at those.\n\n316\n00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.290\nWe don't want to open up so\nmany doors and so\n\n317\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.060\nmany problems that we\ncan't deal with them.\n\n318\n00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.170\nYeah, don't be surprised.\n\n319\n00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.990\nThey might very well say,\nhey, just stop it right here.\n\n320\n00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.070\nPause it right here, whatever.\n\n321\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.800\nAnd that's it.\n\n322\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.560\nBut typically when you go into a system,\nit could be that you just get in and\n\n323\n00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.630\nthey might have an extra program or\nleave something behind.\n\n324\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.480\nI've seen tests like that where they just\nsay, well I want you to show that you can\n\n325\n00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.380\nget to the CEO's system, his notebook or\ndesktop, whatever it is.\n\n326\n00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.080\nAnd they want you to leave\na file on the desktop.\n\n327\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.260\nAnd once you've done that, you've proven\nthat the test has been successful or\n\n328\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.710\nsecurity is just bad enough\nthat you could do that,\n\n329\n00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.820\nthey might very well do\nsomething like that.\n\n330\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.250\nOr they might say that we\nwant to see a situation where\n\n331\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.170\nthat requires you to have regular access.\n\n332\n00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.990\nYou need to hop between systems and\n\n333\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.780\nmaintain that access, so that could\nbe something else that jumps in.\n\n334\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.140\nIt's really, you know, again, their\ncall on how far they wanna take this.\n\n335\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.970\nBut these options are there.\n\n336\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.580\nMake sure you explain it to them,\n\n337\n00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.000\nthe benefits in every specific\ncase that you run into.\n\n338\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.430\nMake sure you explain\nthe benefits of trying that out.\n\n339\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.760\nIf you see a reason to do it, but\n\n340\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.260\nthere's no reason that they have\nto do these things each time.\n\n341\n00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.590\nThey might just say once\nyou got the credentials for\n\n342\n00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.220\nthese things, hey,\nwe're stopping right there.\n\n343\n00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.530\nSo whatever their goals are,\n\n344\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.610\njust make sure you've met their goals and\nlet them go with the rest.\n\n345\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.270\n>> All right, then continuing\non with our high level overview,\n\n346\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.360\nlet's say we've made it into a system,\n\n347\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.490\nwe've gained access, we've run a program\nmaybe or done what we need to do there.\n\n348\n00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.640\nBut as you said, we might want to try\nnow to attack other systems from inside.\n\n349\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.590\nSo I've gotta get back to that\nsystem on a regular basis,\n\n350\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.280\nwhich is another step in\nour exploitation phase.\n\n351\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.210\nRight?\n\n352\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.890\n>> Yes.\n\n353\n00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.930\nThat would be our maintaining access.\n\n354\n00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.750\nOur maintaining access\nis just like it says.\n\n355\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.800\nIt's leaving something on the system\nthat allows you to come back later on.\n\n356\n00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.560\nPresumably what you've done in\nthat previous section is you have\n\n357\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.810\nexecuted something on there that is either\nlistening for you to come back in, and\n\n358\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.620\nit will let you in.\n\n359\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.950\nOr it's something that you\ncan just send a packet to or\n\n360\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.350\nsomething and it does whatever,\nyou know for you.\n\n361\n00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:00.750\nSo there are different things you can\ndo at that point to maintain access.\n\n362\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.350\nAnd Kali has a bunch of tools for\nthat too.\n\n363\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.610\nTo open up back doors,\nto just have the back doors, or\n\n364\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.530\ndo what they call ratting a system.\n\n365\n00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.693\nRoad access Trojan, and\nthey have that, they have them for\n\n366\n00:21:13.693 --> 00:21:16.820\npushing them over SSL and\nHTTP and everything else.\n\n367\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.330\nSo it comes prepared with too, so\n\n368\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.400\nif you need to keep coming\nback it is definitely there.\n\n369\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.344\nAnd we're going to see quite literally,\nwe're going see with the programs and\n\n370\n00:21:28.344 --> 00:21:31.000\nmaintain access,\nwe're going to see a way to do that.\n\n371\n00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.290\nToday and I'm gonna demo it for you.\n\n372\n00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.921\nAnd hopefully everything\ngoes off without a snag.\n\n373\n00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.312\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll see just\n\n374\n00:21:38.312 --> 00:21:40.960\nwhat you could really do with\nthat if it came down to it.\n\n375\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.450\n>> All riight.\nSo we could set up a Trojan.\n\n376\n00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.750\nSome kind of backdoor on their system.\n\n377\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.406\nWe could make an account in active\ndirectory and then VPN right through their\n\n378\n00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:51.840\nnormal VPN process, right, depending on\nwhat level of access we've gained and.\n\n379\n00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.730\nAnd I remember reading something I\nthought was interesting is these hackers,\n\n380\n00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.860\nthey would break into a system, find some\nvulnerability, access the system, and\n\n381\n00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.570\nthen set up their back door and\nthen patch the system.\n\n382\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.140\nThey'd go ahead and\npatch that vulnerability.\n\n383\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.260\nThey didn't want other\nhackers finding that system,\n\n384\n00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.770\nfinding that vulnerability and\nsetting alarms.\n\n385\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.640\nThey did a good job of getting in and\nsetting up there own private back door.\n\n386\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.980\nAnd then they would patch\nthe vulnerability so\n\n387\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.390\nno one else could get in the system.\n\n388\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.210\nIt's kind of funny that they would,\nyou know.\n\n389\n00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.260\nIt's like, wait the bad guys\nare patching my system for me.\n\n390\n00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.820\nOh yeah.\n\n391\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.980\nYou know it's a way of covering their\ntracks, and making sure that nobody else\n\n392\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.590\nsets off alarms and\nKeeps them from getting in there.\n\n393\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.650\n>> Where else would you see something\nlike that, I mean think about it.\n\n394\n00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.620\nCould you imagine a burglar breaks in\nyour house and picking the lock and\n\n395\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.960\nall that and coming inside.\n\n396\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.690\nAnd is like hey there's criminals\naround here man, we got to fix this.\n\n397\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He installs a little camera so\n\n398\n00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.740\nhe can see who else is breaking in.\n\n399\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.620\n>> Yeah it's like we're here to install.\n\n400\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.670\nTo secure your house,\nwe're gonna take some of your stuff.\n\n401\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.950\nBut yeah, there's criminals around here.\n\n402\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.375\nYou can get your stuff stolen.\n\n403\n00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:56.270\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n404\n00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.990\na lot of stuff we really need to go over\nwhen it comes to exploiting a system.\n\n405\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.150\nFrom gaining access to\ncracking a password to\n\n406\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.830\nescalating my credentials and\npossibly running some type of program.\n\n407\n00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.995\nAnd then maintaining access in the end so\na lot of good stuff coming up.\n\n408\n00:23:13.995 --> 00:23:17.950\nSean anything else we want to throw in\nin our overview here for X exploitation?\n\n409\n00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.120\n>> Well, like Mike said.\n\n410\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.790\nJust keep track of those or\nkind of remember those different little\n\n411\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:28.490\nsteps in there and what's happening,\nbecause you're gonna see them all.\n\n412\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.555\nAnd remember you don't have\nto use them in that order.\n\n413\n00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:36.635\nYou might find open net allows you\nto jump right on in to another step.\n\n414\n00:23:36.635 --> 00:23:40.365\nI mean for example you might be able\nto do a privilege escalation without\n\n415\n00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:45.250\never cracking a password because\nyou found it someplace else.\n\n416\n00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:46.210\nYou found it maybe,\n\n417\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.240\nyou know those were reconnaissance\nmethods that we talked about, and\n\n418\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.510\nthe CEH, and we didn't show all the web\nthings here again, the Google hacks.\n\n419\n00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.510\nMaybe you used a Google hack and\nyou found an Excel spreadsheet or\n\n420\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.510\nsomething sitting out there that\nhad user and a password in it.\n\n421\n00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.240\nNow is your time when you do your\nnumeration, and you find your user names\n\n422\n00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.670\nin there, you can say okay well you know\nwhat I remember a user of this name and\n\n423\n00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:15.015\nI remember a user of that same name in my\nMy Google hacks have a file with that.\n\n424\n00:24:15.015 --> 00:24:17.515\nAnd you're like, okay let me try it.\n\n425\n00:24:17.515 --> 00:24:18.605\nAnd it works.\n\n426\n00:24:18.605 --> 00:24:20.255\nMaybe you don't need it, if it works.\n\n427\n00:24:20.255 --> 00:24:22.835\nYou don't need to crack\na password at that point.\n\n428\n00:24:22.835 --> 00:24:25.555\nYou can just move right on\ninto privilege escalation,\n\n429\n00:24:25.555 --> 00:24:27.675\ncuz you may have exactly what you need.\n\n430\n00:24:27.675 --> 00:24:28.630\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And who knows?\n\n431\n00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.300\nYou might even a new privilege escalation.\n\n432\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.390\nIf you recall in CEH, how many\nadmin accounts were we able to pull\n\n433\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.070\nfrom Google hacks, so\nyou may have everything you need anyway.\n\n434\n00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.170\n>> I was gonna say,\nstart off with the admin account,\n\n435\n00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.780\nyou really don't need to escalate\nanything, so you're good to go there.\n\n436\n00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.420\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n437\n00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.400\n>> All right, good deal.\n\n438\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.270\nGood information there.\n\n439\n00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.290\nStick around, we've got more exciting\nepisodes coming up on Gaining Access,\n\n440\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.450\nbut for now, signing off for ITPRO TV.\n\n441\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.520\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n442\n00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.110\n>> And I'm Sean

00:00:16.400\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.470\nHow are you Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.720\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.260\n>> How are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.610\n>> I'm doing fantastic!\n\n8\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.430\nWe're continuing on with\nout Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.660\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at correcting passwords, I guess.\n\n10\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140\nWe've been talking about\nthis gaining access phase.\n\n11\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.510\nWe talked about different ways\nwe go about getting access and\n\n12\n00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000\nkind of the entire process as an overview.\n\n13\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.070\nNow we're gonna take a look at some of the\nfirst steps involved in gaining access and\n\n14\n00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.060\nthat means getting a password,\nSean, right?\n\n15\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.830\nSomehow we've gotta get on the system\nto start this whole thing.\n\n16\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.700\n>> Yeah, that's definitely what you\nhave to do is you have to get to that\n\n17\n00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.870\npoint where you can obtain a password, and\n\n18\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.680\nfortunately we've got a multitude\nof ways of doing that.\n\n19\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.620\nIn fact, it's kind of unbelievable\nthe amount of ways you have to do this.\n\n20\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.800\nIn fact,\nwe could say one of the things we have yet\n\n21\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.730\nto cover is to talk about some of the\nsniffing tools we have available to us.\n\n22\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.880\nSome of the stuff that we do over there\nwill actually come right back around and\n\n23\n00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.260\nfeed back into password cracking again.\n\n24\n00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070\nSo, we're gonna talk about some\nof the things that will actually\n\n25\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.485\nhelp you crack those passwords, so\nwhen we get to sniffing and I say,\n\n26\n00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:25.205\nwell you can grab this of the wire, well,\nhere's a tool specifically for that.\n\n27\n00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:28.095\nIt's just crazy the type\nof things they can do.\n\n28\n00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:29.935\nAnd this is just the stuff out of the box.\n\n29\n00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:32.877\nThere's even more you can load in.\n\n30\n00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:37.697\nSo, yeah, we're gonna talk about some of\nthese different ways you can do that,\n\n31\n00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:40.547\nyou can crack these different\npasswords out there.\n\n32\n00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:45.117\nSo where we'll take a look at,\njust to give you\n\n33\n00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:50.057\na quick overview of the options that\nare available, is inside of Kali,\n\n34\n00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:54.380\nwhich I've pulled up on my screen here,\ninside of Kali,\n\n35\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.240\nI have gone down to the Kali Linux Menu,\nand gone under Password attacks.\n\n36\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.250\nAnd you can see that we have four\nsubmenus that are beneath there\n\n37\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.480\nthat are designed specifically to\ndo different things with passwords.\n\n38\n00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.850\nYou can see we have our GPU tools and\n\n39\n00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.920\nwe'll worry about those ones, that's\na little more powerful class of things.\n\n40\n00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.270\nThere's our Offline attacks, so\n\n41\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.910\njust look at the sheer number\nof those that we have.\n\n42\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.040\nAnd there are some recognizable\nnames in there if you look close,\n\n43\n00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.791\nyou'll see stuff in there like Hashcat.\n\n44\n00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:34.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n45\n00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.218\n>> We did mention that, in the forensics\ncourse we mentioned that one.\n\n46\n00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:39.434\n>> Right.\n\n47\n00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:42.100\n>> We have John and Johnny,\n\n48\n00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.090\nthose are actually the same thing,\nif you can believe it.\n\n49\n00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.007\nWe talked about John the Ripper as\na password cracker over in CEH.\n\n50\n00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:51.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n51\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.490\n>> Well, that's what those guys are, but\n\n52\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.140\nthe reason why it's in there twice\nis one of them is a command line and\n\n53\n00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.100\nthe other one will actually\nbring up a GUI for you.\n\n54\n00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.710\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n55\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.120\n>> So you got both options.\n\n56\n00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.850\nSo if you're kind of sitting there\njonesing for a GUI at this point,\n\n57\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.705\nwell, we've got one for you.\n\n58\n00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:13.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you're not allowed to use it yet,\n\n59\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.998\nso there's that.\n\n60\n00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we've got,\n\n61\n00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.550\nyou can see Ophcrack on there, and\n\n62\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.920\npwdump on there, and then there's\nsome stuff for rainbow tables.\n\n63\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.680\nI mean, you see a lot of\nutilities in there just for\n\n64\n00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.610\ndoing offline password cracking.\n\n65\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.610\nAnd then we go over to our online attacks.\n\n66\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.130\nOnline attacks, like we said, these are\nones that are designed to engage a system\n\n67\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.810\ndirectly and extract information from\nthose connections that are active.\n\n68\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.530\nAnd so if you look at those, I mean,\nwe've got some really good ones there.\n\n69\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.220\nAnd by the way, some of these things\nthat we see in here are designed\n\n70\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.600\nspecifically to generate word lists, and\nthey've got unique ways of doing that.\n\n71\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.870\nAnd we'll be discussing some\nof those here in just a bit.\n\n72\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.952\nSo we have quite a wide\nrange of things there.\n\n73\n00:04:08.952 --> 00:04:12.450\nWe see Medusa, an online password cracker,\n\n74\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.500\nthat's designed to crack a system and\nbust into it that way.\n\n75\n00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.210\nWe've got Burp Suite.\n\n76\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.870\nYou may recall Burp Suite\nfrom when we did our CEH,\n\n77\n00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.250\nthat's something you can use to view\nthe interaction between a browser and\n\n78\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.310\na server, and see what the headers are,\ngoing back and forth.\n\n79\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.840\nAnd even modify or\n\n80\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.410\neven outright drop headers to\nsee how the system reacts to it.\n\n81\n00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.115\nSo we've got that making an appearance.\n\n82\n00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:44.710\nPlus, other ones in there,\n\n83\n00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.885\nI mean, you can even see that\nwe have a Cisco tool in there.\n\n84\n00:04:49.885 --> 00:04:54.905\nSo if you have Cisco devices,\nthey've come to play with those ones, too.\n\n85\n00:04:54.905 --> 00:05:02.560\nLike I said, Kali has pretty much\ngot a lot of bases covered for you.\n\n86\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.120\nSome of these things you're gonna have\nto have a little more than the knowledge\n\n87\n00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.390\nwe can teach you right here.\n\n88\n00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.780\nI mean, Cisco stuff,\nthis isn't a Cisco class,\n\n89\n00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.440\nso you'd have to know the Cisco stuff to\nknow how to use the Cisco auditing tool.\n\n90\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.895\nBut it is there, so that's the good thing.\n\n91\n00:05:19.895 --> 00:05:23.194\nAnd then we've got this Pash\nin the Hash type of attacks,\n\n92\n00:05:23.194 --> 00:05:26.335\nwhich is something that we'll worry about.\n\n93\n00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:29.525\nThis is one that's been around for\nabout 15 plus years, and\n\n94\n00:05:29.525 --> 00:05:34.460\nso we'll talk about that\na little more as we go further.\n\n95\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.380\nBut those are your main things for\ndoing password attacks.\n\n96\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.670\nSo that's our pull down.\n\n97\n00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.060\nWe'll go through some of these things with\nyou, and we'll show you what they do.\n\n98\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.780\nAnd you'll see what the options are, and\n\n99\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.520\nthen you can decide how you're gonna\ngo ahead and use them, yourself.\n\n100\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.950\n>> Nice, so\nwe got a lot of different tools and\n\n101\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.930\nit really comes down to am I doing\nthis offline attack or online attack?\n\n102\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.175\nIt kinda gears me towards which\ntool that I'm using, right?\n\n103\n00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:05.200\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And in an offline attack,\n\n104\n00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.850\nI need something,\nI need either a hash of their password.\n\n105\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.750\nI've either stolen like a SAM file or\ngot into their account database or\n\n106\n00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.310\nmaybe intercepted some hashes\ngoing across the network,\n\n107\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.290\nlike you were talking about with sniffers.\n\n108\n00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.800\nOnline attacks,\nnow we're interacting with that system.\n\n109\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.920\nSo a different set of tools because\nI don't have the hash of the password\n\n110\n00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.242\nthat I can work against with my\nalgorithms and things like that, right?\n\n111\n00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:33.000\nI've gotta submit a password and\nclick Enter and see what happens, right?\n\n112\n00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.230\nSo those kind of tools\nare geared more towards that.\n\n113\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.320\nThat's where those word lists come into\nplay cuz you have to have something to\n\n114\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.300\nfill in those fields and see what happens.\n\n115\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.180\nYou're basically doing password\nguessing with that online stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.740\nOnline, too,\nyou gotta worry about policies, right?\n\n117\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.940\nWhereas, offline I don't have\nto worry about that so much?\n\n118\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.440\n>> Yeah, there's different issues\ninvolved when you do offline.\n\n119\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.726\nAnd policy would be, if you're\ntalking about account lockouts and\n\n120\n00:06:58.726 --> 00:07:00.856\nstuff like that, then yeah, definitely,\n\n121\n00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:05.210\nthat moves out of the picture because\nyou're not directly engaging the system.\n\n122\n00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.940\nSo that's a big benefit of it.\n\n123\n00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.350\nIf you try to engage a system directly,\nyeah, policies are something that is very\n\n124\n00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.500\ncommonly just gonna stop\nyou dead in your tracks.\n\n125\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.420\nSo we wanna kind of stay away from those,\n\n126\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.750\nif we have another option or\nif we know it's gonna take a while.\n\n127\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.890\nIf you know that that password's\nprobably low hanging fruit and\n\n128\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.470\nyou can get it pretty quickly,\nthen online is just fine.\n\n129\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.290\nSo, I mean,\n\n130\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.600\nI'm not saying stay away from them,\nthat's what I want to kind of avoid doing.\n\n131\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.452\nDon't ever use that, no.\n\n132\n00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:38.439\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Everything has its time,\n\n133\n00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.095\nand it's just recognizing when\na good time to use it is.\n\n134\n00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:46.795\n>> And probably during your enumeration,\nif you've gotten a hold of their policies,\n\n135\n00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:50.832\nyou might know that hey, they lock\nthe account after five attempts, and\n\n136\n00:07:50.832 --> 00:07:53.171\nit resets that account lock out counter.\n\n137\n00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:57.325\nAfter 30 minutes, so you could use your\ntool to say, okay, do four guesses,\n\n138\n00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:58.388\nwait 40 minutes.\n\n139\n00:07:58.388 --> 00:08:00.280\nDo four more guesses,\nwait 40 minutes, right?\n\n140\n00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.390\nIt never actually locked the system out.\n\n141\n00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.730\n>> Yes, and\nyou can definitely manipulate it.\n\n142\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.620\nAnd you'll see in some of these password\nsniffers, or sorry, password crackers,\n\n143\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.060\nyou'll see that they do have switches\nin there to adjust the timing.\n\n144\n00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.889\nSo they haven't kind of left\nyou out in the cold on that, so\n\n145\n00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.357\nyou can do stuff to alter that,\nto kinda get around certain things.\n\n146\n00:08:24.357 --> 00:08:25.640\n>> Nice.\n\n147\n00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.860\n>> Something else worth\nmentioning in here, not\n\n148\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.780\nall the tools that would be useful for\n\n149\n00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.280\npassword cracking are in\nthe exact same place.\n\n150\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.764\nIf you go through and,\ngotta remember where this actually is,\n\n151\n00:08:45.764 --> 00:08:49.395\ncuz this is one of the problems with this.\n\n152\n00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.660\n>> Too many menus.\n\n153\n00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.131\n>> It's like where was that again?\n\n154\n00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:59.690\nWe have in here\n>> We have a tool that is used for,\n\n155\n00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.940\nwell, I don't necessarily\nneed to really dig it out.\n\n156\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.940\nBut we do have a tool in\nhere that's specifically\n\n157\n00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.750\nused for doing policy enumeration.\n\n158\n00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.390\n>> Mm, okay.\n>> So\n\n159\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.560\nif you can maybe get into a system\nin some way, shape, or form, or at\n\n160\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.920\nleast find maybe that they're doing that\n>> They have those\n\n161\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.250\nnull session capability.\n\n162\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.340\nIf they, heck, if they've got,\nif it's a Windows box and\n\n163\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.970\nyou're able to get a null session\nout of that, and remember,\n\n164\n00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.340\nthere was tools we saw yesterday\nthat are able to get a null session.\n\n165\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.800\nYou can actually extract some of that\npolicy information out of that system, and\n\n166\n00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.260\nthat may tell you stuff that you're\ntalking about, as far as what you\n\n167\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.960\nmight need to do to refine your attack\na bit more to keep it from being thwarted.\n\n168\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.470\n>> Nice.\n\n169\n00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.256\n>> So, yeah,\nthey've got you covered on that.\n\n170\n00:09:53.256 --> 00:09:58.192\nSo we've got plenty of things\navailable to us to kind of get around\n\n171\n00:09:58.192 --> 00:10:00.580\nsome of these things.\n\n172\n00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.210\n>> So, where do we want to start?\n\n173\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.068\nAre we gonna talk about offline?\n\n174\n00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:06.110\nSean, if we're doing an offline attack,\nso that means I have.\n\n175\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.979\nWell, first I guess we should talk about,\nif we're doing an offline attack,\n\n176\n00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:12.868\nI've got to have something\nto feed this program, right?\n\n177\n00:10:12.868 --> 00:10:14.890\n>> Yeah.\n>> I may have a copy of the SAM file.\n\n178\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.590\nWe've got tools available to\ngo grab that kind of stuff.\n\n179\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:24.300\n>> Yeah, and we can put this away for\na second just to kind of discuss what\n\n180\n00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.830\nwe've got going on here as\nfar as a SAM file goes.\n\n181\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.180\nJust a quick review for all of you,\nbecause this is something that is used in\n\n182\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.900\na lot of these password crackers,\nis they do require a copy of the SAM file.\n\n183\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.490\nAnd what the SAM file is, Security\nAccounts Manager in a Windows system.\n\n184\n00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:49.474\nIt's that local database that sits there\nand stores information on users and\n\n185\n00:10:49.474 --> 00:10:51.705\ngroups and all that type of stuff.\n\n186\n00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:54.080\n>> All your local accounts and\nlocal groups.\n\n187\n00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.500\n>> Yeah,\nit's got all those things in there.\n\n188\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.080\nSo many of these tools like Ophcrack and\n\n189\n00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.550\nthe LSADump and pwdump and\na few other ones.\n\n190\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.550\nThey will specifically ask for\nthat file, and they'll\n\n191\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.730\nscan the file and then pull stuff out it\nfor you and say, this is what I've found.\n\n192\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:19.120\nThey'll kind of make sense of all that for\nyou.\n\n193\n00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.410\nNow the issue there is,\n\n194\n00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.850\nyou have to get ahold of that\nSAM file to be able to do that.\n\n195\n00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.608\nAnd so the question is,\nhow do you get ahold of that SAM file?\n\n196\n00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:31.720\nWell, the SAM file,\nto get ahold of it, you've got, again,\n\n197\n00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.510\nyou've got some options.\n\n198\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.183\nProbably the most common way to do it is\nto, or one of the more common ways to do\n\n199\n00:11:38.183 --> 00:11:41.541\nit, I guess I should say,\nis to shut down the system and\n\n200\n00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:45.942\nto boot off of another piece of media and\njust copy the file off of there.\n\n201\n00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:48.356\nAnd just go and grab it and boom.\n\n202\n00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:51.270\nAnd then you've got the file.\n\n203\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.220\nAnd you can take it over and\nanalyze it in a program like this.\n\n204\n00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.190\nBut you could potentially\ndo a system state,\n\n205\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.390\nlike a system state backup, some of\nthose backups will actually grab it.\n\n206\n00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.360\nAnd there are some tools\nthat can actually grab it,\n\n207\n00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.310\nwhile the system's on, but\nyou might wanna be careful with those,\n\n208\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.050\nbecause that could be more\ntrouble than it's worth.\n\n209\n00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.170\nSome of the tools that do that,\ndo the way they work.\n\n210\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:22.460\nThey're finding little loopholes and\nopenings in Windows to get around that,\n\n211\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:28.660\nto be able to break that exclusive\naccess and get a copy of it.\n\n212\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.740\nWell, if it's find a way to get around it,\nthere's a potential that when it gets\n\n213\n00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.990\naround it to get a copy,\nit breaks up and it corrupts something.\n\n214\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.079\nNow you've got a system\nthat is in a bad way.\n\n215\n00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:40.090\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n216\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.025\n>> And so\nnow you've got that to figure out,\n\n217\n00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:44.695\nbecause that's a dead giveaway\nthat you did something.\n\n218\n00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:46.480\nThe system's all blue screened.\n\n219\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.000\n>> I got your SAM files, so\nI got all your local accounts and\n\n220\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.750\npasswords, but your system's blue screened\nand I can't really access it anymore.\n\n221\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.140\nAnd the big problem is that that file for\nthose of you who aren't aware,\n\n222\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.690\nthat file is locked, right, by Windows.\n\n223\n00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.730\nSo if you just browse that location\nI threw up in the chat room, SQL and\n\n224\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.320\nWindows System 32 config\n>> That's where you're\n\n225\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.390\ngonna find that SAM file.\n\n226\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.020\nBut if you try to just browse to it and\ngrab it, it's locked.\n\n227\n00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.270\nIt's in use by system in Windows.\n\n228\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.640\nSo that's what Sean saying,\n\n229\n00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.830\nyou have to boot to another\nalternate operating system.\n\n230\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.050\nGo in your Kali Linux thumb drive, right?\n\n231\n00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.802\nThrow it in there, boot the system with\nthat, now you can browse that hard drive\n\n232\n00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:27.341\nwhen the system is not in use and you\nshould be able to get a copy of that file.\n\n233\n00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:30.441\nOr like you said if you're lucky and\nyou found one of their backups and\n\n234\n00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:34.074\nyou can figure out how to mount that, you\ncan go there and grab that from a backup,\n\n235\n00:13:34.074 --> 00:13:36.940\nwhich is a kind of a sneaky\nway to get around it, too.\n\n236\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.840\n>> Yeah, you definitely have\nmethods to get around to getting\n\n237\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.850\nthat SAM file, so\ndo remember that you can get that thing\n\n238\n00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.190\nand use it with these\noffline password crackers.\n\n239\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.750\nSo that's the first thing that we\nwanna make sure that we are clear on.\n\n240\n00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:06.030\nOnce we've got that clear,\nwhat options do we have?\n\n241\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:12.298\nNow, I kind of refrained\nfrom actively breaking\n\n242\n00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:17.900\na password right here in front of you,\nbecause that process can take some time.\n\n243\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.109\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna treat this as,\n\n244\n00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:25.755\nhey, to kinda give you\nan idea of what things,\n\n245\n00:14:25.755 --> 00:14:30.835\nthe steps you go through to\nactually grab that information.\n\n246\n00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:36.539\nSo things we can do to make this,\nto retrieve information,\n\n247\n00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:41.570\nwe have several tools that\ncan help us out with that.\n\n248\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.555\nWe have, for example, for\na SAM file, we have, like I said,\n\n249\n00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:48.465\nOphcrack is one that will do that.\n\n250\n00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:52.040\nOphcrack is gonna have a GUI for it, and\n\n251\n00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.850\nall you have to do is just load\nthe SAM file into that and\n\n252\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:01.930\nit will start analyzing it and\nseeing what it can return back to you.\n\n253\n00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:08.350\nSo that's definitely one way you\ncould attain a password out of that.\n\n254\n00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.350\nAnd there's other ones.\n\n255\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:13.480\nJohn the Ripper will actually do that too.\n\n256\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.789\nSo you can grab John the Ripper and\nit will start analyzing\n\n257\n00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:23.220\nthat SAM file so\nyou can extract stuff out of it.\n\n258\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.080\nAnd by the way, when you look at those\ntwo, like I said one's the GUI and\n\n259\n00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.570\none is not.\n\n260\n00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.350\nIf you look at those two,\nJohnny is actually\n\n261\n00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.670\nthe one that opens up the GUI.\n\n262\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.330\nSo it does the same thing,\n\n263\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.080\nit's pretty much the same stuff\nstill running in the background.\n\n264\n00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.406\nSomeone just threw a GUI on it and\nsays, well, there you go.\n\n265\n00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:48.297\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n266\n00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:50.354\nall the people that were complaining,\ngoing, oh, there's no GUIs.\n\n267\n00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.294\nShut up, there's a GUI.\n\n268\n00:15:51.294 --> 00:15:51.922\nOkay, leave us alone.\n>> Thank you.\n\n269\n00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:52.661\nThank you very much.\n\n270\n00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:53.267\nWhat.\n\n271\n00:15:53.267 --> 00:15:55.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n272\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:00.650\nthat's what we have going on with that.\n\n273\n00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.140\nAnswer your question,\n\n274\n00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.420\nyou get to the SAN through the registry-\n>> You can but it's not,\n\n275\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.030\nI did it on my machine just to see\nif I could go in there and get it,\n\n276\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.090\nand you'd get into the SAN key.\n\n277\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.630\nIt's HD local machine SAM.\n\n278\n00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.630\nYou get in there and\nthere's really nothing to find in there.\n\n279\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.940\nSo I assume it's reading\nfrom that file as necessary.\n\n280\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.010\nI didn't dive too much deeper than that.\n\n281\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.430\nI don't think there's a way\nyou can go in there and\n\n282\n00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.280\nread it out of there directly and\nget the hash values out there.\n\n283\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.930\nI could be wrong.\n\n284\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.620\nI'll work on that for you, Ben, and\nsee if I can find a way to do that though.\n\n285\n00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.820\n>> Yeah it would be pretty tough\nto do it that way but you could.\n\n286\n00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.420\nThere's ways to do it when it's on but,\nlike I said,\n\n287\n00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.110\nthose might be the more risky.\n\n288\n00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.860\nBut, once you've got command of it,\nI don't know,\n\n289\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.360\nmaybe you could do it without\nhaving too much of a problem.\n\n290\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.010\nThe things you kinda wanna stay away from\nwhen you're trying to extract stuff or\n\n291\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.430\ntamper with stuff in the SAN\nrelating to passwords and\n\n292\n00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.888\nall that stuff is that anything involves.\n\n293\n00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:12.120\nYou kinda wanna just give\nthat a wide berth on that,\n\n294\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.390\nbecause if you tamper with the and it\nbreaks or something goofy happens to it,\n\n295\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.095\nthat system's,\nit's jacked up at that point.\n\n296\n00:17:22.095 --> 00:17:24.920\n[LAUGH] You're going to\nhave some serious problems.\n\n297\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.230\nI've seen it done.\n\n298\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:31.430\nIn fact, some of these tools like\none of the ones we mentioned in CEH,\n\n299\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:38.110\nwe mentioned using the trinity rescue kit,\nthat you could boot off of and modify.\n\n300\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.850\nIt's actually going into\nthe SAN database and\n\n301\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.580\ndoing something related\nto what we're doing.\n\n302\n00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.720\nIt's not trying to extract the password.\n\n303\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.170\nIt's actually going in and\noverwriting the password with a new one.\n\n304\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.990\nSo that's how it works, but\n\n305\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:58.250\none of the things it offers you is it\nsays do you want to disable Syskey?\n\n306\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.960\nAnd it will ask that no matter\nwhat version of Windows you're on.\n\n307\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.100\nIt says if it has Syskey,\n\n308\n00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.410\nand it's going to ask you to\ndo you want to disable Syskey.\n\n309\n00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.930\nIf you do that, they give you a warning.\n\n310\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.690\nBy the way, I'll tell you,\nif you turn this off,\n\n311\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.220\nit says we're not responsible for anything\nthat happens from this point forward.\n\n312\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.300\nIf you continue with it, it could actually\npermanently disable that account or\n\n313\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.680\ncause something really crazy to happen.\n\n314\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.500\nAnd therefore, that account's no longer\nany good, and it could do even worse.\n\n315\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.620\n>> Right.\n>> So you definitely want to be careful.\n\n316\n00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.280\nWhen doing some of these\nlittle workarounds like that.\n\n317\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.260\nSo, as far as tools that will grab and\n\n318\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.635\nwork with the SAM file,\nlike we have OffCrack,\n\n319\n00:18:42.635 --> 00:18:45.885\non the Windows side, by the way,\nLoftCrack will do it too.\n\n320\n00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:48.515\nSo LoftCrack will do that.\n\n321\n00:18:48.515 --> 00:18:53.457\nWe also have the LSA dump,\nPW dump, we'll do that.\n\n322\n00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:58.217\nThat they will go out there and\nthey will look at the SAM file.\n\n323\n00:18:58.217 --> 00:18:59.617\nSo that's just a few of them.\n\n324\n00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:02.277\nThey also have PW Dump 2.\n\n325\n00:19:02.277 --> 00:19:03.757\nThey have SAM Dump 2.\n\n326\n00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:06.827\nThose will just ask for that and\n\n327\n00:19:06.827 --> 00:19:11.647\nyou'll tell it that here's the actual SAM\nfile and it will work its magic on it.\n\n328\n00:19:11.647 --> 00:19:14.427\nYou might have to do some\nadditional configuration on it but\n\n329\n00:19:14.427 --> 00:19:17.330\nit's pretty much straightforward.\n\n330\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.820\nBut it could take some time.\n\n331\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.760\nDon't expect it to be like,\nhey Don, see you later.\n\n332\n00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.700\nIt's not gonna be that quick unless\nsomeone's got a really simple password.\n\n333\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.850\nIt's gonna take some time to do that.\n\n334\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.380\nSo you could be turning it on and\n\n335\n00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.069\ncoming back in a few hours\nto actually get your result.\n\n336\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.600\nBut you typically will get it though.\n\n337\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.250\nSo, any case, that's the SAM file ones.\n\n338\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.150\nI mentioned John the Ripper.\n\n339\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.650\nSome other ones I think are just\n\n340\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.930\nreally important to mention because I\ncould definitely see them coming up.\n\n341\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:04.140\nIs, I put two tools on my list here,\n\n342\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.660\nI have one called TrueCrack, and\n\n343\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.170\nthis one is actually,\na really Interesting one to look at.\n\n344\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.290\nWhat this one does,\nthe reason why I mention TrueCrack is this\n\n345\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.600\none's designed specifically\ntarget true crypt volumes.\n\n346\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.870\nSo you can go in there and\nstart up TrueCrack, and\n\n347\n00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.260\nit will try to recover information\nout of those true volumes.\n\n348\n00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.880\nIt will even try to recover those\nhidden volumes that we have.\n\n349\n00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.860\nThat we could have hidden inside another,\na true crypt volume, so\n\n350\n00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.980\nthat's kinda cool to be able\nto do that sort of thing.\n\n351\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.950\n>> You have that up on your screen for us?\n\n352\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.520\n>> I ran the tool up here,\nI don't have a true crypt volume, but\n\n353\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.210\nif you wanna take a look at the tool.\n\n354\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.570\nI've got it up on screen.\n\n355\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.630\nIt's a command line tool.\n\n356\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.180\nWhat you would do is you\nwould just run truecrack and\n\n357\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.620\nthen what you do is just tell\nit here's the actual file.\n\n358\n00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.690\nYou can specify encryption\ntechnologies and all that's using.\n\n359\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.020\nHere's a word list.\n\n360\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.040\nRemember we said you could\ngenerate a word list.\n\n361\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.420\nAnd the reason why I'm not really\nworried about the word quite yet,\n\n362\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.450\nyou can download those things from online,\nyou don't have to create one yourself.\n\n363\n00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.050\nReason you might create\none yourself is because\n\n364\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.700\nyou need to have something\nspecific to that environment.\n\n365\n00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.055\nOr there's something just there that is\ngonna help you out better than grabbing\n\n366\n00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:34.165\nsomething that's available to everyone and\nkind of generic.\n\n367\n00:21:34.165 --> 00:21:36.865\nSo that's why I'm not really\ntoo worried about it.\n\n368\n00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:39.135\nYou can download it but we'll show\nhow to actually create your own.\n\n369\n00:21:39.135 --> 00:21:42.135\nThere's some methods of creating your own.\n\n370\n00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:44.915\nSo once you kind of dump\nall this stuff in and\n\n371\n00:21:44.915 --> 00:21:51.070\nyou can see it's got plenty of options\nto it, just type it in and let it go.\n\n372\n00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.760\nAnd it will take some time but\nusually it's pretty good at breaking into\n\n373\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.120\na TrueCrypt volume, so\nthat's kind of a neat thing.\n\n374\n00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.000\nIf you need that, I guess.\n\n375\n00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.570\n>> There's still people who use TrueCrypt?\n\n376\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:09.370\nI know it's a, it's used a lot, so.\n\n377\n00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:15.970\n>> Yeah, we saw that when we\ndid one of our other courses.\n\n378\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.660\nWhen we were talking about it,\n\n379\n00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.070\nI remember there being a few people\nin here that said they still use it,\n\n380\n00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:27.660\neven though there was that\nvulnerability that they said is in it.\n\n381\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.580\nPeople kinda said okay, well that's fine.\n\n382\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.830\nIt's not a big enough deal, or\nit just hasn't proven to be a problem.\n\n383\n00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.630\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n384\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.040\nThey still might run into that out there.\n\n385\n00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.700\nSo yeah, a lot of different\ntools we can use when it looks,\n\n386\n00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.390\nwhen we're looking at doing\nthat offline cracking.\n\n387\n00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.100\nThe big thing is getting ahold of that SAM\nfile trying to use one of these tools to\n\n388\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:46.860\naccess that.\n\n389\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.270\nPWDump or something like that.\n\n390\n00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.700\nThat kinda gives you your source, right?\n\n391\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.810\nCuz these tools need input, they need\nsomething to work on, something to crack.\n\n392\n00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.250\nSo that SAM file or those hash values,\nthat's what we need.\n\n393\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:04.470\n>> Yeah, exactly, and so\nwe can do the SAM file.\n\n394\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.280\nWe saw that if they have something locked\nup in a true crypt volume we can grab it.\n\n395\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.510\nWe also one that is an interesting one,\nis this FCrackZip.\n\n396\n00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.290\nThat one you can pretty much grab.\n\n397\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.440\nYou can kind of assume from those\nlast few letters what it's doing.\n\n398\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.440\nThis one's designed specifically\nto crack zip files.\n\n399\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.950\nAnd people use those all the time, and\n\n400\n00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:31.960\nyou see people that still put passwords\non them, which isn't a bad thing.\n\n401\n00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.960\nBut it's definitely not something\nthat's really gonna stop someone that\n\n402\n00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.120\nis really determined.\n\n403\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.190\nAnd this is got a tool that's\nspecifically designed to bust a zip file.\n\n404\n00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.104\nIt might take some time, but\nI've said, it will do it.\n\n405\n00:23:45.104 --> 00:23:50.026\nSo, that's a tool specifically\ndesigned for that purpose.\n\n406\n00:23:50.026 --> 00:23:54.333\nBut, one of the things I\nkinda wanna talk about also,\n\n407\n00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:59.980\nhere just While we've got a few\nmoments left, is I want to talk about,\n\n408\n00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.560\nlet's say you have a hash, and\nyou wanna do an offline crack on that.\n\n409\n00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:12.165\nOne of the offline attacks that we're just\nnot gonna set up here is a rainbow table.\n\n410\n00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:14.610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One of the things we said is,\n\n411\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:19.200\nif you remember from CEH,\na rainbow table generates\n\n412\n00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.940\nall the possible combinations of all\nthe possible hashes of the memory,\n\n413\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.460\nevery possible combination of characters\nwithin a certain range if you tell it.\n\n414\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:31.040\nSo it uses the hash algorithm and\nall that good stuff to crate that.\n\n415\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.810\nWell what do you do if you have\nmultiple rainbow tables and\n\n416\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.710\nyou want to figure out what hash\nalgorithm was used to create that hash?\n\n417\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.550\nAnd so you can either run it\nagainst the right rainbow table or\n\n418\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.630\nmaybe you've got a hash and you want\nto learn something about that system.\n\n419\n00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.360\nMaybe you can learn about what\nhash algorithms it's using.\n\n420\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.330\nSo I'm just gonna cheat\njust a little bit here.\n\n421\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.680\nI am going to,\nwell I've got this online MD5\n\n422\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.630\ngenerator, and\nit's one that we've seen before.\n\n423\n00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:13.326\nWhat I'm going to do in here is I am going\nto say, okay, this is a test password.\n\n424\n00:25:13.326 --> 00:25:15.330\nI'll call it that.\n\n425\n00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:21.670\nI'm going to take that and say it's MD5\nand it generated that hash on the fly.\n\n426\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.200\nOkay.\nSo you don't need to worry about what\n\n427\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.690\nthe hash specifically is.\n\n428\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.170\nI mean you can look at if you want.\n\n429\n00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.430\nThat's not the part of the demo\nI'm really interested in.\n\n430\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:37.680\nWhat we can do is we can go under\nKali Linux and password attacks and\n\n431\n00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.080\noffline attacks, and\nyou'll see this hash identifier tool.\n\n432\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.690\nWhat I can do is I can go over here,\nand I copied it.\n\n433\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.710\nI should go paste my hash\nright in there and hit enter.\n\n434\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:54.900\nAnd it analyzed it, and\nit spit out a bunch of stuff, but\n\n435\n00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:59.820\nthat scrolled by pretty quickly, so\nlet's see what it's actually telling us.\n\n436\n00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.670\nWell there's my hash.\n\n437\n00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:02.360\nIt told me right up top.\n\n438\n00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.590\nIt's MD5, and it tells me, oh,\n\n439\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:09.510\nit could be related to this,\nMD4 cuz the second choice it has.\n\n440\n00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.510\nAnd then it goes down the list saying\nthese are other ones that I can check\n\n441\n00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:20.170\nagainst, but those are just not,\ndon't fit as well as MD5 does.\n\n442\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:25.530\nSo in this case what\nwe've done in a quick and\n\n443\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.740\neasy move here,\nis we have a way of identifying\n\n444\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.530\nwhat was used to create a specific cache,\nit can tell that.\n\n445\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.690\nSo that's a neat thing.\n\n446\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:45.050\nBecause it can tell you, maybe just this\nhash identifier tool outside of passwords,\n\n447\n00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.060\nmaybe if you were able to\nextract hashes from something,\n\n448\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.170\nno matter what it was on a system.\n\n449\n00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.670\nYou wanna learn,\nmaybe how that person configured it and\n\n450\n00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.250\nwhat that back end looks like.\n\n451\n00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.340\nYou could use this to say okay,\n\n452\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.290\ngrab one of their hashes,\noh this is what they're using.\n\n453\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.880\nLike now I've got a little idea\nof maybe some other configuration\n\n454\n00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.110\nsettings in there.\n\n455\n00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:06.970\nSo that would be very handy for that.\n\n456\n00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.910\nAnd I'll tell you something else\nto add onto here really quickly\n\n457\n00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:20.860\nhere is if I didn't mention this in\nthe CEH, which I don't think I did,\n\n458\n00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:26.580\nif you go to, there's a web site\ncalled the Hacker Warehouse.\n\n459\n00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.870\nIf you go over here, this is to show you.\n\n460\n00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.200\nCuz I also see in the chatroom\nabout not creating your own\n\n461\n00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.070\nword list out there,\nit's probably not worth it.\n\n462\n00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.640\nWell that can be kind of questionable\nif it's worth it or not.\n\n463\n00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.558\nSome people say it is,\nsome people say it isn't.\n\n464\n00:27:49.558 --> 00:27:57.270\nThat would take a little bit of time but\nwhatever.\n\n465\n00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.480\nWhat you can buy off the Hacker Warehouse\nis that it has a hard drive\n\n466\n00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.690\nthat you can buy for $150 out there\nthat contains pre-made rainbow tables.\n\n467\n00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.230\n>> Mm, nice.\n>> So if you really need it,\n\n468\n00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.720\nit's got it right there.\n\n469\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.270\nAnd it's got it within a certain range,\nand\n\n470\n00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.300\nit's got all the different values and\neverything stuck in there already.\n\n471\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.000\nSo all you gotta do is really\nplug it in and point it to it and\n\n472\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.500\nlet it rock and roll.\n\n473\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.770\nSo they're making this as easy as\npossible, and that's not even including\n\n474\n00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:30.600\nthe stuff they have online already where\nyou can pretty much do a variation of what\n\n475\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:36.480\nI just did and just take that hash and\ndump it into a form on a website and\n\n476\n00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.300\nhit submit and it'll tell you right\naway what was used to create that.\n\n477\n00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.490\nCuz someone's already done it.\n\n478\n00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.010\n>> Absolutely.\n\n479\n00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:42.910\nAbsolutely.\n\n480\n00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.820\nYeah, and\nI would agree there with Timothy.\n\n481\n00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.560\nIf you're talking about rainbow tables,\nabsolutely,\n\n482\n00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.070\nyou're much better off going and\nfinding someone who's already\n\n483\n00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.280\ngone through the trouble of hashing\nall these different possibilities,\n\n484\n00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.430\nbecause those things are huge and\nthey take forever to generate.\n\n485\n00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.610\nNow if you're talking\nabout a dictionary file,\n\n486\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.360\nwe're talking about password guessing.\n\n487\n00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.335\nIn that case, I love making my own\nlist because I can be very specific.\n\n488\n00:29:04.335 --> 00:29:07.075\nI've also got all these different lists\nthat I've compiled over the years.\n\n489\n00:29:07.075 --> 00:29:09.175\nLike one is, Klingon words, you know?\n\n490\n00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:12.325\nBecause there's a lot of geeks out there\nthat use Klingon as their password.\n\n491\n00:29:12.325 --> 00:29:13.670\nNobody's going to guess that.\n\n492\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.750\n>> What you talkin about, Willis?\n\n493\n00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.320\n[LAUGH].\n>> [LAUGH] right?\n\n494\n00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.560\n>> So, I do make my own dictionary files,\n\n495\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.010\none word on each line.\n\n496\n00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:25.080\nAnd every list I find, I just append to\nthe end of my list, this huge list of all\n\n497\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.170\nthe common French first names, you know,\nKlingon words,Star Wars phrases,\n\n498\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.800\nand Star trek,\nthings like that you're not gonna find.\n\n499\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.970\nSo those are the kinds of things that\nI like doing in dictionary files, for\n\n500\n00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.330\nthe password guessing.\n\n501\n00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.140\nNow when it comes to breaking hashes,\nyeah,\n\n502\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.020\nI'm not gonna build my own rainbow table.\n\n503\n00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.999\nI don't have enough processing\npower time to wait for that.\n\n504\n00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:46.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it definitely takes some time.\n\n505\n00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.840\nI was able to pull this up on my screen.\n\n506\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.770\nI just opened up another browser\noutside that virtual environment.\n\n507\n00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.530\nThere you go,\nthere's your Rainbow Tables hard drive.\n\n508\n00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.020\nTwo terabytes, which gives you an idea\nof how big these rainbow tables can get.\n\n509\n00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.580\nThere's all the different Rainbow\ntables that it possesses.\n\n510\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.780\nSo those are all little\ndatabases that you could use and\n\n511\n00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.140\nit's got them of different algorithms,\ndifferent bits and everything else.\n\n512\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:20.570\nYou can just buy this and\nbe ready to do whatever you need to do.\n\n513\n00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:21.280\n>> Absolutely.\n\n514\n00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.170\nYeah, and another comparison\nthere with the rainbow tables,\n\n515\n00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.510\nwe've got their hash value.\n\n516\n00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.190\nSomehow we've used PW dump or\n\n517\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.410\nsomething like that, we've got\nthe hashed version of their password.\n\n518\n00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.120\nIf I'm doing online password\nguessing I don't have that, right?\n\n519\n00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.940\nI don't have their hash.\n\n520\n00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.750\nI've got a form that says username and\npassword, and\n\n521\n00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.750\nI gotta enter data into that.\n\n522\n00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:44.260\nAnd I'm not entering hash values,\nI'm entering possible passwords.\n\n523\n00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.740\nThat's why I've gotta\nhave that password list.\n\n524\n00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.530\nAnd I think there's\ngood to generate those.\n\n525\n00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.590\nYou can definitely start with\nsomething you find online and\n\n526\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.520\nstart compiling them up and putting\nthem together to build a massive list.\n\n527\n00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:59.300\nAnd these computers will rifle through\nthose dictionary files in minutes.\n\n528\n00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.600\n>> Yeah, it's no problem to get a lot\nof the stuff or do a lot of the stuff.\n\n529\n00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.200\nBut yeah, rainbow tables is the exception,\nit's gonna take some time.\n\n530\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.350\n>> All right.\nWell, I'll tell you what.\n\n531\n00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.220\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n532\n00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.070\nwe've got more to talk about when\nit comes to password cracking.\n\n533\n00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.480\nBut we're out of time for this episode.\n\n534\n00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.370\nSo, for now, we hope you guys\nhave enjoyed watching this one.\n\n535\n00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.930\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n536\n00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.920\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n537\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.318\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n538\n00:31:25.318 --> 00:31:31.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.230\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.480\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.700\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.250\n>> I can't complain.\n\n7\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.050\nHere we are at ITProTV getting\nready to record another episode\n\n8\n00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.930\nin our Kali Linux series.\n\n9\n00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.180\nIn this one we're going to continue on.\n\n10\n00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.590\nWe've been talking about\ndifferent ways to crack passwords.\n\n11\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.790\nWe're going to jump on over and\n\n12\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.970\ntake a look at some of the online\npassword tracking techniques.\n\n13\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.300\nThis is when you don't have a hash value,\nyou haven't used some of those other tools\n\n14\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.770\nto dump a SAM file, or intercepted some\nhashes with some sniffer type program.\n\n15\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.970\nSo you're up against a log-on\nscreen of some kind.\n\n16\n00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.560\nA lot of times it's some web-based form or\nsomething like that,\n\n17\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.030\nthat I'm trying to log into.\n\n18\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.800\nAnd so we're doing it online, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.306\nWe're actually going to the system's\npage and trying to hit it.\n\n20\n00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:00.863\nRight?\n\n21\n00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:01.548\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n22\n00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:06.146\nAnd that's really the big thing\nthat differentiates it from\n\n23\n00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:10.293\noffline is that yes we\nare actively engaging a target at\n\n24\n00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:15.890\nthis point with the idea that\nwe are gonna break the password.\n\n25\n00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.790\nUsually if you do something like this,\nyou're usually pretty sure you\n\n26\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.480\ncan get the password and\nyou can do it in a short period of time.\n\n27\n00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520\nThose are the types of things\nwe're attained to look for.\n\n28\n00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390\nIt doesn't mean it's only\nrestricted to those situations, but\n\n29\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.476\nthose make good candidates for it.\n\n30\n00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:36.270\nBecause online, due to the way it is,\nyou run the risk of being detected and\n\n31\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.360\nyou run the risk of triggering system\npolicy that will in turn stop that\n\n32\n00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.310\nfrom going, it will stop your\nattack from going any further.\n\n33\n00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.720\nSo, you kinda wanna figure out\nif this is the best approach.\n\n34\n00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970\nBut, with that being said, there are still\nplenty of tools that can accomplish\n\n35\n00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.610\nthis online cracking of passwords,\nand can do it really well, too.\n\n36\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.080\nThey're really adaptable and\nreally powerful.\n\n37\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.300\n>> He's referring to all those policies,\nthe account lock-out policies.\n\n38\n00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.820\nLike in Windows environment, you can\nonly guess that password incorrectly so\n\n39\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.980\nmany times before, maybe,\nthe account gets locked out.\n\n40\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.800\nIf they bothered to turn that on.\n\n41\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.700\nWe probably need to figure\nout what that setting is.\n\n42\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.110\nA lot of applications,\nyou guys have been to webpages.\n\n43\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.940\nI've locked myself out of my own webpages,\ncuz you know by typing in the wrong\n\n44\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.400\npassword, forgetting that I changed it,\nand trying to log back in, and all of\n\n45\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.370\na sudden you get a message, your account\ncannot be used please send us a message.\n\n46\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.530\nYou know?\nSomething like that.\n\n47\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.420\nA lot of systems do have that in place\nwhere, and that's exactly what they're\n\n48\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.790\ntrying to prevent is password guess,\nwhich is what we're trying to do.\n\n49\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.470\nAnd so they try to limit how many\nguesses you can throw at it.\n\n50\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.190\nThey say oh wait a second, this isn't\nsomebody that forgot their password, this\n\n51\n00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.235\nis somebody trying to guess a password\nwe're gonna stop it in it's tracks.\n\n52\n00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:50.280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, they've got a pretty good defense\n\n53\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.660\nagainst it but not everybody\nturns that on, and as you said,\n\n54\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.510\nthese tools have ways that they can\nmaybe not necessarily defeat it but\n\n55\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.600\navoid it or\ntry to skate right under that policy.\n\n56\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.940\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n57\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.160\nPeople have accounted for that,\nbecause they know these systems,\n\n58\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.010\nthey've put defenses in place specifically\ndesigned to thwart these types of attacks.\n\n59\n00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.830\nSo what they want to do is they want to\nmake it so those mechanisms that are gonna\n\n60\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.930\nstop the attack don't get triggered or\nthey delay that as much possible\n\n61\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.560\nbefore that they It would\nbe before they're caught.\n\n62\n00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.570\n>> Right.\n>> And so with that in mind,\n\n63\n00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.510\nyou know we have things like Medusa,\nTHC Hydra,\n\n64\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.560\nwe've got you know just a bunch of\ndifferent ones in this category.\n\n65\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.840\nIn fact, one of the ones I will show you.\n\n66\n00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.320\nUp here just for\n\n67\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.400\na moment just to show you some of\nthe options, I have up on my screen.\n\n68\n00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.250\nI have this is the GUI form of THC Hydra,\n\n69\n00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.010\nTHC Hydra if you used that,\nthat's strictly at the command line.\n\n70\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.990\nDoes the same thing as this will do, but\n\n71\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.200\nsomeone's written this\nlittle simple GUI for it.\n\n72\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.750\nAnd what this will do is when\nyou run this xHydra interface,\n\n73\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.210\nyou can see in here that you can\nhave it go after a single target.\n\n74\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.620\nYou can put a comment,\na limited list of targets in there,\n\n75\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.620\nor put a file in there that tells\nit what it's gonna strike at.\n\n76\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.190\nWhat port it's going to attach to.\n\n77\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.720\nTake a look,\nit even supports IP 6 if you've got that.\n\n78\n00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.110\nSo it can go over that\nprotocol if you've got it.\n\n79\n00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.570\nSo you can tell it what port,\n\n80\n00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.610\nand you can even tell it what protocol\nit's specifically going after, and\n\n81\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.110\nyou can see it supports a whole\nbunch of them out there, so\n\n82\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.200\nwe've got a big long list, so you can\nreally fine tune it to the specific ones.\n\n83\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.920\nWe wanna go after FTP,\nwe've got FTP right there.\n\n84\n00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.610\nAll we gotta do is just make sure\nit's going out to the right port and\n\n85\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.820\nwe're in a good spot.\n\n86\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.589\nAnd then you can see we have other options\ndown here if we choose to do that.\n\n87\n00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:01.363\nYou can see we've got SSL support and\nif you really want to get involved you\n\n88\n00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:05.983\ncan do the other ones that will tell\nyou how many attempts it's taken and\n\n89\n00:05:05.983 --> 00:05:10.460\nverbosity, which will actually give\nyou a lot of information on it.\n\n90\n00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.870\nPasswords, here's your actual\nwhen you go through and tell it,\n\n91\n00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.910\nyou can tell it what user names to go\nthrough, and passwords to go through.\n\n92\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.840\nYou can set a list,\n\n93\n00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.169\nif you have a dictionary file you\ncan do all that type of stuff.\n\n94\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.940\nAnd then, here's the stuff we can really\nget into in these last couple tabs.\n\n95\n00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.300\nI say last couple,\nbecause this last one says start.\n\n96\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.668\nGee, I wonder what that's going to do.\n\n97\n00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:36.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> To talk about what we just said\n\n98\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.090\na moment ago, we have this tuning tab.\n\n99\n00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.180\nIf you take a look at this tuning tab.\n\n100\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.610\nIt is exactly what we were talking about,\nor Mike was talking about,\n\n101\n00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.190\njust a second ago.\n\n102\n00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.160\nThat's what this is\nspecifically designed to do,\n\n103\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.410\nis adjust the way this engages the target.\n\n104\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.280\nSo it has less of a chance of\nactually triggering anything.\n\n105\n00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.850\nSo you can tweak that and\nsee how well it works.\n\n106\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.380\nAnd see if you want to get more\naggressive or if you need to back off it.\n\n107\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.880\n>> I like that option\nthere too that allows you\n\n108\n00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.200\nto stop if it's found something.\n\n109\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.870\nDon't continue on through the list.\n\n110\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.790\nMaybe you want it to, maybe you\nwant it to look for other accounts.\n\n111\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.040\nOr you can have it say, oh I found\none that works, stop right there.\n\n112\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.180\nCuz I now gain access to the system and\n\n113\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.980\nmaybe do my privilege escalation,\nmaybe I don't need to\n\n114\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.660\ntake a chance on setting off alarms by\ncontinuing to guess those passwords.\n\n115\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.390\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n116\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.670\nAnd then we've got, you know,\nother options in here for other things\n\n117\n00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.580\nto specific protocols and\nyou can put those in.\n\n118\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.830\nYou can see we got the app.\n\n119\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.630\nThat would be good for\nactive directory type stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.190\nNot the only one that uses it,\nof course, but we have that.\n\n121\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.526\nAnd then when you're ready to go,\njust click on your start button or\n\n122\n00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:53.920\nyour start tab and you'll start\nseeing it run those parameters, and\n\n123\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.570\nstart spitting out stuff there.\n\n124\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.042\nAnd just go ahead and\neither watch the fun, or\n\n125\n00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:04.720\ncome back in a bit, and see what happens.\n\n126\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.445\n>> You'll either find some passwords, or\nrealize that the authorities run the way.\n\n127\n00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:13.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they should have a little\n\n128\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.730\nthermometer type thing there,\nthat just goes along and tells you.\n\n129\n00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.670\n>> If we're doing a pen test though,\n\n130\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.030\nwe try to avoid setting off the alarms,\nright.\n\n131\n00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.260\nOr maybe we report back that your\nsystem is pretty well tuned.\n\n132\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.420\nI had trouble even getting\nmy tools to function because\n\n133\n00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.670\nof your password policies or\nsomething like that.\n\n134\n00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.045\nSo you could report back either way.\n\n135\n00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:37.310\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo that's that one, that's Hydra, and\n\n136\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:43.950\nlike I said, Medusa will do the same type\nof thing, so those aren't the only ones.\n\n137\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.900\nWe've got plenty of other\ntools that do this but\n\n138\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.220\nthe thing I want to kind of point to when\nwe're doing this and we can't kind of,\n\n139\n00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.580\nyou know, forget what we're doing here for\na second on this, in my virtual machine.\n\n140\n00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.840\nTo kind of get away from that,\nwe've got this tool.\n\n141\n00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.180\nWe've got hydrot you're doing this stuff,\nand\n\n142\n00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.700\nwe have other tools that\nrequire word lists.\n\n143\n00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.390\nWhat do you do if you\nactually need that word list.\n\n144\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.270\nLike we said,\nyou can download them if you want.\n\n145\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.170\nBut what if those aren't really\nadequate for what you need?\n\n146\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.950\nFor what you are trying to accomplish,\n\n147\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.050\nyou need something a little more\ntailored to a specific environment.\n\n148\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:26.120\nWell, that's been covered too.\n\n149\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:34.695\nThat's been covered through a tool known\nas CeWL, if you wanna call it that.\n\n150\n00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:35.415\nC-E-W-L.\n\n151\n00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:43.715\nI'm not gonna run the tool and\n\n152\n00:08:43.715 --> 00:08:48.885\nhave it go through the process of\ngenerating a word list, but I'm\n\n153\n00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:53.550\njust gonna kind of tell you what it does\nand show you some of the options here.\n\n154\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.230\nIn my virtual machine.\n\n155\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:02.990\nSo what we have up on my screen right\nnow is I have CEWL up here in this box.\n\n156\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.910\nWhat this is, is you can see it's\nclearly a command line tool, and\n\n157\n00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.070\nyou can see all the options on how you\ncan tell it to generate a word list.\n\n158\n00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.490\nBut what this is doing is if you look at\nsome of the options here, just giving\n\n159\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.790\na clue of how this is working, you see\nthat is has the double dash off site.\n\n160\n00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.240\nIt's got, as we go through we can see\nproxy information and things like that.\n\n161\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.900\nThat's telling you that it's going\nout someplace to get information.\n\n162\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.780\nAnd I told you,\nthis isn't a password cracker,\n\n163\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.220\nthis is something that\ngenerates a word list.\n\n164\n00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.210\nSo what this will do is this will,\nif you target it towards\n\n165\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:49.130\na victim's site, what the hope is, is that\nwhen it goes through the victim's site.\n\n166\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.970\nIt will start spidering it and\ngathering information.\n\n167\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.370\nHopefully the information it\ngathers can build a word list for\n\n168\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:02.310\nyou that's custom to that situation and\nyou can try that word list against.\n\n169\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.320\nAgainst the system to see if it\ngenerates anything of use to you or\n\n170\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.690\nif it gets you in.\n\n171\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.360\nSo that's what CeWL does.\n\n172\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.310\nAnd who knows?\n\n173\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:15.170\nI mean, there could be stuff\non that site that may get you\n\n174\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.440\nsome action as far as getting\nin deeper to that site.\n\n175\n00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.480\nThat's kind of a neat thing really,\nwhen you look at it.\n\n176\n00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.274\nThe way I kind of position this though,\nthis is just me,\n\n177\n00:10:27.274 --> 00:10:30.436\nis while I do see a value in this tool,\n\n178\n00:10:30.436 --> 00:10:34.218\nhaving it spider a victim site and\nsay okay.\n\n179\n00:10:34.218 --> 00:10:38.469\nI'm gonna build a word list based off\nof what I find I am probably gonna\n\n180\n00:10:38.469 --> 00:10:42.645\nto take the list it has here, and\ncombine it with other lists, too,\n\n181\n00:10:42.645 --> 00:10:44.580\njust to supplement those out.\n\n182\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.790\nSee if those don't work, well,\n\n183\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.710\nhere's another pass it can do,\nbut that's a little more exotic.\n\n184\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.570\nBecause this will generate words,\n\n185\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.600\nwho knows if they're actually\ngoing to be successful.\n\n186\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.500\nIt may, it may not.\n\n187\n00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.290\nLet's go ahead and\nboost our chances a bit more.\n\n188\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.520\nIf we can.\n\n189\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.000\nSo that's what CeWL does.\n\n190\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.120\nLike I said, I'm not going to worry\nabout pointing it out to a site and\n\n191\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.930\nletting it generate the word list because\nwe're just going to be looking at it for\n\n192\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.100\na considerable amount of time\nas it spits all that out.\n\n193\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.130\nAnd then we have a text file at the end.\n\n194\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.140\n[LAUGH] So\nwe don't need to go through that.\n\n195\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.780\nSo that's what that tool does.\n\n196\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.029\nThat is one of the offline tools\nthat we can just go ahead and use.\n\n197\n00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:29.282\n>> That is very cool.\n\n198\n00:11:29.282 --> 00:11:33.058\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not the only one that generates\n\n199\n00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:38.010\nthose lists though, so you do have\nother options if you want to generate\n\n200\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.930\nthose lists, so\n>> So we're done with that, with CeWL,\n\n201\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.240\nthere's not really much\nelse to talk about there.\n\n202\n00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:51.055\nIf you want to try it, all the switches\nare right there and you can go ahead and\n\n203\n00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:55.118\nuse it on your specific site and\nsee, or your specific target and\n\n204\n00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:56.638\nsee what it generates.\n\n205\n00:11:56.638 --> 00:11:57.172\n>> Nice.\n\n206\n00:11:57.172 --> 00:11:59.540\n>> But that's really it.\n\n207\n00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.870\nIs it just go through and\nwill start pulling stuff out of there,\n\n208\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.340\nsee what it can do to generate\nan effective word list for you.\n\n209\n00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.560\n>> And\nthese word lists are reusable right,\n\n210\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.490\nI don't have to generate\none every time as you said.\n\n211\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.550\nTypically if I think of something else or\nI want to add some more options in there,\n\n212\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.300\nwe just append it to the end.\n\n213\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.870\nSo we got that one master list and most of\nthe tools, accept the same format, right?\n\n214\n00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.120\nIt's just one word on each line.\n\n215\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.860\nThat's what a dictionary file is,\na text file with one word on each line.\n\n216\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.370\nAnd it just goes one by one and\ntrying them.\n\n217\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.050\nSo once you make that list,\n\n218\n00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.880\nyou can typically use it with several\ndifferent cracking utilities.\n\n219\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.380\nAny one of them that does\nthat online guessing,\n\n220\n00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.390\nyou just tell it where that file is and\npoint it to it.\n\n221\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.530\nSo it's something that you build up\nover time, and it just gets bigger, and\n\n222\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.580\nbigger, and bigger.\n\n223\n00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.960\n>> Yeah I would definitely consider\njust building a library of text files.\n\n224\n00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.770\nI mean you can store them on,\nget a external hard drive or something,\n\n225\n00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.620\njust store them on there and\nkeep them for later use.\n\n226\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.664\nThere's no reason why you couldn't.\n\n227\n00:12:57.664 --> 00:12:58.186\n>> Yeah.\n\n228\n00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:05.610\n>> But anyways so we talked about CeWL.\n\n229\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.900\nWe talked about Hydra, and XHydra.\n\n230\n00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.515\nI keep thinking of\nthe Avengers when I see that.\n\n231\n00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:14.260\n[LAUGH] The hail Hydra.\n\n232\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.080\nBut anyway, but\nthen the last one on here for\n\n233\n00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.090\nonline is actually a brute forcing tool,\nand it's actually a really powerful\n\n234\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:28.080\none for doing online stuff, cuz it works\nagainst different protocols and all that.\n\n235\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.725\nNow, I like the name because,\nI really like the name, Potater.\n\n236\n00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:37.035\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's get Potater out here.\n\n237\n00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:39.410\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n>> So I just feel like I have to say it\n\n238\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.510\nwith that accent.\n\n239\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n240\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.430\n>> But that's the name of it, is Potater.\n\n241\n00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.740\nAnd you can use that to break passwords.\n\n242\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.270\nIt will do brute force attacks against\n\n243\n00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.110\ndifferent services with\nthe intention of breaking it.\n\n244\n00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.435\nSo that's just one more option that you\nhave, and you could feed word lists and\n\n245\n00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:04.275\nstuff like that into it too, if you want,\nto really customize how it works.\n\n246\n00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:07.505\nBut, that's just another\none that you could\n\n247\n00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:12.085\nkinda throw into the mix to\nget the results that you want.\n\n248\n00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:13.455\nLike I said,\n\n249\n00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:18.005\nwe can't go through all the actual\npassword crackers that are on there.\n\n250\n00:14:18.005 --> 00:14:22.970\nSome of them actually do require having\nthat specific, a specific environment\n\n251\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.760\nbeing set up, but\nwe do have some nice ones in there.\n\n252\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.770\nYou can see we've got\nthe Cisco stuff is on there.\n\n253\n00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.220\nWe've got some stuff for web applications.\n\n254\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:40.620\nPlus some other things that are just kind\nof thrown in there that you can try out.\n\n255\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:47.510\nWe even have one, this THCPPTP,\nso something for VPNs.\n\n256\n00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.648\n>> Right,\na little point tunneling protocol?\n\n257\n00:14:49.648 --> 00:14:50.413\n>> Yeah, it's.\n\n258\n00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:56.750\nYou've got some neat stuff you can try and\nbring to bear.\n\n259\n00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.980\nSo there you go.\n\n260\n00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.979\nThings you can actually work with and\nsee what's being done.\n\n261\n00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.150\nMost of these tools, just to be fair,\nexcept for the Cisco stuff.\n\n262\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.120\nMost of these tools you can\nuse against any of those\n\n263\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.580\nvulnerable machines that\nwe have talked about.\n\n264\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.910\nYou can just grab any of those vulnerable\nmachines like metasploitable stuff\n\n265\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.690\nlike that.\n\n266\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.500\nAnd just run them against them.\n\n267\n00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:25.830\nAnd a lot of those things have simple\nstuff in there cuz they're built that way.\n\n268\n00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.740\nAnd just play with them, see how it works,\ndoesn't take as much time, but\n\n269\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.592\nit still takes some time.\n\n270\n00:15:32.592 --> 00:15:35.330\n>> All right so\nwe've got our online password\n\n271\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.590\ncracking utilities we can use\nto do our password guessing.\n\n272\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.290\nSo on a previous episode we got our\noffline password cracking tools we can\n\n273\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.160\nuse.\n\n274\n00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.562\nThat should, hopefully, knock on wood,\nget us into our system.\n\n275\n00:15:47.562 --> 00:15:50.223\nRight?\n>> Yeah, there are other ways we can get\n\n276\n00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:55.770\na password, but, like we said,\nwe're not gonna address those right here.\n\n277\n00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.630\nThe big one being the social\nengineering aspect of it.\n\n278\n00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.850\nBut since we have something that's\nalready gonna take care of that,\n\n279\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.620\nwe're not gonna do it here,\nbut there's one more\n\n280\n00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.932\nmention of it just to make sure\nthat you know that that is there.\n\n281\n00:16:08.932 --> 00:16:12.695\nBut these,\nas far as the online and offline,\n\n282\n00:16:12.695 --> 00:16:17.715\nyeah, you know what they are,\nand you know where the tools are.\n\n283\n00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:23.160\nAnd now you can go ahead and kinda try\nthem out yourselves and see what you get.\n\n284\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.140\nVery good, very good.\n\n285\n00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.290\nAll right,\nwell a lot of good information there.\n\n286\n00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.150\nSean, anything we want to\nthrow in on cracking passwords\n\n287\n00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.620\nin before we call it a wrap?\n\n288\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.496\n>> I just want to say potater one\nmore time, because I like it.\n\n289\n00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:36.120\nBut no I-\n>> It's going to be his favorite\n\n290\n00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.750\ntool from now on.\n\n291\n00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.315\nI know it is.\n\n292\n00:16:37.315 --> 00:16:39.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Have you guys seen potater?\n\n293\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.695\n>> They were all fried\nby the time I got to it.\n\n294\n00:16:43.695 --> 00:16:46.236\n>> [LAUGH] I don't have\nreally anything to add,\n\n295\n00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:49.327\nbecause if you really want\nall the specifics I guess,\n\n296\n00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:53.881\nit would be one thing to add if you want\nall the specifics of password cracking.\n\n297\n00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:58.044\nI mean, we beat that to\ndeath in the CEH course, so\n\n298\n00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:02.220\nnow you're just seeing\nsome tools that can do it.\n\n299\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.160\nSo if you need to clarify\nsome of those a bit more.\n\n300\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.880\nWe've already been there, done that.\n\n301\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.810\nSo now we look at the tools.\n\n302\n00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:13.300\nSo just go ahead and\nstart experimenting really.\n\n303\n00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.180\n>> Yeah.\nStart building those Word file lists.\n\n304\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.970\nThat's something you can do in your\nspare time even before you need it.\n\n305\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.850\nIf you wanna build your own rainbow\ntables that's another thing that can\n\n306\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.710\ntake a lot of time.\n\n307\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.440\nSo if you wanna build your own or\ngo out and buy that\n\n308\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.720\none that Sean was showing us earlier,\nbut hey, start building those as well.\n\n309\n00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.675\nYou got a computer that's sitting\nin a corner doing nothing?\n\n310\n00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:32.257\n[SOUND] We'll have a go and\nstart building up your files.\n\n311\n00:17:32.257 --> 00:17:36.547\nBy the time you need it, you've got\na nice word list already ready, or\n\n312\n00:17:36.547 --> 00:17:39.280\na rainbow table or whatever you need.\n\n313\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.270\nLots of good information there.\n\n314\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.750\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode,\n\n315\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.420\nwe know we had a lot of fun filming it for\nyou, but for now, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n316\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.610\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n317\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.720\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n318\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.065\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n319\n00:17:53.065 --> 00:17:58.244\n[SOUND]\n\n",

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:18.130\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.,\n>> How you doing Sean?\n\n4\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.466\n>> I'm doing pretty good how you doing?\n\n5\n00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.870\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n6\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.070\nWe got another episode of our Kali Linux\nseries coming your way, and in this\n\n7\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.760\none we're gonna be talking about what\nhappens after you gain access to a system?\n\n8\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.980\nThis is our exploitation\nphase in our progression.\n\n9\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.160\nWe've talked about gaining\naccess to the system by\n\n10\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.980\ndoing som offline password cracking or\ndoing some online password cracking.\n\n11\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.600\nNow that we've got a username and password\nthat we can use to get onto that system.\n\n12\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.990\nOur next step, then, Sean is to\npossibly do some privilege escalation,\n\n13\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.150\ndepending on what kind of account\nwe got in the first place right?\n\n14\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.340\n>> Yeah, that would definitely be a good\nnext step is to see if you could acquire\n\n15\n00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.930\nthe credentials of an account that\ncould boost your access that much more.\n\n16\n00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.720\nAnd there are ways to definitely\ndo that and to do it pretty well.\n\n17\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.190\nOne of the things you\ncan use to do that is\n\n18\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.650\na little utility known as dSniff.\n\n19\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.830\nAnd this is that we're going to see\nagain when we talk about sniffing\n\n20\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.240\nin a later section.\n\n21\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.410\nBut what dsniff can do for\nyou is, if you do dsniff\n\n22\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.410\nyou can just do dsniff, tell it to go\nlisten on an interface and tell it,\n\n23\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.350\nin this case eth0 like we've been\ndoing all along, same interface.\n\n24\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.330\nSo now it's listening here.\n\n25\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.670\nWell, the thing that's really\nneat about this is that,\n\n26\n00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.010\nokay it's not doing anything right now,\nbut what will happen\n\n27\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.710\nis that while it's actually listening,\nyou're not seeing anything up here.\n\n28\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.970\nWhat's gonna happen is\nthat if I were to go and\n\n29\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.530\nstart do an FTP session or picked up\ntraffic related to an FTP session,\n\n30\n00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.800\nit would display just the credentials.\n\n31\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760\nThat's all it would is it would\ntell you hey, here's the server.\n\n32\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.630\nHere's the credentials that you\nuse to log in, and that's it.\n\n33\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.670\nSo it is definitely a sniffer and\nfits in that category pretty squarely.\n\n34\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.690\nBut what we're seeing here is that because\nit only picks up those credentials and\n\n35\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.900\nnothing else, It's, it's, gonna help you\ndo a potential privilege escalation,\n\n36\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.500\nbecause, yeah FTP is one thing, but\nthere's plenty of other protocols that\n\n37\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.270\nit can also do that with as well,\nthat could help you out.\n\n38\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.650\nSo that's a pretty neat thing, dSniff can\ndo it with SNTP and stuff like that too.\n\n39\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.260\nSo it's, it's pretty, varied and\nbroad With the protocols that support.\n\n40\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.130\nSo rather than just running a generic\nsniffer that's capturing all traffic and\n\n41\n00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.360\nthen I've gotta go in and filter data and\nlook for authentication packets or\n\n42\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.090\nlook for what I'm needing.\n\n43\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.760\nI can run dSniff and ignore all that other\nstuff, and it's just going to show me\n\n44\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.310\nthose identification packets that\nare going by for different protocols.\n\n45\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.250\n>> Yeah, we'll pluck those ones out and\njust display the information\n\n46\n00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.540\nthat pertains to those\nthings designed to look for.\n\n47\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.740\n>> Anything else just gets dropped, it's\nnot even going to pay attention to it.\n\n48\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.700\nSo what you end up with is a nice\npiece of information, nothing else.\n\n49\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.812\nIt's just eliminated all that,\nyou don't have to go searching for\n\n50\n00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:45.230\nit or any of that, it's right there.\n\n51\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.881\n>> And I'm hoping most of you have\nrun a packet capture utility at some\n\n52\n00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:48.917\npoint in your careers, and you know that\non a network with more than one computer,\n\n53\n00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:49.655\neven with just one computer,\n\n54\n00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:51.400\nyou fire up Wire Shark,\nyou're getting all kinds of traffic right?\n\n55\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.210\nAnd then you've got to go back in and run\nyour filters to get down to what you need.\n\n56\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.820\nSo having something like this that\nfocuses just on those authentications, or\n\n57\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.620\njust those passwords for\nthe different protocols, that's fantastic.\n\n58\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.730\nThat saves me a lot of time.\n\n59\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.670\nI don't have to dig through 200,000\npackets to find the ten that I'm looking\n\n60\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.090\nfor that dealt with some authentication\non some of those conversations,\n\n61\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.090\nso that's great, Sean.\n\n62\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.020\n>> Yeah,\nit really narrows stuff down for you.\n\n63\n00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.370\nJust to give you an idea here.\n\n64\n00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.710\nI don't need to show you this.\n\n65\n00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.659\nBut here's an idea of\nthe protocols that dSniff will\n\n66\n00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.330\nactively search out credentials for.\n\n67\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.250\nIt's got FTP, TELNA, SNTP, HTTP,\nif you're passing it over that, POP.\n\n68\n00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.740\nIt's got NNTP, IMAP, SNMP, there we go.\n\n69\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.580\nLMAP.\n\n70\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.230\nIt's got a lot of the routing\nprotocols in here.\n\n71\n00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.060\nMS CHAP is in there.\n\n72\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.200\nNFS is in there.\n\n73\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.893\nIt's actually got Napster, imagine that.\n\n74\n00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:50.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's got IRC Aim, ICQ.\n\n75\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.880\nIt's got some Citrix stuff,\nsome Antex stuff, some Microsoft stuff.\n\n76\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.170\nAnd then, you know, Oracle.\n\n77\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.150\nSo it's got a pretty,\njust in that one tool alone,\n\n78\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.130\nit's got quite a bit of functionality and\nfor\n\n79\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.210\nprojeclications you might be able to\noff any of those, be able to grab\n\n80\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.330\nan account that's got what the stuff\nthat you need to go one step further.\n\n81\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.270\nI mean, you just kind of\nthink about what you could do\n\n82\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.440\nwith some of those protocols that I,\nthat I mentioned.\n\n83\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.950\nYou could easily capture credentials and\nsee, okay what could these get me?\n\n84\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.860\nOr what damage could I do with these?\n\n85\n00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.770\nSo we've gained access to the system\nby cracking, brute forcing, or\n\n86\n00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.530\nguessing one username and password,\nand now that we're on the system,\n\n87\n00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.290\nwe can sniff traffic and\ntry to capture others.\n\n88\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.160\nMaybe they've got more credentials or more\nprivileges than we do, maybe they don't.\n\n89\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.670\nBut at least we've got more\noptions that we can now try.\n\n90\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.500\nRather than trying to brute force or\nguess other usernames and\n\n91\n00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.450\npasswords, just capture what's going on in\nthe network there, and try those and see.\n\n92\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.788\nSo that's one way you could\nescalate your credentials.\n\n93\n00:05:55.788 --> 00:06:01.440\nAnother way, Sean, might be to actually\nmodify the account that we hijacked, or\n\n94\n00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.190\nnot hijacked, I shouldn't say that, or\nthe one that we've attacked and broken?\n\n95\n00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.240\n>> Yeah, you could do that.\n\n96\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.790\nYou could go in there and start tweaking\nstuff in the sand to see if that helps you\n\n97\n00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.860\nout, and by doing that,\nthen you can log in.\n\n98\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.830\nOne of the ways we solved doing\nthat in our previous CEH,\n\n99\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.960\nwas to use the TRK,\nthe Trinity Rescue Kit.\n\n100\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.060\nThat's exactly what it's doing.\n\n101\n00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.930\nIt's modifying an existing account,\nso you can get into it and\n\n102\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.510\nthen you can start doing\nwhatever you need to with it.\n\n103\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.170\nSo you have that possibility as well.\n\n104\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.759\nAnd we're not even bringing\ninto the picture stuff like\n\n105\n00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.730\nscripts that you could possibly build.\n\n106\n00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.880\nWe're not bringing in key loggers where\nyou can drop one of those on the system.\n\n107\n00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.030\nBecause those would help as well\nto capture this information and\n\n108\n00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.960\njust go one step further with it.\n\n109\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.790\nSo again you've got quite a bit approaches\nthat you can take to escalate privileges.\n\n110\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.750\nAnd remember there are two types\nof doing a privileged escalation.\n\n111\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.800\nThere are, there is the horizontal one,\nwhere you are just\n\n112\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.970\ngoing from one account to another account\nwith increasing privileges back and\n\n113\n00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.530\nforth until you acquire\nthe level you need.\n\n114\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.220\nOr you do a vertical which is\nwhere you have an account and\n\n115\n00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.780\nyou try to get more privileges added\nto that account to raise it up.\n\n116\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.870\nSo you could approach it either way,\ndepending\n\n117\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.850\non what is gonna to be the best\napproach for that given situation.\n\n118\n00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.280\nSo, there's different options that way\ntoo, but these are some of the things.\n\n119\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.855\nI mean, dSniff, if you capture credentials\n\n120\n00:07:34.855 --> 00:07:38.715\noff something that would definitely\nbe a horizontal privilege escalation.\n\n121\n00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:41.855\nBecause what you're doing is you see\nanother account with more privileges and\n\n122\n00:07:41.855 --> 00:07:43.165\nyou see it's password?\n\n123\n00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:44.285\nWell, okay.\n\n124\n00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:48.667\nI'll just jump over and use that one and\nI'll potentially run other sniffers or\n\n125\n00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.387\ndo something else at that\npoint to get more information.\n\n126\n00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.852\nJust keep jumping back and\nforth, and back and forth.\n\n127\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:57.268\nUntil I have what I need to\nplant something on the system or\n\n128\n00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.054\nrun something on the system.\n\n129\n00:07:59.054 --> 00:08:00.089\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n130\n00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:02.466\nSo we gotta get those,\nI mean, it depends right?\n\n131\n00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:07.025\nYou might've broken in and actually got\nthe administrator account, that user\n\n132\n00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:11.460\naccount that you've picked up might be\nin the local admin's group already.\n\n133\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.050\nSo maybe you don't need to\ndo the privilege escalation.\n\n134\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.220\nMaybe you can go right into starting\nto run some of your programs,\n\n135\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:23.210\nbut if you find that you can't run\nthose programs that you're trying to\n\n136\n00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.685\ndo once you've gained access,\nthen we go to that privileged escalation.\n\n137\n00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:28.150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n138\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.750\n>> And if we've done our SAN file dump,\nif you can see, and\n\n139\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.230\nI know there's some tools that we can\nuse to dump RIDS and things like that.\n\n140\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.130\nRemember how that works?\n\n141\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.910\nLike in a Windows system,\n500 is the RID for that administrator,\n\n142\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.040\nthat built in admin account.\n\n143\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.178\nThat's the one we're looking for.\n\n144\n00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:44.382\n>> Yep.\n>> Hopefully.\n\n145\n00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:45.850\n[LAUGHTER]\n>> Yeah.\n\n146\n00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.420\nIt's definitely important to\nremember that little item as well.\n\n147\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.680\nSo, now we've got these\ntargeted accounts figured out.\n\n148\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.220\nThat we can do, approach escalation.\n\n149\n00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.360\nWe've just got to figure out\nhow far we're going to take it.\n\n150\n00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.100\nDon't think your ultimate\ngoal is always gonna be\n\n151\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.870\nthe big bad administrator account.\n\n152\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.550\nYou may not need that to accomplish\nwhat you need to accomplish.\n\n153\n00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.470\nSo if you don't need that,\ndon't go after it because\n\n154\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.190\nthat's a more heavily defended account and\nit's more closely monitored typically.\n\n155\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.370\nSo avoid being too touchy-feely with\n\n156\n00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.850\nthat account because you could\nget detected and then game over.\n\n157\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.990\n>> That's a good point.\n\n158\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.295\nThat user even though they are not an\nadmin, might have access to the database.\n\n159\n00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:33.035\nMaybe they're the database administrator\nor maybe they're just an elevated user and\n\n160\n00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:36.705\nthey got all the access you need to\nget into that database server or\n\n161\n00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:37.885\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n162\n00:09:37.885 --> 00:09:40.620\nSo you're not always looking for\nthat administrative account.\n\n163\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.140\nJust think how that has the privileges\nthat you need to carry off\n\n164\n00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.370\nyour penetration test or your attack.\n\n165\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:45.940\n>> Exactly.\n\n166\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.940\n>> Nice.\n\n167\n00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.520\nAll right, so let's say we've done it.\n\n168\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.430\nWe've got a password.\n\n169\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.060\nEither that user account had all\nthe privileges we needed to do our\n\n170\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.300\npenetration test.\n\n171\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.870\nOr we were able to escalate our\ncredentials using something like\n\n172\n00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.320\ndSniff to maybe do that\nhorizontal escalation.\n\n173\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.280\nOr were able to modify that user and\n\n174\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.090\ndoing a vertical where we've added\nprivileges to it, what comes next?\n\n175\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.300\nNow we can run what we want to run.\n\n176\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.410\n>> Yeah that's where you start making\nthe choice that yeah you're going to\n\n177\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.920\nstart running some things\nthat are of use to you.\n\n178\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.350\nAnd what could be of use to you?\n\n179\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.190\nWell you name it.\n\n180\n00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.380\nYou could have all sorts\nof things you could run,\n\n181\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.890\neither stuff that's\nalready on that system or\n\n182\n00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:34.240\nstuff that you have brought from someplace\nthat you are now going to execute there.\n\n183\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.850\nBecause you could have very easily\ncompromised an account and then brought in\n\n184\n00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.870\na program down to it, and now once you've\ngot it there now you got to execute it,\n\n185\n00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.700\ndo something else with\nthat user's context.\n\n186\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.670\nSo that will be your next step,\nlet's start executing applications and\n\n187\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.270\nthese application could be used to\nlater on leave a back door open.\n\n188\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.410\nSomething that we could use to come\nback in later on to maintain access, so\n\n189\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.640\nyou might be thinking long term.\n\n190\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.090\nYou're not just running a tool to\ndo one thing, you're leaving a tool\n\n191\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.110\nto allow you to open it up later on and\ngo in and do something else.\n\n192\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.679\nSo you keep coming back and dipping\nin just in case you missed something.\n\n193\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.970\nSo that's something you\ncan add to the mix.\n\n194\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.670\nYou don't need to run\nan application just as one thing.\n\n195\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.920\nYou can leave something there,\n\n196\n00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.890\nplant something there that lets you\nleave a back door for later use.\n\n197\n00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.570\nSo we fortunately have something that can\nhandle that for us, and it's a nice one.\n\n198\n00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.400\n>> What's that?\n\n199\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.390\nTell us about it.\n\n200\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.550\n>> It's Netcat.\n\n201\n00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.150\n>> Woohoo!\n\n202\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.090\n>> Netcat, it's old school.\n\n203\n00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.990\nIt's been around for,\nit's kind of amazing,\n\n204\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.650\nI think it's been around for\nalmost 20 years now.\n\n205\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.780\n>> Wow.\n>> I was just looking at the page for\n\n206\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.010\nthem like, wow,\nthat's been around that long?\n\n207\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:51.130\nSo it shows you just how well it works,\n\n208\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.940\nand then it's very useful if\nit's stuck around like that.\n\n209\n00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.620\nSo what we have here,\nthis is my meta exploitable machine.\n\n210\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.770\nWhat we're seeing here is we\nsee NC at the front of it,\n\n211\n00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.800\nthat is the shorthand for Netcat, so\nyou do not have to type out Netcat.\n\n212\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.320\nAnd what I have there is I have the -l so\nthe -l says to listen.\n\n213\n00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.110\nAnd that one, two, three, four,\nfive is telling it, listen on that port.\n\n214\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.800\nOkay, now the -e means execute.\n\n215\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.700\nAnd we have in quotes after it,\nhave tcpdump.\n\n216\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.466\nSo what's gonna happen\nis I hit Enter on that,\n\n217\n00:12:32.466 --> 00:12:36.512\nand it's running, it's listening.\n\n218\n00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:42.050\nNow since it's running and listening,\nit's waiting for a connection to be made.\n\n219\n00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.090\nSo where's that connection\ngoing to come from?\n\n220\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.810\nWell, if I go over to my Kali system,\nyou can see I have NC and\n\n221\n00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.040\nhave the IP address, and\nthen have one, two, three, four, five.\n\n222\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.840\nSo what's going to happen is that's\ngoing to go out to that IP address and\n\n223\n00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.929\nconnect to that port.\n\n224\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.240\nWe've gotten that far so\nwhat's the significance\n\n225\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.780\nof writing this command and\nattaching it to that other system?\n\n226\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.755\nWell, if we go back to the other\nsystem and take a second look, or\n\n227\n00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:20.115\ncloser look at this,\nyou can see that at the end, that -e,\n\n228\n00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:22.495\nand then it's got those things in quotes.\n\n229\n00:13:22.495 --> 00:13:25.265\nWhat that means is that when\na connections made to that port,\n\n230\n00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:30.285\nit's gonna run whatever's\nafter that e switch.\n\n231\n00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:34.525\nSo I just stuck tcpdump in there\nto have something in there.\n\n232\n00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:39.577\nLet's just say for\na moment that this was a Windows system.\n\n233\n00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.780\nIf this was a Windows system\nI could do something like\n\n234\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.220\nthis, cmd.exe.\n\n235\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.928\nWhat's gonna happen if I do this\nis when that connection comes in\n\n236\n00:13:56.928 --> 00:14:01.170\nFrom the other system,\nit's gonna come in and hit that port, and\n\n237\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.800\nwhen it hits that port,\nit's gonna fire up cmd.exe.\n\n238\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.060\n>> So it's waiting, so you're telling it,\nhey, listen on this port,\n\n239\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.750\nand as soon as somebody connects,\nexecute this.\n\n240\n00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.240\nAnd you should be able to get\nthat from that other machine.\n\n241\n00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.910\n>> Exactly.\n\n242\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.470\nThat's what that's gonna do.\n\n243\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.670\nAnd by the way, you can do it,\nyou can flip flop these a bit.\n\n244\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:25.920\nYou can have it so If you attach from\na client system to a server system,\n\n245\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.690\nit will actually push a shell and\nopen up a shell on your system.\n\n246\n00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:34.410\nSo you could, by doing some subtle\nmanipulation of these which\n\n247\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.360\nyou could figure out just by\nlooking at the commands for\n\n248\n00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.040\nNetCat you could tweak that to get\nall sorts of different results.\n\n249\n00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.130\nSo think about that.\n\n250\n00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.630\nYou could get this on someone's system,\nand then all you have to do once\n\n251\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:51.230\nyou get it on someone's system,\njust run simple command line like this or\n\n252\n00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.205\nhave it scripted so it starts up\nevery time they start their computer.\n\n253\n00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:57.500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then, once that's done, all you\n\n254\n00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.260\nhave to do is punch in the IP address and\nit will fire up that command shell and\n\n255\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.580\nthen you can start doing\nwhatever it is you need to do.\n\n256\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.780\n>> Right, so you can get that command\nprompt at that system level access at that\n\n257\n00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.260\npoint, you're good to go.\n\n258\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.790\n>> Yeah, exactly, and it works quite well.\n\n259\n00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.210\nThat's why it's been around for so long.\n\n260\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:19.039\nIt really does a good job at what it does.\n\n261\n00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:23.639\nSo that's NetCat,\nthat would be very effectively at running\n\n262\n00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:28.681\nthings remotely..You also have\nits companion called Crypt Cat,\n\n263\n00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:34.190\nthat means it's scrambling the stuff\nin transit which NetCat doesn't.\n\n264\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.670\nSomething I will warn\nyou about with NetCat,\n\n265\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.620\nif you're gonna play around with it or\nif that's your intention to,\n\n266\n00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.550\nbe aware of the fact that NetCat is\nvery frequently flagged as malware so\n\n267\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.415\nif you try to get it in your system\nit will get kicked right back off.\n\n268\n00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:50.427\n>> One of those things that's been around\nso long all the antivirus software have\n\n269\n00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:53.732\ndefinitions for it, and\nit's gonna be tagged really quickly.\n\n270\n00:15:53.732 --> 00:15:57.372\nSo yeah, just to play with it,\nuse your antivirus software.\n\n271\n00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:59.128\nDon't turn your antivirus software off.\n\n272\n00:15:59.128 --> 00:16:02.739\nBut make yourself a folder,\nput these kind of tools in there,\n\n273\n00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:05.270\nthen get them from a good, known source.\n\n274\n00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.660\nI have a folder on my machine that\nmy antivirus knows not to scan.\n\n275\n00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.910\nAnything I dump in there, it leaves alone.\n\n276\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.704\nOtherwise, as soon as you download it,\nit'll be gone.\n\n277\n00:16:14.704 --> 00:16:16.180\n[LAUGH] You're like, where'd it go?\n\n278\n00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.927\nAs I go download it again, and it's gone.\n\n279\n00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:18.610\n>> Yep.\n\n280\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.850\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That happened a few times.\n\n281\n00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:25.370\nLossCrack was another one that just gets\ntagged immediately and you just finished\n\n282\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.891\ndownloading it and Defender wants to take\nit away, so set yourself up a little test\n\n283\n00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:33.458\nmachine now that you know,\nyou're not worried about too much.\n\n284\n00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:37.106\nRunning a virus, I think running it's\nstill a good idea, but exclude one of\n\n285\n00:16:37.106 --> 00:16:40.481\nthose folders and that's where you\ncan keep all those special tools.\n\n286\n00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:45.780\n>> Yeah, that's the problem with this\nfield, getting all these little tools.\n\n287\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.480\nYeah, they're gonna get destroyed and\n\n288\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.000\nbeaten up by whatever antivirus you have\nin the system at that point in time.\n\n289\n00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.239\nIt's just the way it works.\n\n290\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.070\n>> All right, so we can run that cat and\nwe can do just about anything, Sean?\n\n291\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.660\nIs there any limitations really to\nwhat we're putting behind that E?\n\n292\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.450\nJust, whatever we want to connect to?\n\n293\n00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.248\n>> In theory, there are some limitations,\nbut they would be minor.\n\n294\n00:17:07.248 --> 00:17:10.000\n>> Obviously,\nit's gotta be installed on that system,\n\n295\n00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.750\nwhatever it is you're trying to run.\n\n296\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.930\n>> Yeah, I'd definitely keep that in mind,\nunless you're lucky enough to be\n\n297\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.915\nable to bundle up a bunch of stuff and\ndeploy it to a system.\n\n298\n00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:20.970\nThen try to keep it so\nit's nice and simple, and\n\n299\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.010\nit's restricted to stuff\nthat's already there.\n\n300\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.640\nIf this was a Windows box,\nI already know the cmd.exe is there, so\n\n301\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.800\nI don't have to bring anything.\n\n302\n00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.130\nI just gotta pass that command and\nmake sure Netcat's there, and\n\n303\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.560\nit's gonna happen.\n\n304\n00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.780\nSo, that's kind of what you gotta\nkeep in mind when you're doing this.\n\n305\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.530\nNetcat doesn't only do this sort of thing.\n\n306\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.610\nNetcat can also do banner grabs.\n\n307\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.010\nIt has the ability to do that,\nplus a whole host of other stuff, too,\n\n308\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.000\nif you really need to do that.\n\n309\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.840\nSo, you might wanna take a look\nat Netcat at some point,\n\n310\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.780\nor Cryptcat, and see if there's any\nother things you wanna know about it.\n\n311\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.040\nEven if you're not gonna use it on your\nnetwork, I'd say take a look at it,\n\n312\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.210\nbecause it is still used, and\n\n313\n00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.310\nit could be something that you're\ngonna defend against later on.\n\n314\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.340\n>> And at this point, Sean, we might\nactually cycle back through our phases.\n\n315\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.290\nI mean I'm picturing myself doing\na pen test, and I'm on the outside and\n\n316\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.690\nI've done my footprinting, as we'll\ncall it, or information gathering,\n\n317\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.310\nand my scanning and my numeration.\n\n318\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.160\nAnd then I've done my exploitation,\nI've gained access.\n\n319\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.880\nNow I'm inside the system.\n\n320\n00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.530\nMight I just turn around and start over in\nusing those same tools from the inside,\n\n321\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.790\nstart doing some more information\ngathering because it might\n\n322\n00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.460\nbe different from what I was able to\nget from the outside, and scanning and\n\n323\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.720\nthings like that?\n\n324\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.600\n>> You might.\n\n325\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.216\nI would seriously to consider it,\nyou might be able to get a little more\n\n326\n00:18:39.216 --> 00:18:43.555\naccess once you're on the inside and\nknow what the lay of the land looks like.\n\n327\n00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:47.435\nYou can start saying, okay, well,\nhere I found some other applications and\n\n328\n00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:52.515\nother things in this environment that\nI can use to start kicking things up.\n\n329\n00:18:52.515 --> 00:18:56.065\nOne of the things we didn't even get\ninto too much here, it was mentioned,\n\n330\n00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:59.510\nwas once you get on the system,\nyou might be able to start going out and\n\n331\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.150\ntargeting your Cisco boxes and\nstuff like that,\n\n332\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.040\nstuff that you couldn't necessarily\nsee all of them from the outside.\n\n333\n00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.140\nSo now you're on the inside,\nyou can start targeting those, and\n\n334\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.590\nsee if you can get any information\nout of those that might help you.\n\n335\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.350\nSee if you can escalate\nprivileges on those.\n\n336\n00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.920\nThere's ways to do that.\n\n337\n00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.490\nSo you've got more possibilities, yeah.\n\n338\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.870\nSo you might be circling around\nto see if there's another\n\n339\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.930\nround of things you can do that\nwill get you even more stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.471\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n341\n00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:30.340\nAll right, so last thing I think we wanna\ntalk about is that maintaining access.\n\n342\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.120\nI wanna make sure that once I've gone\nthrough all this trouble to get into this\n\n343\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.260\nsystem, I wanna be able to\nget back in at any time.\n\n344\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.590\nSo maybe I am coming back and\ndoing some more scanning.\n\n345\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.800\nAnd I wanna wait till after hours,\n\n346\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.822\nwhere nobody is using their machine or\nsomething.\n\n347\n00:19:44.822 --> 00:19:48.590\nOr I just think it's a little bit safer or\nwhat have you or whatever.\n\n348\n00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.080\nSo what do we use to maintain that access,\n\n349\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.172\nany specific programs or\ntechniques we use?\n\n350\n00:19:56.172 --> 00:20:01.800\n>> You know, personally, I would think if\nyou can even get this Netcat running with\n\n351\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.560\nthe dash L, tell it to list on a certain\nport and run executable, that might be\n\n352\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.610\nenough to leave a significant back door\nopen for you to attach whenever you want.\n\n353\n00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.610\nNow you've just gotta make\nsure that you're in a position\n\n354\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.790\nwhere that port is gonna be available.\n\n355\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.450\nIt's not screened or anything like that,\nthen you can go ahead and\n\n356\n00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.110\nattach to it whenever you want.\n\n357\n00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.290\nBut there are other ways\nto maintain access.\n\n358\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.220\nYou get a password.\n\n359\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.130\nYou change it to something that you want.\n\n360\n00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.890\nAnd you take over an account, or\nyou create yourself an account.\n\n361\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.340\nThat could be a way of maintaining access.\n\n362\n00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:39.470\nSo you do have a lot of\ncards that you could\n\n363\n00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:44.760\npossibly play to keep regular\naccess to that system.\n\n364\n00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.910\n>> So if I can get Netcat\nto launch automatically,\n\n365\n00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.950\nsomehow add it to their start up, or\na little script in their start up or\n\n366\n00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.190\nsomething like that,\nthat's my back door then.\n\n367\n00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.120\nAnytime I want to connect to that port\nnumber, I know it's their listing.\n\n368\n00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.850\n>> Exactly.\n\n369\n00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.975\n>> Fantastic, I like it.\n\n370\n00:20:57.975 --> 00:20:59.870\nAll right, well shoot, Sean,\n\n371\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.745\nwe've gone through the whole list\nof our exploitation process.\n\n372\n00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:06.940\nWe started by gaining access to\nthat system we talked about,\n\n373\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.660\nwhat we're talking about,\nwhat we meant by gaining access.\n\n374\n00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:16.020\nWe talked about cracking passwords in\nboth the offline and the online format,\n\n375\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.440\nwe talked about escalating our privileges,\nmight have to, might not, really depends\n\n376\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.530\non what account we got in the first place\nwhen we were doing our gaining access.\n\n377\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.400\nAnd then we talked about executing\nprograms remotely, netcapping,\n\n378\n00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.570\nan extremely popular one because it\ndoes so much, it's so powerful, it's so\n\n379\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.615\nlightweight too.\n\n380\n00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:37.570\nSean, I can't remember how big it is,\nit's like kilobytes or something.\n\n381\n00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:41.480\nIt's pretty darn small if\nI remember right, Netcat.\n\n382\n00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.180\nSo it's a very tiny little payload.\n\n383\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.660\nIt might be a few megs but it's-\n>> Yeah, it's insubstantial.\n\n384\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.751\n>> Yeah.\n\n385\n00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:52.255\n>> The download I got is a 105 kilobytes.\n\n386\n00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:53.022\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n387\n00:21:53.022 --> 00:21:55.620\n>> So it's-\n>> Teeny tiny, not gonna take up a lot of\n\n388\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.180\nspace, not gonna take a lot of\nbandwidth sending it over there.\n\n389\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.910\nIt's just a little blip on the radar,\nreally like that.\n\n390\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.230\nAnd then that can become our back door,\nour way of maintaining access.\n\n391\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.600\nBecause once I get it up and running, it's\njust sitting there listening on that port.\n\n392\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.670\nI told it what port number to listen on so\nI can connect to it anytime.\n\n393\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.990\nI do wanna try to make sure that\nit's running automatically.\n\n394\n00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.190\nIf they reboot their machine, they got\nWindows Update's to do, or what have you,\n\n395\n00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.530\nI'd like a way to make sure\nthat that runs automatically.\n\n396\n00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:26.310\nOtherwise I've gotta somehow\ngain access to the system again.\n\n397\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.760\nHopefully that person hasn't changed their\npassword and launch it all over again.\n\n398\n00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.190\nAnd then there's other tools where you,\nlike you said,\n\n399\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.680\nmight be able to make an account\nthat nobody knows about or\n\n400\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.240\nreset a password or enable account\nthat they thought was disabled.\n\n401\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.500\nSo, many different ways we can maintain\nthat access or set up that back door.\n\n402\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.700\nRemember, back door just means I wanna\nbypass their normal authentication\n\n403\n00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.960\nmethod if I can, so\nlots of good stuff there.\n\n404\n00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.870\nAll right, well, Sean, anything else we\nwanna throw in on exploitation before we\n\n405\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.790\ncall this one a wrap?\n\n406\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:03.500\n>> No, I mean, that was a pretty good\nlook at the overall process so you\n\n407\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.480\ngot exposure to the different tools and\ndifferent steps that are involved in that.\n\n408\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.170\nAnd now it's just a case\nof taking it further\n\n409\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.930\nto see maybe what other tools we can use.\n\n410\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.130\nCuz that's really what we're gonna talk\nabout after this is specific tool types\n\n411\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:24.460\nthat would come in handy when you are\ndoing your penetration testing processing,\n\n412\n00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.740\nthings that you can use,\na lot of them in that last phase.\n\n413\n00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.372\n>> Looking forward to that,\nhope you guys are too.\n\n414\n00:23:31.372 --> 00:23:35.100\nAll right, well then Sean, in that case,\nwe'll call it a wrap on this one.\n\n415\n00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.340\nWe hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching this episode.\n\n416\n00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.240\nI know we had a great time filming it.\n\n417\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.070\nFor now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n418\n00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.070\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n419\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.485\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n420\n00:23:44.485 --> 00:23:45.130\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:18.658\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:19.900\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.880\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.650\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.040\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.110\nWe are continuing on our\nKali Linux series, and\n\n9\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.440\nin this particular episode we are gonna\nbe talking about about sniffing.\n\n10\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.390\nAnd it's one of those things that\nwe've covered in other shows.\n\n11\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.250\nIt's probably something, hopefully,\nthat you've done before, but\n\n12\n00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.810\nit plays a big part in\npenetration testing.\n\n13\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.720\nWe can get a lot of information\nby sniffing the traffic.\n\n14\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.530\nAnd of course Sean,\n\n15\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.090\nI don't mean going up to the ethernet\ncable and smelling it, right?\n\n16\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.395\nI know you guys know what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n17\n00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:54.270\nBut, yeah, they can stink.\n\n18\n00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.500\nThat PVC coating, whew, nasty stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.860\nBut in all seriousness,\nwe're capturing traffic that's\n\n20\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.720\ntraveling across the network, is what\nwe mean by sniffers, and Word cache.\n\n21\n00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.680\nThere's so many choices.\n\n22\n00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070\nWhere do we even start with sniffers?\n\n23\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.520\n>> Well, sniffers,\nobviously it's a big topic.\n\n24\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640\nThe one that everyone seems\nto know about is Wire Shark.\n\n25\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.320\nSo it's not necessarily that sniffing is\na foreign concept to anybody that's in IT.\n\n26\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.038\nIt seems like everyone's used\nWire Shark and knows what the deal is.\n\n27\n00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.640\nBut it's worthwhile to\njust do a quick review.\n\n28\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.200\nAnd none of this is going to be targeted\nspecifically towards Wire Shark.\n\n29\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.430\nYes, we do know about it.\n\n30\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.030\nIt is in Kali to use if you decide\nthat that's the way you want to go.\n\n31\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.840\nBut the purpose of this is to not just\ngive you the option of using Wire Shark,\n\n32\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.320\nbut also tell you there\nare other things there\n\n33\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.440\nthat you can use to accomplish either\nthe same thing Wire Shark's doing,\n\n34\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.540\nor modified Versions of\nwhat Wire Shark's doing.\n\n35\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.280\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n36\n00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.100\nTo start off with things,\nlet's talk about what a sniffer is.\n\n37\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.790\nAnd you described it pretty well, Mike.\n\n38\n00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.750\nIt's something that we use to\ncapture traffic as it flows back and\n\n39\n00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.120\nforth over a network, and\nthat can be wired or wireless.\n\n40\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120\nSo we're capturing traffic as it\ngoes back and forth, back and forth.\n\n41\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.027\nIt's really, really low down in the OSI\nmodel where it's catching that.\n\n42\n00:02:25.027 --> 00:02:29.550\nSo, we'll just see that traffic, whether\nor not it's encrypted, or whatever.\n\n43\n00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.400\nYou just won't be able to\nread it if it's encrypted.\n\n44\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.502\nBut if it's formatted by a certain\napplication, you'll see it.\n\n45\n00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:36.622\nYou may not be able to\nunderstand the underlying data,\n\n46\n00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:40.270\ncuz an application formatted it, but\nyou'll be able to see it with the sniffer.\n\n47\n00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.500\nSo, there's that aspect of it.\n\n48\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.270\nNow, what we can use a sniffer for is,\n\n49\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.830\nwe can use it to intercept things like\ncredentials and confidential data.\n\n50\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.850\nStuff like that is very important to us.\n\n51\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.530\nBut how do they work?\n\n52\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.590\nWell, a sniffer works by turning your\nwired network card Into promiscuous mode.\n\n53\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.960\nAnd promiscuous mode means that that\ncard goes from being able to see\n\n54\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.250\njust the traffic either leaving that\nsystem or going to that system.\n\n55\n00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.550\nIt switches it to being able to\nsee anything that's floating by,\n\n56\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.190\nwhether it's addressed to or\nfrom that card, or to anybody else.\n\n57\n00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.020\nSo, once you're switched in that mode,\nyou will see everything that happens to be\n\n58\n00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.160\nswimming by on the cable no\nmatter who it's addressed to.\n\n59\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.910\nAnd therefore, once you have that\nhappening, you can start putting\n\n60\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.050\nfilters and stuff you've got in place just\nto see the information that you wanna see.\n\n61\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.660\nOr you just choose to capture it all,\nwrite it out to a file, and\n\n62\n00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.150\nthen kind of dissect the file,\nand do what you want offline.\n\n63\n00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.970\nThat's a possibility as well.\n\n64\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.390\nSo, you've got some really neat\nstuff here you can do with sniffers.\n\n65\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.007\nAnd basically, all of them work in\na mode very similar to what I just\n\n66\n00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:54.486\ndescribed with little variation.\n\n67\n00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:58.737\nWhere they start varying from one another\nis the features, their efficiency,\n\n68\n00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:02.890\nspeed, stuff like that are gonna\nmake one different from another.\n\n69\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.350\n>> Yeah, just so really,\nwhen we're talking about sniffing,\n\n70\n00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.220\nthat's a good concept to understand,\nthat promiscuous mode.\n\n71\n00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.650\nNormally, that network adapter\nignores anything that's not\n\n72\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.910\ndestined for him, right?\n\n73\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.280\nIf it's not him on the destination\naddress, he drops the packet.\n\n74\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.030\nHe's not supposed to receive it.\n\n75\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.500\nSwitch it over to promiscuous mode, and\n\n76\n00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.490\nall of the sudden,\nhe'll take in all that traffic.\n\n77\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.080\nAnd that gives us the ability\nto capture that information.\n\n78\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.600\nAnd most of our network\nadapters nowadays support that.\n\n79\n00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.660\nMost of our operating systems give\nus the ability to switch into that\n\n80\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.270\npromiscuous mode?\n\n81\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.500\n>> Yes, it's a very common thing.\n\n82\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.760\nYou can expect to see just about any\ncard you run into to support that.\n\n83\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.600\nWhy there are still some cases\nwhere they don't support that,\n\n84\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.420\nthose are the exception not the rule.\n\n85\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.390\nSo, don't expect to see a card\nthat won't switch into that.\n\n86\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.140\nIt's been many years\nsince we've had a card,\n\n87\n00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.640\nsince we really had to deal with cards,\n\n88\n00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.900\nthat were not gonna run a promiscuous\nmode versus the ones that we have now.\n\n89\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.450\nSo, now it's just a question of,\ndo you have something that can switch it\n\n90\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.210\nover from promiscuous mode, and\ndo you need to have it a promiscuous mode?\n\n91\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440\nEven though a card goes for promiscuous\nmode, there is very few cases in\n\n92\n00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.450\nnormal practice that you need to\nhave it actually go into that mode.\n\n93\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.270\nSniffing is one of them that you would\nneed a card to have promiscuous mode to\n\n94\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.670\ndo it the right way.\n\n95\n00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.470\nAnother reason that you could have\na card switched into promiscuous mode is\n\n96\n00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.915\nif you have Add an IDS or IPS, something\nthat's designed to analyze traffic.\n\n97\n00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:32.385\nThat has to see everything\nthat's moving by, and\n\n98\n00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:35.725\nthen it applies rules to it to\nsee the stuff that's flowing by.\n\n99\n00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:38.045\nDoes it match stuff that\nI know is malicious?\n\n100\n00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:41.905\nAnd if so,\nwhat is gonna be my reaction to that?\n\n101\n00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:48.100\nBut those are two of the few cases where\nyou ever need to be In promiscuous mode.\n\n102\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.620\nOutside of that, if you see something in\npromiscuous mode, it's now a question of,\n\n103\n00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.010\nwhy is it that way, and let's go find out,\nand probably shut it down.\n\n104\n00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.090\n>> Right, it's probably not doing anything\nyou want it to do, in other words.\n\n105\n00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.353\n>> Yeah,\nit really should probably not be that way.\n\n106\n00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:07.497\nAnd then they actually do\ncatch people that way.\n\n107\n00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:12.352\nThey will have systems on networks,\nand they will have people that monitor\n\n108\n00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:17.070\nsort of thing, where they're watching\nthe traffic go back and forth.\n\n109\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.200\nAnd they start seeing other traffic\nthat's indicative of a card someplace\n\n110\n00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.840\nbeing in promiscuous mode, because they'll\nlook at the responses and beacons, or\n\n111\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.282\nwhatever you want to call it,\nthat come out.\n\n112\n00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:31.583\nAnd they'll say, yeah,\nthat's a card in promiscuous mode.\n\n113\n00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:36.073\nAnd there's only certain systems we know\nthat are documented that are supposed to\n\n114\n00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:38.360\nbe that way, and that's not one of them.\n\n115\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.980\nSo, we need to go track that down and\nfigure out why it's that way.\n\n116\n00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.670\n>> All right, so,\nto run these sniffers and\n\n117\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.930\nto be able to capture useful information,\ntypically, cuz usually,\n\n118\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.480\nthe information is not coming to my system\nthat I'm using to do this pen test,\n\n119\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.850\nwe gotta be able to switch\nover to promiscuous mode.\n\n120\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.440\nAnd then, when it comes to sniffers, we've\ngot a whole choice of different tools.\n\n121\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.655\nSome of them, Sean,\ncapture just everything, and\n\n122\n00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:05.520\nthen it's up to us to\nkind of filter it down.\n\n123\n00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.881\nAnd then there's certain types of\nsniffers that can really focus, right,\n\n124\n00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:11.000\non a particular type of traffic?\n\n125\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.480\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n126\n00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.650\nSniffers don't necessarily\nneed to pick up everything.\n\n127\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.220\nAnd I guess it's probably fair to say that\n\n128\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.000\nthese sniffers are actually\nseeing all the traffic.\n\n129\n00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.770\nIt's just what you're actually gonna see.\n\n130\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.060\nSo, when they switch to promiscuous mode,\nwhich all these sniffers are gonna do,\n\n131\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.910\nthey switch that card to promiscuous mode,\nit's gonna see everything.\n\n132\n00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.020\nNow what's happening is that if you only\nsee certain things pop up on your display,\n\n133\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.325\nit's because it's seeing all that traffic.\n\n134\n00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:43.965\nAnd it has filters set up saying,\nif it doesn't match those filters,\n\n135\n00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:45.395\ndon't display it over here.\n\n136\n00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:49.025\nStill sees everything back here, but\nit won't display it over here to you.\n\n137\n00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:53.763\nSo, they're all, again,\nstill that same process.\n\n138\n00:07:53.763 --> 00:07:57.516\nOf dealing with information.\n\n139\n00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:00.778\n>> So I might be able to take one of those\ngeneric general purpose sniffers and\n\n140\n00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:04.092\nconfigure my own filters to just catch\nreserved stuff, or I can just use one\n\n141\n00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:07.110\nof those ones that's just basically\nset up to just do that already.\n\n142\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.790\nI don't have to build the filters and\nI can just use it and\n\n143\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.260\nthat's all it captures.\n\n144\n00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.060\nOr so I might keep both around, right?\n\n145\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.600\nI might have one that captures\neverything when I need it.\n\n146\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.570\nI've got others that are focused\non a particular thing.\n\n147\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:25.200\nI remember one that we, way back when in\nthe CEH class, that just captured images.\n\n148\n00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.410\nNot the most useful thing, but\n\n149\n00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.280\nit was kind of fun to see what pictures\npeople were opening up and looking at.\n\n150\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.160\nIt could also be scary\ndepending on what you're on.\n\n151\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.620\nBut it was cool that that sniffer\nwas designed to just capture Images.\n\n152\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.540\nIt didn't capture anything else.\n\n153\n00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.080\nAs you said, it still sees everything.\n\n154\n00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.178\nIt has to to determine if\nit's a picture or not.\n\n155\n00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:46.380\nBut when it, it all filtered it,\n\n156\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.770\nso in my results window,\nall I saw were those images.\n\n157\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.030\nBut we can get ones that\nare specific to passwords, or\n\n158\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.500\na particular type of traffic, or\nyou were saying, particular applications.\n\n159\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.610\nThey can get very specific.\n\n160\n00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.140\n>> Yeah, they definitely can.\n\n161\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.170\nIt's just a question of\nwhat are you looking for.\n\n162\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:11.840\nYou can take something like Wire Shark and\ntweak it to look at specifically what you\n\n163\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.300\nwant it to, but if it's important enough,\nsomeone's probably already done it.\n\n164\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.440\nAnd you don't have to\nactually build those filters.\n\n165\n00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.260\nSo that's something definitely\nto think about when you're\n\n166\n00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.250\ngoing into something like WireShark.\n\n167\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.210\nWireshark also has some\nlimitations that other\n\n168\n00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.350\nsniffers will actually pick up and\nrun with.\n\n169\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.760\nSo that's another thing to remember.\n\n170\n00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.110\nIt's like anything with software or\nanything in life,\n\n171\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.980\nthere's nothing that does\neverything equally well.\n\n172\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.670\nIt's a case of which things can it do\nwell and which things does it not do so\n\n173\n00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.570\nwell and what you are willing\nto put up with on either side.\n\n174\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.120\nSo with that in mind yea, we have all\nthese sniffers that can do different\n\n175\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.870\nthings and some are very specialized and\nthey're the only ones that can do it and\n\n176\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:06.490\nother ones they have functionality that\ncan be replicated with more work and\n\n177\n00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.570\nmore general purpose sniffer.\n\n178\n00:10:09.772 --> 00:10:14.300\n>> All right, I'll tell you what Sean\nlet's talk about some of these sniffers\n\n179\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.070\nand start getting into them and\nmaybe take a look at a few of them?\n\n180\n00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.300\n>> Yea, we can take a look at them.\n\n181\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.650\nWe probably should take a look at or\n\n182\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.950\ntalk about one of the first\nthings that's important is\n\n183\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.993\nthe stuff we're looking at from the get-go\nhere is gonna be stuff that is on\n\n184\n00:10:36.993 --> 00:10:42.960\na non-switched network or using a hub.\n\n185\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.440\nSo we're not talking about\nthose switched networks yet.\n\n186\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.940\nSo we will get to those because\nthose are a special case.\n\n187\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.163\nSo we're not taking into account that\nwe have all the extra hard route that's\n\n188\n00:10:55.163 --> 00:10:58.340\nsegmenting the network out,\nlay in the router switches and all that.\n\n189\n00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.990\nWe're just going to say everything is\nopen and now we can start just sniffing.\n\n190\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.560\nSo, what could we use to do that?\n\n191\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.190\nWell really,\nany sniffer is gonna be able to do that.\n\n192\n00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.920\nAny sniffer is gonna be able to sniff\non a network that's got a hub in play.\n\n193\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.950\nAnd this is also one of the reasons why,\n\n194\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.758\nby the way,\nhubs are not as popular as they once were.\n\n195\n00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:22.629\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because something goes in on one port\n\n196\n00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:24.730\ncomes out all the other ones.\n\n197\n00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.490\nAnd so since they work that way,\nyou could be anywhere\n\n198\n00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.050\non that network where that hub is\nplugged in and pick up traffic.\n\n199\n00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.350\nAnd so it's a big security problem so\n\n200\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.440\nthey've kind of just starting\nputting those out to pasture.\n\n201\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.860\nDoesn't mean they don't exist but\n\n202\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.310\njust means that there's a problem\nthat's kind of limited.\n\n203\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.860\nOr, where, they're deployed now, and\n\n204\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.740\nthey've replaced some of the,\nin a lot of cases where hubs were used,\n\n205\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.760\nthey put switches in place now to,\nto make things safer and more secure.\n\n206\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.680\nSo, but, anyway,\nthis is just a passive type of sniffing.\n\n207\n00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.440\nThis is, the stuff we're talking about,\nis doing it passively,\n\n208\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.440\nusing all our just off\nthe shelf sniffers to do so.\n\n209\n00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.610\nOkay let's start talking about sniffers by\ntaking a look at them and how they work.\n\n210\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.510\nWell like you said we got a lot\nof sniffing tools available\n\n211\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:24.270\ninside of Kali Linux menu.\n\n212\n00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.340\nWe can see under our sniffing\nmenu not only do we have some,\n\n213\n00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.990\nwell, there you go,\na bunch of network sniffers,\n\n214\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:37.640\nwe've also got some other tools and\ngoodies in there that could help us out.\n\n215\n00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.750\nWe've got our network sniffers,\n\n216\n00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.120\nwe've got stuff for voice,\nthey say voice and surveillance.\n\n217\n00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.140\nVoiceover IP,\njust in case you want to do that.\n\n218\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.831\nLook how ready they are.\n\n219\n00:12:49.831 --> 00:12:53.478\nThey got plenty of tools\njust to mess with that.\n\n220\n00:12:53.478 --> 00:12:56.030\nAnd then you got stuff for the web.\n\n221\n00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.550\nThe stuff over here on the web,\nthat's really for web applications.\n\n222\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.850\nSo it's not working down\nat the network level,\n\n223\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.070\nit's working up at the application level.\n\n224\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.170\nSo that's kind of a different beast, and\n\n225\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.120\nwe're not gonna worry about\nthose too much right here.\n\n226\n00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.140\nWe're gonna worry about\nthe network level stuff.\n\n227\n00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:16.420\nSo, with that being said, what we have is,\nwe'll take a look at the network sniffers.\n\n228\n00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.540\nAnd the one that everyone knows about,\nwe've got Wireshark.\n\n229\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.340\nNow you'll notice when Wireshark comes up\nit throws a bunch of warnings at us and\n\n230\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.990\nall that.\n\n231\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:36.570\nThe thing about it is, is that what we\nget here that we don't get in Windows,\n\n232\n00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.320\nis if you're familiar with it over there,\n\n233\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.240\nyou'll get warnings saying hey by the way\nit's going to disable some stuff and\n\n234\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.680\ndo some things because hey you're\nnot running in administrative mode.\n\n235\n00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.190\nIf you want to run in administrator mode,\nyou could do the S-U-D-O, the SUDO, and\n\n236\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.570\nthen do WireShark and\nenter your password when prompted, and\n\n237\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.750\nthen it will remove some\nof those restrictions.\n\n238\n00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.290\nBut then again,\nyou're also weakening the system for\n\n239\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.820\na certain point in time by doing that.\n\n240\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.740\nI didn't bother doing that, so\nI saw the warning saying oh,\n\n241\n00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.160\nby the way some features are disabled.\n\n242\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.380\nFor what we're talking about and showing\nit's probably not even gonna matter.\n\n243\n00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:19.360\nSo all I have to do now is I told\nit to listen on eth0, I do a start,\n\n244\n00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.340\nand I can do something simple like\nopening up a browser window and\n\n245\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.700\njust typing something in.\n\n246\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.540\nI'll do ITProTV site.\n\n247\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.980\nAnd when I go over to here,\n\n248\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.480\nI slide this down,\nyou can see what we're familiar with.\n\n249\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:45.630\nWe've seen this a bunch of\ntimes before in our CEH class.\n\n250\n00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.000\nThat's just standard network traffic,\nnothing really special.\n\n251\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.320\nAnd we can do odd little things like\nset up filters and all that good stuff,\n\n252\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.790\nso really no problem there.\n\n253\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.210\nWe're seeing what we would expect,\nso that's one sniffer.\n\n254\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.720\nJust wanted to show you that one.\n\n255\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.690\nThere already is a course on Wire Shark.\n\n256\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:11.260\nWire Shark was covered again in the CEH,\nwe covered it in the DFI course too.\n\n257\n00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.590\nSo it's had some coverage already.\n\n258\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.390\nRight now we're kinda not worried\nabout it since it's had that.\n\n259\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.168\nBut just to let you know it is there,\nand there are some things it does kind\n\n260\n00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:26.650\nof chatter away about, but\nit does run, and it does do its job.\n\n261\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.050\nSo, let me go ahead and\nI'll just close that one.\n\n262\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.890\nI am not going to save any of that.\n\n263\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.785\nJust close right out.\n\n264\n00:15:34.915 --> 00:15:37.470\nAnd there we go.\n\n265\n00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.440\nSo I've got that as a sniffer.\n\n266\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.280\nNow there are other ways of\ncapturing traffic of course.\n\n267\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.368\nOne that I like to point out,\n\n268\n00:15:47.368 --> 00:15:52.676\nit's another one that you have available\nto you is one called Ether Ape.\n\n269\n00:15:52.676 --> 00:15:57.674\nEther Ape, let's see if we will\nhave to restart that a bit.\n\n270\n00:15:57.674 --> 00:15:59.427\nBut what EtherApe does,\n\n271\n00:15:59.427 --> 00:16:04.790\nI had this running while I was playing\naround with stuff, so I broke it.\n\n272\n00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.740\nMy fault.\n\n273\n00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.530\nSo what I'm going to do is, let me see\nif I can start up EtherApe again here.\n\n274\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.850\nSo what EtherApe does is, there you go.\n\n275\n00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:19.980\nIt doesn't look like much is happening but\nif I were to open up my\n\n276\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.360\nbrowser again here, I'm trying to\ninduce traffic that it can monitor.\n\n277\n00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.170\nSo I will just do that again, and click.\n\n278\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:34.330\nIf I go over to EtherApe, what's happening\nthere, it's not showing you the traffic,\n\n279\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.320\nbut it is showing you what this\nsystem is actually attaching to.\n\n280\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.260\nSo if you look at it,\n\n281\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:44.390\nyou can actually see those things are\npulsating a bit and doing a little magic.\n\n282\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.980\nWhat's happening there is those\nare active connections going out to\n\n283\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.960\nall those systems.\n\n284\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.750\nAnd it's telling me that, hey,\nwhen you attach to the ITProTV site,\n\n285\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.000\nit's dialing up connections\nto these other guys.\n\n286\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.080\nSo I could look up those\nIP addresses on there or\n\n287\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.820\nDNS names on there and see who that is.\n\n288\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.190\nThose could be things like advertising\nnetworks or what have you.\n\n289\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:13.360\nThe different colors do\ntell you different things.\n\n290\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.930\nIf you look down the left-hand side,\nyou probably can't read it\n\n291\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.420\ntoo well on the screen here, but\nif you look down the left-hand side,\n\n292\n00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:24.040\nyou can see it's got\ndifferent colors over there.\n\n293\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.700\nIt's telling you,\n\n294\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.670\nwell, those different colors\ncorrespond to a specific protocol type.\n\n295\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.160\nIt's kind of a neat thing.\n\n296\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.885\nIt's not giving you specific\ntraffic at that level, but\n\n297\n00:17:36.885 --> 00:17:41.819\nit is telling you,\ngiving you kind of a way to visualize it.\n\n298\n00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:46.161\nAnd I kind of like this tool because\nwhen you look at it, it very quickly and\n\n299\n00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:51.390\neasily shows you how things are flowing\nback and forth from the various systems.\n\n300\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:54.610\nAnd so you can get an idea of well,\nmy system's attaching to this one,\n\n301\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.320\nthis one, and this one.\n\n302\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.430\nAnd then sometimes you'll see\nthe individual systems pass traffic\n\n303\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.790\namongst themselves.\n\n304\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.180\nIt's really a fascinating\nlook to see how things work.\n\n305\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.342\nIt also shows you,\nI'm not touching anything right now.\n\n306\n00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:10.436\nAll I have right there is, there's,\n\n307\n00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:14.104\nobviously there's some traffic\ngoing in and out of this machine,\n\n308\n00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:18.062\ncuz I'm cast down, broadcasting out\nsome video so you guys can see it.\n\n309\n00:18:18.062 --> 00:18:22.850\nSeeing that, and there's some\nstuff going on my host machine.\n\n310\n00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.300\nBut I'm just sitting here and\nI'm not doing much.\n\n311\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.750\nAnd you can see, I've got my hands off.\n\n312\n00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.178\nAnd it's doing things.\n\n313\n00:18:30.178 --> 00:18:34.570\nSo that's a chatty system.\n\n314\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.462\n>> Look, ma, no hands.\n[LAUGH]\n\n315\n00:18:35.462 --> 00:18:37.041\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n316\n00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:38.850\n>> Yeah, it really is.\n\n317\n00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:39.637\nIt's capturing the traffic.\n\n318\n00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:44.480\nYou're not seeing the raw package, though,\nit's more of like a protocol analyzer.\n\n319\n00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.940\nGives me the ability to see what\nconnections are being made,\n\n320\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.160\ndiscover IP addresses that I didn't know\nabout, systems that I didn't know about,\n\n321\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.560\nseeing what protocols\nare being used on a network.\n\n322\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.100\nCuz maybe I've got some tools that I\ncan then capture that specific type\n\n323\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.670\nof traffic.\n\n324\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.100\nOr maybe I wanna go back to my Wireshark\npacket dump, and now filtered.\n\n325\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.820\nI saw a whole lot of certain type of\ntraffic going on using EtherApe or\n\n326\n00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.990\nEtherApe, and\nnow I go back to Wireshark and\n\n327\n00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.600\nI filter it and\nfind those actual packets and look for it.\n\n328\n00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.060\nSo just another great tool to\nhave in the toolbag there.\n\n329\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.990\n>> Yeah, it's just helping you visualize\nthat information in a different way.\n\n330\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:26.990\nBecause realistically, just looking\nat stuff as it flows by on Wireshark,\n\n331\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.850\nwe can look at that and analyze it.\n\n332\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:32.840\nHeck, I know people that can\ngo all matrix on that stuff,\n\n333\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.900\nand do that to a certain degree.\n\n334\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.780\nBut they're still, because of how\nrapid that traffic passes, and\n\n335\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.258\nhow quickly it accumulates, it still\nposes a big challenge to sort through.\n\n336\n00:19:44.258 --> 00:19:48.970\nThis tool just happens to be one with\nEtherApe happens to be one that helps\n\n337\n00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.294\nease that process.\n\n338\n00:19:50.294 --> 00:19:55.807\nSo it's not a bad thing to have\nsomething like that in your arsenal.\n\n339\n00:19:55.807 --> 00:20:00.622\nSo, that's just one that you\ncould run on your system,\n\n340\n00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:05.120\nbut again, there are other ones out there.\n\n341\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.390\nSo we'll take a look at Driftnet and\nwhat it does.\n\n342\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.200\nSo what I've done to set this up,\n\n343\n00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.510\nas you can see I've got\nDriftnet running back here.\n\n344\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.596\nWhat I did is did driftnet -i eth0.\n\n345\n00:20:19.596 --> 00:20:25.768\nAnd you should recognize that now as\nsaying, well, run the driftnet command and\n\n346\n00:20:25.768 --> 00:20:30.150\nhave it observe what's going\non on the eth0 interface.\n\n347\n00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.670\nYou could change it to whatever you want.\n\n348\n00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.530\nIf you have multiple network interfaces,\nyou can definitely do that.\n\n349\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.570\nSo, I only have the one, so\nI'm gonna leave it just with eth0.\n\n350\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.610\nBut you can see it's not doing\nanything just sitting there.\n\n351\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.720\nWhat it did, is it actually opened\nup that box, nothing in the box.\n\n352\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.610\nSo what I'll do is, I will go over and\n\n353\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.170\nI will just find a website,\nsomething that's got graphics or\n\n354\n00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.650\nsomething I know is going to be in,\ngonna pop up here.\n\n355\n00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:05.270\nSo I could do something like I\ntyped in a video gaming site,\n\n356\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:10.670\nand something that I know is\ngonna have some images on it.\n\n357\n00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.220\nAnd you can see what's happening\nthere as it goes through,\n\n358\n00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.550\nyou can see the images actually pop up.\n\n359\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:21.110\nAll the sniffer's doing is it's\nharvesting those images as they go by.\n\n360\n00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.680\nIt looks at the traffic and says,\nokay, this data and these payloads,\n\n361\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.780\nthat's all the same image.\n\n362\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.620\nIt assembles them and displays them there.\n\n363\n00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.903\n>> So [CROSSTALK] I was talking about\n\n364\n00:21:29.903 --> 00:21:31.952\nearlier that just focuses on the pictures,\nthen.\n\n365\n00:21:31.952 --> 00:21:32.465\n>> Yeah.\n\n366\n00:21:32.465 --> 00:21:34.145\nThat's exactly what that one is.\n\n367\n00:21:35.195 --> 00:21:38.605\nAnd you can see as you\ngo to different sites.\n\n368\n00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:42.640\nIf I type in,\nthis is kinda like a funny news site.\n\n369\n00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.318\nYou can see as it goes through that,\nit will start doing the same thing.\n\n370\n00:21:46.318 --> 00:21:52.513\nIt starts popping stuff up on screen and\njust scrolling right by and\n\n371\n00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:56.283\nsaying this is what I found on this site.\n\n372\n00:21:56.283 --> 00:22:01.996\nSo it's pretty neat when you\nstart taking a look at it.\n\n373\n00:22:01.996 --> 00:22:06.000\nYou start seeing all these things flow by.\n\n374\n00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.005\nI don't know in a practical sense\nhow really good it is, but.\n\n375\n00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:14.640\n>> [LAUGH] Still good to see the fact\nthat they've got these sniffers that\n\n376\n00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.030\nare very focused.\n\n377\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.330\nI didn't have to write any filters.\n\n378\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.920\nDidn't have to do anything crazy.\n\n379\n00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:23.240\nThis one grabs images and we can find\nothers that are specific to certain\n\n380\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.470\nthings so that's some very handy stuff.\n\n381\n00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.120\n>> Yeah, it can be a good way to kinda\nsee what people are looking at on your\n\n382\n00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.800\nnetwork.\n\n383\n00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.040\nI've heard of places do that,\nhaving done stuff like that,\n\n384\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.648\nand they're just, why do we do that?\n\n385\n00:22:36.648 --> 00:22:39.850\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well,\nI'll tell you what, Sean.\n\n386\n00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.460\nI know we got more that we\nwanna talk about sniffers.\n\n387\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.550\nBut looking at the clock, we're about\nout of time for this episode, so\n\n388\n00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.110\nlet's go ahead and call it here, and\nwe'll do another episode on sniffing.\n\n389\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.880\nSound like a plan?\n\n390\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.670\n>> Sounds good.\n\n391\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.000\n>> All right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed watching this one.\n\n392\n00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.620\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n393\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.740\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n394\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.630\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n395\n00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:05.860\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.530\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.280\nAnd with me today is Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.390\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n7\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.510\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n8\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.240\nHow you doing?\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.230\nWe've got another exciting episode\ncoming your way here at ITProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.550\nWe're continuing on with our\nKali Linux series and in particular,\n\n11\n00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.540\nwe're talking about sniffers.\n\n12\n00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.760\nSo if you missed the previous episode,\nmake sure you go back and\n\n13\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.100\ncheck that one out.\n\n14\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.600\nWe got our intro to sniffers and\n\n15\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.130\nwe've already gone over a few\ndifferent types of sniffers.\n\n16\n00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.410\nThere's so many though and\nthen they're so fun to use.\n\n17\n00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.490\nNow they give us a lot\nof good information.\n\n18\n00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.340\nWe're gonna continue on taking\na look at different sniffers,\n\n19\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.940\nas well as talking about some of\nthe caveats or some of the things that\n\n20\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.190\nwe've got to worry about with\nsniffers in our modern networks.\n\n21\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.410\nSo Sean,\nlet's get back into sniffers though.\n\n22\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.400\nI know we took a look at a couple,\nwe looked at Wireshark.\n\n23\n00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.540\nWe looked at EtherApe, which was\na nice kind of a protocol analyzer.\n\n24\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.377\nIt didn't really show us the raw packets,\nbut\n\n25\n00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:12.240\nit showed us who we were connecting to and\nwhat protocols were being used.\n\n26\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990\nWe also saw Driftnet,\n\n27\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.790\nthat grabbed all the images that\nwere flowing by on the network.\n\n28\n00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.360\nSo a couple of cool ones there.\n\n29\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630\nWhat else do you wanna take a look at?\n\n30\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890\n>> Okay, we do have some\nother ones in the bag here.\n\n31\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.690\nThe one I really think that needs to\nbe brought up is what they call dsniff.\n\n32\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.900\nAnd dsniff just isn't one thing,\nby the way.\n\n33\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.555\nIt's more than one.\n\n34\n00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:41.790\nIt's accomplishes a good number of tasks.\n\n35\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.595\nNow we did previously talk about\ndsniff in a previous segment,\n\n36\n00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:50.230\nbut not we kinda wanna\nflush that out a bit more.\n\n37\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.590\nCuz it does so much more than be\nused just as an exploitation tool.\n\n38\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.660\nIt is designed to be a sniffer and\nit does that quite well,\n\n39\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.294\nit's just the fact that when\nwe talked about it previously.\n\n40\n00:02:01.294 --> 00:02:04.270\nWe're using it to gain\ninformation that could be used to\n\n41\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.180\ngain access to someone's account.\n\n42\n00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.290\nSo what we wanna do is we\nwanna look at the whole thing.\n\n43\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.350\nWhat dsniff is, is dsniff is like,\n\n44\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.050\nsay the suite of tools, dsniff is\njust one tool as part of that bundle.\n\n45\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.360\nThe other tools do just\na bunch of different things.\n\n46\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.130\nSome of the stuff we will\nlook at later on, but\n\n47\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.050\nwe do wanna start talking and\nbringing this into your thought process.\n\n48\n00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.600\nWhat we have is the first\none in here which is dsniff.\n\n49\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.470\nDsniff, it's simple,\nyou just go through and\n\n50\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.210\ndo -i and\ntell it what interface to listen on.\n\n51\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.370\nAnd boom, it's listening, okay?\n\n52\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.370\nNow nothing showing up, I know.\n\n53\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.010\nIt's like, what's going on in there?\n\n54\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.760\nWell what it's waiting for\n\n55\n00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.600\nis if I was to now open up a browser,\nopen up an FTP client.\n\n56\n00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.220\nI could just start typing in my username\nand password and connect to it.\n\n57\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.060\nIf dsniff is running and it's running,\n\n58\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.810\nas you can clearly see here,\nit picks up that FTP traffic.\n\n59\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.210\nIt will now look at that traffic and\nsay filter out everything,\n\n60\n00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.550\nthe data transfer, everything.\n\n61\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.670\nAll I wanna display back on screen is the\nserver address you're connecting to and\n\n62\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.380\nthe username and password.\n\n63\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.270\nThat's all it will show you.\n\n64\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.470\nIt will let the other\nstuff just do whatever.\n\n65\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.699\nAnd so it will do that with\na multitude of different protocols.\n\n66\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.990\nSome really kind of ones that you're\nprobably not gonna encounter nowadays.\n\n67\n00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.550\nOther ones, you definitely are.\n\n68\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.450\nIf you're passing passwords over HTTP,\nwhich you can, it will pick those up.\n\n69\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.430\nObviously, FTP it will do,\nthe mail protocols it will pick up.\n\n70\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.660\nAll you have to do for\nstuff like SMTP and IMAP and\n\n71\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.680\nPOP, all those guys is just hit send or\nreceive on your client.\n\n72\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.520\nAnd wherever the credentials are being\npassed, it will pick them up and\n\n73\n00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.168\ndisplay them onscreen, telling you\nthis is the server you went to,\n\n74\n00:04:08.168 --> 00:04:10.350\nthis is your account username and done.\n\n75\n00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.970\n>> Nice.\n\n76\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.250\nNow, it's not breaking the password,\nso if it's encrypted or hashed,\n\n77\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.180\nit's just gonna show you that hash value?\n\n78\n00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.840\n>> Well, if it's hash or\nanything like that,\n\n79\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.370\nit's just gonna say it doesn't read,\nit's just not gonna display anything.\n\n80\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.770\nIf the whole thing is\nencrypted using SSL or\n\n81\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.610\nsomething, then it's not\neven be able to see it all.\n\n82\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.260\n>> Gotcha.\n\n83\n00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.602\n>> So it is a very useful thing.\n\n84\n00:04:32.602 --> 00:04:35.964\nAnd interestingly enough,\nyou turn this on and\n\n85\n00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:40.260\nI'm not telling you guys you got\na blank check to go try this.\n\n86\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.903\nBut if you were to start dsniff\non your own corporate network and\n\n87\n00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.800\nturn it on and just let it sit out there.\n\n88\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.729\nYou might be amazed at just how much\nstuff you can see that you shouldn't\n\n89\n00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.660\nbe seeing as easily.\n\n90\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.380\nSo just something to think about.\n\n91\n00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.450\nNow, can you get this stuff through\nother sniffers like Wireshark?\n\n92\n00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.530\nWell yeah, of course you could.\n\n93\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.890\nYou can get all of those\nthings through Wireshark.\n\n94\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.670\nIt's just that for Wireshark you\ngotta set up your filters and\n\n95\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.140\nyou're gonna have to start opening up\npackets to look for that information.\n\n96\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.940\nHere, it's right visible to you.\n\n97\n00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.110\nAll you really have to do if you\nwant to take this to the next level\n\n98\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.780\nis just do that little\ngreater than sign and\n\n99\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.770\npipe it out to a text file and\njust start harvesting.\n\n100\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.740\nThat's it.\n\n101\n00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.510\n>> All right, so focused on authentication\ntype traffic, grabbing all that.\n\n102\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.210\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many web\napplications, websites, don't bother.\n\n103\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.450\nJust set up some type of encryption\non that authentication process.\n\n104\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.100\nAnd if they don't, you'll capture\nthat information pretty quickly.\n\n105\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.500\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthey just don't take basic precautions.\n\n106\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610\nYou will see people not configure their\nmail clients to use any encryption and so\n\n107\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.520\nthey send and receive and all of a sudden,\npop, pop, pop, pop, pop, it comes up.\n\n108\n00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.200\nIt's like saying that\n\n109\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.660\nquestion of going to something like\nStarbucks and turning on Driftnet.\n\n110\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.700\nTurn that on, you'd probably be surprised\nat how much stuff you would catch.\n\n111\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.780\n>> I can't tell you how many networks\nI've gone to where they've got\n\n112\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.620\ntheir email server set up and\ntoo many problems.\n\n113\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.670\nAssigning a certificate to the email\nserver, getting all the clients to trust\n\n114\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.430\nthat certificate,\nthat's too much work for them, right?\n\n115\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.720\nSo they just turn off,\n\n116\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.070\nthey just say, all right,\nwe'll just do unsecured authentication.\n\n117\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.990\nNo problem.\n\n118\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.250\n>> Yeah, I see\n>> It's clear.\n\n119\n00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.480\nYou tell your users yeah, it's gonna warn\nyou, just click OK, it'll be all right.\n\n120\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.861\nAnd maybe it is in-house, right,\nbecause you think it's all inside,\n\n121\n00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:31.570\neverything's good.\n\n122\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.780\nWhat if I've already compromised\nthe system on your network?\n\n123\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.660\nAnd now I'm on that system and\nI'm running something like this,\n\n124\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.650\nlike dsniff, I'm gonnasee all of that.\n\n125\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.303\nSo as a penetration tester slash attacker,\n\n126\n00:06:42.303 --> 00:06:46.770\nnone of those plain text authentication,\nthose are great things [LAUGH].\n\n127\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.550\n>> Yeah, it's, yeah you got to really\nreally really be aware of those things and\n\n128\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.990\nwhat the problems they can actually cause,\nbecause they're not uncommon to do.\n\n129\n00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.710\nBecause they figure enable all the stuff\nor disable things to make it easier for\n\n130\n00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.020\nthem to administer,\ninstead of doing the homework.\n\n131\n00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.790\nTo figure out why they're\nhaving that problem and how to\n\n132\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.800\nmake it more secure at the same time\nmake it, so it's working the right way.\n\n133\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.300\n>> Exactly.\n\n134\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.700\n>> So that was actually what, just dsniff.\n\n135\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:25.210\nDsniff does have other things\nin it's whole suite of tools.\n\n136\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.290\nSome other stuff we can point\nout is one called urlsnarf.\n\n137\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.970\nAnd that one, same type of deal.\n\n138\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:39.490\nYou just go out,\ntype urlsnarf -i eth0, in my case.\n\n139\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.180\nAnd boom, it's listening.\n\n140\n00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.260\nAnd you can see that it tells me\nthe ports that it's listening on.\n\n141\n00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.960\nGreat, happy about that.\n\n142\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.470\nNothing being displayed, though.\n\n143\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.316\nSo what I'm gonna do is again,\nopen up my browser.\n\n144\n00:07:52.316 --> 00:07:56.900\nSo I've opened it up and\nI switch over here.\n\n145\n00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.748\nAnd let me close that window just so\nthat there's less confusion for\n\n146\n00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.490\nme to switch amongst.\n\n147\n00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.290\nNothing showed up, but\nlet's see why that happened.\n\n148\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.870\nI just opened up this\nbrowser window over here.\n\n149\n00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.510\nLook what's doing.\n\n150\n00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.720\nIt's looking at the local drive.\n\n151\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.280\nI haven't generated anything off the\nsystem, so I definitely need to do that.\n\n152\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.570\nSo if I was to go and\ntype something like a new site again, and\n\n153\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.930\ndo this, and go over to this,\nlook at what's happening.\n\n154\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.160\nThe stuff is actually scrolling by.\n\n155\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.450\nThat's the conversation going back and\n\n156\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:35.090\nforth between my system and\nthe USA Today website.\n\n157\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.501\nSo you can see just a lot\nof things happening there.\n\n158\n00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:40.650\n>> Wow.\n\n159\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.100\n>> So, I'm not touching anything.\n\n160\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.090\nThat's all stuff that's being loaded\nas it pieces together that page.\n\n161\n00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.740\n>> Yeah, it's loading up the web page,\nall the different banner ads, and\n\n162\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.250\ngraphics that it's got to go grab.\n\n163\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.040\nSo it's connecting to multiple servers and\ngetting all of that info, and\n\n164\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.460\nyou're seeing all of it come right\nback to that little window, nice.\n\n165\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.161\n>> Yeah, so\n\n166\n00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:03.879\nthat kind of gives you an idea of what one\nof the other tools in that suite does.\n\n167\n00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:10.872\nAnd just to give you kind of an idea,\nand let me just Ctrl+C that to stop it,\n\n168\n00:09:10.872 --> 00:09:15.130\nI can do other deals\nwith that suite of tools.\n\n169\n00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:19.290\nAnd just to kind of make it easy switching\nthrough all the things in the dSniff\n\n170\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:25.960\nsuite, what I've got here is, and\nmaybe you can zoom that up a bit for you.\n\n171\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.180\nThese are the members of the dSniff suite.\n\n172\n00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.360\nI still have at least one more\nI'm gonna show you on there,\n\n173\n00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.840\nbut you can see the things that it can do.\n\n174\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.850\nYou've got ARP spoof.\n\n175\n00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.430\nWhat does it do?\n\n176\n00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.440\nIt spoofs ARP packets.\n\n177\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.180\nOkay, fine.\n\n178\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.280\nDNS, it can respond,\nit can help you reply to DNS queries.\n\n179\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.530\nWith dSniff, we can see what dSniff does.\n\n180\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.340\nFilesnarf to reconstruct files.\n\n181\n00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.038\nWe've got macof, which we'll talk about.\n\n182\n00:09:58.038 --> 00:10:01.830\nMailsnarf, that one,\nyou want to look at what mailsnarf does,\n\n183\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.040\nsaves email messages sniffed from SMTP and\nPOP traffic.\n\n184\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.820\nIf you have encrypted that,\nit would literally take your emails and\n\n185\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.550\ndisplay them onscreen.\n\n186\n00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.170\nOr if you want,\njust pipe it out to a file, and\n\n187\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.660\nyou've got someone's emails that\nthey're sending out and receiving.\n\n188\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.374\nYou've got that, then you have\nmsgsnarf for doing instant messaging.\n\n189\n00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.300\ntcpkill and tcpnice are for\n\n190\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.725\nslowing down and killing connections,\nif you wanna sever a connection.\n\n191\n00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:34.900\nIt could be used for\ndoing man in the middle attacks.\n\n192\n00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.140\nLike they have two tools at\nthe bottom are used specifically for\n\n193\n00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.900\ndoing man in the middle.\n\n194\n00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.170\nAnd then, of course, you've got urlsnarf\nwhich I've showed you and webspy.\n\n195\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.530\nWebspy is kinda another interesting one.\n\n196\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.200\nBecause what it does is if you have that\nturned on and configured the right way,\n\n197\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.080\nwhat will happen is you can have someone\nelse browsing stuff in their system.\n\n198\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.859\nIt means if Mike was over here,\nI could set it up and if Mike was browsing\n\n199\n00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:07.367\nsomething in his web browser with webspy\nset up and the application of arpspoof,\n\n200\n00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:11.587\nanything that he browsed would\nactually show up on my system.\n\n201\n00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:13.960\n>> Not yet, [CROSSTALK]\n>> It would make an identical copy.\n\n202\n00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.295\n[LAUGH]\n>> So just kind of mirror that connection,\n\n203\n00:11:17.295 --> 00:11:19.525\nyou're gonna see exactly as I'm going\nthrough different web pages and\n\n204\n00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:20.310\nthings like that.\n\n205\n00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.254\nIt's like you're sitting back and\n\n206\n00:11:22.254 --> 00:11:25.635\nyour web browser is just changing\nas I change it on my machine.\n\n207\n00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:29.450\n>> Yeah, anything you browse\nto would show up in there.\n\n208\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:35.452\nIt's just a case of me using\nforced ARP requests and\n\n209\n00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:40.170\npoisoning ARP cache on his machine.\n\n210\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.950\nSo it starts changing the flow of traffic.\n\n211\n00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.340\nSo it's including mine on that.\n\n212\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.560\nAnd I'm seeing identical copies of\nwhat's going on in his browser.\n\n213\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.470\nSo it's [LAUGH] a fascinating\nthing to actually see.\n\n214\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.450\n>> It's probably updated to\ndo more than just Netscape.\n\n215\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.170\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a fascinating one right there.\n\n216\n00:11:59.170 -->

class.\n\n219\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.205\n>> That's still my favorite browser.\n\n220\n00:12:07.205 --> 00:12:12.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> But, any case, that's the dSniff suite.\n\n221\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:18.090\nBeen around for quite a long time,\nand it's still extremely useful.\n\n222\n00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.740\nIt's basically a collection,\nfor the most part,\n\n223\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.750\na collection of sniffers that are highly\ncustomized for a specific purpose.\n\n224\n00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.620\nSo we really gotta like that.\n\n225\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.350\nBut that's dSniff, and\nthat kinda what that suite does.\n\n226\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.530\nBut there are other things that we wanna\nconcern ourselves with when we are doing\n\n227\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.190\nsniffing.\n\n228\n00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.460\nSo we've seen all these sniffers so far.\n\n229\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.876\nWe've seen, like I said,\nWireshark, EtherApe, and\n\n230\n00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:51.170\nthere's other ones sitting out\nthere that can do various things.\n\n231\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.840\nWe know if we go into Kali and\nlook at our sniffing and\n\n232\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.490\nspoofing, we can see our\nnetwork sniffers in there.\n\n233\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.360\nThere's a bunch of ones in there.\n\n234\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:06.690\nI mean, look, there's one for SSL that\ncan sniff traffic based on that, so\n\n235\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.650\nsome really neat stuff in there and we've\ngot our web sniffers and it just goes on.\n\n236\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.145\nWe've got some good stuff in there.\n\n237\n00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:18.435\nBut what if you have a situation\nwhere you just can't\n\n238\n00:13:18.435 --> 00:13:21.955\nturn on a sniffer to see all\nthe traffic that you want to see?\n\n239\n00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:23.355\nThat's going to happen.\n\n240\n00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:27.775\nYou're gonna have situations where\nyou try to turn on your sniffer and\n\n241\n00:13:27.775 --> 00:13:33.320\nthe stuff you want to see,\nyou know it's there,\n\n242\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.560\nbut it's on the other side of a switch.\n\n243\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.310\nSo they've ripped out those\nswitches like we talked about.\n\n244\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.360\nIt's on the other side of a switch,\nso we can't just go in and get it.\n\n245\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.340\nWe have to so something about that switch.\n\n246\n00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.940\nSo we've got tools that\nare gonna come into play.\n\n247\n00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.890\nRemember, the way a switch works,\na switch keeps track of traffic and\n\n248\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.050\nwhere it's going to go by\nlooking at the MAC addresses.\n\n249\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.210\nIt keeps track of those by having what\nthey call content addressable memory\n\n250\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.800\ninside the switch.\n\n251\n00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.733\nSo it starts keeping track of MAC\naddresses that are coming through, and\n\n252\n00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:13.995\nso it knows where things are, and\nit can get into the right spot.\n\n253\n00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:20.630\nNow, if that memory gets filled up,\nthe switch can start having problems.\n\n254\n00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.790\nNow in the old days,\nif you started filling up that piece of\n\n255\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.890\nmemory too fast or put too much in there,\nthe switch would actually fail open.\n\n256\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.430\nIt would fail right open.\n\n257\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.320\n>> Turn into a hub then basically.\n\n258\n00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.812\n>> Yeah, it would turn into a hub.\n\n259\n00:14:34.812 --> 00:14:39.270\nIt would fail out into a hub.\n\n260\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.110\nWhich now is great for you as\nan attacker cuz you can see everything.\n\n261\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:50.100\nAll the stuff we've seen here can be done\nwithout any effort whatsoever on a hub.\n\n262\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.149\nOkay, so that's all well and good.\n\n263\n00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:57.500\nWhat if it doesn't do that?\n\n264\n00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.670\nModern switches,\nmost of them tend to fail the other way.\n\n265\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.980\nWhere if you beat on it enough, it will\nfill up that memory and it fails closed.\n\n266\n00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:13.400\nUntil it gets reset or\nit can deal with what it has on hand.\n\n267\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:18.480\nSo thinking about this,\nhow do we cause a situation where\n\n268\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.320\nwe can cause that switch to fail?\n\n269\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:28.250\nWell the way we can do that is\nwe can fill up that CAM table.\n\n270\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.220\nNow we have, of course,\ntools that can do that.\n\n271\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.993\nOne of the tools that we have to do\nthat is part of that dSniff suite.\n\n272\n00:15:35.993 --> 00:15:41.869\nAnd what we have is you can type\nin a tool here called macof.\n\n273\n00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.291\nSo we go ahead and we type that in.\n\n274\n00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:46.040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n275\n00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.136\n>> And I'm only gonna let this run for\na second.\n\n276\n00:15:48.136 --> 00:15:51.346\nIf you're gonna run it, I would\nrecommend you let it run for a second.\n\n277\n00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:57.608\nSo, what I do here is I hit enter on it\nyou can see it just blasting stuff by,\n\n278\n00:15:57.608 --> 00:16:01.360\nit's generating random Mac addresses.\n\n279\n00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.870\nIf I keep letting this go, it has\nthe capability to generate hundreds of\n\n280\n00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.948\nthousands of them,\nI think it's like every minute or\n\n281\n00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:17.050\nsomething they can do like 130 or\n150,000 MAC addresses every minute.\n\n282\n00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.250\nSo it's gonna crush in short order,\n\n283\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.400\nit's gonna crush a switch in there with\nthe amount of traffic it's getting, so\n\n284\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.110\nthis would be a good way\nto throttle that switch, so\n\n285\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.040\nyou can get around it,\nif it will fail like that.\n\n286\n00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.960\n>> Right.\n\n287\n00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.110\nAnd that's something we've\ngotta find out I guess, and\n\n288\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.880\nreally only one way to find out.\n\n289\n00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.990\nRemember, you compromise a machine,\nyou get on to that machine, but\n\n290\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.860\nthe problem is that machine is hooked up\nto the corporate network or whatever, and\n\n291\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.090\nit's connected to a switch.\n\n292\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.500\nAnd as Sean said and we've learned in\nNetwork Plus, that's a point to point\n\n293\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.200\nconnection between you and the switch,\nand all you're gonna see, that switch\n\n294\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.950\nis only allowing traffic that's destined\nfor that node that's out that port.\n\n295\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.890\nSo the idea is a tool like Macof.\n\n296\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.680\nFlood it with Mac address.\n\n297\n00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.220\nIt can't keep track of who's out what's\nport and, hopefully, fails open.\n\n298\n00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.318\nAnd now it's like a hub, and I can\ncapture all the traffic that's going by,\n\n299\n00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:13.400\ncuz now all traffic goes out every port.\n\n300\n00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.520\nThere's a problem we have,\nmodern networks.\n\n301\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.490\nNobody buys hubs anymore.\n\n302\n00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.080\nSwitches are comparable or\nin price to a hub.\n\n303\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.570\nAnd you get so much more functionality,\n\n304\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.790\nand we depend on that to make\nthose contention domains in our\n\n305\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.890\nEthernet networks that you're gonna have\nto have a tool like this under your belt.\n\n306\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.710\n>> It's definitely not the only\none that does it either.\n\n307\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.050\nThere are other tools that\ndo this sort of thing,\n\n308\n00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.650\nthat will just blast stuff at a switch\nwith the intention of seeing if they\n\n309\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:49.260\ncan just crush it with the sheer amount\nof traffic that's being fired at it.\n\n310\n00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.170\nAnd like I said, some will fail\ninto an open state as a hub.\n\n311\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.340\nSome will fail to a closed state,\nand then they have to be reset.\n\n312\n00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.190\nEither manually or they automatically\nwill do that for a period of time.\n\n313\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.840\nSo either way, if you look at it,\n\n314\n00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.230\neither way you're gonna do\nsomething to that person.\n\n315\n00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.386\nYou're either gonna be\nable to capture traffic or\n\n316\n00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:10.515\nif it fails the other way, you've\njust caused a mini denial of service,\n\n317\n00:18:10.515 --> 00:18:14.360\nbecause you just blocked traffic by\ncausing that thing to lock itself down.\n\n318\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.530\n>> And not just that port, right?\n\n319\n00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.350\nAll ports are gonna be on that.\n\n320\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.185\nAll the other people that are connected\nto that switch are no longer gonna have\n\n321\n00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:20.800\naccess either.\n\n322\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.000\nNow you set off some flags or\nsome alarms, hopefully.\n\n323\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.580\nOn the network.\n\n324\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.560\nI mean not hopefully for us but,\nhopefully to the network and\n\n325\n00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.720\nthey're like hey the switch is down,\npeople are gonna be calling.\n\n326\n00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.718\nBut, maybe that's what\nyou're trying to do, so.\n\n327\n00:18:31.718 --> 00:18:32.286\n>> Yep.\n\n328\n00:18:32.286 --> 00:18:34.770\n>> A good tool to have in the belt,\nand as you said,\n\n329\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.860\nthere's others that'll let me\ndo that same kind of thing.\n\n330\n00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.750\nJust try to flood that switch with so\nmuch info, that it can't keep up and\n\n331\n00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.550\nhopefully it fails open and\nsays I give up.\n\n332\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.840\nI don't know who's out what port,\nI'm just gonna send all the traffic,\n\n333\n00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.430\nnow I can sift all that traffic,\njust like I was hooked up through a hub.\n\n334\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.060\nOr it fail's closed, and\nthen we don't get anything, but\n\n335\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.520\nwe did do an analysis service\non the network, so good to have.\n\n336\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:04.090\n>> Yeah, you could definitely cause people\nsome problems doing something like this.\n\n337\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.770\nSo [LAUGH] keep that in mind\nif you were gonna do something\n\n338\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.300\nlike this,\nwhat the consequences of that would be.\n\n339\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.788\nMight also remember, when you blast that\nmany Mac addresses that uses something\n\n340\n00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:18.970\nlike Macof, someone's gonna see it.\n\n341\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.246\n>> Right.\n>> IDS is gonna see that.\n\n342\n00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:25.386\nI just ran that really quickly\non this network here, so\n\n343\n00:19:25.386 --> 00:19:29.266\nI didn't destroy anything or\ncause any problems.\n\n344\n00:19:29.266 --> 00:19:33.850\n>> [LAUGH] All of a sudden our video locks\nup and we're no longer broadcasting live.\n\n345\n00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.200\nYeah, Sean was just running Macof.\n\n346\n00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.180\n>> That kind of streamy,\nkind of blurry video.\n\n347\n00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.960\nIt gets worse.\n\n348\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.265\nWhat's going on?\n\n349\n00:19:41.265 --> 00:19:45.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You would have to keep an eye on what\n\n350\n00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.570\nyou're doing with something like Macof.\n\n351\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.570\nIf you blast enough of that out,\nyeah, it's gonna have some effects.\n\n352\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.750\nAnd IDS is gonna pick it up,\nand once it picks it up,\n\n353\n00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.990\nit's alerting somebody presumably.\n\n354\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.120\nAnd then that person's gonna\ninvestigate and see yeah, well,\n\n355\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.658\nthat's somebody messing around.\n\n356\n00:20:06.658 --> 00:20:10.130\nAnd it's gonna track down\nwhat that problem is,\n\n357\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.950\nor do something to block you out.\n\n358\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.730\n>> And that's one of those things you're\ngonna have to learn, right Sean, if we\n\n359\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.890\nlet's say we do compromise a system, we're\ndoing our pen test, we've compromised\n\n360\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:24.060\nthe system on the inside, we're starting\nto run a sniff run on that system.\n\n361\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.860\nWell, how do I know if I'm a on\na switched Ethernet or not?\n\n362\n00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:31.040\n99% of the time in today's networks your\ngoing to be, but how do I know for sure?\n\n363\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.710\nWell if you start capturing traffic,\nand the only Unicast traffic you see,\n\n364\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.070\nis destined for the machine\nthat you've compromised, right.\n\n365\n00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.410\nYou should know the IP address of\nthe machine you've compromised, and\n\n366\n00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.249\nif your looking at that captured traffic\nand the only Unicast traffic is coming out\n\n367\n00:20:46.249 --> 00:20:50.510\nof that machine, then pretty good chance\nyou're on a switched Ethernet, right.\n\n368\n00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.672\nIf you saw other destination addresses,\nUnicast now,\n\n369\n00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:56.610\nyou gotta ignore the broadcast and\nthings like that.\n\n370\n00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.770\nThen you can assume maybe\nthat you are on a hub.\n\n371\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.440\nOr a portion of the network that's hub.\n\n372\n00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.490\nSo one of the ways you might be able\nto tell you're on a switched Ethernet,\n\n373\n00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.300\nis just looking at the traffic and\nseeing what you see at all.\n\n374\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:10.930\n>> Exactly.\n\n375\n00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:16.790\nIt's pretty much common sense once\nyou know how a switch works in a hub,\n\n376\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.820\nand all those guys work.\n\n377\n00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:19.780\nYou're right.\n\n378\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.070\nIf you were to turn on the sniffer and the\nonly traffic you see is coming to you or\n\n379\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:27.000\nleaving you, that's highly unusual.\n\n380\n00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.430\nIf you're not in your home network,\nthat's highly unusual.\n\n381\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.000\nSo that indicates more than likely,\nthat there's a switch out there\n\n382\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.760\nsomeplace that you and\neveryone else is plugged into.\n\n383\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.140\nSo that switches fingerprints all over it.\n\n384\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.790\n>> All right.\n\n385\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.430\nSean again,\na lot of good information on sniffers, and\n\n386\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.405\nhow we can use them to\ncapture information.\n\n387\n00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:52.630\nAnd how there's these suites that have\nmultiple tools built into them that allow\n\n388\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.560\nme to really focus my efforts and\ncapture just certain types of traffic,\n\n389\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.190\nif that's what I wanna do.\n\n390\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.320\nWe also saw how in today's networks we're\ngonna see a lot of switched Ethernet, and\n\n391\n00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.480\nhow we can get around that.\n\n392\n00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.950\nYou're not stuck just because\nyou're on a switched Ethernet.\n\n393\n00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.280\nThere are ways that I can\n\n394\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.790\nforce it to show me traffic that's\ngoing to other nodes on the network.\n\n395\n00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.270\nHopefully using something like Macof,\nor maybe it fails closed and\n\n396\n00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.320\nthen we don't get to see anything, but\nnobody else on the network does either.\n\n397\n00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.610\nSo maybe that's a plus to it,\n\n398\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.610\nbut anything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n399\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:33.790\nYou know, I would say you're probably,\nat this point,\n\n400\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.910\na lot of you might be thinking,\nwell you know, I've still got Wireshark.\n\n401\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.820\nI'll stick with that.\n\n402\n00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.320\nNow is not the time for\nyou to get a product loyalty here, and\n\n403\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.050\nsay I'm gonna stick with\nWireshark no matter what.\n\n404\n00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.110\nWireshark is a fine piece of software, but\n\n405\n00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.730\nif you just wanna stick with only\nWireshark, you're gonna miss\n\n406\n00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.450\nsome of these other really neat pieces of\nsoftware that have unique perspectives and\n\n407\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:05.882\nunique capabilities,\nthat Wireshark either cannot emulate,\n\n408\n00:23:05.882 --> 00:23:09.680\nor would take a lot of work to emulate it.\n\n409\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.160\nDon't get so tied to Wireshark that\nyou're just not willing to try it.\n\n410\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.000\nI've seen and heard people that way,\noh I know Wireshark,\n\n411\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.158\nit's the best one out there, and all that.\n\n412\n00:23:18.158 --> 00:23:21.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Saying it's the best one out\n\n413\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.030\nthere that's a subjective thing.\n\n414\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.730\nBut it's not subjective to\nsay that there are a big\n\n415\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:31.450\nwide family of specialized sniffers,\nthat also work Wireshark and\n\n416\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.060\ncan offer you something\nthat's just much better.\n\n417\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.550\n>> Then Wireshark may be able to do,\nwithout a lot of work.\n\n418\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.700\nLook at DNS Sniff, look how easy it\nwould be to capture credentials.\n\n419\n00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.470\nYou could do the same\nthing with Wireshark.\n\n420\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.310\nWireshark's gonna take longer to do it,\nto set to stage that attack.\n\n421\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:53.510\nWith something like D Sniff,\nI can do that with a few button clicks,\n\n422\n00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.210\nor a few taps on the keyboard,\nso to speak.\n\n423\n00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.404\n>> I've got that information.\n\n424\n00:23:58.404 --> 00:23:59.709\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n425\n00:23:59.709 --> 00:24:01.430\nAll right.\nSo lots of choices.\n\n426\n00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.870\nDon't be stuck with one.\n\n427\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.020\nTry them all.\n\n428\n00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.150\nYou might find that you like one of\nthose others better than Wire Shark, or\n\n429\n00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.720\nat least it's a good complement to\nwhatever else you've got in your tool bag.\n\n430\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.457\nAll right.\nWell I'll tell you what, ladies and\n\n431\n00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:15.760\ngentlemen, that's gonna end\nthis particular episode,\n\n432\n00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.530\nwe hope you guys enjoyed watching.\n\n433\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.870\nI know we enjoyed making it for you.\n\n434\n00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.010\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n435\n00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.100\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n436\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.254\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n437\n00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:29.701\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.181\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.510\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.490\n>> I am doing awesome.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.070\nHow are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.130\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.770\nIt's another exciting day\nhere at ITProTV land.\n\n9\n00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.640\nWe are continuing on with\nour Kali Linux series, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.120\nin this episode we're going to be\nlooking at social engineering.\n\n11\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.194\nI know social engineering was a concept\nthat we want to talk about and\n\n12\n00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:35.370\nexpand upon.\n\n13\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.890\nWe've seen it in a couple of other classes\nbut, we're gonna go over here and Sean,\n\n14\n00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.650\nwe've got a tool we can actually use,\nwhich is a first, I think, for\n\n15\n00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.530\nsocial engineering.\n\n16\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.030\nSo, why don't we start talking about\nwhat social engineering is, so\n\n17\n00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.160\nwe make sure everybody's\non the same playing field.\n\n18\n00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.260\n>> Yeah.\nLet's just straighten some stuff out right\n\n19\n00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.750\noff the get-go, so we know we're\ntalking about with social engineering.\n\n20\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.230\nAnd I'm aware, probably,\nall of us are good on it, but\n\n21\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.310\nlet's just make sure we have\na good level playing field here.\n\n22\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.430\n>> It is a broad topic.\n\n23\n00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.340\nI mean, it covers, there's a lot of things\nthat fall under social engineering.\n\n24\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.000\nSome of them you might not even realize.\n\n25\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.070\nLike, oh wait, that's social engineering?\n\n26\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.510\nA lot of different techniques we can use,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.050\n>> Yeah, there's a whole bunch of things\nyou can do, social engineering wise,\n\n28\n00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.610\nto manipulate, interact with, and\nextract information out of your target.\n\n29\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.490\nIt's just a question of your skill and\nwhat methods you're gonna use.\n\n30\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.360\nSo, you have to consider that.\n\n31\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.710\nNow we can carry out social engineering\nface to face or using technology.\n\n32\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.580\nBut still, you have to have some savvy and\n\n33\n00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.440\nsome capabilities yourself to be\nable to pull it off successfully.\n\n34\n00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.860\nSo, when we look at doing it,\ntraditionally there hasn't been a ton of\n\n35\n00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.760\ntools that could help you out with it,\nother than just reading some books and\n\n36\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.590\nbeing maybe a good actor and\nhaving a lot of confidence.\n\n37\n00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.103\nThat will help you out,\nbut other than that,\n\n38\n00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:04.627\nyou kind of didn't have\nmuch to fall back on.\n\n39\n00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:09.580\nNow with Kali, they've brought out\nthis social engineering toolkit.\n\n40\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.416\nAnd it's not really exclusive to Kali,\nit's something that you can get on other\n\n41\n00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:19.700\nLinux boxes as well, but it does the same\nthing no matter where you're running it.\n\n42\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.950\nIt allows you to start crafting\na social engineering strategy.\n\n43\n00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.870\nAnd really kind of get things moving.\n\n44\n00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.400\nIt's customizable, it has a lot of tricks\nand all up its sleeve that you can use.\n\n45\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.070\nIt's kind of a neat thing so\nno longer do you just have to\n\n46\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.890\nrely on your own ability to act and\n\n47\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.760\nyour own confidence and savvy and\nall that to really extract information.\n\n48\n00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.400\nNow it definitely helps to have that.\n\n49\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.040\nAnd if you really start observing how\npeople interact with one another,\n\n50\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.050\nand know things about human nature,\nand you just know how to really really\n\n51\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.095\nclose attention to what people are doing,\nyou could get quite a bit.\n\n52\n00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:03.745\nBut this again will boost\nyou up to another level and\n\n53\n00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.825\nhelp you become even more\nsuccessful as a social engineer.\n\n54\n00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:07.475\n>> All right.\n\n55\n00:03:07.475 --> 00:03:10.755\nSo social engineering again is\nreally trying to take advantage of\n\n56\n00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:11.595\nhuman nature, right?\n\n57\n00:03:11.595 --> 00:03:15.875\nNow we're not talking about targeting\na system or targeting a server,\n\n58\n00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:20.105\nan application or protocol,\nwe're targeting the human, right?\n\n59\n00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.120\nThat person that sits behind the keyboard.\n\n60\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.950\nBecause they are one of the weaker links.\n\n61\n00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.180\nA, you can't patch them.\n\n62\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.660\nIt all comes down to training and\npeople are surprisingly easy\n\n63\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.200\nto convince to give up information\nthat they really shouldn't be.\n\n64\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980\nEither through trickery or name dropping,\nor several different methods.\n\n65\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520\nBut the role of social engineering\nis targeting the human.\n\n66\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.523\nTaking advantage of\nthe weakness of the human.\n\n67\n00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:48.160\n>> Exactly, that sounds kind of\nominous the way you said it.\n\n68\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.205\nYou're taking advantage of\nthe weakness of the human.\n\n69\n00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:54.316\n>> [LAUGH] That's right,\nall your base are belong to us.\n\n70\n00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:57.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For social engineering,\n\n71\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.408\nwe talk about what it is.\n\n72\n00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:02.560\nIt again is taking\nadvantage of human nature,\n\n73\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.440\ngetting people to give up information\nthat they really shouldn't, and\n\n74\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.300\na lot of different commonly\nemployed techniques that we use.\n\n75\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.250\nGosh, I'm thinking off the top of my head,\nI can think of some of the simple ones.\n\n76\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.056\nDumpster diving, shoulder surfing,\na lot of these we've covered in CEH,\n\n77\n00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:23.369\nwe've talked about,\nbroke them down a little bit.\n\n78\n00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:25.685\nI'm trying to think,\nwhat are some other ones, Sean?\n\n79\n00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:30.346\n>> You had the one with human nature,\na human's ability to trust,\n\n80\n00:04:30.346 --> 00:04:35.670\nthat's an inherent ability that\nyou get from the day you're born.\n\n81\n00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.280\nSo, you know how to leverage that, gaining\nthat trust and then exploiting that trust.\n\n82\n00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.490\nLearning that humans do have certain\nhabits that they will go back to\n\n83\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.400\nwithout even thinking about it.\n\n84\n00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.980\nLike I said, name dropping definitely\nhelps adding extra weight and\n\n85\n00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.460\nauthority to what you say.\n\n86\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.260\nPreying on people's moral obligations or\nmorals period to get them to do something.\n\n87\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.700\nYou can pursue a lot of these things and\n\n88\n00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.800\npush a lot of buttons to get\nsomebody to do what you want\n\n89\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.500\njust by putting maybe a few of these\ntogether and you can get that information.\n\n90\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.610\nAnd you're right, you may not be in this\ncase be going after an application or\n\n91\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.570\nsomething specifically but,\nI could be using information\n\n92\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.790\nthat I get from someone to further\ntarget a piece of software or\n\n93\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.930\nmaybe even get, find out a way to\naccess it directly through a password.\n\n94\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.019\nOr something like that to get in and\n\n95\n00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.992\nextract the data I want without any effort\nwhatsoever other than what I invested in\n\n96\n00:05:41.992 --> 00:05:46.243\njust talking to the person and\ntaking some time to get to know them, and\n\n97\n00:05:46.243 --> 00:05:49.657\nstart guiding the conversation\nto where I want it to go.\n\n98\n00:05:49.657 --> 00:05:52.957\n>> Yeah, and Ben in the chat room\npoints out, blatant lying, and\n\n99\n00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:55.960\nhonestly, that's kind of\nwhat you're doing, right?\n\n100\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.840\nYou're creating something,\n\n101\n00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.400\na lot of times you're creating some\nkind of backstory that you wanna use.\n\n102\n00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.390\nYou were talking earlier about\nthe gentlemen that went into the different\n\n103\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.010\nbanks, and told them that he was\nworking on the power system or\n\n104\n00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.320\nsomething like that.\n\n105\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.580\nThat is a great example\nof social engineering.\n\n106\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.240\nPeople see the uniform,\nthey just assume that everything's okay.\n\n107\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.259\nThey let the guy in and\nhe could pretty much do or have free.\n\n108\n00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:21.961\nYou said he got a tour of the place.\n\n109\n00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:23.101\n>> Yep.\n\n110\n00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:26.160\n>> That's a prime example\nof social engineering.\n\n111\n00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.180\nPeople have tendencies, as Sean was\nsaying, they like to be liked by\n\n112\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.320\ntheir peers, they want to be,\nthey want to get that pat on the back.\n\n113\n00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.000\nThey also have a respect,\nmost people have a respect for authority.\n\n114\n00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.530\nAnd so sometimes they're,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n115\n00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.100\nWhen they feel like there's somebody\nin power that has authority over them,\n\n116\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.970\nthey might be less inclined\nto think twice, you know.\n\n117\n00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.430\nEverybody knows they shouldn't\ngive their passwords out.\n\n118\n00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.170\nBut when somebody who you think\nis your boss or a supervisor or\n\n119\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.020\nsomebody from the corporate headquarters\nis down at that branch office and he says,\n\n120\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.788\nwhat's your password?\n\n121\n00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:05.146\nYou're like, [SOUND], and you spit it out,\nright, without even thinking.\n\n122\n00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:06.270\n>> You get intimidated.\n\n123\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.050\n>> Yeah, you get intimidated, and\n\n124\n00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.400\nthat's what social engineering\nis really taking advantage of.\n\n125\n00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.520\n>> Yeah, it's really kind of\namazing when you look at it.\n\n126\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.480\nJust the different ways that,\nwith a skilled practitioner,\n\n127\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.240\nthe different ways that they can\nmanipulate someone and do it in such a way\n\n128\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.330\nthat that person doesn't know\nthey're really being manipulated and\n\n129\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.780\njust get that person to reveal\nall sorts of information.\n\n130\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.998\nThere's a few key things you can do with\npeople that once you start engaging them,\n\n131\n00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:40.504\nand talking to them in a certain way,\nand guiding things a certain way.\n\n132\n00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:43.270\nYou start getting a level of trust.\n\n133\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.285\nYou start getting that person\nto become your buddy and\n\n134\n00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:54.646\nthey start just really becoming\nyour friend and telling you stuff.\n\n135\n00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:58.434\nIt's just those type of things and\nit can be a simple in some cases\n\n136\n00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:02.379\nto get that trust, to exploit that\ntrust is to dress a certain way.\n\n137\n00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:05.974\nYou know,\nyou were mentioning about authority and\n\n138\n00:08:05.974 --> 00:08:09.242\nthen maybe even uniforms and\nstuff like that.\n\n139\n00:08:09.242 --> 00:08:15.010\nThat does get you pretty far,\njust dressing a certain way.\n\n140\n00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.920\nSo people will definitely look at that and\ngo,\n\n141\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.250\nwell that person's wearing,\nthat's they must be in charge.\n\n142\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.010\nIf you don't believe that's true, when\nyou wear a tie or something like that.\n\n143\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.790\nPeople look at that and say,\noh wel,l that guy's wearing a tie so\n\n144\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.720\nhe must be someone in authority.\n\n145\n00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.120\nBecause people in authority wear that tie.\n\n146\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.310\nSo that's just the way it kind of works.\n\n147\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.880\nGo from jeans to a tshirt to a suit.\n\n148\n00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.890\nYeah, it makes you look different.\n\n149\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.340\nYou don't shave.\n\n150\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.350\nWhatever.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n151\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.620\nOh yeah, and that's just human nature.\n\n152\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.480\n>> You'll look like that.\n\n153\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.435\nNot that, but that right there.\n\n154\n00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:56.720\n>> [LAUGH] Can you tell I haven't shaved?\n\n155\n00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.302\n>> Yeah, Yeah I see.\n\n156\n00:08:57.302 --> 00:09:01.190\n>> [LAUGH] But yeah it is\n>> It's surprisingly easy to do\n\n157\n00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.350\nwith a little bit of practice.\n\n158\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.250\nYou know,\nif you're going to be a pen tester,\n\n159\n00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.500\nsocial engineering has\nto be in your tool bag.\n\n160\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.240\nYou have to be able to do that,\nbecause a lot of times, that's that\n\n161\n00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.100\nfirst step on getting information, as you\nsaid, maybe gaining access to a system or\n\n162\n00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.830\nthe passwords, or\nlearning policies, you know?\n\n163\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.110\nIt's those stories like you see\nthat every afternoon after work,\n\n164\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.370\nyou're scoping this business out,\nthey walk across the street and\n\n165\n00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.000\nthey go sit down at the local pub and\ngrub place there.\n\n166\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.020\nAnd so you see that happen everyday, so\none day you go into that same place and\n\n167\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.580\nyou sit up at the bar and what have you,\nand you know they're going to come in\n\n168\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.780\nright behind you because\nyou've watched them, right.\n\n169\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.600\nAnd then they get there and\nyou strike up conversation.\n\n170\n00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.180\nYou say,\noh you know it's my job is horrible.\n\n171\n00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.500\nWe gotta change our\npassword every 45 days.\n\n172\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.190\nIt's gotta be eight characters long, and\n\n173\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.450\nthen they remember the last\nfive passwords I've used.\n\n174\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.460\nI hate it.\n\n175\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.650\nAnd one of those guys pipes up and\nsays, that's really not that bad dude.\n\n176\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.010\nI mean, I've gotta change my\npassword every 30 days and\n\n177\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.560\nit's gotta be ten characters long and\nthey remember the last 24 passwords.\n\n178\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.440\nOh, that's horrible, I can't\nbelieve you gotta put up with that.\n\n179\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.760\nI just figured out what their password\npolicy is at that company, right?\n\n180\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.930\nThose are the kind of things you\ncan get with social engineering,\n\n181\n00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.620\njust tricking people.\n\n182\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.450\nHe didn't even realize that he was\ngiving up his company's security policy.\n\n183\n00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.270\n>> You know what else I\ntake away from that story?\n\n184\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.670\nEveryone in that story is a dude.\n\n185\n00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:26.562\nBecause that's what dude's do.\n\n186\n00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:27.642\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You think that's bad,\n\n187\n00:10:27.642 --> 00:10:28.321\nthat ain't nothing.\n\n188\n00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:32.050\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] That's\na bunch of guys right there.\n\n189\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.351\nJust letting you in on that.\n\n190\n00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:35.180\nThe women that are in there.\n\n191\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.620\nThat's what we do.\n\n192\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.580\nWe have to upstage on another.\n\n193\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.505\nThat's how we talked when\nwe go out to the bars.\n\n194\n00:10:40.505 --> 00:10:41.800\n[LAUGH]\n>> Like what, yeah.\n\n195\n00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.460\nYou know, you got the last five,\nthe last ten.\n\n196\n00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.750\nOh, I can I remember everything back to\nlike '72 or something like that, you know.\n\n197\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.930\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, business cards has\nbeen points out in the chatroom.\n\n198\n00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.460\nHaving different service uniforms.\n\n199\n00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.330\nHeck, you can go down to some of these\nclothing stores, used clothing stores,\n\n200\n00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.680\nand find old service uniforms, stitch\na different tag on there or whatever.\n\n201\n00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.005\nAnd you'd be surprised with how far\nyou ca go with just a simple shirt.\n\n202\n00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:08.725\nYeah, it doesn't take much.\n\n203\n00:11:08.725 --> 00:11:14.625\nIn fact that was what the guy that\nwas in that bank, that's what he did.\n\n204\n00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:20.287\nHe got a button down shirt and actually\nput on one of those little card or\n\n205\n00:11:20.287 --> 00:11:24.707\nID badges, something you can get\nat Staples for next to nothing.\n\n206\n00:11:24.707 --> 00:11:28.177\nGot it, stuck it in there, and\nboom you're that person now.\n\n207\n00:11:28.177 --> 00:11:32.017\nYou've got the ID badge, I mean how\nmany times do you see that guidance too.\n\n208\n00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:35.747\nYou look, you see someone with a nametag\non them, oh well they're cool.\n\n209\n00:11:35.747 --> 00:11:39.297\nWell I can get a nametag pretty easily,\nit's not necessarily\n\n210\n00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:44.220\nsomething that's really says that\nyou are an authority or whatever.\n\n211\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:49.230\nIt's just a lot of interesting things,\nand there's so many\n\n212\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.880\nbooks and things written on how\nsocial engineering takes place.\n\n213\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.830\nAnd you'll learn a lot of things\nabout human nature that you\n\n214\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.210\njust didn't realize Is actually there.\n\n215\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.650\nYou may have seen it your whole life,\nand just,\n\n216\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.330\nit's one of those things that your brain\njust doesn't pay attention to anymore.\n\n217\n00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.100\nJust tunes it out, or\nthinks it's just incidental.\n\n218\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.590\nBut, when you look at it in\ndifferent light, you're like,\n\n219\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.350\noh well that does indicate something.\n\n220\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.740\nYou know, there's all sorts of little\nthings people do with the way they act and\n\n221\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.290\ntalk, you name it.\n\n222\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:34.380\nI mean, heck, I think of this stuff\nlike poker games, people have a tell.\n\n223\n00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.360\nPeople have these little\nnervous habits that they do.\n\n224\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.160\nAnd everyone has some sort of nervous\n\n225\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.170\nlittle habit that they do even if\nthey say yeah, I dont have it.\n\n226\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.710\nYeah you've got one, it just,\n\n227\n00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.060\nwait till the next time you're nervous\ni'll see something that you're doing,\n\n228\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.040\neither it's the tapping your foot or\nthe way you're moving your fingers or\n\n229\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.095\nchewing your fingernails or\npicking your nose, or whatever.\n\n230\n00:12:55.095 --> 00:12:57.215\nThose are all things I do just in case.\n\n231\n00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:59.485\nI like to have several just so\nI can rotate.\n\n232\n00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.441\n>> Mom's gonna get you on that one.\n\n233\n00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:04.203\nYou know, Thomas in the chatroom,\nposted another one out there.\n\n234\n00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:07.520\nYou've got a job interview,\na reverse interview right?\n\n235\n00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.160\nYou may very well go in and\ntake an interview, right?\n\n236\n00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.120\nApply for a job and\nall your doing is fishing for information.\n\n237\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.290\nThat guy's telling,\nhe's sitting there telling you,\n\n238\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.200\nthe interviewer is telling you that we\nneed somebody that can support this and\n\n239\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.820\ncan support this, and we run this on so\nmany systems and blah, blah.\n\n240\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.800\nHe's describing his whole network to you.\n\n241\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.580\nAnd you could just be making notes and\ntaking that home and\n\n242\n00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.820\ntaking advantage of it.\n\n243\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.440\nSo lots of different ways you can gather\ninformation through social engineering.\n\n244\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.660\nNow the social engineering tool\nkit is one that what, John,\n\n245\n00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.470\nhelps us build the back story.\n\n246\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.920\nWhat all does it allow us to do,\nbecause really social engineering is\n\n247\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.530\nusually not so much an electronic attack,\nso what can they do for us?\n\n248\n00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.610\n>> Yeah, it's one of those things that if\nyou're gonna use the digital world to help\n\n249\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.550\nyou as part of social engineering attack,\nit's the delivery mechanism,\n\n250\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:02.880\nit's not the actual payload,\nI guess is really the way to put it.\n\n251\n00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.930\nYou could use email to\ndo a phishing attack.\n\n252\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.530\nBut what you've done is in the body\nof the email you constructed that\n\n253\n00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.280\nemail with links and\nall that to look convincing.\n\n254\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.780\nYou're using email as the delivery\nmechanism for it to get it in their face,\n\n255\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:25.790\nand then that email is constructed in\nsuch a way that, oh it gains their trust.\n\n256\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:31.420\nThey look at it and see it's from a bank\nor It's from so and so, or whatever.\n\n257\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.060\nWe see that.\n\n258\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.350\nYou see with email, even if they're\nnot doing a phishing email, directly,\n\n259\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.450\nwhere they're saying oh your bank's\ngotta have its whatever reset.\n\n260\n00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.250\nIt could be something that\npreys on people's morals for\n\n261\n00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.460\na lot, or moral obligation.\n\n262\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.070\nI mean a lot of us have seen those\nemails where they send something out and\n\n263\n00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.250\nthey send an email to you saying that so\nand so has been stuck\n\n264\n00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:59.550\nin a certain country, needs this amount\nof money for you to help them out.\n\n265\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.720\nAnd some people will send money out\nthere because they want to help.\n\n266\n00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.010\nYou know, a fellow human being, and\nunfortunately while they want to help\n\n267\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.950\na fellow human being, that person's out\nthere trying to scam that individual.\n\n268\n00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.060\nSo you see just those sorts of things, and\n\n269\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.390\nthen you see other ones that\nare that are digitally based, but\n\n270\n00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:25.550\nagain there's using people's sense of\nwanting to help and do the right thing.\n\n271\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.898\nAnd you think of whenever a major\ndisaster hits, you pick one,\n\n272\n00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:34.164\nevery major disaster that hits,\nthere's, in short order,\n\n273\n00:15:34.164 --> 00:15:39.765\nbeen a campaign of e-mails coming out that\nsay, to help the victims of all that.\n\n274\n00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:44.561\nSo people wanna donate money, they see\nan easy way to do that, and boom, they're\n\n275\n00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:49.220\ngiving their money to someone that has\nnothing to do with that charity, nothing\n\n276\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.836\nto do with that cleanup, and is gonna\ndisappear with whatever cash they have.\n\n277\n00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:54.461\n>> Mm-huh.\n\n278\n00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:59.429\n>> So, So that's where it kinda comes in\nis that you're using technologies as its\n\n279\n00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:04.710\ndelivery mechanism, and you're using all\nthose things that we just talked about.\n\n280\n00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.190\nYou're building various mixtures\nof those into the digital world\n\n281\n00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.960\nto send out to people to\nget a desired result.\n\n282\n00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:17.100\nSo social engineering toolkit is\nsomething that is there to help you\n\n283\n00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.700\nreally kinda construct a campaign to\nbe able to do social engineering.\n\n284\n00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.290\n>> Okay.\n\n285\n00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.100\nVery good.\nVery good.\n\n286\n00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.500\nWell, shall we take a look at it, then?\n\n287\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.790\n>> Yeah, we can take a look at it.\n\n288\n00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:32.470\nYou'll see the Social Engineering Toolkit\nis a simple, menu-driven thing.\n\n289\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.820\nIt's a command line stuff.\n\n290\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.080\nThat's about as much as\na GUI you're gonna get.\n\n291\n00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.640\nSo it kinda counts.\n\n292\n00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.860\nBut what we have as you can see,\nthe menu that we have sitting down there.\n\n293\n00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.400\nThere's really the options that we have,\njust to kinda point some stuff out here.\n\n294\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.940\nSome of the options, six,\nthat's your help part of it.\n\n295\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.190\nWhen you look at four it says,\nUpdate the Social-engineer Toolkit.\n\n296\n00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.230\nThat's not really useful to you.\n\n297\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.210\nThe reason why I say four is not useful to\nyou is that gets update during the normal\n\n298\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.880\nupdates of Kali anyway, so if you tried to\nuse that it just says well that's already\n\n299\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.700\ndone someplace else and\nit kicks you back to the main menu.\n\n300\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.510\nAnyway, we'll take a look at\nsome of the things in here.\n\n301\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.810\nI will just go ahead to kind of\ngive you a peak of what's going on.\n\n302\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:29.280\nIs if we go to our first option on\nthe menu of social engineering attacks.\n\n303\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.940\nSo I say well, that looks good.\n\n304\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.700\nI wanna do social engineering attacks.\n\n305\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.490\nSo you hit one and what happens is it\nbrings up a submenu in here saying\n\n306\n00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.960\nhere's the things that we\nhave available to you.\n\n307\n00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.400\nIs that you've got these other\ntypes of attacks you can pull off,\n\n308\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.340\nso let's just say when we look through it,\nwe want to do a spear fishing attack.\n\n309\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.610\nSo I will go ahead and hit one on that and\n\n310\n00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.900\nit says okay well, this is kind\nof the options in here and yeah,\n\n311\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.460\nmy screen since it's a little smaller\ntells you this is what it can actually do.\n\n312\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.930\nNow this one has kind of got some,\nit's kind of\n\n313\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.760\nreally weird the way it's\nwrapped around on there.\n\n314\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.980\nBut what I can do,\nit says I can perform a mass email attack.\n\n315\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.380\nSo it's asking me, you want to do\na phishing with this type as a mass email.\n\n316\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.730\nI'll go ahead and do that.\n\n317\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.170\nAnd it starts asking me other stuff.\n\n318\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.990\nThe way you want to embed\nstuff in that email, so\n\n319\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.470\nyou can choose stuff off this list.\n\n320\n00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.130\nLook at the type of things you can\nuse to [LAUGH] carry that out.\n\n321\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.820\nThat's a pretty broad amount of things.\n\n322\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:46.040\nBut for overflow stuff in there, just\na bunch of different things you can use.\n\n323\n00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.910\nI can just choose one off the list.\n\n324\n00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.120\nAnd no particular type of thing.\n\n325\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.900\nI'll just choose 14 off that list.\n\n326\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.525\nAnd it just keeps going through on\nhow you want to construct this.\n\n327\n00:18:58.525 --> 00:18:59.985\nHere's saying what else to you want?\n\n328\n00:18:59.985 --> 00:19:01.900\nDo you want to have it\nopen a reverse shell out?\n\n329\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.105\nOkay, I'll open a reverse\nshell out of there.\n\n330\n00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:07.655\nAnd you can just keep\npopulating this stuff.\n\n331\n00:19:07.655 --> 00:19:11.625\nAnd I didn't really have\na specific rhyme or reason\n\n332\n00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:15.100\nto be honest with the combination of stuff\nI put together just to kind of show you.\n\n333\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.540\nYou just choose something off this menu.\n\n334\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.440\nIt takes you to the next one.\n\n335\n00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.880\nYou choose something off there, and\nit's snapping those components together to\n\n336\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.290\nactually make your attack to craft if for\nyou.\n\n337\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.050\nNow you don't necessarily have to get, and\n\n338\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.600\nI'll just start dropping\nan IP address in there.\n\n339\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.930\nI'll drop my loop back just for\nsafety reasons.\n\n340\n00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.050\nSo you can see in here it's generating\n\n341\n00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.960\nthe actual tag from the input\nthat I put together.\n\n342\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.680\nOkay, boom.\n\n343\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.800\nIt went ahead and\nit's failing on a couple things because\n\n344\n00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.190\nI'm putting it back to my machine I don't\nwant to go anyplace, I'm playing it safe.\n\n345\n00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:02.736\nSo I'll do test.txt,\nthat's where I'm going to save this.\n\n346\n00:20:02.736 --> 00:20:07.980\nAnd, okay, it wants an attachment so\nI don't have an attachment ready for this.\n\n347\n00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.750\nBut [COUGH].\n\n348\n00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.530\n>> It's saying,\nin one of the methods you chose then so\n\n349\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.330\nyou need a file that it's\ngoing to attach something to.\n\n350\n00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.280\n>> Yeah, so I don't have one in here,\nso it's asking for\n\n351\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.580\nan attachment to put on there.\n\n352\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.060\nSo I could start going to, if I had\nan attachment ready to send out this\n\n353\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.380\nemail maybe like a script or\nsomething, I can go ahead and do that.\n\n354\n00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.740\nBut I don't have that ready.\n\n355\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.220\nI think I've got,\nit should be in my Home folder.\n\n356\n00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.960\nI should have, let's see if I can\njust attach one of the ones in here.\n\n357\n00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.550\nI'll just do a sean.txt.\n\n358\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.090\nOkay, it doesn't wanna do that one either.\n\n359\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.960\nIt put me in a little\nbit of a corner here.\n\n360\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.960\nIn fact, I'll just go ahead and\ngo back here.\n\n361\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.610\nBut that was just creating one attack, so\n\n362\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.180\nyou can kind of get the idea\nof what it was doing.\n\n363\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.850\nBut it also has, you can look at.\n\n364\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:07.070\nOption two,\nit's also got the same type of stuff.\n\n365\n00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.980\nIt doesn't go into as much\ndetail as option one does,\n\n366\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.590\noption one said, craft a campaign.\n\n367\n00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.510\nYou saw how many options it had,\nwe were really going to town on that and\n\n368\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:22.210\nthere would have been a lot more,\na lot more things actually happening.\n\n369\n00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.510\nBut what I've got here is I can see,\nwell, what do you wanna do?\n\n370\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.800\nIt has stuff already created for you.\n\n371\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.220\nI can say I wanna do stuff with SQL.\n\n372\n00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.370\nHit Enter on that.\n\n373\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.820\nHow do you want it to go through and\nlook for stuff with SQL?\n\n374\n00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.350\nSo I'm just stepping through some stuff,\nlike I said, kind of quickly to show you\n\n375\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:45.680\nthe way the options you know,\nactually work in the way it does its job.\n\n376\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.520\nAnd you just, all you have to do is\nprovide your input if you've done your\n\n377\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.260\nrecon and all that, this should\nall be really easy for you to do.\n\n378\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.931\nI just hit enter a bunch of times so\n\n379\n00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:59.573\nit went through and said okay well I\ncan't find a SQL server for this one,\n\n380\n00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:02.577\nwell yeah there's no SQL server\npresent anywhere in here.\n\n381\n00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:05.630\nSo obviously I would expect that.\n\n382\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.090\nBut you can see that, in this case, well,\n\n383\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.100\nyou tell it what you want to do, the type\nof attack, you put your IP addresses in,\n\n384\n00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:18.460\nand it just wraps everything around that\nto create an attack based off of that.\n\n385\n00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:25.800\nAnd this, you actually can create\na template that it can use, too.\n\n386\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.290\nSo if you don't like the standard\ntemplates that are in there.\n\n387\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:32.370\nThis is all documented you can\nactually create your own templates and\n\n388\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.550\ndrop it in the social\nengineering toolkit and\n\n389\n00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.080\nit will create a campaign based\naround those templates too.\n\n390\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:37.620\n>> Nice.\n\n391\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.150\n>> Yeah so.\n>> You expand your own menus and\n\n392\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.120\nadd other options to it.\n\n393\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.620\n>> Oh yeah, in fact if you look, if I go\nback to the main menu, if I do 99 on here.\n\n394\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.690\nYou can see for option three,\nit's got third party modules.\n\n395\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.230\nIf I click on that,\n\n396\n00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.610\nwell, I don't really have any of that\nmuch in the way of third party modules.\n\n397\n00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.260\nThere's really only a couple in there.\n\n398\n00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.710\nBut remote administration tool.\n\n399\n00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.500\nYou can see it's got a couple remote\nadministration tools in there.\n\n400\n00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.520\nThat's kinda neat.\n\n401\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.190\n>> Absolutely.\n\n402\n00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.860\n>> You could construct a campaign and\nwith these third party modules,\n\n403\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.359\nyou can attach these or embed these\ninto an email and send them to someone.\n\n404\n00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.414\nAnd they get tricked into\nrunning the thing, and\n\n405\n00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:26.482\nall of a sudden they've opened up a back\ndoor on the system that you can now go in.\n\n406\n00:23:26.482 --> 00:23:28.780\n>> Wow, that's impressive.\n\n407\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.780\nI was curious to see what the tool\nwas going to be able to do for me.\n\n408\n00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.330\nIn my mind I was thinking,\nsocial engineering,\n\n409\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.550\nhow can a tool help me do that?\n\n410\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.960\nI've gotta be able to\nsmooth talk somebody or\n\n411\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.870\nI've gotta be able to do some\ntype of technique like that.\n\n412\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.050\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\n413\n00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.020\nReally I could see where\nthat could really pay off.\n\n414\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.760\n>> Yeah, this is just king of a quick and\nrough look at it.\n\n415\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.506\nWe don't really have a specific campaign\nin mind when we were doing this.\n\n416\n00:23:54.506 --> 00:23:59.342\nBut to just kinda show you, you can go\nthrough these menus and you can start\n\n417\n00:23:59.342 --> 00:24:04.646\nChoosing the stuff off there and snapping\ntogether the pieces to make an attack,\n\n418\n00:24:04.646 --> 00:24:08.797\nand come out with a pretty decent\nattack in pretty short order.\n\n419\n00:24:08.797 --> 00:24:10.521\nAnd other people do write modules for\nthis.\n\n420\n00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:13.977\nThere's all sorts of scripting stuff\nbehind this that you can plug into it.\n\n421\n00:24:13.977 --> 00:24:17.241\nAnd so\nyou could create your own modules or\n\n422\n00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:21.914\nget something from someone\nelse to really customize this.\n\n423\n00:24:21.914 --> 00:24:23.237\nSo it's really kind of a neat thing.\n\n424\n00:24:23.237 --> 00:24:25.244\nYou even look at it,\nwe're running this on Linux.\n\n425\n00:24:25.244 --> 00:24:27.961\nIt even has stuff for PowerShell on it.\n\n426\n00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:32.527\nIt's got the capability of\nexploiting PowerShell so\n\n427\n00:24:32.527 --> 00:24:37.810\nwe can deploy this to Windows and\nget it to do stuff over there.\n\n428\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.710\n>> I'm dying to dive into\nthat QR code generator, man.\n\n429\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.625\nWho can resist?\n\n430\n00:24:41.625 --> 00:24:43.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Scanning your QR code, it's like, oh,\n\n431\n00:24:43.818 --> 00:24:46.100\nI gotta see what that's gonna get me.\n\n432\n00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.325\n[LAUGH] That's the first one I'm\ndiving into when I come home tonight.\n\n433\n00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:50.044\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n434\n00:24:50.044 --> 00:24:54.184\nyou can imagine the types of fun and\ngames you can have with stuff like that,\n\n435\n00:24:54.184 --> 00:24:57.941\nI guess, when you really play around\nwith it there's just so much.\n\n436\n00:24:57.941 --> 00:25:01.792\nI mean, you can even see on there,\nthere's stuff for\n\n437\n00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:05.480\ndoing attacking wireless and\nall that good stuff.\n\n438\n00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.790\nSo it's just a really kind of a neat\nthing for you to add to your tool kit.\n\n439\n00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.704\nAnd I would encourage all of you just to\nstart to play with this type of thing,\n\n440\n00:25:14.704 --> 00:25:16.184\nto see what it can do for you.\n\n441\n00:25:16.184 --> 00:25:19.910\nYeah, you can do the QR\ncodes if you wanna do that.\n\n442\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:25.230\nBut then there's plenty of other stuff\nin here as well that you can really\n\n443\n00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.810\ngo to town with and\ndo some really neat stuff.\n\n444\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.490\n>> That's very impressive.\n\n445\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.920\nWell, I tell you what ladies and\ngentlemen,\n\n446\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.470\njust when you thought you couldn't learn\nanything more about social engineering,\n\n447\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.190\nbam, there you go.\n\n448\n00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:41.020\nThere's a whole tool built into Kali to\nhelp you get better social engineering.\n\n449\n00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.690\nAnd I'm not saying you should go out and\nsocial engineer everybody,\n\n450\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.770\nbut as a penetration tester,\nthis has to be in my toolkit.\n\n451\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.694\nI have to be able to perform these tests.\n\n452\n00:25:48.694 --> 00:25:53.309\nIf I'm gonna do a true penetration test\nagainst an organization I guess I'm\n\n453\n00:25:53.309 --> 00:25:56.784\ndoing all of my network based tests and\nthings like that.\n\n454\n00:25:56.784 --> 00:25:59.796\nI've gotta test their\nemployees just as much though,\n\n455\n00:25:59.796 --> 00:26:02.097\nbecause they are one of the weaker links.\n\n456\n00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:05.756\nAnd that company could have everything\nnice and secure on that network.\n\n457\n00:26:05.756 --> 00:26:10.020\nIt just takes one human that hasn't\nbeen trained properly to fall victim to\n\n458\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.027\na social engineering attack and\nblow holes wide open in their system.\n\n459\n00:26:14.027 --> 00:26:20.464\nSo it has to be a part of your\npenetration testing process, right?\n\n460\n00:26:20.464 --> 00:26:22.650\nIs doing that social engineering.\n\n461\n00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.178\nSo here is a way that you can practice,\nget a little better, learn new tips and\n\n462\n00:26:27.178 --> 00:26:29.561\ntricks on how to do social engineering.\n\n463\n00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:30.977\n>> Very impressive.\n\n464\n00:26:30.977 --> 00:26:34.590\n>> All right, well Sean, anything else we\nwant to throw in for social engineering?\n\n465\n00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.588\nThat was a lot of good info.\n\n466\n00:26:35.588 --> 00:26:37.220\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of things.\n\n467\n00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.444\nFirst of all, I am recommending that\nyou go out and social engineering and\n\n468\n00:26:40.444 --> 00:26:41.122\ntrick people.\n\n469\n00:26:41.122 --> 00:26:42.468\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't care what he says.\n\n470\n00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:45.022\nI'm saying do it for fun and profit.\n\n471\n00:26:45.022 --> 00:26:46.300\nThat's how you learn.\n\n472\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.164\nAnd so there's that, and the other one,\nyou keep saying the weakest link.\n\n473\n00:26:50.164 --> 00:26:53.337\nI think we need to get that British\nlady does that game show to do that.\n\n474\n00:26:53.337 --> 00:26:56.565\nWe need to dub that in after,\nthe weakest link.\n\n475\n00:26:56.565 --> 00:26:58.329\n>> You are, the weakest link.\n\n476\n00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:00.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We need that to happen.\n\n477\n00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.600\nI want that to happen.\n\n478\n00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.756\n>> And then all of sudden a hole opens\nup under my feet and I disappear.\n\n479\n00:27:04.756 --> 00:27:08.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n480\n00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.559\nWell ladies and\n\n481\n00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:11.092\ngentlemen we hope you enjoyed watching\nthis show on social engineering.\n\n482\n00:27:11.092 --> 00:27:13.925\nI know we had a blast filming it for ya.\n\n483\n00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:15.780\nBut that's going to do it for today.\n\n484\n00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.584\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n485\n00:27:18.584 --> 00:27:20.030\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n486\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.207\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n487\n00:27:21.207 --> 00:27:27.340\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:16.670\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.010\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.900\n>> I'm doing all right.\n\n6\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.690\n>> Doing all right?\n\n7\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.260\nAll right.\nIt's Thursday here.\n\n8\n00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.340\nWe're doing okay.\n\n9\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.432\nNo, we're excited.\n\n10\n00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:26.271\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've got another great episode coming\n\n11\n00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:28.340\nyour way for our Kali Linux series.\n\n12\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.530\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be looking\nat web servers and web applications.\n\n13\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.880\nThese are prime targets for\nthe bad guys or the hackers,\n\n14\n00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.980\ncuz they're typically our public\nexposure for most organizations.\n\n15\n00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.850\nAnd as a pen tester, these are the kinda\nthings that we've gotta test, right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.980\nWe've gotta figure out how the bad\nguys are gonna try to get in, so\n\n17\n00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.650\nwe've gotta be aware of\nall the tools we can use,\n\n18\n00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.700\nthat we can bring to bear\nagainst those kinda things.\n\n19\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.480\nSo Sean, I guess we should probably\nstart out just talking about\n\n20\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.490\nweb servers in general and\nthe way we interact with them normally,\n\n21\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.320\nthe way with our client\nserver type relationship.\n\n22\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.270\n>> Yes.\n\n23\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.360\nJust to make sure, again, we're all on the\nsame page with what the situation is here,\n\n24\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.730\nwhen we talk about web applications,\n\n25\n00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.220\nwe really wanna kind of get\na handle on the environment,\n\n26\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.960\nso we can understand the tools and\nhow they're gonna be brought to bear, and\n\n27\n00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.730\nwe can understand what they're expected\nto do and what they're gonna look for.\n\n28\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.740\nSo to get things started we talk\nabout a web application we're\n\n29\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.960\ntalking about something\nthat's getting processed or\n\n30\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.740\ndoing its activity on the web\nserver itself or on that machine.\n\n31\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.940\nSo, when we look at that machine,\nwe have of course the operating system,\n\n32\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.142\nplus the web server,\nplus whatever application modules\n\n33\n00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.297\nthat make that application\nwork sitting on top of that.\n\n34\n00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:49.530\nAnd all that comes together to be the web\napplication in its simplest form.\n\n35\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.590\nI know I may be oversimplifying that\nbecause if you look at some of the more\n\n36\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.380\ncomplex web applications, they can\nhave a front end, a middle tier and\n\n37\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.800\na back end, and those things can all be\nspread out amongst multiple components.\n\n38\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.220\nYou can have databases brought into bear,\n\n39\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.620\nyou could have all these\ndifferent things coming into play.\n\n40\n00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.960\nBut its most basic form is just gonna be\nthe operating system with the web server\n\n41\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.885\nand a web application\nstacked on top of it.\n\n42\n00:02:16.885 --> 00:02:20.555\nNow what the web application does\nis really kind of varied and\n\n43\n00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:25.645\nthat's one of the things that\nmakes this area kind of tough.\n\n44\n00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.545\nTo really just cover everything\nin a setting like this.\n\n45\n00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:34.515\nWe can talk about web applications in\ngeneral we definitely are going to take\n\n46\n00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:37.850\na look at some of the various\ntools that are available\n\n47\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.990\nright here in Kali to help you with that.\n\n48\n00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.780\nBut to really do a full-blown and\nreally usable assessment,\n\n49\n00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.880\nyou're going to have to have an\nunderstanding of your specific situation\n\n50\n00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.990\nand your specific web application.\n\n51\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.154\nSo, that's kind of telling\nof us what we can do,\n\n52\n00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:56.560\nwhat type of environment we're going into.\n\n53\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.010\n>> Yeah, so there's a lot of\ndifferent possibilities right?\n\n54\n00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.110\nDifferent web servers that could be\nrunning, I think IAS, Apache, and\n\n55\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.930\nI know I'm missing a few there.\n\n56\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.350\nAnd then different applications\nthat are running on top of that.\n\n57\n00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.020\nCustom made, off the shelf products.\n\n58\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.740\nAs you said, they could be multi-tier or\nyour n-tier setups,\n\n59\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.160\nwhere they've got the data actually\nresiding somewhere else on the network.\n\n60\n00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.510\nOr it could be a very simple setup.\n\n61\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.790\nCould be a farm, could be load balancing.\n\n62\n00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.580\nSo there's a lot of different possible\nconfigurations where we talk about\n\n63\n00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.440\ntrying to hit a web server\nwith web application.\n\n64\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.355\nBut then there are some things that\nare kind of common to the whole,\n\n65\n00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:33.145\nno matter how it's set up, right?\n\n66\n00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:36.065\nIt's listening on certain ports,\nit's got certain things that are open,\n\n67\n00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:37.065\ncertain things that it's doing,\n\n68\n00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.485\nso there are some commonalities that\nwe can kind of take a look at then.\n\n69\n00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:41.465\n>> Yes, and\n\n70\n00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:45.325\nthat's kind of some of the stuff we\ncan take a look at here, but yeah,\n\n71\n00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:48.405\nthere are gonna be things that are gonna\nbe unique to each specific environment.\n\n72\n00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:52.785\nThings like cross site scripting,\nproblems with forms,\n\n73\n00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:56.000\nand all sorts of little things.\n\n74\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.475\nWell, we even talked about\nthings like session hijacking.\n\n75\n00:03:58.475 --> 00:04:01.690\nStuff like that can be done\nat the application level.\n\n76\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.920\nAnd that means we're talking web\nserver slash web applications.\n\n77\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.340\nSo, some of those things\nwill go across the board.\n\n78\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.960\nAnd be issues with really any technology\nyou get into on the web application side.\n\n79\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.250\nBut there are specifics that\nreally require that you have that\n\n80\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.500\nfine grain knowledge or in depth\nknowledge of that specific environment.\n\n81\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.140\nI can sit here and say well, here is\nthis specific tool targeting SharePoint,\n\n82\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.950\nbut, why it's targeting SharePoint,\nif I don't know every detail\n\n83\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.200\nabout SharePoint and really understand it,\nit's just a bunch of things on a screen.\n\n84\n00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.696\nAnd you know it sounds like,\njust learn about SharePoint.\n\n85\n00:04:40.696 --> 00:04:46.880\nOkay, well I'll say it's easy\njust to make it simple but\n\n86\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.580\nthat would be the easy thing to do.\n\n87\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.420\nOkay, learn SharePoint.\n\n88\n00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.210\nOkay, but that covers one web application.\n\n89\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.610\nHow many different web\napplications do we have?\n\n90\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.960\nJust tons of different ones.\n\n91\n00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.350\nIt's unlike networking,\nsome of these other technologies.\n\n92\n00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.620\nNetworking, you can configure it in many,\nmany different ways, but there's so\n\n93\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.960\nmuch that's carried across and\ncommon amongst all of those that, yeah,\n\n94\n00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.460\nyou'll have to figure out different\nthings in that environment.\n\n95\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.300\nBut it's not something that someone\nthat knows networking technology\n\n96\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.820\ncan't just walk into and kind of do\nan analysis, and figure things out.\n\n97\n00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.750\nWe do have to keep that in mind and\n\n98\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.150\nthere's even the programming\ntechnologies that come in to bear too.\n\n99\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.000\nIf you learn something like SharePoint,\nfine, but what if someone's customized it?\n\n100\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.504\nWhat if they've brought\nall that into play?\n\n101\n00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:39.630\nNow that opens up another can of\nworms that you've gotta get into.\n\n102\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.240\nSo, what we're going to take a look\nat are the tools that can help you\n\n103\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.990\nget this information?\n\n104\n00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.520\nBut, you're still going to have\nto do your homework on that side.\n\n105\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.780\n>> Right, and then you got to also think\nabout whether we're using that tool\n\n106\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.165\nthat is targeting the web server itself.\n\n107\n00:05:56.165 --> 00:06:00.010\nVersus an application that's\nrunning on that web server,\n\n108\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.400\ncuz that's gonna make web\nservers have vulnerabilities.\n\n109\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.100\nLike IAS itself or Apache itself.\n\n110\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.200\nOr then it could be, as you're saying, the\napplication that's running on top of that.\n\n111\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.970\nAnd then depending on what scripting\nlanguage they might be using if they're\n\n112\n00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.150\nusing one at all.\n\n113\n00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.280\nThat can change our angle of attack or\nthe tools we use.\n\n114\n00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.390\nWhether everything's based on PHP, or\nwhether they're using MySQL versus SQL.\n\n115\n00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.800\nSo, a lot of variations.\n\n116\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.800\nAnd so it's one of those areas where you\nreally just got to get in and play and\n\n117\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.540\ntry things and do things.\n\n118\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.290\nThat's where fingerprinting\nI think comes back.\n\n119\n00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.940\nA lot of that information that we gathered\nway back in one of our first phases,\n\n120\n00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.610\nour reconnaissance phase, right.\n\n121\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.980\nThat's gonna help me in this part,\nbecause now I know, hopefully,\n\n122\n00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.140\nwhat they're running as\nan underlying operating system.\n\n123\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.820\nWhat version of a web server\napplication they're running.\n\n124\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.330\nIf they're running IAS or\n\n125\n00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.090\nApache and what scripting language maybe\nthat they're using and things like that.\n\n126\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.750\nAll of that can come back into this\nphase and really help us out, right?\n\n127\n00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.530\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n128\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.690\nThere's so much of the stuff that's gonna\ncome from previous phases are gonna be\n\n129\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.990\ncarried over into this.\n\n130\n00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.240\nA lot of the tools that we've used.\n\n131\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.540\nIf you have been saving that information,\nwhich hopefully, if you're doing this\n\n132\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.750\nin a live environment,\nthat you are indeed saving that or\n\n133\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.120\ndocumenting it, because that's\ngonna come into play big time.\n\n134\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.055\nSo, just make sure when\nyou're doing the slide\n\n135\n00:07:22.055 --> 00:07:25.235\nthat you're keeping track of all that.\n\n136\n00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:27.855\nNo need to go through and\nsay, well, what did I forget?\n\n137\n00:07:27.855 --> 00:07:30.685\nI think there was something\nthat I remember getting before.\n\n138\n00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:33.735\nSo now you gotta go through all\nyour tests and see where that was.\n\n139\n00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:35.625\nLet's not do that.\n\n140\n00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:38.105\nLet's make sure we're getting\neverything clearly documented.\n\n141\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.670\nJust make it a habit.\n\n142\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.460\n>> So we talk about the client-server\nrelationship that we have\n\n143\n00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.460\nwith these web servers and\nthese web applications, Sean, and\n\n144\n00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.570\nwe're talking about we're\nbeing the client, right?\n\n145\n00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.710\nWe're consuming a service,\nor using a service.\n\n146\n00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.610\nThat web server is the server side of that\nrelationship, it's presenting information,\n\n147\n00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.195\nor providing a service\nthat we're consuming.\n\n148\n00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:04.924\nA lot of times the code is executed\non a web server itself, or\n\n149\n00:08:04.924 --> 00:08:08.291\nmaybe on a On an end tier\nsystem behind the web server.\n\n150\n00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:11.275\nSometimes though,\ncode is executed on the client machine,\n\n151\n00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:13.623\nreally depending on how\nthey've got it setup.\n\n152\n00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:16.225\n>> Yeah, it can be a mixture of those.\n\n153\n00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:20.643\nYou can have stuff being\nprocessed on the server side.\n\n154\n00:08:20.643 --> 00:08:23.356\nAnd that server can kick out\nsomething to the client,\n\n155\n00:08:23.356 --> 00:08:26.500\nand the client does another\nround of processing on it's end.\n\n156\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.915\nAnd stuff that will be done there.\n\n157\n00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:31.404\nYou could also have it when\nsomeone submits stuff.\n\n158\n00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:35.825\nLet's say that someone requests something\nfrom a web application and it's a form,\n\n159\n00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:36.828\nthey get the form.\n\n160\n00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:39.785\nThey put stuff to populate that form.\n\n161\n00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:40.841\nThey hit Submit.\n\n162\n00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:45.448\nThere could be a client site script\nvalidating that everything in the form is\n\n163\n00:08:45.448 --> 00:08:47.472\nthere and in the correct format.\n\n164\n00:08:47.472 --> 00:08:50.752\nAnd if it's not, it doesn't\nsubmit it back up to the server.\n\n165\n00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:54.701\nIf it is correct, it goes up to the\nserver, and the server may actually say,\n\n166\n00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:58.925\nI'm gonna forward that information because\nnow I have some data I need to store.\n\n167\n00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:03.384\nI'm gonna forward that on to a database\nserver sitting someplace else that's\n\n168\n00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:07.858\ngonna go ahead and keep that all on file,\nso I can do something with it later on.\n\n169\n00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:11.577\n>> Yeah, a lot of times those web\ndesigners, I'm not a web designer, but\n\n170\n00:09:11.577 --> 00:09:13.004\ndabbled in it a little bit,\n\n171\n00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.489\nbut we might try to push some of\nthat execution off onto the client.\n\n172\n00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:18.700\nThat just means less work on my server.\n\n173\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.788\nOther times, it might be things that, I\ndon't know what they've got installed and\n\n174\n00:09:22.788 --> 00:09:24.872\nI could try to put it\non their end of things.\n\n175\n00:09:24.872 --> 00:09:28.776\nBut they might not have the right .NET\nframework or something like that.\n\n176\n00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:31.335\nSo, maybe,\nI need to process it on the server side.\n\n177\n00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:34.718\nAnd then, like you said, typically\nyou are going to see both going on.\n\n178\n00:09:34.718 --> 00:09:37.920\nSome information being processed on\nthe client end of things before it\n\n179\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.568\nis presented to that server, like our\nvalidation checks and things like that.\n\n180\n00:09:41.568 --> 00:09:44.601\nAnd then other stuff being\nprocessed on that server site.\n\n181\n00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:47.459\nSo, a couple of different\nplaces we can look for\n\n182\n00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:50.612\nvulnerabilities or\nplaces we have to test, right?\n\n183\n00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:54.793\n>> Yeah, and what this is all\ngetting towards is that there is so\n\n184\n00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:58.082\nmany places where\nvulnerabilities can pop up.\n\n185\n00:09:58.082 --> 00:10:03.052\nAnd fortunately, what something like\nKali does is it brings in a bunch of\n\n186\n00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:06.973\ntools that can analyze all\nthese different components.\n\n187\n00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:11.910\nWe're just gonna start looking at\nsome of the stuff in this first\n\n188\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.931\npiece we're doing here.\n\n189\n00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:18.165\nWe're talking about what web applications\nare and kind of flushing them out a bit,\n\n190\n00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:21.794\ntrying to give you an overview, or\n[INAUDIBLE] trying to impress upon you\n\n191\n00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:25.786\nalong the way that, yeah, we have these\ntools that can help you find that, and\n\n192\n00:10:25.786 --> 00:10:28.295\ngo through all these little nooks and\ncrannies.\n\n193\n00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:33.128\nBut then, there's other stuff that we're\nnot gonna get to yet, and that's for\n\n194\n00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:35.560\nexample, the SQL stuff in the backend.\n\n195\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.503\nWhat if you have a database there,\n\n196\n00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:41.593\nthose databases are another beast\naltogether that has to be addressed.\n\n197\n00:10:41.593 --> 00:10:45.868\nAnd you can't just say that's\na web application, generically.\n\n198\n00:10:45.868 --> 00:10:48.065\nYou just have to say okay,\nthere's a web application.\n\n199\n00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:51.855\nThat's one thing, but that thing can\nintegrate and connect to a database.\n\n200\n00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:57.107\nAnd so, that having the complexity and\nstuff going on that it does,\n\n201\n00:10:57.107 --> 00:11:00.711\nwe have something else\nwe need to address too.\n\n202\n00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:04.257\nSo, we have to push that\noff to another section to\n\n203\n00:11:04.257 --> 00:11:06.945\nbe able to handle that the right way.\n\n204\n00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:09.033\nSo, just keep that in mind, too.\n\n205\n00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:10.847\nWe've got all these different components.\n\n206\n00:11:10.847 --> 00:11:14.734\nThese tools should all be helping you keep\ntrack of all those little components and\n\n207\n00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:15.478\ntest them all.\n\n208\n00:11:15.478 --> 00:11:20.307\nYou really gotta keep that one in\nmind when you're doing it, and\n\n209\n00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:21.922\nthat's something.\n\n210\n00:11:21.922 --> 00:11:25.498\nI mean, think about this,\nthese tools can also be used for\n\n211\n00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:28.205\nsomeone that's developing these things.\n\n212\n00:11:28.205 --> 00:11:33.144\nThere's nothing saying that these tools\nare limited to just being the person that\n\n213\n00:11:33.144 --> 00:11:37.367\nis a pen tester is gonna use that to\njust analyze an application that's\n\n214\n00:11:37.367 --> 00:11:38.885\nalready been deployed.\n\n215\n00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:43.518\nThis may be the application\ndeveloper themselves saying, okay,\n\n216\n00:11:43.518 --> 00:11:48.647\nI'm going to run one of these tools\nagainst my application that I've just\n\n217\n00:11:48.647 --> 00:11:54.042\nbuilt from the ground up, or what have\nyou, to see if I've missed anything.\n\n218\n00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:57.165\n>> Find it before the bad guys do, or\nbefore I put it in production maybe, or\n\n219\n00:11:57.165 --> 00:11:58.153\nsomething like that.\n\n220\n00:11:58.153 --> 00:12:00.530\n>> Yeah,\nthese are very good testing tools.\n\n221\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.617\nYou'll see a lot of the tools that we're\ngoing to view here today, you'll see\n\n222\n00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:11.110\na lot of these tools, lots will show up on\ndeveloper forums and developer websites.\n\n223\n00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.286\nYou'll see them mentioned as, hey,\n\n224\n00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:17.909\nhere's a framework that you can use to do\nan evaluation of your specific web app to\n\n225\n00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:21.518\nmake sure that there's no little\nnastiness hiding out there.\n\n226\n00:12:21.518 --> 00:12:23.327\nAnd that's a great thing.\n\n227\n00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:26.524\nSo, there is another purpose\nto having these as well.\n\n228\n00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:30.721\nSo, if you have a developer that\nyou're gonna be working with or\n\n229\n00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:35.620\nconsulting with at any point during this,\nthese may be tools that you wanna\n\n230\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.053\ninform them about, so that's\nsomething that they can use as well,\n\n231\n00:12:40.053 --> 00:12:44.928\nto maybe improve and tweak their code\nbefore it gets to you as a pen tester.\n\n232\n00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:49.395\nRemember, the easiest place to address\nsecurity is when you design a system and\n\n233\n00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:50.475\nstart to build it.\n\n234\n00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:53.977\nSo, it's better for\nthem to catch it than for you to catch it.\n\n235\n00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:58.382\nIf you catch stuff, it should be\nstuff that, okay, they missed it.\n\n236\n00:12:58.382 --> 00:13:02.340\nBut, hopefully, it's the ones that\nthey maybe didn't think of, or\n\n237\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.172\nreally high level stuff and\nyou catch those ones.\n\n238\n00:13:05.172 --> 00:13:07.208\nYou should be kind of\na safety check to them.\n\n239\n00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:10.425\nSo, you will see a lot of these\ntools being used by developers.\n\n240\n00:13:10.425 --> 00:13:13.037\nThat's another little\ntricky component here.\n\n241\n00:13:13.037 --> 00:13:16.606\n>> So, again, important that we understand\nthe way this client server relationship\n\n242\n00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:19.464\nworks, because as a pen tester,\nI wanna make sure I'm thorough.\n\n243\n00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:23.359\nI've gotta make sure that, I don't wanna\ngo in and just hit the web server and say,\n\n244\n00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:24.750\noh, everything looks good,\n\n245\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.535\nwhen they had major vulnerabilities in\none of the applications on the server, or\n\n246\n00:13:28.535 --> 00:13:31.010\nwith that backend system,\nor something like that.\n\n247\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.898\nSo, it is important that we understand\nthe way the web server works,\n\n248\n00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:39.187\nthe way the applications interact with\nthat server, the way that server and\n\n249\n00:13:39.187 --> 00:13:43.568\napplications might interact with other\nservers that are storing that data.\n\n250\n00:13:43.568 --> 00:13:44.756\nSo, next on our list.\n\n251\n00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:47.042\nYesterday, we talked about that\nclient server relationship.\n\n252\n00:13:47.042 --> 00:13:50.910\nWe talked about a web application and\nanalyzing an application.\n\n253\n00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.901\nWhat are we doing here, Sean?\n\n254\n00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:57.385\n>> When you analyze a web application, you\nreally want to, once you know that client\n\n255\n00:13:57.385 --> 00:14:01.545\nserver relationship, I would always kind\nof try to get a picture in your mind\n\n256\n00:14:01.545 --> 00:14:05.518\nof what that environment looks like,\nwhat tiers you're dealing with.\n\n257\n00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:09.493\nNow, you will be able to get some of that\njust by doing your earlier assessments,\n\n258\n00:14:09.493 --> 00:14:11.485\nyou'll be able to get a picture of that.\n\n259\n00:14:11.485 --> 00:14:13.775\nWell, hopefully, you never know.\n\n260\n00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:16.855\nBut, hopefully, you're able to get a clear\npicture of how things are laid out.\n\n261\n00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:19.574\nOnce you've got that,\nthen you can start seeing what\n\n262\n00:14:19.574 --> 00:14:22.545\ncomponents you've actually\nhave to go through and test.\n\n263\n00:14:22.545 --> 00:14:26.622\nYou can also start using some of the stuff\nwe touched, for example, the CEH,\n\n264\n00:14:26.622 --> 00:14:30.385\nyou can use those things to see what\nfile types exists up on the server and\n\n265\n00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:33.431\nthat can tell you things about\nthe technologies in play.\n\n266\n00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:37.836\nWe're, of course, assuming, by saying that\nyou can find it out, we're assuming that\n\n267\n00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:41.212\nyou're doing a black box type test,\nthat you have zero knowledge.\n\n268\n00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:46.150\nIf you have a grey box or especially\na white box situation then, heck,\n\n269\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.845\njust ask and they're gonna tell you.\n\n270\n00:14:48.845 --> 00:14:50.531\nBut if you don't have that,\n\n271\n00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:54.548\nthen you're going to have to find\na way to locate that information.\n\n272\n00:14:54.548 --> 00:14:57.768\nFortunately, we've got plenty\nof things that can help us out.\n\n273\n00:14:57.768 --> 00:15:00.865\nMake sure you get what the structure\nof the application is.\n\n274\n00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:03.160\nYou know what operating\nsystems they're running and\n\n275\n00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.517\nwhat that environment looks\nlike wherever possible.\n\n276\n00:15:05.517 --> 00:15:08.918\nMake sure you know the clients\nthat could be accessing this, and\n\n277\n00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:12.887\nversions of engines that might come into\nplay on their side that are going to\n\n278\n00:15:12.887 --> 00:15:14.538\nprocess scripts and all that.\n\n279\n00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:18.850\nSo, there's those little things you got to\nbring together to see how they all play\n\n280\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.175\ntogether and play nice.\n\n281\n00:15:20.175 --> 00:15:24.638\nIt can be a very, very confusing and\nconvoluted environment.\n\n282\n00:15:24.638 --> 00:15:28.394\nAnd remember, we have,\nyou mentioned the two big ones, Mike.\n\n283\n00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:33.292\nYou mentioned IES and Apache, we have\nanother one out there that comes into\n\n284\n00:15:33.292 --> 00:15:38.451\nplay is NGINX, N-G-I-N-X, that one is\nseen in a number of places as well.\n\n285\n00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:43.179\nSo, keep in mind that that's something\nelse that might appear you have to get\n\n286\n00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:44.141\nknowledge on.\n\n287\n00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:48.519\nSo, yeah, now as far as the other\nweb servers that are out there,\n\n288\n00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:52.737\njust to kind of give those things\nlip service out there, yeah,\n\n289\n00:15:52.737 --> 00:15:56.421\nI'm aware that there's other\nweb servers out there.\n\n290\n00:15:56.421 --> 00:16:00.526\nI mean, it ain't the big three,\nthere's other ones out there but\n\n291\n00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:03.162\nthe reality is is that, more than likely,\n\n292\n00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:07.799\nyou're just not going to run into them,\nthe odds are stacked against you.\n\n293\n00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:10.384\nYou could, but,\nmore than likely you're not.\n\n294\n00:16:10.384 --> 00:16:15.972\nSo I would always have reference\nmaterial available to look at for\n\n295\n00:16:15.972 --> 00:16:21.720\nthose big three, and\nthe other ones look them up as needed.\n\n296\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.680\nThere are still people out there, believe\nit or not, that use Netscape Servers and\n\n297\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.370\nstuff like that.\n\n298\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.110\nThose are still out there.\n\n299\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.106\nDon't know why, but\nthey're still out there.\n\n300\n00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:35.230\nThere's plenty of those old\nschool ones that people are like\n\n301\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.130\nyou can get it from me when you\ntake it out of my cold, dead hands.\n\n302\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.660\nThat type of attitude.\n\n303\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.290\n>> Especially if it's an internal server,\nsomething like that, for\n\n304\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.390\nan internal website.\n\n305\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.608\nMaybe I'm okay with using that.\n\n306\n00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:48.520\nProbably not gonna see it as much\nout there in the public facing area.\n\n307\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.390\nBut as Sean says, you wouldn't be\nsurprised what people will do.\n\n308\n00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.790\n>> Yeah.\nShouldn't be surprised here.\n\n309\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.510\nNot too often.\n\n310\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.230\n>> Not at this point\nanyway in our careers.\n\n311\n00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.180\nWe should understand that yeah,\n\n312\n00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.580\npeople are still running NT,\npeople are still using AOL.\n\n313\n00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.630\nAll that good stuff.\n\n314\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.741\nAll right, so Sean we get a good idea\nabout the client server relationship\n\n315\n00:17:07.741 --> 00:17:10.461\nbetween the web server,\nthe applications, and\n\n316\n00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:13.830\nthen the client that's\nconsuming that information.\n\n317\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:18.360\nTalked a little bit about\nanalyzing web application.\n\n318\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.070\nI know there's a bunch of tools\nthat we're gonna go more in depth\n\n319\n00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.370\non in just a little bit.\n\n320\n00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.270\nBut start us off, give us a hint or\n\n321\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:31.370\nan idea of some of the tools we might be\nusing to do this web application analysis.\n\n322\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.790\n>> Yes, this is what areas that we\nhave a lot of duplicate tools or\n\n323\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.450\ntools that do somewhat\nduplicate functionality.\n\n324\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.010\nWe also have a lot of new ones here,\nand Kali as well.\n\n325\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.800\nWe have ones that are what\nthey typically call\n\n326\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.920\ntesting frameworks or\nassessment frameworks.\n\n327\n00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.800\nThose are something that you see a lot of.\n\n328\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.500\nTypically those frameworks are ones\nthat you can plug modules into and\n\n329\n00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.390\nthey can do various scans.\n\n330\n00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.390\nAnd this is also, by the way, in these\nareas, just to kind of why we're talking\n\n331\n00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:11.850\nabout it, this is one of the areas in\nKali that you see both command line and\n\n332\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.730\nGUI based stuff, but you actually see more\nGUI based stuff than you do command line.\n\n333\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.230\nAt least with most of the major tools,\nwhen you start drilling with some of\n\n334\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.225\nthe other ones that starts to change\na bit, but you do see a good number of\n\n335\n00:18:25.225 --> 00:18:29.470\nGUI based tools, just because it\ndoes make it a lot easier to use.\n\n336\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.190\nNot just for the fact that hey,\nmaybe you came over to Windows and\n\n337\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.660\nhere over to Kali.\n\n338\n00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.170\nIt's just because\nthe information you're providing\n\n339\n00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.110\nthe best way to do it is\ngonna be through a GUI.\n\n340\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:44.460\nIf you try to provide that stuff at\nthe command line, no, I'm not doing it.\n\n341\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.680\n>> Not fun.\n>> I'm just not gonna do it.\n\n342\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.370\nSo, you can do that with\nsome of these tools,\n\n343\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.610\nbut we do have a lot of GUI\nbased ones that can help us out.\n\n344\n00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.880\nSo we are gonna take\na look at several of them.\n\n345\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.026\nWe have ones like w3af.\n\n346\n00:18:59.026 --> 00:19:04.090\nWe have ones like,\n\n347\n00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.740\nwell, I've got kind of a short list.\n\n348\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.640\nVega, OWASP, we have the Burp suite\n\n349\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.740\nwhich we have seen a little bit of before,\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n350\n00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.060\nAnd then we have other things that\nyou may not associate with testing\n\n351\n00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.570\na web application but,\nthey do play a role there, too.\n\n352\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.380\nThings like OpenVas,\nwhich is a vulnerability scanner.\n\n353\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.600\nThat would indeed be useful here too.\n\n354\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:36.720\nSo we have at the very least a good\nnumber of tools just right there,\n\n355\n00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.790\nbut yeah, there's plenty of other ones.\n\n356\n00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.980\nThere's plenty, and plenty, and\nplenty of other ones out there.\n\n357\n00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.070\nAnd more than likely,\n\n358\n00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.960\nyou're gonna see that this is gonna be an\narea where you're gonna have to do quite\n\n359\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.030\na bit of assessment cuz it's important\nto remember that a web server is one\n\n360\n00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:57.700\nof those things that does act as a very\neasy entry point into an organization.\n\n361\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.252\nSo you may not just be targeting\na specific IP out there and\n\n362\n00:20:01.252 --> 00:20:03.890\nusing it as an entry point in general.\n\n363\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:09.010\nYou're using a web server as a place\nwhere you can scan it, see user accounts\n\n364\n00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.510\non there, maybe bust a password, those\ntypes of things and use that to get in.\n\n365\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:20.010\nAnd then we've seen stuff like\nbrowsing out of the home folder or\n\n366\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.230\nthe web folder onto the system by doing\ndirectory traversals and stuff like that.\n\n367\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.950\nWe can do those types of\nthings to get out of there and\n\n368\n00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.190\nstart doing other stuff to\nplant things in the system,\n\n369\n00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.460\nto do manipulation of user accounts and\nstuff like that.\n\n370\n00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.080\nTo bring stuff on to that system,\nand now what do we do?\n\n371\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.880\nWe can start opening up that hole more and\nmore and more, to the point where we can\n\n372\n00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.080\nget a lot of nastiness in there and\nreally open up the network.\n\n373\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.420\nSo this may be the place where the person\nkind of gets their foot in the door,\n\n374\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.830\nto do further damage.\n\n375\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.250\nSo that's another big reason why you\nwanna use everything at your disposal\n\n376\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.930\nin this area to really make sure\nyou've got your bases covered.\n\n377\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.380\nThis is where people go.\n\n378\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.750\n>> Yeah, I would think that,\n\n379\n00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.420\nas a pen tester, I've gotta be able to\nput a web server through its paces.\n\n380\n00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.700\nBy its nature,\nit usually needs some level of public or\n\n381\n00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.090\nanonymous access because we want the\ngeneral public to be able to come to our\n\n382\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.640\nweb server and browse our web page and\nfind out about our company, or\n\n383\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.740\nbuy our products, or whatever it is\nwe're putting that web server up.\n\n384\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.460\nSo it's got some level of.\n\n385\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.760\nIt's not like my file server that I can\nlock behind those firewalls or my domain\n\n386\n00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.910\ncontroller that I feel is safe back there\nbehind two layers of firewalls right?\n\n387\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.350\nThat web server's sitting out there so\n\n388\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.610\nyou know as the bad guys,\nthat's what they're gonna be hitting,\n\n389\n00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.880\nit's the first thing they see,\nit's the easiest thing to access.\n\n390\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.130\nThat's usually their starting point.\n\n391\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.550\nAs a pen tester,\nwe've gotta test that thoroughly.\n\n392\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.149\nThat means, as you said, knowing all the\ndifferent tools, knowing all the different\n\n393\n00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:50.181\nways to analyze it, being familiar with\neven those off the wall web browsers\n\n394\n00:21:50.181 --> 00:21:54.250\nNetScape, not web browsers but\nweb servers that might be out there.\n\n395\n00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.730\nSo that we can, again,\ndo a thorough job in our penetration test.\n\n396\n00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.650\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, well lots of tools and\n\n397\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.380\nstuff that we're gonna take a look at, but\nSean looking at the clock we're about out\n\n398\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.440\nof time for this episode, so\nanything else we wanna throw in?\n\n399\n00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:11.230\nJust on the the concepts of web servers\nand server application type thing?\n\n400\n00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:16.980\n>> Well, the things that come to mind here\nare if you're really gonna get the most\n\n401\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.840\nbang for your buck out of looking\nat testing web applications and\n\n402\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.150\nusing these tools.\n\n403\n00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:31.320\nDo familiarize yourself with at\nthe very least IAS and Apache.\n\n404\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.080\nKinda take a look at how the different\nmodules are laid out and\n\n405\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.670\nwhat type of features they have.\n\n406\n00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.500\n>> And so you know what makes one\ndifferent from the other, and\n\n407\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.550\ndifferent mechanics underneath the hood.\n\n408\n00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:48.230\nI don't necessarily need you\njust going in raw to this to be\n\n409\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.510\nsomeone that is an gonna become an expert\nand brush up on those things so\n\n410\n00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.740\nthey really know every nook and cranny?\n\n411\n00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.010\nOf course not.\n\n412\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.500\nBut I would expect you to get the most\ninformation out of these things.\n\n413\n00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:06.180\nOne of the things you need to know is\nunderstand at least those two web servers.\n\n414\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.010\nAnd then we go on to talk\nabout the web applications.\n\n415\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.380\nThe web applications,\nto really get the most bang for\n\n416\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.780\nthe buck out of a lot of these.\n\n417\n00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.270\nYou're gonna have to have more intimate\nknowledge of a specific web application.\n\n418\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:22.510\nSo for today with what we're doing,\nwe don't really care if\n\n419\n00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.180\nyou've got that knowledge going in\nwith a web application at least.\n\n420\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.980\nWeb servers,\nI would expect most of you already have\n\n421\n00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.230\na good knowledge of web servers and\nhow they work.\n\n422\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.210\nYou may have to fill in some\nholes here and there, but\n\n423\n00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.080\nyou at least have a good\nworking knowledge.\n\n424\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.380\nThe web application,\nwe're just gonna say, okay, generically,\n\n425\n00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.550\na web application is something\nthat processes stuff out there.\n\n426\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.320\nBut if you're gonna be going to\nan environment and pen test,\n\n427\n00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.570\nbefore you pen test really fully\nwith that web app, you're probably\n\n428\n00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:57.230\nwanna take a closer look at what it's\nexpected to do, common issues with it.\n\n429\n00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.310\nThat's if it's something off the shelf.\n\n430\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:04.760\nSomething that's off the shelf that\nsomeone has implemented their environment,\n\n431\n00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.020\nthen yeah go to the vendor and\nfigure out what they are doing.\n\n432\n00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.540\nIf it's something that they've homegrown,\nthat's a different story.\n\n433\n00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.670\nYou may actually have to view the\ndifferent component technologies used to\n\n434\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.360\nweave together to make that solution.\n\n435\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.940\n>> Right.\n>> And then go from there, and\n\n436\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.160\nthat can be a little\nbit of a taller order.\n\n437\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.090\nIn fact, it might be something that you\njust have to enlist a developer themselves\n\n438\n00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:28.070\nto help you out with.\n\n439\n00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.580\nAnd don't be afraid to do that.\n\n440\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.960\nIf you need to do a thorough job,\nwhich you should always be striving to do,\n\n441\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.080\nif you need a developer to sit with or\n\n442\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.580\ntalk to, don't make this stuff up\nyourself and just guess at it,\n\n443\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.860\nget them to do it, to work with you to\nkind of help you fill in those gaps.\n\n444\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.550\nBut fortunately most of the time\nyou'll be able to at least\n\n445\n00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:50.300\nget a good amount of information\neven without going to that.\n\n446\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.420\nBut at some point you should really\nseriously consider to do the best possible\n\n447\n00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:01.950\njob you can, you need a developer\nto come in and really help you out.\n\n448\n00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.930\nThis product will help you to\na certain degree with that.\n\n449\n00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.720\nOr I should say,\nthe tools that this product\n\n450\n00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.870\nhas in it Kail a lot of them will\nhelp you out with that stuff.\n\n451\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.960\nThey'll tell you hey, I found these things\nand you can just go ahead when you know\n\n452\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.570\nwhat the name of that thing is and\nknow the name of the specific issue is,\n\n453\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.620\nyou can use that to say okay,\nI know that that's a nasty one.\n\n454\n00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.810\nI know what high level, what that means.\n\n455\n00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.830\nAnd I have evidence of that appearing.\n\n456\n00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:26.800\nI can turn that over.\n\n457\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.990\nThat might be enough to take\nto your client and say yeah,\n\n458\n00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.850\nI found evidence of cross-site\nscripting happening here.\n\n459\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.140\nThey're the ones that are gonna have\nto take care of it in their end and\n\n460\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.530\nreally understand what's causing it.\n\n461\n00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.890\nBut you, at least, were able to find it,\nby virtue of having these tools.\n\n462\n00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.820\nSo do remember that.\n\n463\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.530\nSo for\nright now don't sweat that sort of stuff.\n\n464\n00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:52.400\nBut that is something that you\nshould have on your plate as kind\n\n465\n00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.030\nof a review item, if you're gonna\nbe doing this, which you will.\n\n466\n00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.990\n>> Very good.\n\n467\n00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.330\nAll right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n468\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.950\nthat does it for this particular episode.\n\n469\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.320\nWe want to thank everybody for watching.\n\n470\n00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.960\nMake sure you stay tuned, we've got\nmore Kali episodes coming your way.\n\n471\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.620\nBut for you now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n472\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.570\n>> And I'm Sean Oreono.\n\n473\n00:26:09.570 -->

00:00:16.681\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:17.740\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.604\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:19.116\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:20.220\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.334\nAnother day here in ITProTV land.\n\n9\n00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:26.580\nWe got our Kali Linux series going on, and\nin this episode, we're gonna be looking at\n\n10\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.512\nsome of the tools we can use when\nwe're doing penetration tests.\n\n11\n00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:34.360\nAnd trying to test web servers,\nand web application, right?\n\n12\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.120\nThat's a very common point of attack, it's\na public facing point for most companies.\n\n13\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.690\nSo it is a common target,\nwhich means we've gotta do a good,\n\n14\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.870\nthorough job testing that and\nmaking sure that it's secured properly and\n\n15\n00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.550\nthe applications on it\nare secured properly.\n\n16\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.190\nAnd Kali doesn't fall short here,\ndoes it, Sean?\n\n17\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.320\nIt brings a lot of tools to bear.\n\n18\n00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.810\nSo we can do this kinda thing.\n\n19\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.440\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.760\nThere's an amazing amount of\ntools in this product already.\n\n21\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.850\nAnd one of the one areas\nthey really don't skimp on,\n\n22\n00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.620\nat all is what we have out of the box\nto do testing of web applications.\n\n23\n00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.290\nAnd, so we're gonna take a look at some of\nthese tools to see what they can do for\n\n24\n00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.910\nus and where they kinda fit in and\nwhat they're expected to address.\n\n25\n00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.110\nAnd I'll be upfront with you on this one.\n\n26\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.920\nThere is some crossover amongst\nthese tools, so be prepared for\n\n27\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.910\nthe fact that some of these tools\nwill have very similar functionality.\n\n28\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.090\nBut that's actually I look at\nit's not really a problem for\n\n29\n00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.770\nme because hey, there's crossover.\n\n30\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.020\nThis tool does this, this tool does this.\n\n31\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740\nThat means I now have a choice of\nwhich one's best gonna work for me.\n\n32\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.351\nI don't just have one thing\nthat's gonna do the job,\n\n33\n00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:53.070\nso that's always a great thing to have.\n\n34\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.730\n>> We've talked about having more\nthan one tool so we can trust and\n\n35\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.640\nverify our results as well.\n\n36\n00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.274\n>> Yeah absolutely\n>> Making sure that we're getting true\n\n37\n00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:00.865\nresults.\n\n38\n00:02:00.865 --> 00:02:05.143\n>> Yeah, and the way I look at\nit there's no tool that does\n\n39\n00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:07.840\neverything 100% perfectly.\n\n40\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.270\nThey do miss something and\nthis is one of those situations where\n\n41\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.590\nyou really want to really to kinda test\nthese things out on your own, in your lab.\n\n42\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.430\nAll these things should be\ntested out in your lab anyway.\n\n43\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.570\nBut you really wanna take a look\nat something like this cuz some\n\n44\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.570\nof these results can vary wildly.\n\n45\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.900\nI have it for years, and\nstuff like this situation,\n\n46\n00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.738\none of the things I'm gonna bring\nup is a vulnerability scanner.\n\n47\n00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:39.740\nVulnerability scanners,\nI've compared in some of my classes and\n\n48\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.960\nsome of my presentations I've\ncompared Nessus and Nexpose.\n\n49\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.830\nThe presentations aren't\nmeant to pick on them.\n\n50\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.950\nIt's just meant to show that hey,\nhere's both equally good\n\n51\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.230\nvulnerability scanners but\nthe results between the two are different.\n\n52\n00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.750\nOne will pick up some things\nthat say they are critical,\n\n53\n00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.380\nin fact, which is really scary.\n\n54\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.340\nOne of them says oh, this is very serious\ncritical urgent issues, things on fire,\n\n55\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.450\nyou have got to fix it.\n\n56\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.990\nAnd then this one says,\noh, there's no problem.\n\n57\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.122\nThis is all, everything's all good.\n\n58\n00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:17.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's, like, that's a big problem there.\n\n59\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.340\nIf I just got minor issues,\nthat's still of a concern to me.\n\n60\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.970\nWhy are they over here and not here?\n\n61\n00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.750\n>> Right.\n\n62\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.439\n>> But if it's big, hey,\nthe roof's gonna fall on you.\n\n63\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.040\nWhy is there a difference there?\n\n64\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.520\nJust FYI, test these things out.\n\n65\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.520\nFortunately, you don't just\nhave to test them out blind.\n\n66\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.340\nThese tools, you can test just\nabout all of these out against\n\n67\n00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.130\na preconfigured vulnerable\nvirtual machine.\n\n68\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.303\nRemember, one of the things we mentioned,\nway,\n\n69\n00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:50.437\nway back at the beginning\nof this whole journey.\n\n70\n00:03:50.437 --> 00:03:55.800\nIs the fact that they do make vulnerable\nvirtual machines you can just plug in,\n\n71\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.377\ndrop into your virtualization\nsoftware of choice,\n\n72\n00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:03.320\nas a matter of fact,\nturn it on, and start testing.\n\n73\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.360\nAnd the cool thing about\nhaving that is not only\n\n74\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.640\nhave you had the work done for you.\n\n75\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.120\nYou also have something that has\n\n76\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.160\na wad of major technologies\nyou can test against it.\n\n77\n00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.760\nIncluding databases such as MySequel,\nand those guys.\n\n78\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.500\nAnd, then even on top of that\nthose vulnerabilities for\n\n79\n00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.422\nthe most part that are all\ndocumented clearly by a developer.\n\n80\n00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:30.760\nSo, you now know purposely what they put\nin there and what should be showing up.\n\n81\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.470\nSo you can really do that trust but\nverify thing.\n\n82\n00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.680\nThey're telling you these are bad.\n\n83\n00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.100\nIf you don't find,\nat the very least, those, or\n\n84\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.365\na good number of those, there's a problem.\n\n85\n00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:46.545\nYou may want to see if that product\nis one you really want to use.\n\n86\n00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:49.125\nIf it misses enough of them,\nthat's just not good.\n\n87\n00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.485\n>> Either your technique is off or\n\n88\n00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:54.167\nthe tool is not doing what it's supposed\nto do and you need to check that out.\n\n89\n00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:56.327\n>> Yeah, definitely ask questions.\n\n90\n00:04:56.327 --> 00:05:03.477\nAsk questions to make sure you understand\nwhy those results are the way they are.\n\n91\n00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:08.260\nAnd if you've answered that question\nto your satisfaction then, heck.\n\n92\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.930\nGo ahead and use it.\n\n93\n00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.580\nI wouldn't tell you not to.\n\n94\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.611\nJust telling you, make sure that you\nknow that those limitations are there.\n\n95\n00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.013\nDon't want the bad guys find out and\nyou've gone ahead and\n\n96\n00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:21.358\nsigned off on a report saying,\nto the best of my ability.\n\n97\n00:05:21.358 --> 00:05:24.890\nAnd this, that could leave you open\nto a lot of problems later on.\n\n98\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.320\nNot only looking stupid and\nquestioning your abilities, but\n\n99\n00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.900\nalso it could open you up\nto legal reproductions too.\n\n100\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.360\nIf it's big enough they're going to say,\nwell that should have picked up,\n\n101\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.330\nwhat's your problem?\n\n102\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.420\n>> And that might hurt my\njob prospects in the future,\n\n103\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.845\neither one of those scenarios, so.\n\n104\n00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:38.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n105\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.430\n>> I could have a future\nas a pen tester anyway.\n\n106\n00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.220\n>> Yeah, there's people that have been\nknown to actually take the results\n\n107\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.320\nout of Nessus.\n\n108\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.480\nAnd these are not reputable\npeople that are doing this.\n\n109\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.780\nThey'll take the results out of\nsomething like Nessus and just copy and\n\n110\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.640\npaste it someplace else and\nsay that's their findings.\n\n111\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.940\nAnd that makes you look even worse\nbecause you don't understand what\n\n112\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.480\nthe vulnerability is.\n\n113\n00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.158\nIf you're doing that you probably don't.\n\n114\n00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:08.565\nYou copy it over and paste it in there,\ndon't tell anybody that's it coming from\n\n115\n00:06:08.565 --> 00:06:11.960\nNessus and someone looks and\ngoes, hey I recognize that.\n\n116\n00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.950\nThen they might challenge you on it,\nnow you show you don't know anything, and\n\n117\n00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.100\nyou're even plagiarizing\nstuff from another place.\n\n118\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.760\nThat will end your career pretty quickly,\n\n119\n00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.240\ndecapitated by someone really\nquick if that happens.\n\n120\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.403\nSo don't do that.\n\n121\n00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:29.515\nI've stuck some stuff in my reports\nthat I've found in Nessus and\n\n122\n00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:33.348\nNexpose that I found were\nsomething that needed to be cited.\n\n123\n00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:36.125\nBut it was very clear\nthat's where it came from.\n\n124\n00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.858\nI would cite it saying yeah,\nthis is where this came from and\n\n125\n00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:42.060\nI just pulled it over instead\nof rewriting it for you.\n\n126\n00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.760\nPeople have done that too, but\nbe careful when you're doing this and\n\n127\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.640\nknow your environment.\n\n128\n00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.650\n>> All right, well, Sean, do you have\na favorite tool you wanna start with?\n\n129\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.880\nWhere do you wanna go with this?\n\n130\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.740\n>> Well,\nlet's just take a brief look at what\n\n131\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.960\nKali offers you in a broad\nsense in this category.\n\n132\n00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.720\nSo what I've got here in\nmy virtual machine is,\n\n133\n00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.980\nI've gone into the Kali Linux menu,\nI have my web applications, and\n\n134\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.160\nthen you can look over on our\nmenus that are cascading out.\n\n135\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.450\nYou can see we have one for\ndoing CMS systems, databases.\n\n136\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.130\nAnd there's even separate tools up and\nabove this for\n\n137\n00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.970\ndoing databases if you can believe it.\n\n138\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.520\nThere's three here.\n\n139\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:35.210\nThat's not anywhere near being\nthe full roster of tools we have.\n\n140\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.870\nI mean, there's some of our IDS,\nIPS identification.\n\n141\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.660\nWell, we still got that coming\nup on how to identify those.\n\n142\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.949\nWell, they've got a tool right here for\nthat.\n\n143\n00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.458\nBut then some stuff that we really kind\nof haven't seen before, not on this way.\n\n144\n00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:56.984\nIn CEH, we talked about different\nways of testing web applications.\n\n145\n00:07:56.984 --> 00:07:58.812\nFuzzing was brought up.\n\n146\n00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:03.388\nBut there was really not much\nguidance brought up on fuzzing.\n\n147\n00:08:03.388 --> 00:08:06.537\nIt was just kind of,\nhere's what fuzzing is and\n\n148\n00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:09.545\nif you want to do fuzzing\nthen go research it.\n\n149\n00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:12.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's kind of what CEH is.\n\n150\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.928\nAnd, heck, when you look at it,\nyou can't really blame them.\n\n151\n00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:19.560\nHeck, when I wrote that CEH book.\n\n152\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.420\nWhen I wrote that thing I mentioned that\nin there as well, and didn't really cover\n\n153\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.140\nmuch with it except point people to some\nplace to get more information on it.\n\n154\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.870\nBecause to really understand that you\ngotta know stuff about development, and\n\n155\n00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.690\nthat to really get\nthe full power of it and\n\n156\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.650\nthat's a big can of worms\nyou're opening just on that.\n\n157\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:44.310\nBut what fuzzing is,\njust in a very brief sense, in a nutshell,\n\n158\n00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.750\nis it means you're feeding different\nranges and different combinations of\n\n159\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.850\nvalues into an application,\nto watch and see how it responds.\n\n160\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.120\nBecause when you feed a range of values\ninto it, and maybe even outside or\n\n161\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.420\ndifferent ways than it's expecting, that\napplication can do funny things and may\n\n162\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.740\neven give people access or allow them to\ndo stuff they shouldn't be allowed to do.\n\n163\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.615\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n164\n00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:09.070\nYou got a field on a web form that's\nexpecting your phone number, and\n\n165\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.560\nwhat if somebody puts pound symbols\nall the way through it, and\n\n166\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.390\nall of a sudden a shell pops open or\nan error message\n\n167\n00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.940\npops up that spits out all kinds of\ninformation about the back-end database.\n\n168\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.380\nOr it crashes a server.\n\n169\n00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.630\nThe database hangs up cuz\nit's trying to process this,\n\n170\n00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.440\nand there's a data type set on the field\nthat it's trying to dump that value into.\n\n171\n00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.590\nSo fuzzing it allows you to throw\nstuff at it, that's not expected.\n\n172\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.760\nA lot of times, when you're developing\napplications, you're developing this.\n\n173\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.510\nYou're like okay here's a user name field,\nhere's a password field,\n\n174\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.930\nhere's a phone number field.\n\n175\n00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.840\nAnd as you're developing it, you're typing\nin a dummy user name, a dummy last name or\n\n176\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.260\npassword, and a dummy phone number.\n\n177\n00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.130\nYou never even think about what if\nsomebody put their name in the phone\n\n178\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.000\nnumber field, right?\n\n179\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.630\nSo those are the kind of\nthings that fuzzing can find.\n\n180\n00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.950\nIt exposed some of those weaknesses\nin the code and those applications.\n\n181\n00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.268\n>> Yeah.\nThey're starting to check for\n\n182\n00:09:59.268 --> 00:09:59.870\na little more.\n\n183\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.860\nIt's tools like this\nthat are helping it out.\n\n184\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.110\nBut yeah, you're right.\n\n185\n00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:08.140\nWhen you're developing\nan application it used to be that,\n\n186\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.580\nyou kind of had blinders on.\n\n187\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.470\nYou wrote it with a certain process in\nmind, and you wrote towards that process.\n\n188\n00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.840\nSo you modeled it out.\n\n189\n00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.330\nAnd you said,\nthis is the way things are gonna move, and\n\n190\n00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.700\nyeah, if I have something\nthat's collecting names and\n\n191\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.324\nphone numbers, well do you mind if I\nput someone's blood type in there?\n\n192\n00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:27.778\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not part of it, so why bother?\n\n193\n00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:30.665\n>> And right now those darn error\ncatching loops are such a pain, and\n\n194\n00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:32.408\nit doubles the length of your project.\n\n195\n00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:33.555\nI mean, who has time for that [LAUGH]?\n\n196\n00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:34.864\n>> Yeah.\n\n197\n00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:37.302\nThat's called a patch and billable hours.\n\n198\n00:10:37.302 --> 00:10:40.460\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.440\n>> But these things with fuzzy,\n\n200\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.060\nare designed to help\nyou pick those things-\n\n201\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.240\n>> Like a Web Slayer, Power Fuzzer.\n\n202\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.400\nGreat names, again.\n\n203\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.060\n>> That sounds like a metal band.\n\n204\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.804\nPower Fuzzer.\n\n205\n00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:53.351\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND] Come on.\n\n206\n00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:57.885\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Opening for Motley Crue.\n\n207\n00:10:57.885 --> 00:11:02.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've got quite a few players in NAT\n\n208\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.400\ncategory, as far as web applications.\n\n209\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.430\nAnd we've got Web proxies.\n\n210\n00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.890\nNow maybe we can zoom that up.\n\n211\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.870\nMy big fat head's in the way of that menu.\n\n212\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.870\nOkay, there we go.\n\n213\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.850\nSo, we have Web application proxies.\n\n214\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:20.742\nThis one is actually interesting category,\nmainly what we're going to look at here is\n\n215\n00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:23.635\ngonna be burpsuite, and\nwe've seen that before.\n\n216\n00:11:23.635 --> 00:11:28.608\nBut there's also,\nwe're gonna take a look at vega in here,\n\n217\n00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:32.130\nbut the one that's interesting is paros.\n\n218\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.500\nThey have paros proxy in there.\n\n219\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.074\nAnd if you recall, I mentioned this\nduring the CEH course, I also mention it\n\n220\n00:11:38.074 --> 00:11:42.620\nduring all our DFI course when\nwe're doing investigation there.\n\n221\n00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.640\nParos proxy has been put out to pasture.\n\n222\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.950\nYou can still get it, but\nit's been replaced by owasp.\n\n223\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.730\nBut you can see owasp is\non that menu as well.\n\n224\n00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:57.040\nSo if you like using paros proxy,\nyou got it there.\n\n225\n00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.930\nI would recommend that you\njust really think about if\n\n226\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.550\nthat's the one you really wanna use.\n\n227\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.825\nI'd probably just go with owasp.\n\n228\n00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:08.128\n>> We got a question in the chatroom\nthere from Macailey, she's asking,\n\n229\n00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:11.720\nwould you restrict fuzzing to test\nenvironments only if there was a risk of\n\n230\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.160\ncrashing a live server, or just let the\ncustomer know what the risk is ahead of\n\n231\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.449\ntime and do it on their production,\nor leave that choice up to them?\n\n232\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.960\n>> I would say if you\nhave the opportunity,\n\n233\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.310\ntest environments are,\nthat's what they're there for.\n\n234\n00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.590\nThat's where you wanna catch it,\nthat test and\n\n235\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.889\ndevelopment environment,\nbut if it gets deployed.\n\n236\n00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.950\nIf you find that input validation and\n\n237\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:44.070\nfuzzing may be an issue, it's something\nthat you want to talk to the client first,\n\n238\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.160\nto tell them that this is what the problem\nis, to give them a chance to maybe address\n\n239\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.890\nit without you going in and penetrating\nthat vulnerability to see how bad it gets.\n\n240\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.650\nOr they may decide,\nhey rock and roll, go ahead.\n\n241\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.830\nIf you crash it,\nwe got stuff to restore it.\n\n242\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.750\nPeople sometimes will do that.\n\n243\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:08.580\nBut I wouldn't count on it,\nif it's a business that has their whole\n\n244\n00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.460\nthing is like ecommerce or something, they\ndon't have a brick and mortar storefront.\n\n245\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.746\nYou're basically going over there and just\nkicking over their stack of blocks and\n\n246\n00:13:16.746 --> 00:13:21.108\nsaying, [SOUND] see you later, they can't\ndo anything, they gotta redo all that.\n\n247\n00:13:21.108 --> 00:13:25.506\nSo you really wanna,\ncuz if you can catch it in a test, yeah,\n\n248\n00:13:25.506 --> 00:13:28.000\nget it in a test environment.\n\n249\n00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.800\nBut you may not have that opportunity.\n\n250\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.350\nIt may already have been deployed,\nand now you're doing your testing.\n\n251\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.960\nYou find out that there's\na possibility of this.\n\n252\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.310\nIt's one of those things that,\nif you're being smart about it,\n\n253\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:46.030\nand you are really doing it to the best\nof your ability, you're gonna ask them is\n\n254\n00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.110\nthis something if there's a concern\nhere that this may actually cause some\n\n255\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:55.770\ndestruction of data or cause something\nto go down, do you want me to proceed?\n\n256\n00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:01.330\n>> Yeah early on in that agreement that\nwe're generating with the customer,\n\n257\n00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.390\nall those risks really\nneed to be laid out and\n\n258\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.410\ndecided on,\nthen cuz Enguido makes a good point.\n\n259\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.303\nIf it's a black box test,\nthey might say, hey,\n\n260\n00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:12.494\nwe want you to try whatever\nthe bad guys are gonna try.\n\n261\n00:14:12.494 --> 00:14:17.219\nYou don't really know what they have or\nwhether they're gonna be separable, so\n\n262\n00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:19.659\nyou gotta test it, to be a thorough test.\n\n263\n00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:22.506\nBut we do the old,\nremember the phrase CYA comes to mind.\n\n264\n00:14:22.506 --> 00:14:24.039\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, yeah.\n>> Back in the beginning,\n\n265\n00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:26.345\nwhen we got hired on,\nwe made sure we said hey,\n\n266\n00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:29.208\nif we do a thorough test there's\na chance this goes down.\n\n267\n00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:32.840\nMaybe they've got certain hours they want\nto perform the test in, that way if there\n\n268\n00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.000\nis, something happens, they've got time to\nrestore it before business the next day.\n\n269\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.590\nOr maybe they've got their own test\nenvironment and they say well,\n\n270\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.190\nif you're gonna do something like that,\nlet's test against this non-production\n\n271\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.950\nduplication of our production environment,\nor something like that.\n\n272\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.340\nReally the main thing I think is,\nmake sure they're aware of it, don't do\n\n273\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.400\nanything without letting them know there's\na chance, hey I might crash your server.\n\n274\n00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.730\nYou don't want to surprise\nthem with something like that.\n\n275\n00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.760\n>> A healthy abundance of caution\nis never going to hurt you.\n\n276\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.910\nI'd rather get someone on the phone, and\njust tell them, this is what I found.\n\n277\n00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:13.090\nI do believe there is\na serious problem here.\n\n278\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.249\nSo, I am not gonna wait til I get to\nthe report, I'm telling you right now.\n\n279\n00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:21.244\nAnd, do you want me to actually\ntake advantage of that,\n\n280\n00:15:21.244 --> 00:15:25.324\nor would you just rather go ahead and\nanalyze your code and\n\n281\n00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:29.747\nfix it quietly,\nwithout me causing some major disturbance.\n\n282\n00:15:29.747 --> 00:15:32.637\nLet them make the choice, but don't just\ntake it on yourself to go through and\n\n283\n00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:35.280\nyeah, I'm gonna kick this thing down and\nsee what happens.\n\n284\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.675\nThat's not gonna turn out well.\n\n285\n00:15:36.675 --> 00:15:38.120\n>> Right.\nYou're not gonna find too many\n\n286\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.275\nclients going that was awesome,\ndo it again!\n\n287\n00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:41.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, they're not gonna do it.\n\n288\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.534\nSo be careful on that.\n\n289\n00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:45.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you can, then awesome.\n\n290\n00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.736\nI would totally work for\na client like that.\n\n291\n00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:48.282\n>> Right?\n[LAUGH].\n\n292\n00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:51.861\nSo lots of different tools we can use\nthen, to put these web servers and\n\n293\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.786\nthe applications that are running\non them to their test.\n\n294\n00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:58.986\nAny of them that you find particularly\nuseful, or we wanna take a look at?\n\n295\n00:15:58.986 --> 00:16:01.262\n>> We are gonna take a look at\na number of other things here.\n\n296\n00:16:01.262 --> 00:16:08.110\nThere is a whole wide world of\nthese different tools out there.\n\n297\n00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.830\nJust a couple more categories\nto quickly mention,\n\n298\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.790\nwe talked about the web crawlers here.\n\n299\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.680\nWe can kinda go through and\nit will look at a site.\n\n300\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.050\nAnd then we also have the web\nvulnerability scanners.\n\n301\n00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.360\nI mean, look at the number of web\nvulnerability scanners are on that.\n\n302\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.460\nThat's even one of those\nscrolling menu deals.\n\n303\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.333\nSo you've got a lot of things to\nbring to bear on a web application\n\n304\n00:16:30.333 --> 00:16:34.951\nthat you can check to see what\nyour particular problems are.\n\n305\n00:16:34.951 --> 00:16:39.693\nThey've got pretty much everything for\nalmost whatever you wanna do, and\n\n306\n00:16:39.693 --> 00:16:42.261\nsome interesting names in there, too.\n\n307\n00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:44.862\nWhatweb.\n\n308\n00:16:44.862 --> 00:16:45.547\n>> What web?\n\n309\n00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:49.750\n>> Yeah, Whatweb, and\nHadbuster, I like that.\n\n310\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.408\nGrabber, and my favorite, Cadaver.\n\n311\n00:16:52.408 --> 00:16:53.035\n>> Cadaver.\n\n312\n00:16:53.035 --> 00:16:54.695\n>> Cadaver, yeah.\n\n313\n00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:58.660\n>> When you're doing a ping test\nagainst a web server like this or\n\n314\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.703\nany web server, do you do like\nthe server application first and\n\n315\n00:17:02.703 --> 00:17:06.000\nthen the applications that run on it or\nvice versa?\n\n316\n00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.260\nOr does it really matter?\n\n317\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.550\nDo you focus on one or the other or\ndo you just start going at it and\n\n318\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.380\nsee what you can find?\n\n319\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.987\n>> I will typically, if I can, kind of see\nwhat I can figure out, because if you look\n\n320\n00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:20.491\nat it you're probably already getting it\non the web server way before you get it\n\n321\n00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:23.491\non the application because you\nneed to do a reconnaissance phase.\n\n322\n00:17:23.491 --> 00:17:25.739\nYou're already pulling\nsome of that already.\n\n323\n00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:28.640\nSo, you already have kinda that in hand.\n\n324\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.530\nNow, when you start going over and\ntest the web application,\n\n325\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.570\nyou're gonna grab the stuff\nfrom the web server anyway.\n\n326\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.140\n>> Got ya.\n\n327\n00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.524\n>> And most of these tools\nkinda treat them as they're so\n\n328\n00:17:37.524 --> 00:17:41.362\ntightly in bed with one another\nthat they just kinda figure,\n\n329\n00:17:41.362 --> 00:17:46.300\nwe'll test them as a unit not as\nthere's this and there's that.\n\n330\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.310\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n331\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.900\nAll right,\nwell let's do some testing shall we?\n\n332\n00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.460\n>> Yeah.\nAs far,\n\n333\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.550\nI mean to answer your question there\ntoo by the way, do I have a favorite?\n\n334\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.720\nAnd I don't even know if I'd wanna go\nthat far and say there's a favorite.\n\n335\n00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.915\nThere's some neat ones in here to be sure.\n\n336\n00:18:03.915 --> 00:18:04.510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n337\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.410\n>> You're gonna take a look at these ones\nin here we're gonna introduce you to.\n\n338\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.460\nNo way we're gonna introduce\nyou to all of them.\n\n339\n00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.280\nBut you're gonna look through these and\ngo yeah, there's some stuff in there that\n\n340\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.420\ndoes some pretty, that's some pretty\nneat stuff, some pretty helpful stuff.\n\n341\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.370\nYou're gonna have to do your\nown kind of assessment and\n\n342\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.630\nuse your own judgement to figure out\nwhich ones are gonna be your favorites.\n\n343\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:29.470\nAnd you probably are gonna\nhave favorites when you look\n\n344\n00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:36.370\nat stuff like things like w3af and\nVega and Burp Suite, Nikto.\n\n345\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:39.376\nWe talked about Nikto's cousin, Wikto.\n\n346\n00:18:39.376 --> 00:18:41.661\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Over in CEH and so yeah, so\n\n347\n00:18:41.661 --> 00:18:42.616\nwe had that.\n\n348\n00:18:42.616 --> 00:18:44.276\n>> Nice.\n\n349\n00:18:44.276 --> 00:18:48.152\n>> You're gonna see that\nyeah there's crossover.\n\n350\n00:18:48.152 --> 00:18:52.050\nYou're just gonna have to figure out\nwhich ones are gonna do the job for you.\n\n351\n00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.460\nCool thing about it is that some of these\nthings even have other versions out there\n\n352\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.440\nthat you can also install and\nupgrade from there.\n\n353\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.610\nSelling cases for free.\n\n354\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.770\nSome of them even have\nversions that run on Windows.\n\n355\n00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.790\nBurp Suite is one of the things that,\n\n356\n00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.210\nthere really is only one version of\nBurp Suite, if you can believe that.\n\n357\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.615\nThere's actually only one version of it.\n\n358\n00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:10.400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n359\n00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.920\n>> It's written in Java so you can\nactually, if you've downloaded the CEH\n\n360\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.860\ncourse, if you've downloaded it,\nyou can grab that file right off of your\n\n361\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.660\nWindows system, drop it over on any Linux\nsystem and it'll run, exact same way.\n\n362\n00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.442\nSo that's kind of neat.\n\n363\n00:19:28.442 --> 00:19:29.896\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, that's uncommon.\n\n364\n00:19:29.896 --> 00:19:30.396\n>> Yeah.\n\n365\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.180\n>> So that's a good thing\nwith this type of stuff,\n\n366\n00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.100\nso we're gonna see some of these things\nand it's up to you to chose what your\n\n367\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.410\nfavorites are, like I said there's so\nmany different ones.\n\n368\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.385\nSo, we've got places that\nwe're gonna start in here.\n\n369\n00:19:44.385 --> 00:19:45.290\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n370\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.628\n>> We're gonna take a look at\nthings like the Burp Suite.\n\n371\n00:19:48.628 --> 00:19:50.485\nSo we're gonna take a look at that again.\n\n372\n00:19:50.485 --> 00:19:52.294\nWe'll take a look at Vega.\n\n373\n00:19:52.294 --> 00:19:56.780\nSomething that does the same type of\nthing, with some other stuff thrown in.\n\n374\n00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.007\nWe are gonna take a look at the W3F,\nOWASP and\n\n375\n00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:08.350\nthen we'll get a few other\nones in there along the way.\n\n376\n00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.380\nSo if you wanna kind of follow along,\n\n377\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.500\nthose are the big ones we're\ngonna be using right off the bat.\n\n378\n00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.650\nAnd then we can kinda throw some\nother ones in along the way.\n\n379\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.390\nAnd this is actually a good\npoint here too, by the way.\n\n380\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:26.310\nThe client may sometimes tell you\nwhat tools that they want to use.\n\n381\n00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:34.010\nYeah, I have seen that type of stuff\nhappen, or heard of that stuff happen.\n\n382\n00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.080\nI've never had that happened to me,\nto be honest.\n\n383\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.600\nSo what I have had happen, is, I agree\nwith what you're saying, the client\n\n384\n00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.660\nwill specify what tools to use, cuz they\nmight be mitigating a previous finding,\n\n385\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.650\nand attempting to reconstruct\nthe original findings to compare results.\n\n386\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.201\n>> Try not to compare apples to oranges if\nyou had somebody come in and do a test,\n\n387\n00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:54.826\nand they used a certain tool,\nthey got a set of results.\n\n388\n00:20:54.826 --> 00:20:57.779\nYou think you've fixed them, and\nso you want someone to come in and\n\n389\n00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:00.649\nuse the same tools to see if those\nresults have changed, maybe.\n\n390\n00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:04.144\n>> Yeah, it very well could be that.\n\n391\n00:21:04.144 --> 00:21:09.364\nThe situations that I've had that\nkinda sorta talk to this is the client\n\n392\n00:21:09.364 --> 00:21:14.236\nwill have me come in and has a report\nthat they generate in XYZ tool,\n\n393\n00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:17.803\nwhatever it is,\nthey'll bring that in and say,\n\n394\n00:21:17.803 --> 00:21:22.762\nthis is what our guy found, or\nthis is what we found when we ran this,\n\n395\n00:21:22.762 --> 00:21:26.418\nand we're concerned, and\nwe'll talk about it.\n\n396\n00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:30.029\nThey will not usually tell me,\nwell we want you to run the same tool.\n\n397\n00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:32.970\nWhat they're gonna say is, well,\ncan you double check this?\n\n398\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.360\nOr, do a more thorough\nassessment to see if this is it?\n\n399\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.350\nOr, is more problems we have here.\n\n400\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.960\nSo, I will use whatever tool I want and\n\n401\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.990\ntechniques I wanna use to do a thorough\nexamination to see what the problems are.\n\n402\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.790\nAnd once i have that,\nthen I will get my report and\n\n403\n00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.520\ngive it back to them and\nrecommend changes.\n\n404\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.034\nAnd what they'll do is they'll take\nmy report the buy recommendation on\n\n405\n00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:00.665\nchanges such as they are.\n\n406\n00:22:00.665 --> 00:22:04.854\nImplement those, and\nthen they, themselves,\n\n407\n00:22:04.854 --> 00:22:08.027\nmay take that same tool and rerun it.\n\n408\n00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:12.319\nIt's within their rights to say,\nhey, can you run this yourself,\n\n409\n00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:14.969\nthe same tool, yourself, and check it?\n\n410\n00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.120\nI might tell them,\nif they were to ask something like that,\n\n411\n00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.610\nwhich I haven't, if they were to ask me,\ncould you run the same tool?\n\n412\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.620\nI might tell them well,\nI have my own stuff that does the same\n\n413\n00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.450\ntype of thing and I will go ahead and\nuse those tools instead.\n\n414\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.390\nIf you're okay with that.\n\n415\n00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.670\nAnd I can't see a client saying no.\n\n416\n00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.990\nClients, usually, if they're calling\nyou [INAUDIBLE] or as the expert,\n\n417\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.520\nmore than likely, they're just gonna say,\nokay, well, we called you as the experts\n\n418\n00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.930\nso you go ahead and you do what's\nappropriate, what you feel is appropriate.\n\n419\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.520\nAnd so, I'll take it from there,\nbut they could ask us,\n\n420\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.570\nit's well within their rights.\n\n421\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.250\nAnd you're right, that does happen.\n\n422\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.150\nI haven't had it happen to me, but they\nvery well could do that sort of thing.\n\n423\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.820\nWho knows?\n\n424\n00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.480\nMaybe I'll have someone put\nthat to me in the future.\n\n425\n00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.390\nI just haven't had it yet.\n\n426\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.980\n>> Well, Sean,\n\n427\n00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.698\nI tell you looking at our clock we're\ngetting a little low on time here.\n\n428\n00:23:12.698 --> 00:23:16.078\nDo we wanna take a look at these\ntools in our next episode?\n\n429\n00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:18.549\n>> Yeah, I think that's the best thing.\n\n430\n00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:21.830\nI wanted to give an overview of\nthe different categories of tools so\n\n431\n00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.345\neveryone is on the same thing,\nwe talked in our first segment about what\n\n432\n00:23:25.345 --> 00:23:29.170\nweb applications are and\nsome of the issues revolving around them.\n\n433\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.140\nAnd now, because we have so many tools, I\nwanted to use this segment to talk about,\n\n434\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.640\ngive you an overview of the different\ntypes of tools that we have.\n\n435\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:40.630\nAnd that was a very high level look so\nwhat we'll do is,\n\n436\n00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.260\nyeah we should do another segments now\nlooking at the individual tools, so\n\n437\n00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.520\nyou can really get a good look at\nwhat these are and even go ahead and\n\n438\n00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.210\nconfigure them yourself, and try them out.\n\n439\n00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.470\nSo, that's what we'll have coming up.\n\n440\n00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.490\n>> Sounds like a plan to me.\n\n441\n00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.080\nAll right.\n\n442\n00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.160\nWell, you heard it ladies and gentlemen.\n\n443\n00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.400\nWe're gonna call it there for\nthis particular episode.\n\n444\n00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.680\nWe hope you enjoyed watching it.\n\n445\n00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.583\nRemember, stay tuned,\nwe've got another episode coming up.\n\n446\n00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:05.867\nWe're gonna take a look at some of the\ntools we can use to do our web server and\n\n447\n00:24:05.867 --> 00:24:08.791\nweb application testing,\nso stay tuned for that.\n\n448\n00:24:08.791 --> 00:24:11.845\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n449\n00:24:11.845 --> 00:24:12.983\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n450\n00:24:12.983 --> 00:24:14.875\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n451\n00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:20.090\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Rodrick.\n\n3\n00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.060\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.140\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.790\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:19.920\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130\nReady for another exciting\nepisode in our Kali Linux series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.110\nAnd in this one, it's gonna be\na continuation of a previous episode.\n\n9\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.170\nWe've been going over some\nof these web analysis tools.\n\n10\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.750\nSo, if you missed those previous episodes,\nmake sure you go back and check those out.\n\n11\n00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.180\nWe kind of did a high level overview of\nsome of the different tools that we can\n\n12\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.280\nbring to bear against web servers and\nweb applications.\n\n13\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.138\nAnd before that, we talked about just\nthe general concepts of what a web server,\n\n14\n00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:44.170\nweb application is.\n\n15\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.180\nThe client server relationship,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n16\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.280\nAnd in this episode we're gonna actually\ntake a look at these kinds of tools and\n\n17\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.070\nsee some of the information that we might\nbe able to get back on a web server.\n\n18\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.525\nSo Sean, where the heck do we start?\n\n19\n00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:02.312\n>> We've got so many different\nplaces we can start so I figured\n\n20\n00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:08.220\nwe'd start by showing probably a new\ntool to a lot of you if not all of you.\n\n21\n00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.755\nDefinitely one we haven't seen in any\nof the security stuff that we've done.\n\n22\n00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:17.170\nIt's kind of related to the some\nof the other tools we have used.\n\n23\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.490\nIt is one called Vega.\n\n24\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.505\nWhat Vega does for us is Vega is,\nit fits in a category what they\n\n25\n00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:29.795\ncall webcrawlers so if you're going under\nthe menus in there you'll see webcrawlers.\n\n26\n00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.675\nNow it's more than just a webcrawler in\nthe sense that it's going through and\n\n27\n00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.765\nlooking at a website and telling you\nwhat the structure of it looks like.\n\n28\n00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:39.585\nYeah, it does that but there's much,\nmuch more that it does.\n\n29\n00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:43.925\nIt actually combines the ability\nof something that's crawling,\n\n30\n00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:45.540\nspidering the site,\n\n31\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.440\nit puts that together with something that\nis basically a vulnerability type scanner.\n\n32\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.182\nIt's got that.\n\n33\n00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:55.795\nSo it's really kinda giving you some\nreally,really good information here.\n\n34\n00:01:55.795 --> 00:02:00.770\nNow the thing is,\nthe scans do take a little bit of time.\n\n35\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.960\nSo I have taken the liberty of starting\na scan prior to us starting here.\n\n36\n00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.418\nSo that's one of the reasons why we\nhad a little longer break there.\n\n37\n00:02:11.418 --> 00:02:12.277\n>> Well, we appreciate that.\n\n38\n00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:13.148\n>> Well,\nthat's what I'm telling all these guys.\n\n39\n00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.654\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> They don't know that I was out there\n\n40\n00:02:15.654 --> 00:02:16.781\nscrewing around.\n\n41\n00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:22.714\nBut anyway, so\nwhat I'm gonna do here is on my machine,\n\n42\n00:02:22.714 --> 00:02:27.530\nI have already gone ahead and\nloaded up Vega.\n\n43\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.363\nNow what you see here is,\nyou see the results of a scan.\n\n44\n00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:39.060\nAnd you can start a new scan,\nit's actually still scanning right now.\n\n45\n00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.450\nI started this not too long after we went\nto break, and it's still doing that.\n\n46\n00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.210\nSo, what's happening is,\nI started a new scan, it's doing its job.\n\n47\n00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.980\nI just kind of opened it up and\nsaid do your stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.279\nAnd-\n>> Did you give it the URL for\n\n49\n00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.310\nthe web server?\n\n50\n00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.150\n>> Yeah, I gave it the URL, you tell it.\n\n51\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.600\nYeah, this one I just told it,\nfor kicks, and I can stop that.\n\n52\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.840\nI told it just to go through and\ndo a quick scan of USA Today site,\n\n53\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.459\nso it spidered thing out and all that.\n\n54\n00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.490\nSo no problem there or anything, the stuff\n\n55\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.450\njust came out of publicly known stuff and\nall that.\n\n56\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.300\n>> He was calling USA Today earlier\nto say hey we're gonna borrow\n\n57\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.610\nyour website for a minute.\n\n58\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.125\n>> And I got an idea for\ntomorrow's little graph thing.\n\n59\n00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.831\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n60\n00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:37.251\nwhat we're seeing here is\nI ran the scan on it, and\n\n61\n00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:42.724\nwhat we're seeing is over here\non the upper left-hand side,\n\n62\n00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:47.565\nwe are seeing a list of these domains,\nsub-domains,\n\n63\n00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:51.800\nand stuff like that this thing links to.\n\n64\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.970\nSo it's just a straightforward thing,\nthere.\n\n65\n00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.580\nIt doesn't go out to all of them, at all.\n\n66\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.170\nWhat it does is, it just says, okay, here,\nI found some other sites this links to.\n\n67\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.910\nAnd it's kind of interesting when\nyou look at a site like this, and\n\n68\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.620\njust do kind of a cursory look at it,\n\n69\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.535\njust many sites out there\nactually has stuff fired out to?\n\n70\n00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:19.405\n>> Those might be banner ads or graphics\nthat are pulling from other sites or,\n\n71\n00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:23.425\nlike me on Facebook type buttons that link\nto other sites, and things like that.\n\n72\n00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:25.675\n>> Yeah, actually,\nwhen you look down the list,\n\n73\n00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:30.555\nyou see stuff like Google,\nthat would be like an ad network.\n\n74\n00:04:30.555 --> 00:04:33.740\nIt's grayed out because it didn't scan it.\n\n75\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.900\nThere's other ones in here.\n\n76\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.145\nCouple ones that start with API for\nsomething, so\n\n77\n00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.288\nit's somehow linking out to there.\n\n78\n00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.850\nProbably got some sort of\npartnership going on with them.\n\n79\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.828\nSome that looks like it has\nsomething to the Tennesseean.com.\n\n80\n00:04:51.828 --> 00:04:54.020\nI think that's another newspaper.\n\n81\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.700\nThere's a crosswords one.\n\n82\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.510\nI mean so there's a lot of\ndifferent things that they have.\n\n83\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.770\nInstagram, iTunes.\n\n84\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.040\nThey've got doing that.\n\n85\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.920\nSo there's so many.\n\n86\n00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.770\nThere's Twitter.\n\n87\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.760\nPinterest.\n\n88\n00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.440\nThey probably got,\nI saw LinkedIn in there.\n\n89\n00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.360\nThey probably got buttons on certain\nthings that they can do this\n\n90\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.930\ntype of stuff with.\n\n91\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.170\n>> And take a quick break from that, and\nget that question that Guido's asking.\n\n92\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.370\nIs there any sites you know of that you\ncan practice against or scan legally, or\n\n93\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.170\nis it more of a set up\nyour own test network,\n\n94\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.530\nget some of those vulnerable machines and\ndo it that way?\n\n95\n00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.635\n>> Yeah, there's sites that you can\nscan against legally out there,\n\n96\n00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:46.860\nlike one I know of it IT Pro's-\n>> [LAUGH] No, no.\n\n97\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.460\n>> No, that's not an authorization\nof that, all right?\n\n98\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.561\n>> We'll be editing that one\nout in just a little bit.\n\n99\n00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:55.300\n>> [LAUGH] Mute, mute, mute.\n\n100\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.020\n>> Mikayla put one up there,\npentestlab.org.\n\n101\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.860\nIt looks like they've\ngot a site we can go to.\n\n102\n00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.390\nThat's good.\n\n103\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.310\n>> Yeah, there's sites like that.\n\n104\n00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.520\nTo be honest and be serious about, yeah,\nthere are sites that you can do that with,\n\n105\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.465\nthat you can just go ahead and\nrun a scan against.\n\n106\n00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:13.310\nThey've put them out there for that.\n\n107\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:20.340\nSo if you need to do those sorts of\nthings, then by all means do that.\n\n108\n00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.340\nIn this case, with USA Today, I did it.\n\n109\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.905\nI know somebody there so I asked.\n\n110\n00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:29.760\n[LAUGH] I didn't just\nrandomly go through there.\n\n111\n00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.610\nI do know somebody there and I asked.\n\n112\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.942\nI'm like yeah, can I just use\nthis demo and he's like sure, so-\n\n113\n00:06:35.942 --> 00:06:37.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.939\n>> Yeah I didn't just like hey screw\n\n115\n00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:39.990\nit, watch.\n\n116\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.699\nAfter this let's go after the White House,\nlet's see what they do.\n\n117\n00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.750\n>> [LAUGH] I know the one that\nyou mentioned the other day,\n\n118\n00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.650\n[INAUDIBLE] Is a good one.\n\n119\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.450\nYou can set up your own.\n\n120\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.370\nYou can find trial software\ntypically to just set up your own.\n\n121\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.060\nA little bit more work, but it definitely\nkeeps you on the legal side of things.\n\n122\n00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.880\n>> Yeah,\nin fact stuff like Metasploitable, and\n\n123\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.840\nother ones we mentioned Sauron and a few\nother ones like that, they're designed for\n\n124\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.790\nthat specifically so you can test\nagainst them, and there are so\n\n125\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.950\nmany different forms of those tools, or\n\n126\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.060\ndifferent configurations of vulnerable\nmachines that you can test against.\n\n127\n00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.370\nI mean, they don't even have\nto be vulnerable machines.\n\n128\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.790\nThey could be some of those appliances\nthat some of these different vendors put\n\n129\n00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.810\nout with their own virtual machines on.\n\n130\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.606\nI mean, you might try just grabbing\nsomething they have with their own product\n\n131\n00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:35.458\non and drop it in and see what happens.\n\n132\n00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:39.548\nThat's not a bad practice to\ndo those sorts of things.\n\n133\n00:07:39.548 --> 00:07:43.580\nSo just something to consider\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n134\n00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.210\nBut I chose this one\njust because it's a site.\n\n135\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.443\nThe results here,\nI kinda tweaked them a bit to\n\n136\n00:07:51.443 --> 00:07:56.013\nget the kinda get results\nthat look interesting.\n\n137\n00:07:56.013 --> 00:08:01.245\nNow, don't count on these things actually\nbeing the gospel truth in real life.\n\n138\n00:08:01.245 --> 00:08:05.388\nI just went ahead and like I said, I\ntweaked these things to give us something\n\n139\n00:08:05.388 --> 00:08:08.394\nthat looks interesting for\nour demo here So, anyway.\n\n140\n00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:14.270\nSo we've got the upper left hand, we have\nthe overall website view as they call it.\n\n141\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.170\nThat gives us all those overall goodies,\nthen we see the scan alerts down\n\n142\n00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.120\nthere on the left hand side.\n\n143\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.210\nYou can see it's actually got,\nif these results were legit,\n\n144\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.960\nas far as being the truthful\nresults from that site.\n\n145\n00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.290\nWe look at it and say, okay, well high,\nthere's 191 high level things,\n\n146\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.559\nand this one, I stopped the scan,\nit's at 23% complete.\n\n147\n00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.454\nIn 23% complete, you got that many,\n\n148\n00:08:44.454 --> 00:08:47.920\nit's something that I'm gonna\nscrutinize a bit closer.\n\n149\n00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.310\nBut for here, like I said, it's been\ntweaked to get those results just so\n\n150\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.240\nwe can kinda see some variety here,\ninstead of just a small number of things.\n\n151\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.020\nI wanted something that\nlooked interesting.\n\n152\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.700\nSo you can expand the stuff out here and\nyou can see it breaks it into categories.\n\n153\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.514\nI got some cross-site scripting issues\nthat I could take a look at and\n\n154\n00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:07.510\nit says okay,\n\n155\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:13.240\nhere's specifically where the potential\ncross-site scripting problems are.\n\n156\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.300\nSo it's really broken those things out for\nus and\n\n157\n00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.660\nlet me kind of just drag that out a bit.\n\n158\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.150\nSo you can see,\nits got a few places where things,\n\n159\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.090\nyeah, you can have cross-site\nscripting concerns here.\n\n160\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.480\nSo, if these were factual\nauthentic results,\n\n161\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.730\nyou would be going to those locations\nsaying what is actually going on here.\n\n162\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.472\nOkay, now if I click on something,\nyou can see over on the right hand side,\n\n163\n00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:44.010\nthe window changes and it goes,\nhere's what I found at that location.\n\n164\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.399\nYou can see it's found, at a glance,\nit gives you a brief view of it,\n\n165\n00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.940\ntelling you what the problem is.\n\n166\n00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.570\nThere's the specific snippet of code\nthat it believes has a problem.\n\n167\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.460\nSo you would want to analyze that and\n\n168\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.430\ntake a look to see if there is a problem\nthat is of, that exists, first of all,\n\n169\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.680\nand second of all, is it a big enough\nproblem for you to have to address it?\n\n170\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.210\nOr can you leave it as is.\n\n171\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.220\n>> And I'm looking at the URL on that one,\n\n172\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.000\nit doesn't even look like it's a USA Today\nthing, so that could be a big eye opener\n\n173\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.600\nfor an organization when they have you\ndo a pen test against their web server.\n\n174\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.400\nThey might have even thought about\nvulnerabilities that might exist on\n\n175\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.390\npages that are linked or are providing\ncode for them and things like that.\n\n176\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.530\n>> Yeah, in fact, if you saw that,\nyeah, you're right,\n\n177\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.520\nyou'll look at that script\nsource that says gannett.cdn,\n\n178\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.630\nthat should be something that should,\nat the very least, raise an eyebrow.\n\n179\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.880\nIt's like, why is that there?\n\n180\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.630\nWell, Gannett is actually\nthe parent company of USA Today,\n\n181\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.910\nthe main publishing house.\n\n182\n00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:53.870\nSo by saying that it's suspicious and\nall that, yeah, it's suspicious.\n\n183\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.260\nIt's not what you were expecting.\n\n184\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.254\nIf you went in there, saw that,\nsaid it was suspicious and\n\n185\n00:10:58.254 --> 00:10:59.530\ndoesn't match what you'd expect.\n\n186\n00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:04.066\nI'd be looking it up and once I found\nthat, oh yes, parent company, I'm like,\n\n187\n00:11:04.066 --> 00:11:08.640\nokay, I'd rather check that than just say,\nnah, everything looks okay here.\n\n188\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.500\n>> See what happens when you do\na slack job in your cognizance,\n\n189\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.595\nI didn't even know that was the parent\ncompany, darn on, shame on me.\n\n190\n00:11:14.595 --> 00:11:19.385\n[LAUGH]\n>> This is one of those things you\n\n191\n00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:23.870\nfind out kind of just by\ndoing your poking around.\n\n192\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.740\nI didn't find it out\nbecause of pen testing.\n\n193\n00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.030\nI found it out because of doing\na couple of other things,\n\n194\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.240\nbecause I look at their\nsite fairly regularly.\n\n195\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.210\nBut their site, again,\nhas not only owns USA Today,\n\n196\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.270\nthey also license the content out to other\nsites and they also have a presence in\n\n197\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.270\nmany, many different markets like\nthese big media companies do.\n\n198\n00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.060\nSo where this fits into us is you can\nactually see situations where you\n\n199\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.600\nmight go to another site, I think that\nTennessean site is a good example.\n\n200\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.860\nI think if you type in that Tennessean\nsite and go there, it's actually looks,\n\n201\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.296\nit's branded as The Tennesseans\nas a paper for that region, but\n\n202\n00:12:04.296 --> 00:12:07.180\nit is actually looks extremely\nsimilar to USA Today.\n\n203\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.030\nIt's formatted the same way,\nsame portal look and everything.\n\n204\n00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.900\nIt's because they just basically said,\nhey, here you go,\n\n205\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.790\nrebrand it and put it over here.\n\n206\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.449\nSo, that's how I kind of found that out\nwhen I was running into news sites that\n\n207\n00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:19.306\nlooked the same.\n\n208\n00:12:19.306 --> 00:12:22.375\nI'm like, wow, okay, it's a good layout,\n\n209\n00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:25.860\nbut if everyone uses it,\nit kind of loses its magic.\n\n210\n00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.370\nThat's why.\n\n211\n00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.830\nBut, if I hadn't done that, I'd still,\n\n212\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.870\nI would be checking the same\nthing on why is that there.\n\n213\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.080\nI don't recognize that as\nan ad network immediately, so\n\n214\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.080\nthere's something else going on.\n\n215\n00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.280\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n216\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.680\n>> But yeah, you go right through and\n\n217\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.870\nyou could see that these are all\nthings that it sees as being problems.\n\n218\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.670\nAnd then we have shell injection issues.\n\n219\n00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.060\nIt's saying there's a problem here, and\n\n220\n00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.160\nyou could see what the description\nof the problem is.\n\n221\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.240\nIt says, yeah, there's a problem with,\n\n222\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.580\nit looks like a specific script and\nthe way it's maybe accepting data.\n\n223\n00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:01.940\nOkay, fine, well, we would take a look\nat that and see, okay, what's going on?\n\n224\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.770\nAnd look at the impact of this one.\n\n225\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.890\nIt says there could be a problem there.\n\n226\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.110\nNotice the operative word,\ncould be a problem there.\n\n227\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.710\nAnd it says,\nmay lead to unauthorized remote access.\n\n228\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.450\n>> Sounds severe.\n\n229\n00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.380\n>> Yeah, that's an eye-opener there.\n\n230\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.790\nLet's take a, let's kinda flag that\none to see if that really is the case.\n\n231\n00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.660\nWell, first of all, see if it really\nexists and then if it really exists,\n\n232\n00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.610\nwhat we can do to address it.\n\n233\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.290\nSo it's even telling\nyou how do you fix it.\n\n234\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.970\nWell those are very generic steps.\n\n235\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.270\nYou can probably figure out,\noh well hey, there's this problem,\n\n236\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.470\nI think might be there,\nlet's get a developer.\n\n237\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.820\nHave them look at it and\nsee what the nature of it is.\n\n238\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.620\nAnd then of course you've got your SQL\ninjections, which are very, very common.\n\n239\n00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.070\nThey've got those things broken out.\n\n240\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.880\nSays there's five of those existing.\n\n241\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.180\nSo if we open those things up.\n\n242\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.666\nI like that.\nThey're all in the horoscope pages,\n\n243\n00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:02.152\nit looks like [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n244\n00:14:02.152 --> 00:14:04.673\n[LAUGH]\n>> Except for one.\n\n245\n00:14:04.673 --> 00:14:08.451\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wonder if the horoscope people saw\n\n246\n00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:09.620\nthat coming.\n\n247\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.757\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wonder if they run their horoscope\n\n248\n00:14:13.757 --> 00:14:15.680\nsite on Oracle.\n\n249\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.440\nOkay, I had to go there.\n\n250\n00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm doing it.\n\n251\n00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.180\nAll right.\n\n252\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:18.695\nI don't care.\n\n253\n00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:21.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So all right.\n\n254\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.940\nSo you can see we've got the medium ones\nwe can keep going right on through but\n\n255\n00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.190\nI won't, but you can see this thing\ngenerated a pretty good report\n\n256\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.870\nof what's going on in this site.\n\n257\n00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.880\nI do like to see that because now\nI've got stuff I can see well,\n\n258\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.320\ndo I wanna take any of this stuff further.\n\n259\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.410\nHere's some medium ones,\ninfo problems, low ones.\n\n260\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.320\nYou can sit there and\njust browse through these things and\n\n261\n00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.750\nsee what you have and you can save\nthese results for later if you want.\n\n262\n00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.338\n>> Right.\n>> So a really, really great thing for\n\n263\n00:14:54.338 --> 00:14:57.890\nyou to have kind of in your arsenal.\n\n264\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:03.410\nThis is probably not gonna be\nthe stealthiest pen testing tool, but\n\n265\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:10.430\nit is something that is actually useful\nto you to kind of put into your toolkit.\n\n266\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.970\nIf someone tasks you with a gray or white\nbox type task, they know you're there and\n\n267\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.180\nyou know what their deal is, and you can\ngo ahead and run this, not worry about it.\n\n268\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.690\nA black box task,\nthis probably isn't the best\n\n269\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.220\nchoice necessarily because it doesn't\nreally add much in the way of options.\n\n270\n00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.548\nIt's just adjusting the scanning settings.\n\n271\n00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:29.320\nSo it's gonna really be\nhitting that hard and\n\n272\n00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.240\nheavy but\nit will get you some good results.\n\n273\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.090\n>> It's one of my kind of tools, right.\n\n274\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.810\nYou just type in a URL and you click scan,\nand you come back an hour or two later.\n\n275\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.350\nI like that.\nIt's just compiling all\n\n276\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.140\nof that information.\n\n277\n00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.440\nAnd not a lot of work,\nnot very difficult to configure, so.\n\n278\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.830\n>> Yeah, it's very simple,\nvery easy for you to use.\n\n279\n00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.860\nAnd there's some adjustments,\nby the way, you can do with the scan.\n\n280\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.450\nIt's not like they completely\ncut you loose on that.\n\n281\n00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.660\nAnd then you can do things.\n\n282\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.750\nThere's the actual target.\n\n283\n00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:03.429\nYou can set.\n\n284\n00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:07.659\nYou can choose a scope for it and\nsee how far out you want to make things so\n\n285\n00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:10.476\nyou can exclude certain\nParts of the website.\n\n286\n00:16:10.476 --> 00:16:13.658\nSay I don't wanna go look in there,\nso just leave that alone.\n\n287\n00:16:13.658 --> 00:16:18.420\nSo that might be useful.\n\n288\n00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.460\nI'll just leave the URL the same.\n\n289\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.230\nThen you can go over.\n\n290\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.860\nIt says okay,\nwhat modules do you wanna run?\n\n291\n00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.280\nAnd take a look, you can click in and\n\n292\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.180\nyou can tell it what specific\nthings you want to take a look at.\n\n293\n00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.320\nIf you take a look at the ones we\nhave hear you can see that it has\n\n294\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.240\na whole host of things already checked.\n\n295\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.070\nAnd if you're really paying\nattention to these things going by,\n\n296\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.410\nmaybe you don't see them all.\n\n297\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:51.520\nWe've got things for social security,\nsocial insurance number detector\n\n298\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.610\nso, but that's PII, so\nit's got that sitting there.\n\n299\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.440\nIf you kind of scroll up the list a bit,\n\n300\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.910\nyou can see that it's got a section in\nthere for that's not checked in for\n\n301\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.700\nchecking credit card information,\nto see if any of that is exposed.\n\n302\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.980\nSo it's already got modules to check\nsome of the things that might be of\n\n303\n00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:12.810\nconcern to us.\n\n304\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.990\nOr at least, should be concerns for you.\n\n305\n00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.940\nIf you're not, [LAUGH] if you're like,\nit ain't my credit card,\n\n306\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.920\nwhatever, I don't care.\n\n307\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.158\nIn fact, I'm gonna use it.\n\n308\n00:17:22.158 --> 00:17:27.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can check those things and\n\n309\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.130\nsee if they do it.\n\n310\n00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.960\nSo, once you've got your modules,\nyou can start setting identities.\n\n311\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.310\nYou can tell it if there's a specific\n\n312\n00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.230\nthing you wanna use to have you appear\nto as that site, you can do that.\n\n313\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.170\nYou can have it set cookies to say you\nwere there, wherever, if you want.\n\n314\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.730\nAnd once you're done with that,\n\n315\n00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:49.330\nyou can just keep clicking right on\nthrough and go ahead and do the scan!\n\n316\n00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.160\n>> Nice.\n\n317\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.750\n>> So you can see there's\nnot a ton you gotta put in.\n\n318\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.930\nNow, the thing is, it will take some time.\n\n319\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.110\nDon't count on this thing just all of\na sudden unless it's a very small site and\n\n320\n00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.040\nyou expect it to just go boom and be done.\n\n321\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.300\nSome sites, also, by the way, will not\nlet you go in and run this thing either.\n\n322\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.430\nAnd the reason for that is that robot.txt\nmay be there, and it may be stopping it.\n\n323\n00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.639\nSo this thing does respect that, and so\nif someone wants you to do a pen test and\n\n324\n00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:21.985\nthey have a robot [INAUDIBLE]\nthat's stopping that.\n\n325\n00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:25.445\nThey're going to need to temporarily\nremove that, rename it or\n\n326\n00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:31.435\nsomething to prevent this\nfrom reacting to that.\n\n327\n00:18:31.435 --> 00:18:33.115\nSo that is Vega.\n\n328\n00:18:33.115 --> 00:18:40.730\nIt's just one of the actual web\ncrawlers that we have Web crawler.\n\n329\n00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.686\nThat's what they call Spiderman.\n\n330\n00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:43.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n331\n00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.420\nthat's just one type of web crawler.\n\n332\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.940\nWe also have some other ones in there too.\n\n333\n00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:57.720\nJust FYI, you can see they got one for\nApache, they've got OWASP in there.\n\n334\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.210\nOf course, there is Vega.\n\n335\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:05.190\nWebScarab's one that\npeople do tend to like.\n\n336\n00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.150\nWhat WebScarab does, it's actually\nstarting up, is it's another utility.\n\n337\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:15.620\nIt can go through and help you go\nthrough and really kinda examine a site.\n\n338\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.470\nThis one,\nwhat's really neat about this one is.\n\n339\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.240\nAnd I won't go through about configuring\nthis one and working with it quite yet.\n\n340\n00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.920\nBut what this one does is that\nthis one could be useful.\n\n341\n00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.980\nYou can see things it can grab for\nyou, I mean session IDs.\n\n342\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.530\nThat would be useful if you could start\npicking out session IDs on this and\n\n343\n00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.850\nyou could start picking them out say okay,\nwell there's a pattern here.\n\n344\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.980\nI'm actually able to readily\njust see what the pattern is and\n\n345\n00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.390\nI can see it's re-using\nsession IDs in here.\n\n346\n00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.690\nWell, you see that we've got\nsuch a hijacking concern here.\n\n347\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.830\nIt's just all of a sudden\na big red flag came up.\n\n348\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.290\nYou know?\nBut you also have a built in fuzzer\n\n349\n00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.280\nas part of this.\n\n350\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.840\nSo you can use it for that, if you want.\n\n351\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.470\nIt's got stuff for SAML.\n\n352\n00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.640\nAnd just in case you don't remember SAML.\n\n353\n00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.145\nThat is for doing federation services or\nfederated services.\n\n354\n00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:10.813\nI always say federation,\nI guess I do too much Star Trek.\n\n355\n00:20:10.813 --> 00:20:16.405\nYou've got used, one of the things\nthat's used is federate services.\n\n356\n00:20:16.405 --> 00:20:18.535\nIt's used in other areas too.\n\n357\n00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:23.705\nIt's an XML based format that is used\nto set security associations and\n\n358\n00:20:23.705 --> 00:20:26.220\nclaims between applications.\n\n359\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.850\nSo Federation Services uses that to\nlink together things like active\n\n360\n00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.770\ndirectory with external applications so it\ncan share authentication stuff that way.\n\n361\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.900\nBut if memory serves,\n\n362\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.550\nI'm not a developer but\nI believe the Soap system uses that, too.\n\n363\n00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.420\nI might be wrong, so no one, like, freak\nout and tell me and go, yeah you're wrong,\n\n364\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.400\ngot 'em.\n\n365\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.050\nNo, I'm not 100% sure about that one\nbecause I'm not a developer, but\n\n366\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.320\nI think Sammell is used there too.\n\n367\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.760\nSo there's that deal and\nyou can see we have some other\n\n368\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.600\nservices just going right on through,\nit's extendable.\n\n369\n00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.750\nThere's some cross site scripting\nchecks it can do for you.\n\n370\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.030\nSo this is another one that's pretty\n\n371\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.240\npowerful as far as things that can\ncheck applications out for you.\n\n372\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.610\nAnd you can see it's got the spidering,\n\n373\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.700\nas far as the spidering goes, that's what\nVega does, but it includes other things.\n\n374\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.230\nAnd these other things you may recognize,\nfrom the burp suite,\n\n375\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.242\nthe burp suite does do some\nof these things as well.\n\n376\n00:21:28.242 --> 00:21:31.050\nThe Burpsuite will actually\nfeed stuff through,\n\n377\n00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.380\nwhen you browse something with a browser,\nthe browser puts\n\n378\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.720\nthe request through Burpsuite and\nBurpsuite goes out to the web.\n\n379\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.580\nAnd they go back and forth through\nBurpsuite as the man in the middle, and\n\n380\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.960\nthat gives Burpsuite the advantage of\nanalyzing as the traffic goes back and\n\n381\n00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.460\nforth or the headers.\n\n382\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.940\nSo you can kind of see the interplay and\nas a developer,\n\n383\n00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.920\nyou can see what that is and\nfix it when problems arise.\n\n384\n00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.407\nAs an attacker, you can see the responses\nand maybe make alterations, and\n\n385\n00:21:57.407 --> 00:21:59.830\nstuff like that,\nto go to a different part of the site or\n\n386\n00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:04.440\njust change what the site's\nsupposed to be doing normally.\n\n387\n00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.750\nSo this can have that ability too.\n\n388\n00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:12.550\nBut it's got plenty of stuff\neven outside those things.\n\n389\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:17.445\nSo I'm pointing it out just to\nkind of not to overwhelm you, but\n\n390\n00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:21.315\njust to give you an idea that, you've\ngot a broad range of capabilities even\n\n391\n00:22:21.315 --> 00:22:23.935\namongst the different products\nwithin a specific category.\n\n392\n00:22:23.935 --> 00:22:29.235\nYou've got a lot of things you can\nuse to really get that thorough and\n\n393\n00:22:29.235 --> 00:22:30.145\neffective test going.\n\n394\n00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:34.545\n>> Nice, nice.\nAll right, so we got a couple there.\n\n395\n00:22:34.545 --> 00:22:37.107\nAny others we wanna pull out and\nplay with?\n\n396\n00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:42.290\n>> Well I think with those ones,\nwith the web applications,\n\n397\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:48.750\nas far as the crawlers go, I think\nwe've hit the big ones with crawlers.\n\n398\n00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.930\nI definitely did wanna talk about Vega,\n\n399\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.680\nbecause they thought that was\nkind of a new, interesting one.\n\n400\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.770\nThen I want to talk about,\nlike you said, Web Scarab back there.\n\n401\n00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:07.070\nWeb Scarab are one of the reasons why I\nnow I bring that up here as that was one\n\n402\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.451\nthat was in the CEH course.\n\n403\n00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:16.580\nIt was mentioned in Analysis of\nWeb Servers and Web Apps, so\n\n404\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.110\nthat was mentioned there but\nwe didn't get to see it.\n\n405\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.860\nNow, that's what it actually looks like.\n\n406\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.880\nWe're not going to worry about using\nthat at this point in time, but\n\n407\n00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.480\nit is actually there.\n\n408\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.360\nCan we kill that box and box guys?\n\n409\n00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.210\nLet's take a look at that list\nwhile he's talking about it there.\n\n410\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:38.650\n>> Yeah let's zoom in on that a bit\nmore if we can just to make sure\n\n411\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.540\nbecause again my fat\nhead's right in the way.\n\n412\n00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.410\nIf I shaved that thing that glare\nwould blind you guys right now.\n\n413\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:52.820\nSo yeah there's our big, well our quote\nunquote big list that we have there.\n\n414\n00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.260\nSo Burpsuite, like I said,\nyou've still got that one ahead.\n\n415\n00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.288\nBut there's the other things that\nyou have specifically on this list.\n\n416\n00:24:02.288 --> 00:24:07.205\nAnd you've seen, by the way,\njust about everything I've picked so far,\n\n417\n00:24:07.205 --> 00:24:09.089\neven though it's not a ton.\n\n418\n00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:11.946\nThe stuff I've picked\nhas all been GUI based.\n\n419\n00:24:11.946 --> 00:24:15.640\nI don't think that there's really too\nmany that are command line based,\n\n420\n00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.930\nmaybe Directory Buster is I\nguess maybe it isn't either.\n\n421\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:24.740\nYeah, Directory Buster just\nbrought up its own GUI as well so,\n\n422\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.300\nthis is, like I said one of these\nareas they do have a lot of GUI based\n\n423\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.700\nstuff to help you out because there's just\nso many so many things that can be done.\n\n424\n00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.290\nIt's hard to kinda do this\njust off the top of your head.\n\n425\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.180\n>> And probably, to point out too,\n\n426\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.620\nthat some of these tools look like they're\ndesigned to scan servers and look for\n\n427\n00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.190\nvulnerabilities\n>> Some of them, like this one looks like\n\n428\n00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.790\nit's meant to take down a server, like\nbrute force attacks and things like that.\n\n429\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.330\nProbably need to make sure\nwe know what we're doing\n\n430\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.486\nwhen we pick the appropriate tool for\nthe situation.\n\n431\n00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:58.196\n>> Whitehouse dot, no I'm just kidding.\n\n432\n00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:05.560\nYeah, some of these things,\nthere might be a serious danger with that.\n\n433\n00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:12.420\nThis one if you set it too aggressive,\nyeah it possibly can do that.\n\n434\n00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.460\nActually what it would probably cause\nis a denial of service as it opens\n\n435\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.530\nup all these threads and\ntries to scan the directory structure.\n\n436\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:24.860\nIf it did that too aggressively, it's\ngonna slow down that and yeah you do have\n\n437\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.850\na danger there of some amount\nthat it could take that down.\n\n438\n00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.790\nSo, that's your testing.\n\n439\n00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.254\nI mean-\n>> What we've might be being paid to do is\n\n440\n00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:37.340\ntake that thing down.\n\n441\n00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.130\n>> Yeah, and test this in your lab.\n\n442\n00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.190\nAgain, I keep saying that, but that really\ncomes to you testing stuff in the lab.\n\n443\n00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.750\nMake sure you really understand what the\nimplications are because you can see in\n\n444\n00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.210\nthe lab pretty quickly if something\nlike this is firing out tons of traffic.\n\n445\n00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.660\nIf you have Wireshark or whatever your\nfavorite sniffer is sitting over there,\n\n446\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.020\nand all of a sudden stuff is just\nflying by at light speed, and\n\n447\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.380\nall you did is hit a single button and\nnothing else is happening?\n\n448\n00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.230\nYeah.\nThere's a possibility you could brute\n\n449\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:13.780\nforce or you could, denial of service\nsomething without even thinking about it,\n\n450\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.790\nand you wouldn't be the first\none that's done that.\n\n451\n00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:21.406\nI just don't want you to be the next one,\nso be careful with that.\n\n452\n00:26:21.406 --> 00:26:25.070\n>> Very good, all right well a lot of very\ngood tools available right here in Kali\n\n453\n00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.990\nto do our penetration testing\nagainst web servers, and\n\n454\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.300\nweb applications so we can find out\nwhere those vulnerabilities lie,\n\n455\n00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.270\nsee if they're susceptible to\ndifferent types of attacks.\n\n456\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.120\nWe talked about fuzzing, and\nwe talked a little about SQL injection.\n\n457\n00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.360\nWe've got a whole nother episode\nwe're gonna deal with some of those\n\n458\n00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.640\ndatabase vulnerabilities.\n\n459\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.835\nSo a lot of good stuff.\n\n460\n00:26:44.835 --> 00:26:48.370\nSean, anything else you wanna throw in\non our web tools analysis before we\n\n461\n00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.620\nwrap this one up?\n\n462\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:56.050\n>> At least on this, you know,\npart of it, with the web crawlers, no.\n\n463\n00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:59.330\nThere's not really anything else\nI want to throw in at this point.\n\n464\n00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.620\nI think we kind of, you know,\nhit what we needed to.\n\n465\n00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.630\nYou can go ahead and experiment with\nthe rest of them if you so choose.\n\n466\n00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.450\n>> Have fun set up web server and get your\nlittle sandbox going and fire away at it.\n\n467\n00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:13.580\nWell, we want to thank everybody for\n\n468\n00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.960\ntuning in, for now we are going to call\nit a wrap, so signing off for ITProTV.\n\n469\n00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.520\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n470\n00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.580\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n471\n00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.160\n>> And we'll see you next time!\n\n",

00:00:14.580\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.230\nAnd with me today, is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.650\nHow are you Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.510\n>> I am doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.230\nHow are you doing.\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.430\nWe've got another exciting episode of\nour Kali Linux series coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.370\nThis is a continuation,\nwe're gonna be talking more about some of\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.970\nthe tools we have available within\nKali to use against web servers.\n\n11\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.892\nWe're trying to do a penetration test\nagainst web servers or web applications.\n\n12\n00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:38.731\nSo if you missed the other part,\njump back into library,\n\n13\n00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.403\nyou'll see there's actually a part one,\npart two.\n\n14\n00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:44.840\nWe're on part three of\nour web server tools.\n\n15\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.290\nSo Sean, where do we start with this one?\n\n16\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.370\nI know we've already got the basics down,\nso\n\n17\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.770\nwe're just gonna dive right\nin to some of these tools?\n\n18\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.910\n>> Yeah, we're gonna move into yet\n\n19\n00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.470\nanother tool that is gonna do\njust something else for us.\n\n20\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.830\nAnd this tool we're gonna\nfind when we go under our,\n\n21\n00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.700\nand I've got this up on my screen here for\nyou.\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.120\nWe can just go full screen on this one,\nto make sure you got it.\n\n23\n00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.780\nWhat I have here is, I'm gonna go into\nthe Kali Linux web application section.\n\n24\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.350\nAnd what we're gonna do is when we\ngo through this, we are going to,\n\n25\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.290\nwhere is it?\n\n26\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.490\nRight down here under Web Vulnerability,\nyou're gonna see on this one, nikto.\n\n27\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.960\nnikto is a command line utility\n\n28\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.560\nthat you can see is gonna be used\nspecifically to test for vulnerabilities\n\n29\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.760\nin a web site slash web application,\ndepending on how you configure it.\n\n30\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.320\nThis actually is a,\nkind of a cousin, if you will,\n\n31\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.280\nto one on the windows side called Wikto,\n\n32\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.350\nand that one, if you remember that one,\n\n33\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.850\nthat was a nice GUI application,\nand it had different tabs in it.\n\n34\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.670\nYou could do Google hacks and\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n35\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.370\nIt's by no means a bad application,\nit does some other things, and\n\n36\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.750\nit does some of the stuff\nthat this one does.\n\n37\n00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.860\nThere's some crossover between the two.\n\n38\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.046\nBut there are some things\nthat are different.\n\n39\n00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:19.430\nSo if you've seen that one,\nthey're very close but\n\n40\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.660\nthere are some changes between the two.\n\n41\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.903\nSo in any case,\nthis one just probably fits more in\n\n42\n00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:32.220\nthe category of web\nvulnerability then Wikto does.\n\n43\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.620\nBut, hey, we can argue that, and we could.\n\n44\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.308\nWe're not, but we could argue that.\n\n45\n00:02:37.308 --> 00:02:41.160\nSo, [COUGH] anyway, so, what I've done is,\n\n46\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.340\nI have already run a scan for\nus with Wikto.\n\n47\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.550\nAnd I went ahead and\nused USA Today again as the site.\n\n48\n00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.600\nThis just did a quick\nreally easy sweep of it.\n\n49\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.870\nIf you look at the command line for\nthis one, the command line four,\n\n50\n00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.510\nall I did was I just did nikto -h,\nand said just look at that.\n\n51\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.280\nAnd so I'm finding a little more then\njust a little bit more than Google would,\n\n52\n00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.610\nif Google went through and\nlooked at all the content.\n\n53\n00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.920\nIt's just reading some stuff in the actual\nHTML code and saying, there you go.\n\n54\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.250\nWe're not really doing that much\nmore than a basic reconnaissance,\n\n55\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.850\nand just a little look\nat what we found there.\n\n56\n00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.650\nYou can go much deeper than this.\n\n57\n00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.883\nIf I was to go over to my other\nwindow here and do wikto- -help.\n\n58\n00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:34.579\nWell.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n59\n00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.299\n>> Nikto.\n\n60\n00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:35.879\n>> Or nikto.\n\n61\n00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.991\nYeah, all right.\n\n62\n00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.758\nIt's Friday.\n\n63\n00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:43.801\n>> [LAUGH] It's all the jumping back and\nforth between Windows and Linux, you know.\n\n64\n00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:48.700\n>> [LAUGH] So, in any case,\nwhat I've got here is,\n\n65\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.470\nyou can see it's got a fair\namount of options in it.\n\n66\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.770\nSo I could've really fine\ntuned this if I wanted to.\n\n67\n00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.140\nThere's really no reason for\nme to do that, cuz what I was looking for\n\n68\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.850\nto do here, and I don't wanna\nbe aggressive with their site.\n\n69\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.040\nI just wanna do a really cursory\nlook to generate some results,\n\n70\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.130\nto show you what they look like.\n\n71\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.240\nOnce you have a site that you've\ngot more of a blank check\n\n72\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.490\nto do what you want with it, then hey\nby all means, go ahead and do that.\n\n73\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.948\nBut this one I just did\na really cursory look at it and\n\n74\n00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:26.933\nthat's all the dash h does for us, but\nyou can see it's got plenty of other\n\n75\n00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.650\nthings that you can do If you\nreally want to tweak that.\n\n76\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.499\nYou can see we have SSL options in there,\nand there's different\n\n77\n00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:38.930\ntypes of plugins that we can do with\nthis thing to really get some results.\n\n78\n00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:45.110\nAll right, so what I've got is\nthere's my results out of nikto,\n\n79\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.870\nI would just dump this to a file normally.\n\n80\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.180\nI didn't do that here.\n\n81\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.690\nI just went ahead and\ndisplayed on screen, so\n\n82\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.770\nwe can kinda glance through it together.\n\n83\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.460\nAnd we're not gonna focus,\nAd nauseam on every line in there.\n\n84\n00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.280\nThere's really no need for that.\n\n85\n00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.000\nBut we're just kinda take a quick\nglance to see what it's retrieving.\n\n86\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.800\nSo you can see that, okay, got the target\nand then boom, it went right through.\n\n87\n00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.170\nThere's the IP, there's the host name,\nthe port, when it started the scan.\n\n88\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.967\nOkay.\nSo, and\n\n89\n00:05:14.967 --> 00:05:19.821\nthis did by the way during the break,\nas soon as we went to break.\n\n90\n00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:24.717\nI went ahead and typed that in,\nenter, and I was sitting over there,\n\n91\n00:05:24.717 --> 00:05:29.025\nit finished up just about a minute or\ntwo before we came back,\n\n92\n00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:33.433\nso give you kind of give you\nan idea of the performance of this.\n\n93\n00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.086\n>> For those of you that are watching or\nrecording,\n\n94\n00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.050\nwe took about a 15 minute break there,\nI think.\n\n95\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.160\n>> Yeah, somewhere in there.\n\n96\n00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.551\nAnd those of you who\nare watching the recording,\n\n97\n00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:45.612\nwhy aren't you watching it live,\neveryone else made it.\n\n98\n00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:46.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyway.\n\n99\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.010\nBut what we have is,\nyou can see the server, there we go.\n\n100\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.780\nThere's something a little different\nthan we expect, we see Engine X,\n\n101\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.715\nokay so they're running something\nother than Apache and IIS.\n\n102\n00:06:02.715 --> 00:06:04.810\n>> So there is another web server and\napplication.\n\n103\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.740\nYou weren't lying to us.\n\n104\n00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.561\nI didn't know.\n\n105\n00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:07.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's another one.\n\n106\n00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.370\nYou don't see it a ton, but you do see it,\nand occasion, it just pokes its head out.\n\n107\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.391\nSo I would've been more surprised\nif it had something like\n\n108\n00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.395\nNetscape sitting up there.\n\n109\n00:06:19.395 --> 00:06:20.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like this thing is\n\n110\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.780\nbroken I'm never using it again.\n\n111\n00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.962\nSo you can see in here,\nit tells me the server,\n\n112\n00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:32.115\nClickjacking, it doesn't\nhave any protection against\n\n113\n00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:37.540\nthat where it can do redirects and\nnonsense like that.\n\n114\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.050\nApparently they've done some\ntweaks to their headers.\n\n115\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.480\nThey've added some stuff to it,\nthat makes us not really recognize it.\n\n116\n00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.260\nBut, hey, no big deal.\n\n117\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.466\nBut you keep going through this, and\n\n118\n00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:56.450\nyou can see that they've done\nsome various things in here.\n\n119\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.131\nI kinda like when you\nget down here it says,\n\n120\n00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:05.042\nserver banner is changed from this to,\n[INAUDIBLE] we're\n\n121\n00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:10.510\ngonna go with that, but\nI'm gonna go with AkamaiGHost.\n\n122\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.150\nWho knows.\n\n123\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.280\nThey said they changed\nthe server banner from that,\n\n124\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.320\nthat could indicate that they just\nchanged their hosting solution maybe.\n\n125\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.480\nThey've moved it someplace or\n\n126\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.260\nthey've consciously made some edit\nthere and we're not really sure why.\n\n127\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.810\nMaybe they did move it\nfrom one place to another.\n\n128\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.270\nWho knows, but they've picked that up and\nthey've indicated that there's a change\n\n129\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.790\nthere, but\nwe're just going through results.\n\n130\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.640\nWe're seeing just all sorts\nof little things in here, but\n\n131\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.960\nit hasn't gone all that deep.\n\n132\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.278\nThis is just kind of like a quick\nscrape of the surface of the website,\n\n133\n00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:46.124\nand that's really it.\n\n134\n00:07:46.124 --> 00:07:51.496\nSo we have a big text list here, done.\n\n135\n00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:56.067\nLook at the scan time, 736 seconds.\n\n136\n00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:57.965\nThat's like three hours.\n\n137\n00:07:57.965 --> 00:08:02.156\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But hey, so we've Yeah,\n\n138\n00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:06.810\nso it's done a reasonable amount here.\n\n139\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.445\nAnd then it's giving us some information\nat the end that may be helpful to us.\n\n140\n00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:16.378\nIt says the security focus site and some\nother things that may be something that\n\n141\n00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:20.355\nwe wanna refer to for\nmore information on some of these things.\n\n142\n00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:27.185\nBut not a ton of stuff, but\nyou can see what it can actually do.\n\n143\n00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:33.270\nBut that's Nikto,\nsimple command line vulnerability scanner.\n\n144\n00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:37.990\nThere are ones that do way more than this,\nthis one can do way more than this.\n\n145\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.810\n[LAUGH] It's just that\nwe chose not to do that.\n\n146\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:47.223\nBut I don't think it's a bad one,\nit's very lightweight,\n\n147\n00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:50.520\nit does a decent job for what it is.\n\n148\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.300\nAnd so you might very well go ahead and\ncheck it out.\n\n149\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.470\nI've done different options\neverything on here and\n\n150\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.850\ngot some pretty good results off of it.\n\n151\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.570\nYou'll notice that this one\ndidn't give us more results.\n\n152\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:07.973\nNot just because I only set the H switch,\nbut you'll also notice when you get\n\n153\n00:09:07.973 --> 00:09:14.758\ndown towards the bottom there it mentions\nsome comments about limits being reached.\n\n154\n00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:18.862\nSo there was a certain point where it\nsaid, okay, you didn't actually code any,\n\n155\n00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:21.990\nyou didn't tell us to override\nany of the default limits, so\n\n156\n00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.680\nwe're just gonna cut it so\nthe scan doesn't go any further.\n\n157\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.820\nAnd a lot of them will do that because\nif the scanner gets too aggressive and\n\n158\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.720\ngets too deep and\nretrieves too many files, you're gonna\n\n159\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.000\nwreak havoc on the target and\nyou're gonna have a really messy scan.\n\n160\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.660\nAnd you're probably gonna end up\nwith more stuff than you need.\n\n161\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.280\n>> Right.\n>> So they try to set it conservatively\n\n162\n00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.660\nand if you wanna kinda bust out of that\nand make it more aggressive, you can.\n\n163\n00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:56.380\nAnyway, so that is what we have here for\nworking with Wikto.\n\n164\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.800\nAs far as the other vulnerability\nscanners we have in there,\n\n165\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.330\njust to kind of go through and\nmention these.\n\n166\n00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.590\nThe vulnerability scanners,\n\n167\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.670\nyou can see that we do have a bunch\nof other ones sitting on here.\n\n168\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.930\nWe can go fulls creen on this for you.\n\n169\n00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.270\nYou can see we have a bunch of other\nones that are residing out there.\n\n170\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:22.878\nThere is Vega, again, and there's some\nother ones, there's a SQL Server one.\n\n171\n00:10:22.878 --> 00:10:27.640\nThere is OWASP in case you haven't\never taken a look at this.\n\n172\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:35.630\nThis is another application for\nfor doing scans of a website.\n\n173\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.980\nSo this one's going ahead and this one's\ngot it's own GUI, everything for it.\n\n174\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.320\nThis is what replaced, and I'm starting\nthis up just to kinda give you an idea.\n\n175\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.730\nThis is what replaced that Paros Proxy.\n\n176\n00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.918\nAnd Paros Proxy,\n\n177\n00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:52.680\nthey just replaced it because it was\nkinda reaching the end of its life.\n\n178\n00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.280\nYou couldn't really upgrade it too much\nanymore and it was showing its age.\n\n179\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.469\nAnd instead of just going through and\nripping it to pieces and saying, oh well,\n\n180\n00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:07.272\nwe're gonna do this, this, and\nthis and kludging something together,\n\n181\n00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:10.448\nthey said,\nyeah we'll just kinda go through and\n\n182\n00:11:10.448 --> 00:11:14.590\ndo something else that gets\nthe results that we want.\n\n183\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:20.860\nAnyway, what I'm going to do is I am\ngonna go ahead and start this thing up.\n\n184\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.280\nSo there is OWASP doing its thing.\n\n185\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.809\nSince it just started I'll let\nit check for any updates so\n\n186\n00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:33.450\nif there's any new problems it wants\nto add to the database it's got that.\n\n187\n00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.610\nAnd you can see it,\nthis one's pretty easy to start up.\n\n188\n00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:44.980\nAll we have to do is for a URL we put in\nthe URL of whatever site we want to check.\n\n189\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.242\nAnd so I'll just go ahead and drop mine,\nthe same one I've been doing in here\n\n190\n00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:55.600\nbecause I'm not gonna do anything\nreally aggressive with this at all.\n\n191\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.750\nSo I can put that in there, see if\nthere's anything else I wanna add in.\n\n192\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.800\nAnd you can configure it a lot\nmore than what I've got here.\n\n193\n00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.930\nOnce I've done that,\nI can click my button for Attack.\n\n194\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.270\nAnd now what's going to happen is,\nit's going through,\n\n195\n00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.710\nyou can see it says it's\nspidering the content.\n\n196\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.300\nSo it's reading that site.\n\n197\n00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.010\nIt's just gonna build me a map of it and\n\n198\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.270\ngive me some basic ideas of\nvulnerabilities and that's it.\n\n199\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:25.260\nAnd so once we see that, we could see\nif we wanna go any further with it or\n\n200\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.810\nif we're good with what we have.\n\n201\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.360\nI would tell you when you're\nlooking at these tools,\n\n202\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.750\nthe thing you wanna kinda keep in\nmind when you run any of these is,\n\n203\n00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.350\ndon't just all of a sudden decide that\nthis isn't gonna be enough information.\n\n204\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.020\nSo if I just start this up don't just\nassume, oh well, this isn't gonna\n\n205\n00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.670\nbe nearly enough information for\nme to make a good judgement on it.\n\n206\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.810\nI'd consider starting with\nthe conservative settings and\n\n207\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.240\nthen see what that gives you.\n\n208\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.790\nAnd see if you really do need\nto ratchet it up higher.\n\n209\n00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.260\nOr if it's something that you can just\nleave right at those default settings for\n\n210\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.930\nhow many files and\nhow long it's gonna take.\n\n211\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.130\nBecause what you don't wanna do is you\ndon't wanna say well, it's only retrieving\n\n212\n00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.220\nthe first 20 results or something, saying\nthat's not enough, I want the first 200.\n\n213\n00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.780\nYou don't know what that's gonna do.\n\n214\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.688\nUnless you've really\ntested that thoroughly,\n\n215\n00:13:18.688 --> 00:13:20.230\nyou don't know what that's gonna do.\n\n216\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.960\nAnd that could cause the thing to\nsnowball out of control very quickly.\n\n217\n00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.610\nI've seen it happen with\npeople who are just like, oh,\n\n218\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.630\ngo bigger, go large on this one.\n\n219\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.965\nIt's like, no, no, no, no, no, relax,\nstart and kind of work your way up.\n\n220\n00:13:33.965 --> 00:13:36.775\nIt's a smart way to do it.\n\n221\n00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:38.825\nSo it's why it's doing it's whole deal.\n\n222\n00:13:38.825 --> 00:13:41.895\nYou can see down at the bottom\nis that little progress bar and\n\n223\n00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:46.513\nyou can see, we've been talking here for\na few moments, that only moved that much.\n\n224\n00:13:46.513 --> 00:13:51.105\nIt's going kind of slow here.\n\n225\n00:13:51.105 --> 00:13:54.205\nThis is a pretty decent sized site.\n\n226\n00:13:54.205 --> 00:13:58.900\nI can go ahead and stop that, but\nit's a pretty decent size site.\n\n227\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.350\nWhat we have down here at the bottom,\nI can just go ahead and drag this up here.\n\n228\n00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.488\nI think I can drag that up, okay,\nit's not letting me drag it up.\n\n229\n00:14:07.488 --> 00:14:10.788\nAll right so you can see that we can,\n\n230\n00:14:10.788 --> 00:14:15.629\nwe've got a bunch of tabs\ndown here that we can look at\n\n231\n00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:20.158\nour different parts of our\nscan such as they are.\n\n232\n00:14:20.158 --> 00:14:23.068\nDown here I can see what\nit actually scanned.\n\n233\n00:14:23.068 --> 00:14:27.019\nLooks like it's still stopping, I was\ntrying to switch over to the History tab,\n\n234\n00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:30.228\nbut it's still kind of stopping and\njust backing out of the scan.\n\n235\n00:14:30.228 --> 00:14:34.943\nWhich can happen, if it starts a process,\nit can actually say when it's\n\n236\n00:14:34.943 --> 00:14:39.908\nstarting that process, it can say,\nokay, I can't just kill it right now.\n\n237\n00:14:39.908 --> 00:14:43.658\nI have to complete that scan,\nthat thread's still running, so-\n\n238\n00:14:43.658 --> 00:14:44.965\n>> It stops launching into new threads but\n\n239\n00:14:44.965 --> 00:14:46.398\nit's gotta finish what it started there.\n\n240\n00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:50.224\n>> Yeah, it's all right in the middle\nof that transaction so it says, yeah,\n\n241\n00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:53.770\nI heard you, but I can't just go ahead and\nterminate this right now.\n\n242\n00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:58.640\nSo we'll be sitting here for\nawhile if we do that.\n\n243\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.552\nBut I'll let that one just go ahead and\n\n244\n00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:06.740\nsince it's still doing that I'll\nlet it terminate its whole deal.\n\n245\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.972\nBut this is the one, like I said,\nif you come down to any documentation\n\n246\n00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:17.820\nthat says Paros Proxy, just replace\nParos Proxy with this instead.\n\n247\n00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.291\nAnd the big reason why I make\na big deal about that is you'll\n\n248\n00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:27.982\nsee a lot of documentation\nthat pertains to the CEH\n\n249\n00:15:27.982 --> 00:15:32.910\nthat says Paros Proxy,\nParos Proxy, Paros Proxy.\n\n250\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.430\nI, even in my book, made a mention of it.\n\n251\n00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.057\nBut I also put a little box after it,\nsays by the way,\n\n252\n00:15:39.057 --> 00:15:42.865\nthat's basically deprecated,\nthat's out of date.\n\n253\n00:15:42.865 --> 00:15:48.070\nEC-Council wants you to know about it,\nbut fine, you have been briefed.\n\n254\n00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:55.430\nBut OWASP is what\nthe preferred tool is now.\n\n255\n00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:00.340\nSo don't use that in\nyour pen tests anymore.\n\n256\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.726\nUnless you've got a real good reason,\ndon't use that.\n\n257\n00:16:03.726 --> 00:16:09.177\nGo with OWASP to use all its stuff because\nthat's the one that's more capable.\n\n258\n00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:10.757\nThat's what's been kept up to date.\n\n259\n00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:13.364\nThat's the one that's gonna\nget you what you need to.\n\n260\n00:16:13.364 --> 00:16:18.629\nSo just FYI, when you see those\ntwo is that you generally\n\n261\n00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:24.015\njust replace Paros with OWASP,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n262\n00:16:24.015 --> 00:16:25.071\n>> Good.\n\n263\n00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.894\n>> Yeah, it's still going.\n\n264\n00:16:27.894 --> 00:16:28.918\n>> Still chugging.\n\n265\n00:16:28.918 --> 00:16:29.487\nGosh.\n\n266\n00:16:29.487 --> 00:16:30.855\n>> It's still stopped at that.\n\n267\n00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:37.014\nSo, wow,\nthat's an impressive little deal there.\n\n268\n00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:40.449\nSo, okay, so\nyeah it's still terminating that, but\n\n269\n00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:43.495\nI don't really need to go in and\nshow the other stuff in there but\n\n270\n00:16:43.495 --> 00:16:46.795\nthis kind of shows, this kind of gives\nyou an idea of what this one can do.\n\n271\n00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:50.405\nYou can tweak the heck out of that\nscan if you really wanted to.\n\n272\n00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:55.395\nThis thing generates detailed reports\non things for you if you want it.\n\n273\n00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:59.420\nIt will just do all that which is really,\nreally nice.\n\n274\n00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.350\nSo that is OWASP.\n\n275\n00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.150\nAnd by the way you can get this for\n\n276\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.650\nWindows if you Google OWASP, you'll go to\ntheir site and they have it on there too.\n\n277\n00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.910\nThey have a whole wiki up there too\nthat talks about different stuff.\n\n278\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.500\nThey keep this pretty much up to date.\n\n279\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.860\nNotice how when I started this up it said,\nyou wanna look for updates?\n\n280\n00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.230\nYeah, they keep the thing updated.\n\n281\n00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.500\nSo, they'll always have, or\nhopefully always have the latest and\n\n282\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.330\ngreatest, as much as they\ncan have the latest and\n\n283\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.766\ngreatest in there for\nyou to be ready to use.\n\n284\n00:17:29.766 --> 00:17:31.480\n>> Always good.\n\n285\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.678\n>> Yeah, that's what you wanna have,\nthe stuff changes pretty rapidly.\n\n286\n00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:40.400\nAnd then just to make\nreference to these other ones.\n\n287\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.830\nThere's your other list of tools\nif you wanna try these ones out.\n\n288\n00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.845\nLike I said, here's the Burp Suite.\n\n289\n00:17:48.845 --> 00:17:53.780\nThe Burp Suite, I will just bring this up,\njust briefly to\n\n290\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.710\nkind of show you what's going on,\nand what it's doing here with this.\n\n291\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.366\nThe Burp Suite, what's really neat\nabout it is, is that the experience and\n\n292\n00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:08.244\nfunctionally between this and Windows is\ngonna be exactly the same because this\n\n293\n00:18:08.244 --> 00:18:10.930\nwhole Burp Suite is written in Java.\n\n294\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.950\nSo you can literally take this\nthing right off of Windows and\n\n295\n00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.210\ndrop it on to Linux or vice versa.\n\n296\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.475\nIt will work exactly the same.\n\n297\n00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:21.040\n>> Nice.\n\n298\n00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.402\nYou don't need anything new except\njust to have Java loaded on your box.\n\n299\n00:18:29.402 --> 00:18:33.700\nSo, the Burp Suite has started.\n\n300\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.370\nIt's sitting there.\n\n301\n00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.975\nMy system must be getting angry at me.\n\n302\n00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:39.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can\n\n303\n00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.630\nsee all sorts of nonsense going on.\n\n304\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.150\nAll right, so there is your Burp Suite.\n\n305\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.950\nWhat Burp Suite has, is when you get\ndown to this whole thing you're gonna\n\n306\n00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.640\nsee that it's usually configured for you\nwhen you go through all this whole deal.\n\n307\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.890\nIt's usually already configured.\n\n308\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.330\nThe way you check is when you run Burp\nSuite you will go under this Proxy tab and\n\n309\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.950\nyou will see Options.\n\n310\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.550\nAnd what you're looking for,\nis you're gonna see a proxy and\n\n311\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:12.760\nyou can check this box, and you can say\nit's supposed to be running on this IP\n\n312\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.630\naddress that you recognize as\nyour loop back in port 8080.\n\n313\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.190\nThe way you use that is once that, and\nyou can change that if you want, but\n\n314\n00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.020\n127 is where you are.\n\n315\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.420\nI mean that's where it's residing,\nso that makes sense.\n\n316\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.594\nThe 8080, if that port doesn't work for\nyou, you can change it to something else.\n\n317\n00:19:30.594 --> 00:19:35.170\nBut what you do is, you're gonna go in and\nopen up your browser.\n\n318\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.520\nAnd when you go into your browser you will\ngo over to whatever browser you're using.\n\n319\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.100\nThis isn't just limited to Iceweasel or\nanything else.\n\n320\n00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.885\nThis can literally work\nwith any browser out there.\n\n321\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:52.055\nYou just have to go into\nthe preferences for the browser.\n\n322\n00:19:52.055 --> 00:19:58.427\nAnd wherever the settings are to change\nyour proxy, you will go in there and\n\n323\n00:19:58.427 --> 00:20:04.292\npunch in, hey this is the proxy you\nwanna use, and you'll say okay,\n\n324\n00:20:04.292 --> 00:20:09.071\nwell there's 127.0.0.0 and port 8080.\n\n325\n00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:12.270\nMake sure it's gonna use it for\nall protocols.\n\n326\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.360\nSo no matter what you do,\nyou want it to be routed through there.\n\n327\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.810\nAnd once we've got that.\n\n328\n00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.690\nThe thing I had with Iceweasel,\nit may be in your\n\n329\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.660\nbrowser too, is it said, No Proxy For.\n\n330\n00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.100\nWhen I went here earlier, the No Proxy For\n\n331\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.870\nactually had 127;local host.\n\n332\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.610\nAnd if you don't take that out of there,\nwhat's gonna happen is,\n\n333\n00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.090\nit won't use the proxy.\n\n334\n00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.790\nAnd therefore Burp Suite will do nothing,\ncuz you're bypassing it and\n\n335\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.910\ngoing out anyway.\n\n336\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.240\nSo you gotta take that out and say, for\n\n337\n00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.540\nevery protocol use the loop back,\nor use Burp Suite by doing this.\n\n338\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.170\nSo once we're done with that, so\nI've got the proxy IP and the port number,\n\n339\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.620\nI hit Okay, close out of this.\n\n340\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.088\nWhat should be happening\nnow at this point,\n\n341\n00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:06.156\nis I should be able to just\ngo over here and type in,\n\n342\n00:21:06.156 --> 00:21:11.137\nlike I'll do IT Pro,\nI'll do our website here.\n\n343\n00:21:11.137 --> 00:21:15.745\nAnd what I should see, if everything's\nworking the way it's supposed to,\n\n344\n00:21:15.745 --> 00:21:20.357\nshould actually see, it doesn't show\nmy proxy running on there right now.\n\n345\n00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:26.966\nBut what will happen is that, as this\nis going, as traffic's going back and\n\n346\n00:21:26.966 --> 00:21:32.056\nforth, You will actually see\nthe headers show up in here.\n\n347\n00:21:32.056 --> 00:21:34.920\nAnd so it's not a big deal.\n\n348\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.260\nThe proxy is not configured.\n\n349\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.153\nThe proxy, I just didn't turn it on.\n\n350\n00:21:38.153 --> 00:21:40.643\nBut what will happen\nunder typical situations,\n\n351\n00:21:40.643 --> 00:21:43.990\nother options where it says running,\nyou should just have that.\n\n352\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.274\nIf I go over here, it should be.\n\n353\n00:21:48.274 --> 00:21:49.948\nWhere is it?\n\n354\n00:21:53.301 --> 00:21:55.210\nTurn it on right now.\n\n355\n00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.551\nSo it looks okay.\n\n356\n00:21:56.551 --> 00:22:01.367\nBut anyway, when I check this in\nwhat will happen is, like I said,\n\n357\n00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:06.699\nIntercept will show stuff going Batch\nfrom this client out to the server,\n\n358\n00:22:06.699 --> 00:22:08.600\nand from the server back.\n\n359\n00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.549\nAnd what you'll have to do, is when you\nmake a request from the browser out,\n\n360\n00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:18.040\nevery request that goes, or anything that\ngoes either way, you'll have to say okay,\n\n361\n00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.200\ngo ahead, allow, allow,\nallow, allow, or reject it.\n\n362\n00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.870\nAnd reject it will literally drop it, so\n\n363\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.360\nthat will never go back to whatever\nside was supposed to receive it.\n\n364\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.010\nAnd you can even go down\nto that bottom part and\n\n365\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.470\neven edit those responses\nto get a different result.\n\n366\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.410\nIf you know what you're doing,\n\n367\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.840\nyou can edit those,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.140\n>> And get all sorts of stuff to happen.\n\n369\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.810\nFor developers, that can be just\na really awesome thing to have.\n\n370\n00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:46.120\nFor what we do,\nthat can give us inside information on how\n\n371\n00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.060\nthe application's working on the side of\nthe house that we don't normally see.\n\n372\n00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.785\nYou know,\nwe don't see those headers going back and\n\n373\n00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:55.410\nforth unless we specifically look for\nthem.\n\n374\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.100\nAnd so this will allow you to view them.\n\n375\n00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.350\nAnd you can go ahead at any point,\nyou're not using this,\n\n376\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.320\njust go ahead and click and\nturn the thing off and you're done.\n\n377\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.430\nAnd so you can leave your\nbrowser configured for it.\n\n378\n00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.108\nIf you turn Intercept off, it'll still\nproxy everything through Burp Suite but\n\n379\n00:23:10.108 --> 00:23:14.020\nit won't intercept anything\nanymore unless you tell it.\n\n380\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.420\n>> So tools like this, Burp Suite, OWASP,\n\n381\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.160\nyou're basically running your own\nproxy on your own machine, and\n\n382\n00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.230\nthen pointing your browser to that proxy,\nand then going out to the web.\n\n383\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.190\nAnd it's just giving you a chance,\n\n384\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.620\ncuz that proxy obviously gets all that\ntraffic, gives you a chance to intercept,\n\n385\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.450\nand analyze or modify.\n\n386\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:31.990\n>> Exactly.\n\n387\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.530\n>> Nice.\n>> That's exactly what\n\n388\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.310\nit's gonna do for you.\n\n389\n00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.490\nAnd you can see that this has a ton\nof other functionality into it.\n\n390\n00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.880\nWe don't have a reason to\nreally get into that right now.\n\n391\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.910\nBut there's a bunch of other\nthings we have in here.\n\n392\n00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:51.240\nSo this is a very,\nvery capable product, and it's free.\n\n393\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.917\nSo, you've got that one\nready to use free as well.\n\n394\n00:23:56.917 --> 00:24:02.669\nSo there's two of the big vulnerability\nscanners that you can get into and\n\n395\n00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:03.705\nreally use.\n\n396\n00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.740\nLike I said there's plenty\nof other ones on there.\n\n397\n00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.946\nIf you really want to go ahead and\ngo to town and try these other things.\n\n398\n00:24:08.946 --> 00:24:14.815\nI know Burp Suite, it tends to be one of\nthe more popular ones, as does OWASP.\n\n399\n00:24:14.815 --> 00:24:17.975\nA lot of people do like OWASP\nbecause it's able to check for\n\n400\n00:24:17.975 --> 00:24:23.045\na lot of the new vulnerabilities\nagainst that web based environment.\n\n401\n00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:24.475\nThere's other vulnerability scanners for\n\n402\n00:24:24.475 --> 00:24:28.800\nsure that also are good\nat doing vulnerabilities.\n\n403\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.960\nBut those are more one size fits all.\n\n404\n00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.440\nThis is specifically done for\nthat web environment.\n\n405\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.561\n>> And like with any vulnerability\nscanner, web vulnerability scanner,\n\n406\n00:24:37.561 --> 00:24:38.789\nOS vulnerability scanner,\n\n407\n00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:42.079\nit really comes down to making sure that\nthey keep their database up to date.\n\n408\n00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.135\n>> Yeah.\n\n409\n00:24:43.135 --> 00:24:47.450\n>> With an out of date database it's\nnot really gonna help me too much.\n\n410\n00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.210\n>> Yeah, it just won't.\n\n411\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:54.200\nIt'll just start checking for things and\nit'll do great at those things,\n\n412\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.550\nbut the new stuff, no it won't check for.\n\n413\n00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.770\n>> And those are old problems that\nhave probably been patched against.\n\n414\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.100\nI need to test against the new stuff.\n\n415\n00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.490\nThe stuff that's coming out yesterday and\ntomorrow and stuff like that.\n\n416\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.314\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n417\n00:25:04.314 --> 00:25:04.926\n>> Very good.\n\n418\n00:25:04.926 --> 00:25:08.020\nAll right, well Sean, today I saw\na lot of good information again,\n\n419\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.410\njust more tools we can use to take\na look at our web servers, and our web\n\n420\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.870\napplications that are running on those\nweb servers, looking for vulnerabilities,\n\n421\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.750\ntrying to find out if there's any way that\nbad guys can take advantage of those.\n\n422\n00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.490\nSo, anything else we wanna\nthrow in on this episode?\n\n423\n00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:29.400\n>> Hey go ahead and get cracking on these,\ntry it out and see what you get.\n\n424\n00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.490\n>> Yeah, fire up some of those VM's\nthat you can download that have known\n\n425\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.510\nvulnerabilities, set up your own web\nserver at your house in a VM and\n\n426\n00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.020\nfire these tools up, and\nstart practicing with them,\n\n427\n00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.580\nget familiar with how they work and which\nones give you the information you need.\n\n428\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.222\nYou'll probably need more than one\nto get everything that you want.\n\n429\n00:25:46.222 --> 00:25:49.810\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\ntime for us to wrap this episode up,\n\n430\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.240\nwe wanna thank everybody for\ntuning in and watching.\n\n431\n00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.540\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n432\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.516\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n433\n00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:56.581\n>> And

00:00:16.120\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.920\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.750\n>> Doing real good.\n\n6\n00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.550\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.550\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.370\nWe've got another exciting episode\nin our links series coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.185\nWe're going to continue talking\nabout tools that allow us to do pen\n\n10\n00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.835\ntests against web servers and\nweb applications.\n\n11\n00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:34.355\nIf you've missed the previous episodes\nmake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n12\n00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.495\nWe've already gone over quite a few tools.\n\n13\n00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.765\nSean, and\nyou've got more to show us, right?\n\n14\n00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:44.035\n>> Yeah, I am just going to show\na few more here to kind of give\n\n15\n00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:48.035\nyou a look at a few more\noptions that we have.\n\n16\n00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:54.280\nAnd I thought it'd be kinda\ninteresting to take a look at,\n\n17\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.700\nfirst of all, one called W3AF.\n\n18\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.106\nJust rolls off the tongue, I know.\n\n19\n00:00:58.106 --> 00:00:59.174\n>> [LAUGH] Doesn't it?\n\n20\n00:00:59.174 --> 00:01:01.110\n[LAUGH]\n>> I wish I thought of that.\n\n21\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.450\nSo, what this one does is,\n\n22\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.940\nthis is a piece of software that\nallows you to, again check for\n\n23\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.290\ndifferent vulnerabilities and do\ndifferent analysis on a site, and you can\n\n24\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.490\nactually customize it to tell it what type\nof checks you want to do against the site.\n\n25\n00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.120\nSo I think it's a really neat one and\nit's definitely worth a look.\n\n26\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.750\nSo, what I have done is I have gone ahead.\n\n27\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.450\nI have this brought up on my screen here.\n\n28\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.400\nThis is a w3af.\n\n29\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.590\nWhat you can, excuse me, what you can\ndo with this, is you can go in here and\n\n30\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.830\nyou can just punch in whatever\nyour URL happens to be.\n\n31\n00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.560\nSo whatever you want to choose.\n\n32\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.020\nYou can go in here and,\nshould I choose a new website?\n\n33\n00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.100\n>> Sure.\nLet's switch it up a little bit.\n\n34\n00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.610\n>> I don't know.\nI [INAUDIBLE] on top of my head and\n\n35\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.660\nit's always a mess.\n\n36\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.715\nSomebody give me a good website.\n\n37\n00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:00.543\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n38\n00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:01.043\n>> What's this?\n\n39\n00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:02.075\nWhite house?\n\n40\n00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:04.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n41\n00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.090\nI'm trying to think like\na small website I can use.\n\n42\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.460\nIt'll just be a small one to do\na really quick look at but, yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.320\nAll right.\n\n44\n00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.190\n>> Tried and true?\n\n45\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.420\n>> We'll do our ITPro.\n\n46\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.890\nThat's it.\nIt won't cause any harm.\n\n47\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.220\n>> If you guys lose connectivity and\nour video feed stops, you'll know why.\n\n48\n00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640\n>> Someone unplug the server,\nI want to get out of here for the weekend.\n\n49\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.600\nI can't believe you people\nare making me show up tomorrow.\n\n50\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.680\nAll right, so what you can do is put in\nthe target and, once you put in the target\n\n51\n00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.590\nall we've got to do is check off\nthe stuff that we want it to check.\n\n52\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.870\nI will tell you some of these things\nare kind of mutually exclusive and\n\n53\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.570\nit will tell you if you tag one.\n\n54\n00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.490\nThat is if you tag one that is\nincompatible with another one,\n\n55\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.110\nit'll bark at you and tell you hey,\nthat's not a good idea.\n\n56\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.930\nSo, if I was to just go through and just,\nyou know, check a few things on here,\n\n57\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.740\nyou can say, oh,\n\n58\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.390\nwell, now it's telling you hey, guess\nwhat, if you keep enabling this stuff.\n\n59\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.410\nSays if you enable all of them it's\ngonna take a long time to do this.\n\n60\n00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.190\nSo, it'll let you do it, but\n\n61\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.111\nsaying you may not wanna do this.\n\n62\n00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.169\n>> Hm.\n\n63\n00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.470\n>> And\nsomebody get me David's information.\n\n64\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.325\nI got a website I gotta check.\n\n65\n00:03:36.325 --> 00:03:40.058\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in any case what we're gonna do is\n\n66\n00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:43.008\nwe're going to check a few and\n\n67\n00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:48.206\nyou can see it's got different\nprofiles you can do.\n\n68\n00:03:48.206 --> 00:03:53.010\nYou can actually if you want you have\nthis empty profile that you can set\n\n69\n00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.380\nyour own settings on and reuse it.\n\n70\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.125\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n71\n00:03:56.125 --> 00:04:00.115\n>> Or you can grab your own profiles, or\n\n72\n00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:05.170\ngrab predefined profiles out of this list.\n\n73\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.470\nIf you see the profiles we\nhave on the left hand side,\n\n74\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.970\nnotice it's got the OWAS stuff,\nthe Open Web Application Security Project.\n\n75\n00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.050\nSo there you go.\n\n76\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.110\nIf you keep wondering when I say OWASP and\nwhat that means,\n\n77\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.660\nwhat it means is the name's too long,\nI'm not gonna say it more than once.\n\n78\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.640\nThat's what it means.\n\n79\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.935\nBut that's what OWASP means.\n\n80\n00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:29.975\nSo, its got some preconfigured\nprofiles on here.\n\n81\n00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:33.215\nIf you look at this one for\nOWASP, what does it have?\n\n82\n00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:36.577\nWell you can see it looks for\nthe top ten security flaws.\n\n83\n00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:40.287\nWell that's kind of cool, that it\nwill automatically check for those.\n\n84\n00:04:40.287 --> 00:04:43.627\nAnd you've got other ones in here\nthat do different types of audits.\n\n85\n00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:45.317\nYou can see this audit one.\n\n86\n00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:47.177\nWhat's it doing?\nChecking for SQL injections.\n\n87\n00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:53.797\nOS command, see if it can fire things\nat the OS through the website.\n\n88\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.630\nInsecure file uploads.\n\n89\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.140\nFTP anonymous uploads, stuff like that.\n\n90\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.940\nSo it's got some good stuff.\n\n91\n00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.230\nAuthentication stuff, remember\nthe password cracking stuff we did,\n\n92\n00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.858\nit'll check to see if you\nhave defenses against that.\n\n93\n00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:12.080\nBut you kinda get the idea,\nyou guys presumably have\n\n94\n00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.750\nKali downloaded you can go\nthrough all these later on.\n\n95\n00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.990\nAs you see fit.\n\n96\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.350\nSo, if i want to do my own profile,\nwhich I will go ahead and do,\n\n97\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.890\nI just will put in, I'll put in this URL\nand I'll do a very basic look at it.\n\n98\n00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.940\nIn fact, I'll just go ahead and do a,\noh the crawl is going to take awhile.\n\n99\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.480\nI don't think there's a ton\nof pages on ITpro site.\n\n100\n00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.470\n>> Right [LAUGH]\n>> But you can do that.\n\n101\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.680\nYeah, this one you can see evasion\ngoing past IPS's, you know,\n\n102\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.340\nit tells you right there\nwhat every one does.\n\n103\n00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.550\nBut you can still see what it does.\n\n104\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.390\nI'll do the grep one since it says it's\ngonna look for emails and stuff like that.\n\n105\n00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.810\nSo that's nothing that's a big secret or\ngonna cause any problems.\n\n106\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.698\nSo, what I do is I've got the target,\nI got everything what's ITpro.tv.\n\n107\n00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:05.010\nAll right, cool, whatever.\n\n108\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.900\nOkay, I'm not paying attention, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.170\nI'm an expert on security,\nnot installing stuff right.\n\n110\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.700\nSo, you can see its right in the search,\nyou can see\n\n111\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.830\nthe little kind of wheel spinning\nover there, so it's doing it's job.\n\n112\n00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.470\nAnd it can take some\ntime on what it's doing.\n\n113\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.110\nSo I'm just kinda clicking through here,\nseeing if there's anything,\n\n114\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.580\nseeing if it's giving me any issues.\n\n115\n00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.430\nIt's spitting stuff out, and I would tell\nyou the errors that this thing spits out,\n\n116\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.600\nor concerns it spits out,\none of the things that\n\n117\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.260\nthese scanners tend to do a lot of\nis they might make you freak out.\n\n118\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.850\nThis is something that I wouldn't\ntell someone that's a novice of this\n\n119\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.680\nstuff to necessarily look\nat these things too much.\n\n120\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.000\nBecause they're going to flip out\nlooking at this, going, oh my god,\n\n121\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.570\nwhen am I ever going to get rid of this?\n\n122\n00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.080\nWhat's going on?\n\n123\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.300\nThese things actually make it look like,\n\n124\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.150\nsome of these things are more\nserious than they actually are.\n\n125\n00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.340\n>> Yeah, really.\nSome of those vulnerability\n\n126\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.170\nscanners do seem to\nover-dramatize some of that.\n\n127\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.080\nI don't know if that's designed to really\nstress the point that you need to look\n\n128\n00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.100\nat this.\n\n129\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.400\nBut I've seen admins run some of these and\nsend you this page and go,\n\n130\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.810\noh my gosh Mike look at all\nthis stuff that I found.\n\n131\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.640\nI found this tool that said to scan\nour server and look at all this!\n\n132\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.850\nAnd then you can sit down with them and go\nokay, this is one that we can accept and\n\n133\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.980\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n134\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.450\nSometimes they do seem to get a little\ndramatic with the red and this\n\n135\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:42.130\nis a huge problem, you've got to fix it\nnow and a high risk, things like that.\n\n136\n00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.770\n>> You've got to know how to really\nturn your attention to this stuff and\n\n137\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.250\nsee you know, and do your research,\n\n138\n00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.170\nsee is that really the issue\nthat they're claiming it is?\n\n139\n00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:58.159\nYou know, so don't just all of the sudden\nassume because it shows up that you've got\n\n140\n00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:02.376\nsome big dangerous problem it's saying,\nhey this is something that,\n\n141\n00:08:02.376 --> 00:08:07.300\nPeople have it in the past as well as\nresearch has shown, could be a problem.\n\n142\n00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.810\nYou have to determine if it's\na problem in your case and\n\n143\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.980\njust how big of a problem is it?\n\n144\n00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.570\nThat's the things we're looking at.\n\n145\n00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.290\n>> And as a plan tester,\nthat's probably our responsibility, right?\n\n146\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.360\nTo take that report to them and\nexplain to them the severity and the risk.\n\n147\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.750\nSo, then they can determine whether\nnot they want to mitigate it or\n\n148\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.980\naccept the risk or what have you.\n\n149\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.110\n>> Yeah exactly right is that\nyou'd want to work with them,\n\n150\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.544\ncollaborate with them if they require and\ndetermine what needs to be done.\n\n151\n00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:38.470\nYou're telling you're\ngonna give me advice and\n\n152\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.550\nthen they can determine what\ntype of work is needed, and\n\n153\n00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.510\nif they really wanna go any further\nwith that and just leave it as it is.\n\n154\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.960\nAnyway, but that's just\nsomething to really think about.\n\n155\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.650\nAnd you ask kind of funny you mentioned\nabout seeing [INAUDIBLE] of the ports.\n\n156\n00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.600\nI can't tell you how many\ntimes I've seen that, too.\n\n157\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.763\nThey just flip out.\n\n158\n00:08:58.763 --> 00:09:01.884\n>> And they find some cool link on the web\nor some tool that their friend told\n\n159\n00:09:01.884 --> 00:09:05.371\nthem about and they run it against one of\nthe servers and they come running down to\n\n160\n00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:08.128\nthe IT department with this thing\nin their hand going oh my god,\n\n161\n00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:09.514\nwhat am I paying you guys to do?\n\n162\n00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:10.653\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n163\n00:09:10.653 --> 00:09:14.753\n>> Yeah,\nthey don't get the context of that tool or\n\n164\n00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:18.000\nwhat those results really mean.\n\n165\n00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.560\nI remember the MDSA or\n\n166\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.513\nwhatever in the hell first came out for\nlook what this says.\n\n167\n00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:25.647\nLook at how bad this things are.\n\n168\n00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:26.669\nRelax.\n\n169\n00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:28.960\nIt's not that bad.\n\n170\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.090\nYou don't even know what they stuff means.\n\n171\n00:09:31.090 -->

here.\n\n183\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.040\nSo, you know.\n\n184\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.650\n>> Tell us about ITPro.tv here.\n\n185\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.760\n>> Yeah, the things I'm seeing

and\n\n188\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.500\nit can help people find out about you or\nit's something that, you just,\n\n189\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.770\nmay be something that\nyou don't wanna put out.\n\n190\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.470\nBut I don't see anything that's\na major problem in here.\n\n191\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.910\nAnd you can see that it's\ngot some DNS stuff in here.\n\n192\n00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.590\nThat's fine.\n\n193\n00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.060\nYou know, okay, there's some DNS stuff.\n\n194\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.150\nThat's about thought was a concern.\n\n195\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.190\nOkay, whatever.\n\n196\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.320\nLet's look at one of the red ones\nto see what's going on here.\n\n197\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.678\nSecure content over HTTP.\n\n198\n00:10:55.678 --> 00:11:03.306\nOkay, well, don't know if\nthat's necessarily a problem.\n\n199\n00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:07.530\nIt says goes to vulnerable URLs are HTPS,\n\n200\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.280\nwell if that's really the case\nthen there is a concern there.\n\n201\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.584\nBut what makes me look at this and say,\n\n202\n00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:18.135\nI don't think this is a concern is that\nlook what it's got after it; HTTP.\n\n203\n00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.087\nAll of the.\n\n204\n00:11:19.087 --> 00:11:23.280\n>> Right\n>> But I would want to look at this and\n\n205\n00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.230\ninvestigate it a bit closer and see.\n\n206\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.500\nWhy it's saying that,\n\n207\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.860\nwhy, specifically this is something\nthat it chose to tell me about.\n\n208\n00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.810\nBecause it seems pretty obvious\nwhen you look at it, but, again,\n\n209\n00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.570\nyou would do your homework and\nsee what that actually means.\n\n210\n00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.250\nAnd so we can just keep kinda\ngoing through this list and\n\n211\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.810\nsee is there's anything else\nthat is jumping out at us.\n\n212\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.340\nAll right,\nI've got some shared hosting environment.\n\n213\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.630\nOkay, fine.\n\n214\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.630\nThat means there's other people\non the server where ITPro is\n\n215\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.000\nhosting their content, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.710\nThis isn't a bad thing either because,\nyou look at this thing, okay,\n\n217\n00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:09.090\nfine we've got some other domains out\nhere that are at the same IP address,\n\n218\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.360\nthat's not an uncommon situation.\n\n219\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.420\nThat's not a security problem perse.\n\n220\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.520\nWhat that would mean for\nus is if we saw that and said,\n\n221\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.950\noh, there's more than one web site\nbeing hosted at this IP address.\n\n222\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.940\nWell, I'm not supposed\nto have that situation.\n\n223\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.180\nMaybe for\na legal requirement you can't have that.\n\n224\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:35.716\nThen you'd say, this is something\nthat I need to do something about.\n\n225\n00:12:35.716 --> 00:12:39.126\n>> Where somebody had compromised your web\nserver was hosting their own webpage and\n\n226\n00:12:39.126 --> 00:12:40.239\nyou weren't aware of it.\n\n227\n00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:44.100\nSomething like that.\n>> Could be, it could be.\n\n228\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.930\nIt's just something to kind\nof do your checks on and\n\n229\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.520\nin here it says click jacking.\n\n230\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.480\nI don't see any really big\nproblems there either,\n\n231\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.140\nand to be honest,\njust like I ran this before.\n\n232\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.130\nI showed you guys.\n\n233\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.682\nI ran it and nothing here is a problem.\n\n234\n00:13:04.682 --> 00:13:06.658\nCause I didn't wanna put out\nstuff out there that was.\n\n235\n00:13:06.658 --> 00:13:11.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey, look, it's on video was wrong.\n\n236\n00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:17.060\nNow, I checked, and even though\nstuff's isn't red, it's not a concern.\n\n237\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:17.627\nIt's not a problem.\n\n238\n00:13:17.627 --> 00:13:22.242\nSo, that's something you'd want\nto do is go through this and\n\n239\n00:13:22.242 --> 00:13:25.450\nsee are these really truly issues for you.\n\n240\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.490\nSo, that is just like I said W3AF.\n\n241\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.202\nThis one does have some other\noptions in it available.\n\n242\n00:13:35.202 --> 00:13:37.010\nYou kinda play around with\nsome of these things.\n\n243\n00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.830\nIt'll let you go ahead and\nlog different requests for you,\n\n244\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.960\nlike I said you can change\nthe configuration of it.\n\n245\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.450\nYou can do a lot of stuff\ninside this tool if you want.\n\n246\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.210\nAnd this one does tend to be one\nof the more popular ones too, so.\n\n247\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.770\nJust keep that in mind as well.\n\n248\n00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.810\nI mean just the fact that you\ncan set up your skin, and\n\n249\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.770\ncustomize the skin to your liking\nis just a great thing to have.\n\n250\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.900\n>> Nice.\n\n251\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.653\n>> So that is the W3AF.\n\n252\n00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:05.386\nThe other thing I wanna talk about,\nhere, and\n\n253\n00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:10.820\nI'll go ahead and\njust quit out of this and get rid of that.\n\n254\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.750\nWhat I have is,\nI have this utility over here,\n\n255\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.010\nwhich is actually still kinda\ndoing its scan what this is,\n\n256\n00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.980\nlet me go right to the top, so\nthere's a lot of stuff happening here.\n\n257\n00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.760\nWhat this is the results\nof a utility called,\n\n258\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.490\nlet's just go up here, Golismero.\n\n259\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.590\nWhat this one does, I mean I like\nhow they call it the Web Knife.\n\n260\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.690\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah so,\n\n261\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.450\nthat just sounds intimating doesn't it?\n\n262\n00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:46.770\nWhat this one will do for you, and\n\n263\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:53.120\nI really dig this, is the fact that you\ncan run it by itself against a target.\n\n264\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.940\nSo, if I do Golismaro dash D and\nthen put in my website over here.\n\n265\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.660\nIt'll just do its basic checks\nagainst that website, and that's it.\n\n266\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.930\n>> Okay.\n>> But what makes this really neat is,\n\n267\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:14.870\nI'll go ahead and close this,\njust to give you a kind of a peek at this.\n\n268\n00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:21.860\nIf you go Golismaro what this is doing is,\n\n269\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:28.310\nGolismero actually has, let me see if\nI can bring up the whole help file.\n\n270\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.157\nIt's only giving me part of it here.\n\n271\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.990\nWhat this one can do, so\nI go up this list, okay.\n\n272\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.160\nSo, what we have is first of all, here's\nsome of the switches that you can use.\n\n273\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.706\nYou can tell it what to scan and all\nthat good stuff, okay, so that's fine it\n\n274\n00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:53.205\nis a scanners, it's designed to do that\nand those types of things for you.\n\n275\n00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:56.021\nYou can see it will do an actual\ngenerated report for you,\n\n276\n00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.733\nit has that functionality for it.\n\n277\n00:15:57.733 --> 00:15:59.846\nOkay, that's pretty cool.\n\n278\n00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:04.329\nBut as we go down the list in here,\nthis is kind of where it gets really\n\n279\n00:16:04.329 --> 00:16:09.778\ninteresting, is that, if you'll notice\nit starts referencing these plugins.\n\n280\n00:16:09.778 --> 00:16:14.460\nThose plugins, and they do have a list.\n\n281\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.650\nLet's see, the switch for it is, it's\n\n282\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:25.020\ngot the golismero plugins,\nso if I go golismero and\n\n283\n00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:30.190\nthen do, type in plugins, okay.\n\n284\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:38.600\nBut these plugins can do, and\nyou can tell it's on a short list.\n\n285\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.640\nWhat's really cool about these things is,\n\n286\n00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.180\nokay there's the top of\nthe list of plug-ins.\n\n287\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.430\nSo alright we go through,\n\n288\n00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.840\nthere's some of the plug-ins that\nare there, here's some other plug-ins.\n\n289\n00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.610\nNot all of these are loaded, and\nit won't run all of these for\n\n290\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.740\nyou until you load them.\n\n291\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.590\nOkay, so you can see in here\nit's got one for DNS resolver.\n\n292\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.190\nAnother one to see if\nthe domain has been hijacked or\n\n293\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.920\nsomeone has tried to\ncapture traffic from it.\n\n294\n00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:19.530\nFingerprint your web server, check it\nagainst an exploit database, geolocate it.\n\n295\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.737\nYou might be able to do that.\n\n296\n00:17:22.515 --> 00:17:26.193\n>> Yeah, it looked like if you scroll back\nup there it looked like some of the tools\n\n297\n00:17:26.193 --> 00:17:29.500\nwe've already run independently\nare actually part of this tool too?\n\n298\n00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.970\nOr it can go and\nrun those as well for you?\n\n299\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.040\nLike is in there.\n\n300\n00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.620\nnmap is in there, which we've seen and\nrun as independent tools.\n\n301\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.370\n>> You're absolutely right.\n\n302\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.680\nYou saw it right there is that\nthis one's got these other tools.\n\n303\n00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.420\nYou can see Showdance in there.\n\n304\n00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.660\nWe talked about that in our CEH.\n\n305\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.500\nSpiderfoot is another one that can go\nthrough and crawl through a website and\n\n306\n00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.020\nget detailed information.\n\n307\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:53.730\nThe harvester.\n\n308\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.370\nWell, we looked at the harvester already,\nso it's here.\n\n309\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.520\nThat's a plugin.\n\n310\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.240\nAnd there's Nikto right\nthere at the bottom.\n\n311\n00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.840\nSo what this amounts to, I mean,\nthere's nmap, you can get it Heartbleed.\n\n312\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.950\nYou can check for those things.\n\n313\n00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.630\nIt's got all these various things in here.\n\n314\n00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.960\nThat means that you can go through and\ndo something like that.\n\n315\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.985\n>> Mm.\n>> Cuz what it's doing is if you do\n\n316\n00:18:17.985 --> 00:18:22.170\ngolismero and\njust do golismero space dash h and\n\n317\n00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.200\nthen put in the target,\nall it's gonna do is check that target.\n\n318\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.110\nThat's it.\n\n319\n00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.360\nHowever, if you want wanna take it\na step further, you can now say,\n\n320\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.595\ngolismero dash d and\nit says I wanna use these plugins.\n\n321\n00:18:36.595 --> 00:18:39.665\nAnd you go through the list and\njust say, this plugin comma,\n\n322\n00:18:39.665 --> 00:18:41.395\nthis plugin comma, this plugin.\n\n323\n00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:45.875\nAll the ones you wanna use and then put\nin the target, and it will run the main\n\n324\n00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:51.070\ngolismero functionality and then it will\nrun each one of those plugins in turn.\n\n325\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.294\nAnd if you choose it will stick it\nall into a report and you're done.\n\n326\n00:18:54.294 --> 00:18:55.290\n>> Wow, nice.\n\n327\n00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.460\n>> So, that's what makes this one\nespecially powerful in the scheme of\n\n328\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.160\nthings, is that it's not\njust doing one thing,\n\n329\n00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.340\nit's doing multiple things if you so\nchoose.\n\n330\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.820\nNow, remember, the down side to that is if\nyou haven't already picked it up, you run\n\n331\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:17.190\nmultiple plugins like that, don't count on\nthis thing taking short amount of time.\n\n332\n00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.801\nBe conservative with it.\n\n333\n00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:23.761\nOne of the things we're taking a longer\nbreak here is I was trying to give you\n\n334\n00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:29.300\na look at results and give you something\nbeyond just what the basic golismero does.\n\n335\n00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.460\nWhich is basic golismero gives\nyou some good results but\n\n336\n00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.760\nthey're not that dramatic or striking.\n\n337\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.650\nSo I was like well let's see if I can add\nsome more stuff into it to show you just\n\n338\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.300\nkind of what one of these things\nlooks like and it was taking awhile.\n\n339\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.870\nWe were sitting back there and it was\nlike okay still checking, still checking,\n\n340\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.600\nstill checking.\n\n341\n00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.440\nWho knows how long it would have taken.\n\n342\n00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.240\nSo, I just killed it and said, okay well,\nlet's just go ahead and we'll end and\n\n343\n00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.650\nwe'll talk about it and then you guys.\n\n344\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.180\nYou can see the syntax to\nrun the extra plug ins.\n\n345\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.610\nIt's very easy.\n\n346\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.340\nYou can just do it if you want.\n\n347\n00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.760\nSo it's another very very nice tool for\n\n348\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.160\nyou to use to get some\ninteresting results.\n\n349\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.990\n>> It's always nice when you can find\na tool that combines multiple tools.\n\n350\n00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.370\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Gives you one interface or\n\n351\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.920\nin this case, that one command\nline interface to get used to.\n\n352\n00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.880\nAnd just run multiple tools at once,\nthat's a timesaver.\n\n353\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.581\nI can be working on other things while\nthat particular test is going on.\n\n354\n00:20:28.581 --> 00:20:32.212\n>> Yeah that's exactly the way\nI look at this is that,\n\n355\n00:20:32.212 --> 00:20:35.765\nyou have utility that\ncombines multiple things.\n\n356\n00:20:35.765 --> 00:20:40.200\nAnd so, when you look through the list on\ngolismero, if you've looked at that and\n\n357\n00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.928\nseen oh, the harvester is on there and\nI found that useful and Nikto,\n\n358\n00:20:43.928 --> 00:20:47.430\nI found that useful and\nyou found all these things.\n\n359\n00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.280\nNow you don't have to\nscript those things or\n\n360\n00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.150\ndo anything separately\nif you don't want to.\n\n361\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.760\nYou can just run this and\nit can run them sequentially for you and\n\n362\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.330\ngenerate a report and you're done.\n\n363\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.830\n>> Nice.\n\n364\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.950\nAlways good.\n\n365\n00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.570\n>> Yeah, you've gotta like that.\n\n366\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.550\nI mean, that's the way I like it.\n\n367\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.434\nYou've really gotta like it.\n\n368\n00:21:06.434 --> 00:21:11.368\nAnd then just one other thing to point\nout here if you haven't already kind\n\n369\n00:21:11.368 --> 00:21:12.830\nof seen it.\n\n370\n00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:19.330\nRight there is look down here at the,\non the screen\n\n371\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:25.170\nyou see it says report plugins here,\nif you look at the report plugins.\n\n372\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.510\nJust look at what it's doing, it doesn't\njust puke this out into a text file\n\n373\n00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.060\nlike you can,\nit's not necessarily a problem but\n\n374\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.270\nit doesn't just puke it out into\na text file, you can choose that.\n\n375\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.230\nBut you can see here, it can do\nit in a lot of other formats too.\n\n376\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.916\nHTML, you can see LTSV for\n\n377\n00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:48.303\nputting into database I guess\nif you want to do that.\n\n378\n00:21:48.303 --> 00:21:49.754\nThere's some other ones.\n\n379\n00:21:49.754 --> 00:21:53.470\nLook at that\nODT Open Office Document format.\n\n380\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.530\nYou can take it into what,\nLibre office or Open Office and\n\n381\n00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.430\nboth of those will read that.\n\n382\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:03.470\nThen you can just say I want to render\nthe whole thing in text, or whatever.\n\n383\n00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.390\n>> That's nice.\n>> And once you're done, just exit.\n\n384\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.690\n>> Flexibility, that way you know whatever\nthe customer wants the report format to be\n\n385\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.870\nin, I don't have to worry\nabout converting things.\n\n386\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.590\nThis tool will output it into just\nabout anything, it looks like.\n\n387\n00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.540\n>> Yeah, that's why it\n\n388\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.530\ngives you a tremendous amount\nof flexibility in the format.\n\n389\n00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.480\nHeck, even if the customer wasn't going to\nsee this report, I immediately look at it\n\n390\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.340\nand say, well what if I wrote this\nout to something like an ODT file.\n\n391\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.740\nHeck I have LibreOffice on here\nI'll open an ODT file on there and\n\n392\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.670\nI can just copy and\n\n393\n00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:41.130\npaste the text right out of those into my\nreport instead of having to retype stuff.\n\n394\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.850\nI've got it just right in there so\ninformation I gather on a vulnerability,\n\n395\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.000\njust drop it right in.\n\n396\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.270\nMaybe I got to change a couple of\nthe wording here and there to make it more\n\n397\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.540\nunderstandable to the client I just\ndon't have to rewrite the whole thing.\n\n398\n00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.810\nI can tell them,\nyeah I used another tool to get this and\n\n399\n00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.420\nI used their description of it.\n\n400\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.860\nAnd I cleaned it up for\nyou, and that's it.\n\n401\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.360\n>> Perfect.\n\n402\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.480\nWell Sean, again another great set\nof tools we can use to analyze our\n\n403\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.690\nweb servers and then the applications\nthat are running on those web servers.\n\n404\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.370\nLook for those vulnerabilities that we can\nreport back in our penetration tests and\n\n405\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.980\nespecially that last one with\nall the different, we can\n\n406\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.960\ncombine those tools together as well\na various output methods that we can use.\n\n407\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.670\nSo that we can really support just\nabout anything that customer wants.\n\n408\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.210\nThat's fantastic.\n\n409\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.000\nAll right, well anything else we\nwanna throw in this episode before we\n\n410\n00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.690\nwrap it up?\n\n411\n00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.130\n>> Well, again,\ntry these things out in practice.\n\n412\n00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:41.650\nThe ones that we have shown you over\nthe past three segments here have been\n\n413\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:47.700\nthe ones that I tend to think are sort of\nthe better ones, or more interesting ones.\n\n414\n00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.540\nThey're definitely not the only ones.\n\n415\n00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.170\nYou guys know that, I know that.\n\n416\n00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.130\nSo you can go ahead and\ntry some of these other ones.\n\n417\n00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.040\nAnd see what they get you,\nand see if those results\n\n418\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.990\nare something that are gonna be things\nthat are gonna give you information\n\n419\n00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.870\nthat you can use to secure your system\nbetter or what have you in that case.\n\n420\n00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:13.420\nSo, yeah, just play around, experiment,\nsee what you get, and go from there.\n\n421\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:19.040\nThere's a lot of stuff going on with web\napplication or web testing utilities.\n\n422\n00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.910\nThere's so much you can do.\n\n423\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.820\nThis is a really cool thing.\n\n424\n00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.550\n>> Yeah, we brought it up in that very\nfirst episode in this series about\n\n425\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.900\nthe web servers and web applications.\n\n426\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.450\nSo many different combinations\nof the server platform,\n\n427\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.640\nthe applications that are running on it,\nbut now we've got a myriad of tools.\n\n428\n00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.922\nSet up your sandbox, and go to town.\n\n429\n00:24:35.922 --> 00:24:38.860\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this show.\n\n430\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.750\nSigning off, for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n431\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.651\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n432\n00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:43.988\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n433\n00:24:43.988 --> 00:24:50.160\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.930\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.810\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.360\n>> I am doing pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.580\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.550\nWe're kicking off another episode\nin our Kali Linux series.\n\n8\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.650\nIn this episode, we're gonna be talking\nabout something called SQL Injection.\n\n9\n00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.920\nAnd Sean, this is something that\nmany websites have to worry about.\n\n10\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.570\nIt seems like today's websites\nare all database driven, so\n\n11\n00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.300\nthey've got some type of\ndatabase behind them.\n\n12\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.450\nAnd so we need to be able to test to\nmake sure that that database is, or\n\n13\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.930\nthe web app, and the web server and\n\n14\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.360\nthe database behind it aren't susceptible\nto this type of attack, right?\n\n15\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.560\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n16\n00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.395\nAnd it's very much true that\nthere's a wealth of websites\n\n17\n00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:58.560\nnowadays that are running a database\nof some sort as their backend.\n\n18\n00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.934\nIt just allows for\na more dynamic and more immersive\n\n19\n00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:07.930\nexperience when people look\nat that website and visit it.\n\n20\n00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.751\nThey can retrieve information,\nthey can do queries of different sorts,\n\n21\n00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.640\nthey can do just all sorts\nof really cool things.\n\n22\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.130\nAnd then you can even extend\nit beyond an individual site.\n\n23\n00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.179\nAnd they are even nowadays having\ndatabases across multiple sites and\n\n24\n00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.775\norganizations all pulling information\nfrom one another to even give it a better\n\n25\n00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:27.810\nexperience.\n\n26\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.740\nWhich some may find kinda scary and\nthey tie all this stuff together.\n\n27\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.860\nAnd so it's something that you as a pen\ntester are gonna have to at least\n\n28\n00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.890\nhave some familiarity with, to be\nable to do some basic pen tests with.\n\n29\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.827\nSo we've got a fair amount of tools inside\nof Kali that can help us do this and\n\n30\n00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:50.892\nreally kind of check to\nsee what conditions exist.\n\n31\n00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:54.812\nSo we've got tools that can\nhelp us test SQL injections.\n\n32\n00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:58.536\nAnd then we also have just to\nmake sure we're clear on this,\n\n33\n00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:03.450\nwe also have tools that we saw way earlier\nin our segments that are specifically\n\n34\n00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.652\ntargeted towards testing\ndatabases themselves,\n\n35\n00:02:06.652 --> 00:02:11.202\neven without the SQL injection part\nbeing anywhere near that equation.\n\n36\n00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:15.534\nSo I mean, we looked at one that cracked\npasswords, and extracted UIDs, and\n\n37\n00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:16.990\nall that from Oracle.\n\n38\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.720\nIt was purpose built for that.\n\n39\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.960\nThere's ones for MySQL and\neven SQL Server.\n\n40\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.950\nThe big ones they've got\ncovered plus there's ones that\n\n41\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.035\nare really tools that are for working\nwith databases that are really agnostic,\n\n42\n00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:33.705\nthey'll work with any one out there.\n\n43\n00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:37.305\nBut do remember that we got ones for\nworking with the web apps that are driven\n\n44\n00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:40.005\non the backend by a database,\nand then we have stuff that\n\n45\n00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:44.785\nalso goes towards the database\nitself without the web application.\n\n46\n00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.445\nFor what we're doing for\nthis section though,\n\n47\n00:02:47.445 --> 00:02:52.340\nis we're just really focused\non the SQL injection part.\n\n48\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.040\nAnd what a SQL injection is, what leads to\nit and then kind of discussing what tools\n\n49\n00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.140\nyou have available to you and\nwhere that could take you.\n\n50\n00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.975\n>> All right, so\nwhen we talk about SQL injection then,\n\n51\n00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:07.135\nwe're really not talking about a flaw\non the database server itself, right?\n\n52\n00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.735\nI mean it's doing what it's supposed\nto do, so SQL injection, Sean,\n\n53\n00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:12.775\nthat's more on the application side and\n\n54\n00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:16.140\nthe way it processes and\nhands off data to that database.\n\n55\n00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.730\n>> Yeah, in theory you could have\nsome flaws in the backend that\n\n56\n00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.260\nare making it worse,\nI guess is the way to really look at it,\n\n57\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.140\nit's kind of bringing it to a level that's\neven nastier than it would be otherwise.\n\n58\n00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.710\nBut generally we're talking SQL injection,\nyou're talking something that,\n\n59\n00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.940\nsomeone has taken a database and embedded\nit in some sort of web application.\n\n60\n00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.950\nAnd the construction of, or\n\n61\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.730\nthe merging I guess if you want to look\nat it that way, of the database and\n\n62\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.860\nthat frontend web application\nare making the problem come to light.\n\n63\n00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.250\nAnd if you really look at it closely, it's\nprobably however that person constructed\n\n64\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.810\nthat frontend is allowing the SQL\nInjection to occur in the first place.\n\n65\n00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.220\n>> Yeah, because you've got\nsome kind of web application,\n\n66\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.760\nmaybe users going to a log on page.\n\n67\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.880\nSo they've got a form on that webpage,\nand you can type in your username and\n\n68\n00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.368\nyou can type in your password, and\nthen you've got code on the backend\n\n69\n00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:13.700\nthat's maybe PHP, or\nwhatever you're using, MySQL.\n\n70\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.210\nYou've got some code back there on\nthat server that's generating a query.\n\n71\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.470\nThat's saying, hey, I want you to go\nlook up, in that database, Mike Rodrick.\n\n72\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.200\nHere's the password he typed in,\nlet's verify he typed the right password.\n\n73\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.690\nSo it's compiling that\ninformation that you inputted,\n\n74\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.450\nsending it back to that code.\n\n75\n00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.800\nThe code's doing what it's gotta do,\ngenerating the SQL statement, and\n\n76\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.620\nthen transmitting it to\nthe database server.\n\n77\n00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.328\nThe database server is just\nprocessing the information.\n\n78\n00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:39.320\nAnd it's supposed to look it up and\nsee if whether or\n\n79\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.625\nnot you used the right password, right?\n\n80\n00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:45.179\nSQL injection, instead of putting in\na password, I might put in a command that\n\n81\n00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.631\nsays, hey, select all from,\nsome kind of SQL statement.\n\n82\n00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.598\nAnd if you're not doing any checks on the\ndata that I'm putting in, or if that code\n\n83\n00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:56.683\non the backend is not looking for anything\nunusual, it's going to wrap up whatever I\n\n84\n00:04:56.683 --> 00:05:01.080\ntyped in and send it to the database and\nthe database is just going to execute it.\n\n85\n00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.850\nSo, if I said delete all or something like\nthat, that's really what SQL injection is,\n\n86\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.520\nis when we're getting our commands\nexecuted against your database.\n\n87\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.070\nAnd that should never be\nallowed to happen, right?\n\n88\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.940\n>> Yeah, that really definitely\nshould not be an event that\n\n89\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.780\nis allowed to proceed like that.\n\n90\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.300\nAnd there's a number of\nthings that can lead to it,\n\n91\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.800\nbut probably the biggest one is not\ndoing some sort of input validation.\n\n92\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.500\nWhen someone provides something to be put\ninto a form that's not checked to see,\n\n93\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.080\nis it what should be put there?\n\n94\n00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.370\nAnd then even further, is it sanitized\nbefore it goes into the database itself?\n\n95\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.240\nLittle mistakes like that which may not\nseem like a big problem at the time when\n\n96\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.970\nyou're developing the thing can\nlead to monumental problems later.\n\n97\n00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.880\nIn fact, if you really kind of look\nat the SQL injections as a whole and\n\n98\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.650\nlook at the impact they've had and\njust how high\n\n99\n00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.440\nup on the scale it is as far as\nseriousness, it's right in the top three.\n\n100\n00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.590\nIt's always in the top three of problems\nthat occur in the security field.\n\n101\n00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.320\nNow it's not something that\nhappens every day, but\n\n102\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.900\nit is something that when it happens,\n\n103\n00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.580\nthe results tend to be pretty spectacular\nwhen they occur, and we've seen that.\n\n104\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.270\nThere's been numerous cases\nwhere that's been the situation.\n\n105\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.760\nSony was one example there, plus a bunch\nof other ones you could point to.\n\n106\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.821\nI believe Home Depot in their\ndisclosure was one, and\n\n107\n00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:40.790\nyou can keep going on and\non and on and on, with this,\n\n108\n00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.140\nwith inadvertent disclosure\nof personal information.\n\n109\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.980\nAnd that causes a whole bunch of things\nthat that company now has to deal with.\n\n110\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.390\nThen there is the technical side,\n\n111\n00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.650\nyou have to figure out [LAUGH]\nwhy that actually occurred.\n\n112\n00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.470\nSo they got the legal, the technical and\njust customer confidence.\n\n113\n00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.220\nOnce you lose your customers it's very\nhard to get that trust back with them.\n\n114\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.790\nTarget saw that when\nthey had their problems.\n\n115\n00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.700\nSo, this is something that you\ndefinitely want to take care of and\n\n116\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.555\nmake sure it's really not something that\nexists and can cause you any nastiness.\n\n117\n00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:17.920\nCuz like I said,\nit's one of the top three.\n\n118\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.733\nIt's not necessarily the easiest thing\nto exploit, but when you can exploit it,\n\n119\n00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:28.380\nyeah, you really kind of notice\nthe pain pretty quickly with it.\n\n120\n00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.093\n>> Yeah,\nif they're doing that SQL injection again,\n\n121\n00:07:31.093 --> 00:07:33.253\nthey're just executing SQL commands and\n\n122\n00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:37.410\nI mentioned like maybe deleting a database\nor deleting rows out of a table.\n\n123\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.800\nThat would be bad for a business,\n\n124\n00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.530\nobviously, but\nmost likely they've got a backup.\n\n125\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.390\nThey might lose a little bit of time, they\nlose some orders and things like that.\n\n126\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.550\nIt's gonna be bad, but it is recoverable.\n\n127\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.070\nThe big issue is like you said,\n\n128\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.890\nif I'm not doing a delete\nstatement I'm doing a select.\n\n129\n00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.180\nThink about all the things that they're\nstoring on their customers, right?\n\n130\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.630\nHow many of you said\nremember me at this website?\n\n131\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.210\nHow many of you said store\nmy credit card number\n\n132\n00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.518\non file because I don't want to\nhave to break out my wallet or\n\n133\n00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:06.475\npurse and type it in every\ntime I go order something?\n\n134\n00:08:06.475 --> 00:08:09.360\nIt's just more convenient to say oh,\nstore it on file.\n\n135\n00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.390\nThat means Best Buy or Sony or\nTarget now has your credit card on file.\n\n136\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:18.570\nIf they're susceptible to a SQL injection\nattack, guess what they're gonna get?\n\n137\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.920\nYour credit card information.\n\n138\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.850\nThink twice about taking that easy way\nout about storing your credit card but\n\n139\n00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.490\nthat's the kind of thing that can\nhappen with these SQL injections.\n\n140\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.920\nThey're attacking that database, and\n\n141\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.390\nthat database is what stores\nall that information.\n\n142\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.590\nWhether it's customer information,\nhealthcare information, information about\n\n143\n00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.211\nproducts, and all the stuff that's\ndriving those dynamic websites.\n\n144\n00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:46.680\nWith SQL injection, they're basically\nable to run whatever commands\n\n145\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.760\nthey want against your SQL server, whether\nthat's removing things, modifying things,\n\n146\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.910\njust navigating somewhere else,\ntaking over the server itself.\n\n147\n00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:01.250\nOr the big one, retrieving data,\nunauthorized retrieval of information and\n\n148\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.810\nthat's what SQL injection can cause.\n\n149\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:11.600\n>> Also, if you recall from our\nexploration of this topic in the CEH,\n\n150\n00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.980\nyou'll recall that you can even go\nbeyond even just extracting data and\n\n151\n00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.060\nmodifying data and stuff of that nature.\n\n152\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.550\nYou can go right past the data itself and\nif that database is configured\n\n153\n00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.730\nincorrectly, or\nsomebody just overlooks something,\n\n154\n00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.500\nit is possible to execute commands all the\nway out to the operating system itself,\n\n155\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.000\nand even start mapping the network,\nand uploading and downloading files.\n\n156\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.960\nThat vulnerability is there,\n\n157\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.240\njust if someone has left a configuration\nsetting one way or the other.\n\n158\n00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:53.050\nIt could be, to go back to the beginning,\nis that always something regarding\n\n159\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.330\nthe web application and the merging of\nthe database and that front end itself.\n\n160\n00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.770\nThe majority of time it is but there's\nalso this other thing that when you\n\n161\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.360\nhave the database misconfigured, if\nsomeone does get through this, something's\n\n162\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.710\nmisconfigured in the back end, can just\nstep it up and make it even worse.\n\n163\n00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.910\nIf someone finds that setting,\nor finds that you missed it, and\n\n164\n00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:18.090\nthey are in a position where they\ncan get out to the operating system,\n\n165\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.648\nthey might very well choose to take\nthat route and go one step further.\n\n166\n00:10:21.648 --> 00:10:25.810\nOnce they're there and they've got access\nto the operating system they may very well\n\n167\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.510\nhave very,\nvery privileged access at that point.\n\n168\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.500\nIf they that then it's\nanybody's guess what they\n\n169\n00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.250\nwant to do at that point because the\nattacker really has kind of a blank slate,\n\n170\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.610\nthey can start creating new\nuser accounts for themselves.\n\n171\n00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.290\nThey can start uploading files to that or\n\n172\n00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.010\ndownloading files from another location,\nand then executing those on there.\n\n173\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.910\nThey could just do a lot that could cause\nyou to have a very, very, very bad day.\n\n174\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.610\nDo remember that there's other things\nother than just grabbing data and\n\n175\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.310\ncausing mischief on the database.\n\n176\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.080\nYou can go right on through into\nthe system itself and cause harm there.\n\n177\n00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.940\n>> Absolutely, scary, scary and\nit's surprising to see\n\n178\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.360\nhow many SQL servers are still\nsusceptible, there's lots of patching.\n\n179\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.060\nDepending on the version of it,\nif you're doing a Microsoft server,\n\n180\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.950\nor if you're using MySQL,\nthere's ways to secure against this.\n\n181\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.900\nAs Sean has stated earlier, one of\nthe biggest things that we can do is\n\n182\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.580\njust make sure that they're not\nallowed to even start the process.\n\n183\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.210\nIf I've got a field on a form on\na webpage and if I'm doing any\n\n184\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.680\nkind of checks on that to make sure there\nare no special characters or SQL commands.\n\n185\n00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.430\nBecause a lot of it has to do\nwith putting a couple of dashes\n\n186\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.920\nin there to make the SQL server think that\nit's a comment, to ignore everything,\n\n187\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.040\nthose kind of things.\n\n188\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.840\nIf you can prevent that they can't even\nstart the SQL injection attack, so\n\n189\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.770\nit's really easy to protect against yet,\n\n190\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.790\nit's surprising how many because you get\npeople that are, at least what I see,\n\n191\n00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.295\nSean, is you've got your database\nadmin setting up the database.\n\n192\n00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:02.875\nYou've got your web app developers\nover here that are working on that.\n\n193\n00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:05.865\nThey're talking to each other, saying we\nneed a database to store this and that and\n\n194\n00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:08.005\nthe other but\nthey don't really ever get together and\n\n195\n00:12:08.005 --> 00:12:11.195\ntalk about let's make sure that we're\nnot doing this, we're not doing that.\n\n196\n00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:15.255\nThose web app guys probably aren't\ndatabase people, they know their code and\n\n197\n00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:16.900\nhow to design these webpages.\n\n198\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.850\nThey're not real familiar with SQL other\nthan how to pass these commands pass to\n\n199\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.440\nit, so a lot of times it's\njust poor communications,\n\n200\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.400\npoor configuration that leads\nto the susceptibility of this.\n\n201\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.730\n>> I really think you hit the nail on the\nhead when you talk about the two groups\n\n202\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.189\nworking on this and maybe not sharing\ninformation as well as they should be.\n\n203\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.180\nI wouldn't be the least bit surprised\nto look at a web developer and\n\n204\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.620\nsay that they're not the best\nat knowing the SQL language,\n\n205\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.330\nnor do they understand\nthe intricacies of databases.\n\n206\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.250\nDatabases are not something anybody\nthat really knows a database is\n\n207\n00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:03.000\nprobably not going to tell you that's\neasy, it's just not going to happen.\n\n208\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.432\nThose two things are very complex and they\nusually have their own people that do it,\n\n209\n00:13:09.432 --> 00:13:11.568\nand if they're working together,\n\n210\n00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:15.501\nthey don't necessarily have\nreally good information sharing.\n\n211\n00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:18.425\nThat can lead to problems right there but\n\n212\n00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:24.015\nI would add into this whole thing is\nthe knowledge of the SQL language itself,\n\n213\n00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:29.003\nwhich really cuts to the root of this\nproblem if someone's able to get\n\n214\n00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:33.387\nthat access, and\nthe system's vulnerable to that.\n\n215\n00:13:33.387 --> 00:13:36.327\nThey have to know the SQL\nlanguage to do this, and\n\n216\n00:13:36.327 --> 00:13:40.507\nthe knowledge of the SQL language isn't\nsomething that is really good knowledge,\n\n217\n00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:44.577\nat least, i's not something that you\ncan just go out and find quite easily.\n\n218\n00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:49.177\nThere's people out there that have it,\nto be sure, and then there's\n\n219\n00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:53.120\neven a smaller percentage of that that\nknow it really, really, really well.\n\n220\n00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.107\nYou have to have a good\ncommand of this to really\n\n221\n00:13:57.107 --> 00:14:00.695\ntake advantage of these specific flaws.\n\n222\n00:14:02.263 --> 00:14:03.620\n>> All right, so let's take a look, Sean.\n\n223\n00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.500\nWe've kind of explained what\na SQL injection attack is, and\n\n224\n00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.640\nwe understand that concept now\nthat it's gonna allow somebody\n\n225\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.580\nto possibly send commands\nagainst my SQL database.\n\n226\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.490\nThey might do damage to that database,\ndelete it, retrieve records,\n\n227\n00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.020\ninsert information, create users, or\neven worse go beyond the database and\n\n228\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.730\nhit the server itself and\nwhatever they want to do beyond that.\n\n229\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.086\nBecause typically my database\nis behind my corporate firewall,\n\n230\n00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:33.700\nit's not out in my web server,\nmy front end, setting out that DMZ.\n\n231\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.910\nIf they've made it into my\ndatabase server that's my backend,\n\n232\n00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.710\nthat's behind the corporate firewall.\n\n233\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.620\nNow that I'm on the internal network and\n\n234\n00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.700\nthe damage they can do\nfrom there is tremendous.\n\n235\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.030\nThere's a lot of potential there.\n\n236\n00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.460\n>> Yeah, they've gotten pretty far if\nthey've gotten to that point where they\n\n237\n00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.910\npunch through and gotten through\na whole DMZ and gotten to that,\n\n238\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.190\nwhat I say is a soft candy center,\nand gotten into that database.\n\n239\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:05.710\nYou really do want to thwart that and\nthe challenge is for you as a pen tester,\n\n240\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:12.190\nis to be able to check for these things,\nand really get a good handle on,\n\n241\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:17.764\ndo those things actually exist, and\nwhat is the specific nature of them?\n\n242\n00:15:17.764 --> 00:15:23.200\nDo I have any recommendations or\nthe way to fix this?\n\n243\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.300\nNow, as a pen tester, I can sit here and\ntell you, go out and learn SQL.\n\n244\n00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.860\nOh yeah, sure, let's go out and\nlearn SQL, no problem.\n\n245\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.060\nAfter I learn how to do brain\nsurgery I'll take care of that.\n\n246\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.898\nI'm not necessarily gonna tell you to do\nthat, I'm gonna tell you should, at least,\n\n247\n00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:43.420\nhave a really rudimentary\nunderstanding of it.\n\n248\n00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:50.060\nThat's the very least you need and\nbeyond that you'll start to acquire more.\n\n249\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.050\nI don't expect you to be like a DBA.\n\n250\n00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.633\nIf you're not already one now, or\nyou don't have that in your plans,\n\n251\n00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:58.140\nI'm not gonna tell you to go ahead and\ngrab that.\n\n252\n00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.534\nBut you should have that understanding\nof what the SQL language is and\n\n253\n00:16:02.534 --> 00:16:04.780\nkinda what it looks like.\n\n254\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.768\nBut having said that, the other thing\nthat's gonna help you is that we do have\n\n255\n00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:14.700\ntools that check for those vulnerabilities\nthat can make it easier for you.\n\n256\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:20.701\nNow as far as Kali's concerned and\npen testing in general, we typically,\n\n257\n00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:25.570\nwe're gonna encounter three\ntypes of databases out there.\n\n258\n00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.593\nThere's going to be\nSQL Server from Microsoft,\n\n259\n00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:32.240\nthen they'll be Oracle sitting\nout there and then MySQL.\n\n260\n00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.420\nThose are the three.\n\n261\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.530\nYes, I am aware there's more\nthat that out there, but\n\n262\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.000\nthose tend to be the three that\nappear in the greatest numbers.\n\n263\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.930\nif you have something else than that,\n\n264\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.040\nit doesn't mean that you're\nleft out in the cold.\n\n265\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.330\nThere actually are tools in Kali\nitself that are completely,\n\n266\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:51.750\nI use the term agnostic.\n\n267\n00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.630\nThey don't care what you've\ngot in the back end.\n\n268\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:17:00.220\nAll they care is that you got a system and\nit uses SQL and they will test against it.\n\n269\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:06.470\nSo, we do have solutions that can\nwork with you and get a result.\n\n270\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.277\nSo, you don't need to\nacquire those really, really,\n\n271\n00:17:10.277 --> 00:17:14.980\nreally in-depth DBA and\nSQL development and skills of that nature.\n\n272\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.690\nI mean, if you want to, hey, that's\nyour call but you don't have to do that.\n\n273\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.115\nHaving said that, what we'll kind of take\n\n274\n00:17:25.115 --> 00:17:30.236\na look at is the types\nof tools that we have\n\n275\n00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:36.300\nsitting out there that can do SQL stuff.\n\n276\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.520\nPretty much the SQL stuff\nthat we're concerned with for\n\n277\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.620\nweb applications, they're all gonna\nbe tucked away under here under web\n\n278\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:48.820\napplications of that menu and\nunder our Database Exploitation.\n\n279\n00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.150\nThey're really easy to find.\n\n280\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.460\n>> You can see what we have on here and\nwe're not gonna\n\n281\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.350\nworry about writing all these\nagainst an actual web application.\n\n282\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.980\nI guess it is worthwhile adding when\nwe're going through this topic.\n\n283\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:15.190\nThis topic of SQL injection, we did go\nthrough it quite a bit, and the CEH.\n\n284\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.130\nThere were actually samples all in there.\n\n285\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.550\nSo if you wanna see, specifically,\n\n286\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.933\nsome samples of how that's working,\nIf you don't already know that or\n\n287\n00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:29.360\nyou wanna take a closer look at it or\nreview, that's already been done.\n\n288\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.620\nAnd it was done quite well over there.\n\n289\n00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.245\nIt was done quite well\n,cuz I didn't do it.\n\n290\n00:18:36.245 --> 00:18:38.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't touch SQL.\n\n291\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.860\nSo, I stay as far away from that as I can.\n\n292\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.622\nNo, my fingers like, no, no, no, no.\n\n293\n00:18:45.622 --> 00:18:48.120\nAll right.\n\n294\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.320\nSo we have this database\nexploitation section.\n\n295\n00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:59.876\nWhat we have here, the tools we have,\nwe have the aptly named BBQ SQL.\n\n296\n00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:00.854\n>> Oh my god.\n\n297\n00:19:00.854 --> 00:19:05.100\n>> [LAUGH] It's kind of a funny one,\na barbecue SQL.\n\n298\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.300\nIt's even got the tips for\na good barbecue,\n\n299\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.810\nwhich you can't really argue with that,\nright.\n\n300\n00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.490\nIt's got something for everybody.\n\n301\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:18.663\nSo, we have a tool out here,\nthis one specifically\n\n302\n00:19:18.663 --> 00:19:24.490\ndesigned to query a web app and\ntest against it.\n\n303\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.738\nSo, you can tell it what it's\ngonna go against in specific\n\n304\n00:19:28.738 --> 00:19:32.740\nparameters when it's going\nafter a web application.\n\n305\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.600\nSo, if you had a web application in mind,\nyou'd gather the information it has here.\n\n306\n00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.600\nWhere it is, the page, specifically\nthe form you're gonna be going after.\n\n307\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.300\nYou could put it there under URL.\n\n308\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.330\nAnd anything else you needed to\nput in to actually make that work,\n\n309\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.640\nyou could just drop that in here.\n\n310\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.280\n>> Yeah, you can see right there in that\nURL that it's creating, where it's going.\n\n311\n00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.996\nIt's got the http: and then index.php?\n\n312\n00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:57.672\nRight?\n\n313\n00:19:57.672 --> 00:20:02.500\nThat's gonna be that http, gosh I'm not a\nweb guy, I think that's a POST statement?\n\n314\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.480\nBut so you've got that username\nequals user, password equals, and\n\n315\n00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.380\nthen behind that you can see\nwhere they've got that injection.\n\n316\n00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.180\nThat's where that malicious code is gonna\nreside, so it's just gonna try to submit\n\n317\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.910\nthat to the URL, pop those in the fields\nand see what that database does.\n\n318\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.850\nOr see what that web application does,\nsee if it submits it.\n\n319\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.440\n>> So this is gonna be helping you out and\nautomate it.\n\n320\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.570\nAnd you can see it's pretty configurable.\n\n321\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.870\nI could go through this list in here and\njust choose a number and\n\n322\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.450\ndrop the appropriate information in and\nit would, in turn,\n\n323\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:39.630\nbe able to feed that to the web\napplication accordingly.\n\n324\n00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.370\nSo, I'll go back to the main menu.\n\n325\n00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:49.070\nThe other thing we have in\nhere as far as options go,\n\n326\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.570\nyou can see other deals that you\ncan have to export information,\n\n327\n00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.670\nmaybe use it and\ntest against something else.\n\n328\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.710\nYou can even see at the bottom the queries\nthat you can start throwing different\n\n329\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.550\ntypes of queries in and\neverything in there.\n\n330\n00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.180\nSo, you've got quite a bit of\nconfigurability in this specific tool.\n\n331\n00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.550\nThis tool should be fine working against\n\n332\n00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:17.730\nmost SQL server databases\nwithout really any problem.\n\n333\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:24.510\nOutside of those ones, maybe Oracle, stuff\nlike that, you may have limited success.\n\n334\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.180\nJust look at the name of the tool.\n\n335\n00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.090\nIt's a BBQSQL.\n\n336\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.140\nIt's designed for SQL Server.\n\n337\n00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.400\nI also think something that's\nworth mentioning if you haven't\n\n338\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.330\nreally paid attention to the color\ntext up top is if you look at it,\n\n339\n00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.750\nthis integrates with something else\nwe saw earlier on in our series.\n\n340\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.350\nIt integrates with the set\nsocial engineering tool-kit.\n\n341\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:53.200\nAnd underneath the menus there,\nwe didn't show it in here,\n\n342\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.900\nbut we did show the menus,\nbut we didn't show that\n\n343\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.040\nspecific option because we were gonna wait\nuntil now to talk about SQL injections.\n\n344\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.240\nBut you do have the ability to\nconstruct the social engineering\n\n345\n00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.770\ncampaign that brings in SQL\ninjections as part of it.\n\n346\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.750\nCuz maybe you can get\nsomeone to click on a link or\n\n347\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.770\nsomething like that will\ncarry on the attack for you.\n\n348\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.770\nSo that's kind of a neat\nthing that you have.\n\n349\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.010\nOnce you've gone through and\nyou've configured everything,\n\n350\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.100\nthen you can see it's as simple as just\ntap and five and boom it will start\n\n351\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.900\nrunning whatever you stuck in there\nagainst that SQL database and\n\n352\n00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:38.125\nspit back the results as it gets them.\n\n353\n00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:41.628\nJust in case you need to work with us,\n\n354\n00:22:41.628 --> 00:22:45.825\nit's got a pretty good\nhelp system in here.\n\n355\n00:22:45.825 --> 00:22:48.165\nNo, it doesn't have the help\nsystem really built in well here.\n\n356\n00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:54.925\nYou can see it's got right\nhere under the help section it\n\n357\n00:22:54.925 --> 00:23:00.200\ndirects you right to their their Github\nsite where you can get all sorts of stuff.\n\n358\n00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.230\nThey have Readme files and\nWord docs and everything up there.\n\n359\n00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.670\nReally documenting everything that you\nneed to know about this tool if you're\n\n360\n00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.640\ngonna deploy it as part of your pen test.\n\n361\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.920\n>> Yeah, that's a good one and\nthen you've got SQL Ninja and SQL SUS.\n\n362\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.200\nSo they've got a few different tools in\nthere that we can use to work against\n\n363\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.800\nthese web applications that\nmight be database-driven.\n\n364\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.890\nAs you said, here we're really\ntalking about SQL injection,\n\n365\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.260\nbut vulnerability analysis might be\nanother thing that we do at this point,\n\n366\n00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.060\nand they've got a whole bunch\nof database tools there.\n\n367\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.290\nThey got, as you were saying,\nthat Oracle scanner, and SQL map,\n\n368\n00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.730\nand the list goes on and on.\n\n369\n00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.182\nSo, lot of different options that\nwe could use to test that database,\n\n370\n00:23:44.182 --> 00:23:48.720\ntest that web application,\nsee if it's vulnerable to SQL injection.\n\n371\n00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.657\n>> Yeah, they've really\nbrought a lot to the table and\n\n372\n00:23:51.657 --> 00:23:55.794\nthe stuff that Mike's talking about,\nI open up the menu on here You know,\n\n373\n00:23:55.794 --> 00:24:00.170\nmaybe we can zoom that up here, you know,\nbecause you know I'm blocking it.\n\n374\n00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.996\nBut the part of the menu, you know,\nyou kind of get the idea though, and\n\n375\n00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:10.090\nyou can see just how many tools or\nare there for just checking the database.\n\n376\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.820\nYou know, so the cool think I like to\nthink of when you look at something like\n\n377\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:19.860\nthis is that they're bringing\na lot of stuff that can ease\n\n378\n00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.450\nthe burden that you would have had before\nhaving to type this stuff in manually.\n\n379\n00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.660\nThey've eased the burden of that,\nthey've made it so\n\n380\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.995\nyou can just get an understanding of these\ntools and start just shooting stuff,\n\n381\n00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:38.245\nyou know, at the database itself\nwithout having to do too much.\n\n382\n00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:42.885\nBut, once you get beyond there, beyond\njust doing the basic SQL injections to see\n\n383\n00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:45.575\nif it's vulnerable to it, then yeah,\n\n384\n00:24:45.575 --> 00:24:49.315\nyou're probably going to have to consult\nwith someone that really knows SQL and\n\n385\n00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:53.620\na web application developer to really\nget a good handle, you know, on it.\n\n386\n00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:59.530\nIt's also, just FYI, worth pointing out\nthat some of the stuff we talked about\n\n387\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:05.585\nyesterday, like we saw Vega yesterday and\nwe saw W3AF yesterday.\n\n388\n00:25:05.585 --> 00:25:06.810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n389\n00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:11.410\n>> If you recall,\nthose tools also included\n\n390\n00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.380\na section where they would say, there's\na SQL injection vulnerability here.\n\n391\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.490\nSo you actually have already\nseen some tools that\n\n392\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.980\nalso include the ability to check for this\nas part of their default functionality.\n\n393\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.960\nThey will find those and say boom,\nboom, boom, boom, boom, boom,\n\n394\n00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.792\nboom, yeah here's\nthe problems that we have\n\n395\n00:25:31.792 --> 00:25:36.630\nthat are Banner of SQL injections.\n\n396\n00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.340\nSo that's kind of a neat thing.\n\n397\n00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:43.060\nSo they got you covered, but if you're\nnot a SQL person, there's only so\n\n398\n00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:43.750\nmuch they can do.\n\n399\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.505\nThey're not going to hold your hand and\nwalk you through how to fix it.\n\n400\n00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:48.375\nThey're just going to say \"there you go\".\n\n401\n00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:51.995\nYou maybe stuck in a position where you\nhave to just present a report saying \"yes\n\n402\n00:25:51.995 --> 00:25:57.785\nyou are vulnerable to it\" and you give\nthe recommendation to have their DBA and\n\n403\n00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:03.157\ntheir webapp guy look at it, or\nyou may have to call a teammate or\n\n404\n00:26:03.157 --> 00:26:07.827\nsomething to have that you trust to work\non that with you to really kind of make\n\n405\n00:26:07.827 --> 00:26:12.387\nsure that you've got that properly\nassessed before you put it on your report.\n\n406\n00:26:12.387 --> 00:26:15.947\nSo, but\nthat's kind of the thing is that, yeah,\n\n407\n00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:22.130\nyou've got the bases covered here\nas far as SQL injections go.\n\n408\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.880\nYou'll also notice when you go\nthrough some of these tools\n\n409\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:33.430\nin here, this is one called\nSQL Ninja is another one.\n\n410\n00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.045\nThis works with several\ndifferent tools out there.\n\n411\n00:26:37.045 --> 00:26:40.375\nAnd what I kind of like about this one, or\n\n412\n00:26:40.375 --> 00:26:45.045\nI think it's worth actually pointing out\non this, is if you go through the list of\n\n413\n00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:48.222\nstuff that it can actually check for,\nyou've got this mode option.\n\n414\n00:26:48.222 --> 00:26:52.612\nThere's some stuff on here we already\ntalked about in the CEH as being\n\n415\n00:26:54.322 --> 00:26:57.002\npotentially problematic, specifically,\n\n416\n00:26:57.002 --> 00:27:02.782\nwhat have we got, right here,\nthe XP command shell.\n\n417\n00:27:02.782 --> 00:27:06.752\nWe were just talking a moment ago about,\nyou can get out to the operating system,\n\n418\n00:27:06.752 --> 00:27:08.812\nbe able to interact with\nit through the database.\n\n419\n00:27:08.812 --> 00:27:13.540\nWell, on SQL Server, the older versions,\nthis is still available as I understand,\n\n420\n00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.440\nit's even available in the newest version,\nit's just disabled in the newer versions.\n\n421\n00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.860\nThe older versions had this enabled by\ndefault, so if you didn't disable it, and\n\n422\n00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.090\nyou used and someone was doing a SQL\ninjection against you and found that,\n\n423\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.760\nthey could potentially push right on\npast the database into the OS, itself.\n\n424\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:38.010\nSo you've got the ability\nhere to check right for that.\n\n425\n00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.140\n>> It's a stored procedure,\nthat, if it's not disabled,\n\n426\n00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.280\nsomebody could definitely run,\nand launch a shell.\n\n427\n00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.300\nAnd when it sell command shell,\n\n428\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.210\nI mean that's a system level access\nshell that you could get to open up.\n\n429\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.390\nSo, very dangerous.\n\n430\n00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.060\n>> Yeah, so it's got a lot,\nyou know, here.\n\n431\n00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.750\nAnd then you could even see under\nthe mode as we go further down in here,\n\n432\n00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.700\nit's got the ability to integrate\nwith metasploit, you know so\n\n433\n00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.190\na tool that we're going to talk\nabout next week, other things.\n\n434\n00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:10.670\nBrute force the system admin account,\nit can go directly after that.\n\n435\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:16.150\nSo it's got some pretty powerful\nthings that it can do on its own.\n\n436\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.630\n>> That's a common one there, too.\n\n437\n00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.820\nI can't tell you how many databases\nI see set up that still use the old\n\n438\n00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.390\nmixed mode authentication, where you're\nnot just using Windows authentication.\n\n439\n00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.230\nYou're using authentication for accounts\nthat are stored on that SQL server.\n\n440\n00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.570\nAnd that SA account should be disabled.\n\n441\n00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.020\nIf it's not being used then you\nshouldn't use the mix mode anyway.\n\n442\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.430\nYeah, if somebody has that turned on\nthat's an easy one t hammer away at.\n\n443\n00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.130\nLots of good stuff Sean,\nyou know when we look at these databases.\n\n444\n00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:45.090\nDatabases are a big vulnerability and\nprimarily it's not the database itself\n\n445\n00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.470\nalthough, as we saw, there are tools\nwe can use because SQL, MySQL,\n\n446\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.510\nOracle, I mean there's still\napplications right, and\n\n447\n00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.450\nthey still have vulnerabilities,\nthey need to be patched.\n\n448\n00:28:55.450 --> 00:29:00.180\nWe've got scanners that we can use to scan\nthem, try to find those vulnerabilities.\n\n449\n00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.460\nWhen we're looking at SQL injection, as\nearly as that application, not processing\n\n450\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.100\nthat data or allowing certain commands\nto be sent back to that SQL server.\n\n451\n00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.210\nAnd so it comes to making sure that\nweb app is developed properly.\n\n452\n00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.490\nAnd as a pen tester, we're not so worried\nabout typically fixing the problem, right?\n\n453\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.810\nWe've got to find it and report it in.\n\n454\n00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.530\nKali gives us all the tools I need to do\nthat right here in this operating system,\n\n455\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:26.080\nso yeah, pretty easy to do.\n\n456\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.960\n>> Yeah, I would say I would agree\nwith your statement on that.\n\n457\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.230\nAs a pen tester, we're\n\n458\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.960\ntypically not expected to deal\nwith something like this.\n\n459\n00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.450\nThey might ask you for suggestions on it,\nbut you've got to kind of\n\n460\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:49.010\nreally find out if that's going outside\nyour scope of knowledge pretty quickly.\n\n461\n00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:53.640\nBecause a lot of pen testers\nthat I've encountered,\n\n462\n00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.710\nself included, not SQL experts.\n\n463\n00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:00.100\nI can tell you what SQL is, and\nI can go through the basics of it,\n\n464\n00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.330\nbut no I'm not going to get\ninto the nuts and bolts of it,\n\n465\n00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.030\nit's not something I have\nthat level of mastery of.\n\n466\n00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.490\nSo if you start asking me ways to fix it,\nunless you've got something misspelled or\n\n467\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:12.680\nsomething in there, I ain't fixing it.\n\n468\n00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.970\nSo it's not something that I have.\n\n469\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:21.910\nBut I do know people that know SQL, and\nare aware of those things that I can\n\n470\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:28.700\ncall on those expertise to make\nrecommendations If they were needed.\n\n471\n00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.040\nSo be prepared for that.\n\n472\n00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.330\nIf you're a sequel person, hey,\ngood for you if you can do that.\n\n473\n00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.470\nIt's not my thing, but maybe it's yours.\n\n474\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.027\nNo accounting for lunatics in this world.\n\n475\n00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:43.800\n>> [LAUGH] It's usually a lonely job,\n\n476\n00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.040\nbut everybody loves them\nwhen they need something.\n\n477\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.220\nAlright, so a lot of good tools in there.\n\n478\n00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:55.250\nAnything else we want to throw in on SQL\ninjection before we wrap this one up?\n\n479\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:31:00.630\n>> If I was going to throw anything onto\nthe end of this, because we didn't really\n\n480\n00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:06.670\ndemo anything in here, just because we've\ndone that kind of well enough before.\n\n481\n00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:12.140\nWe showed the different tools that\nwere in here that you had available.\n\n482\n00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:18.020\nIf you haven't seen it already, you should\nbe going over to look at the CEH and\n\n483\n00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.580\nlook at what was discussed with\nSQL injections over there and\n\n484\n00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.390\nthe examples that were given.\n\n485\n00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.900\nIt will give you a good\nbasic understanding\n\n486\n00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.350\nof what a SQL injection actually is and\nwhat it looks like, so\n\n487\n00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:33.490\nyou can kind of get your head around\nthat to at least get that level.\n\n488\n00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.610\nStuff in the CH is the most\nbasic level you should have,\n\n489\n00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:42.105\na little bit more than that actually, but\nit's the good foundation you should have.\n\n490\n00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:47.580\nYou want to go beyond that and specialize\nin something like SQL or Oracle then hey,\n\n491\n00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.875\nmore power to you, but If you want to kind\nof get that, and your head around what it\n\n492\n00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:57.765\nis, what it looks like, then yeah, take\na look at that stuff as soon as you can.\n\n493\n00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:02.135\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode,\n\n494\n00:32:02.135 --> 00:32:04.250\nwe know we enjoyed filming it for you.\n\n495\n00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.410\nFilming it for you, if I can that out,\nbut signing off from ITProTV,\n\n496\n00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:09.510\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n497\n00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.320\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n498\n00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.699\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n499\n00:32:11.699 --> 00:32:18.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.800\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.380\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.000\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n7\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.670\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.710\n>> I'm doing fantastic!\n\n9\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.460\nWe've got another exciting episode coming\nyour way on our Kali Linux series.\n\n10\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.150\nAnd in this episode in particular,\nwe're gonna be focusing in on wireless.\n\n11\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.690\nSo wireless networks, different\ntechnologies and then as far as some of\n\n12\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.518\nthe tools that we can use to do tests\nagainst these wireless networks.\n\n13\n00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:42.160\nWireless networks Sean, a very common\nthing to find in most networks, also\n\n14\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.039\na very common source of vulnerabilities\nI guess is a good way to put it.\n\n15\n00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.522\n>> Yes indeed.\n\n16\n00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:51.410\n[LAUGH] They absolutely are very, very,\n\n17\n00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.595\nvery common source of problems\nof the security kind.\n\n18\n00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:04.210\nSo, when we think about it we used to\njust have the wireless 80211 segment.\n\n19\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.720\nNow, what do we have?\n\n20\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.700\nWe have bluetooth and\nthen we have RFID and\n\n21\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.390\nthen we even have other stuff out beyond\nthat with NFC and stuff like that.\n\n22\n00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.570\nSo, it's really wireless\nappearing in different forms in so\n\n23\n00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.370\nmany different places.\n\n24\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.690\nThere is a big potential for\nsecurity problems.\n\n25\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.850\nSecurity problems have been definitely\nbeen realized in, across the board.\n\n26\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.750\nSo it's something that Kali\nactually comes to bear and\n\n27\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.970\nhas a bunch of tools that\nit can help you assess and\n\n28\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.930\nsee where you actually stand as\nfar as issues with wireless.\n\n29\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.378\n>> Yeah it just opens up so\n\n30\n00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:46.891\nmany other avenues of attack as you say\nbecause you're wireless, you're unbound.\n\n31\n00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:50.850\nIt's inherently more difficult to\nsecure because it is an unbound media.\n\n32\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.130\nYour data is just floating out there and\nanybody within range and\n\n33\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.130\nan antenna could potentially\ncapture that information.\n\n34\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.110\nAnd it's also the technology changes so\nfast,\n\n35\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.750\nthere's problems within\nthe protocols themselves.\n\n36\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.120\nLike, we remember 80211, early on,\n80211 had WEP, which we know had issues.\n\n37\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.226\nAnd we're seeing the same things in\nsome of these other technologies,\n\n38\n00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:14.167\nbluetooth and RFID.\n\n39\n00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.760\nI think,\nbecause they're being pushed out so fast.\n\n40\n00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.130\nSecurity's kind of an afterthought.\n\n41\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.890\nAnd it's like, we're gonna get it out,\nwe're gonna get this cool technology made\n\n42\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.760\nup and make it really easy and\nconvenient to use.\n\n43\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.597\nThen figure out how to secure\nit after the fact, and\n\n44\n00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.144\nsometimes that's not the best strategy.\n\n45\n00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:31.450\nSo it does leave a lot of vulnerabilities,\nas as you've said,\n\n46\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.060\nthere's tons of tools to\ntake advantage of those.\n\n47\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.330\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of tools on both sides.\n\n48\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.070\nThere's a lot of tools\non the defensive side.\n\n49\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.220\nThere's tools on the offensive side and,\n\n50\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.725\nit's things that we have to use to protect\nourselves or see where we actually stand.\n\n51\n00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:52.810\nAnd I definitely agree with the statement\nyou said about, with wireless\n\n52\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.030\nbeing pushed out, I mean, put in so\nmany places, like, really any technology.\n\n53\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.320\nThey just keep pushing, and\npushing, and pushing it.\n\n54\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.460\nAnd then after the fact they're like,\noh, now let's secure it.\n\n55\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.820\nIt's like, yeah,\n\n56\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.570\nlet's close the barn door after the horses\nhave eaten your children or whatever.\n\n57\n00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.200\nI don't know how that saying goes,\nbut whatever.\n\n58\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.700\nYou'll work it.\n\n59\n00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:13.042\nGotcha on that one, didn't I?\n\n60\n00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:14.875\n[LAUGH] I was like, wait, wait, what?\n\n61\n00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.244\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do you use any of the NFCs?\n\n62\n00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:21.450\nDo you have your smartphone with\nyour credit card stored on there,\n\n63\n00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.860\nwhere you can just walk up and touch your\nphone to the device and pay for things?\n\n64\n00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.130\n>> I don't use that no way.\n\n65\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.060\n>> Yeah.\n\n66\n00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.385\n>> I won't even touch that, so.\n\n67\n00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:32.720\n>> [LAUGH] I mean that just seems\nto me like a horrible thing.\n\n68\n00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.090\nAnd it's a great concept, it's a great\nidea, I'm sure it's very convenient.\n\n69\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.780\nBut, from a security perspective we've\ntalked about it in several shows right?\n\n70\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.700\nConvenience and\n\n71\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.550\nsecurity typically are at opposite\nends of the spectrum, and some making\n\n72\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.180\nsomething really easy to use usually\nreduces the security on that thing.\n\n73\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.870\nAnd I think that's a great example, so.\n\n74\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.770\n>> Opposite ends of\nthe spectrum with wireless.\n\n75\n00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.675\nGet it?\n\n76\n00:03:55.675 --> 00:04:02.115\n>> [LAUGH] So, wireless networks just as\na quick refresher for folks out there.\n\n77\n00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:05.804\nI know most of you are at this point if\nyou're watching this class you've gone\n\n78\n00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:06.609\nthrough net+.\n\n79\n00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.818\nYou've done some of that basic stuff.\n\n80\n00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:10.965\nYou have an understanding of\nwhat a wireless network is.\n\n81\n00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:16.515\nBut let's just do a quick recap, Sean,\nabout what we mean by a wireless network.\n\n82\n00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.605\n>> Yeah, a wireless network is, really\n\n83\n00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:23.295\nwe could really take the kinda pathetic\nanswer of it's a network without wires.\n\n84\n00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.550\nNext.\n>> Check, done, yeah.\n\n85\n00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.340\n>> This is like the abridged\nversion of the course.\n\n86\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.490\nAnd well, that is what it is,\n\n87\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.325\nbut when you look at a wireless network,\nit doesn't use wires.\n\n88\n00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:43.150\nBut uses radio waves to carry out that\ninformation to wherever it needs to go.\n\n89\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.140\nSo that's the first concept we have there.\n\n90\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.630\nNow, the thing is,\nis that since it uses wireless or\n\n91\n00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.870\nRF to carry those signals out wirelessly,\nthat's great.\n\n92\n00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.090\nYou can be wherever you need to be,\nwithin reason, and get that signal.\n\n93\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.870\nThe downside of it is, is that you\ncan be wherever you need to be and\n\n94\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.620\nstill get that signal.\n\n95\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.048\nSo it's a plus and a minus there.\n\n96\n00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:15.870\nSo, why the user that's authorized and\nlegit to use that can get it\n\n97\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.830\nfrom the next room, or on the other side\nof the parking lot, so can the attacker.\n\n98\n00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.740\nThe attacker can get it from\nthose exact same places.\n\n99\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.318\nAnd unlike wired networks, where they\nphysically have to gain access, and\n\n100\n00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:31.692\nthen that brings in all sorts\nof ways we can pick that up.\n\n101\n00:05:31.692 --> 00:05:32.852\nWireless you can't do that.\n\n102\n00:05:32.852 --> 00:05:35.291\nWireless you can't just say well,\n\n103\n00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:41.020\nthere's someone sitting in this area\nwhere they are tapping into the network.\n\n104\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.100\n>> It's difficult to do a good,\n\n105\n00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.480\na lot of people don't do proper\nwireless surveys on their network, so.\n\n106\n00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.180\nThey don't realize that their signal's\nreaching outside of the building,\n\n107\n00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.700\npossibly into the next office or into that\nparking lot or something like that where\n\n108\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.110\nsomebody could sit unmonitored and\nattempt to access that network.\n\n109\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.358\nSo it does, as you said, bring\na whole nother set of issues to bear.\n\n110\n00:06:02.358 --> 00:06:04.893\nAlso with wireless networks again,\nquick recap for you,\n\n111\n00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:06.970\nthey can be set up in two\ndifferent modes right.\n\n112\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.650\nYou've got your peer-to-peer type,\nor your ad hoc networks\n\n113\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.530\nwhere you've got wireless clients that\nare connecting to each other directly.\n\n114\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.266\nSo each wireless client talks to\nanother wireless client directly.\n\n115\n00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:23.640\nThey basically form a mesh if there's\nmore than a couple devices there.\n\n116\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.750\nDoesn't give you any access to\nthe wired portion of the network,\n\n117\n00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.510\njust to all the wireless clients.\n\n118\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.500\nSo, that's one that's the ad hoc, and\nthen you've got the access point,\n\n119\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.900\nI forget the name we used for that one.\n\n120\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.670\nWhat is that mode?\n\n121\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.260\n>> Infrastructure.\n\n122\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.870\n>> Infrastructure mode, thank you.\n\n123\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.880\nWhere you've got an access point and\n\n124\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.730\nthat access point is tied\ninto the wired network.\n\n125\n00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.157\nAll the wireless clients connect\nto that access point, so\n\n126\n00:06:46.157 --> 00:06:47.800\nit's a central connectivity device.\n\n127\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.875\nAnd even if two wireless clients\nwanna talk to each other,\n\n128\n00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:55.040\nthe traffic still flows back to that\naccess point and out to the other clients.\n\n129\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.090\nSo two different modes,\n\n130\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.460\nsomething we might have to consider\nwhen we're going our wireless surveys or\n\n131\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.220\ndoing our pin test against our\nnetwork is how they have that set up.\n\n132\n00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.130\nAnd, another thing that just\npopped into my head is,\n\n133\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.460\nwhat if I find an ad hoc network that\nmaybe shouldn't be allowed, right?\n\n134\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.510\nYou've got two people\nthat have set one up.\n\n135\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.620\nThis is what happens, is you get two,\n\n136\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.460\nsay, C-level people that want\nto share files real quick.\n\n137\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.640\nThey setup a little ad hoc network.\n\n138\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.170\nThey have no idea what they're doing,\nhow to secure it, and\n\n139\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.730\nthat opens up holes in\nour security as well.\n\n140\n00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.080\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of stuff that happens\n\n141\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.730\nwith every technology\nthat can cause problems.\n\n142\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.390\nAnd yeah the peer to peer ones.\n\n143\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.940\nYeah I could definitely see, someone\njust said C level And they're C level,\n\n144\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.390\nbecause they're not smart to be an A to\nfigure out that that's a bad idea.\n\n145\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.430\n>> I was just gonna say that.\n\n146\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.130\n>> I don't mean anything bad.\n\n147\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.810\n>> If you're a C level, I don't mean\nanything derogatory by that at all,\n\n148\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.050\nbut you probably have other,\n\n149\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.080\nbigger things to worry about than\nhow to configure a wireless network.\n\n150\n00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.220\nThat's my disclaimer there.\n\n151\n00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.350\n>> No you don't.\nI mean that bad.\n\n152\n00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.970\nI can say that because\nI'm Captain America.\n\n153\n00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.670\nI can say that.\n\n154\n00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:07.348\nYeah, it's the nature of the beast,\nis that when they push new technology out,\n\n155\n00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:12.959\nsomeone is gonna abuse it, so they can\nfind these little things like that to do.\n\n156\n00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:16.851\nAnd I also think it's worthwhile, when\nwe're talking about this whole thing with\n\n157\n00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:20.762\nwireless, make sure that we do bring in\nthe fact that we have different standards.\n\n158\n00:08:20.762 --> 00:08:25.119\nThe different standards, and you can\nfeel free to look these up on your own.\n\n159\n00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:30.137\nBut just to do a quick recap,\nyou have 802.11a,\n\n160\n00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:33.627\nthen you have 802.11b, g, n,\n\n161\n00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:38.445\nand then we even have,\nreally just came out, is AC.\n\n162\n00:08:38.445 --> 00:08:40.349\nAnd we've got DC coming out next year.\n\n163\n00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:45.521\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> We\n\n164\n00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:50.555\nhave those being the main\nstandards right now.\n\n165\n00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:54.301\nAC, you're probably not going\nto see a lot of right now,\n\n166\n00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:57.580\nbecause if you go look at\nthe access points for it,\n\n167\n00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.657\nthe access points themselves are,\nthey're kind of pricey.\n\n168\n00:09:01.657 --> 00:09:06.187\nThey're not all, ridiculously, pricey,\nbut they're more than you're paying for\n\n169\n00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:08.308\nyour access points for the other stuff.\n\n170\n00:09:08.308 --> 00:09:11.225\nI've seen access points just regular,\n\n171\n00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:17.073\nsupposed to be consumer grade access\npoints for AC running about 8, $900.\n\n172\n00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:18.873\nThey're cool and they're cool looking,\n\n173\n00:09:18.873 --> 00:09:21.627\nI mean they've always got this\nweird shapes and stuff like a bug.\n\n174\n00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.040\nI'd probably hit it with\na newspaper [INAUDIBLE].\n\n175\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.280\nBut they have those, but they're gonna\ncome down in price like anything.\n\n176\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.060\nYou're probably not going to\nsee too many of those yet, but\n\n177\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.621\nthey are kind of making their\nway into the marketplace.\n\n178\n00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:40.697\nAnd what separates those\nstandards is mainly speed,\n\n179\n00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:44.655\nas well as the frequency range it runs in.\n\n180\n00:09:44.655 --> 00:09:47.584\nIf you look at things like a and n,\n\n181\n00:09:47.584 --> 00:09:52.723\nthose ones both have the ability\nto run at five gigahertz.\n\n182\n00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:55.336\nAnd that tends to be less polluted.\n\n183\n00:09:55.336 --> 00:09:58.648\nMeaning there's less devices\nrunning in that spectrum.\n\n184\n00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:03.023\nSo, you're probably gonna\nget better performance, and\n\n185\n00:10:03.023 --> 00:10:07.498\nless issues as far as interference and\nall that nastiness.\n\n186\n00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:12.378\nDownside, because of the way that\nsignal's formatted and modulated,\n\n187\n00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:15.818\nyou get a situation where\nit doesn't go that far and\n\n188\n00:10:15.818 --> 00:10:20.952\neasily gets sported by just basic\nconstruction of buildings or obstacles.\n\n189\n00:10:20.952 --> 00:10:22.995\nIt will stop.\n\n190\n00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:29.448\nIf you have 2.4,\n2.4 will go a lot further than a will.\n\n191\n00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:34.924\nHowever, there's a lot of things that run\nat 2.4 because it's an unlicensed band,\n\n192\n00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:39.959\nand since it's an unlicensed band, you\nhave all sorts of things running there.\n\n193\n00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:43.794\nEverything from your wireless networks,\nof course, your cordless phones,\n\n194\n00:10:43.794 --> 00:10:47.923\nyour Bluetooth devices, under the right\nconditions a microwave can generate those\n\n195\n00:10:47.923 --> 00:10:50.849\ntypes of signals, and\nthat's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n196\n00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:54.201\nWe're not even bringing in the stuff,\nlike your various game controllers and\n\n197\n00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:54.979\nstuff like that.\n\n198\n00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:58.018\nSo, there's a lot of stuff\nthat's crunched in and\n\n199\n00:10:58.018 --> 00:11:00.788\njammed into that 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n200\n00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:06.459\nAnd so, it's still more popular than\nfive gigahertz because of the range and\n\n201\n00:11:06.459 --> 00:11:11.011\nthe ability to be compatible with so\nmany different devices.\n\n202\n00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:15.486\nSo, you're more likely gonna see\nthat than the five gigahertz.\n\n203\n00:11:15.486 --> 00:11:20.127\nSo, you really should have a good handle\nat understanding when you're doing your\n\n204\n00:11:20.127 --> 00:11:22.354\nattacks and using the tool for a while.\n\n205\n00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:26.683\nYou should really have a good\nunderstanding of what the different\n\n206\n00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:31.416\nstandards mean to you, and that will\nallow you to use the tools better.\n\n207\n00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:36.622\nBecause if you don't know the standards\nat least at some basic level,\n\n208\n00:11:36.622 --> 00:11:38.475\nor intermediate level,\n\n209\n00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:44.051\nyou're probably going to get less than\nstellar results with these tools.\n\n210\n00:11:44.051 --> 00:11:47.405\nI don't need you to\nbecome an RF engineer and\n\n211\n00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:51.674\nget all those fat books on it and\ngo through it and study.\n\n212\n00:11:51.674 --> 00:11:55.531\nIf you wanna do that fine,\ngo ahead, but you don't need that.\n\n213\n00:11:55.531 --> 00:11:57.409\nYou need to understand\nwhat the standards are.\n\n214\n00:11:57.409 --> 00:11:59.926\nYou need to understand\nsecurity protocols and\n\n215\n00:11:59.926 --> 00:12:04.003\nmaybe some of the stuff in the environment\nthat impact and affect signals.\n\n216\n00:12:04.003 --> 00:12:05.816\nThose are the ones we're going for.\n\n217\n00:12:05.816 --> 00:12:09.136\nOnce you got those,\ntools become much easier.\n\n218\n00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:15.278\nBut anything else above that, it's just\nextra stuff that's, hey, nice to have but\n\n219\n00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:20.076\nit's not going to really add a ton\nof extra value to your skill set.\n\n220\n00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:24.348\nAnd I know some may argue with that, but\nthat's kind of the way I look at it.\n\n221\n00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:27.737\n>> All right, so as a pen tester here,\nplaying with Kali here, we've got a good\n\n222\n00:12:27.737 --> 00:12:31.233\nunderstanding of what our wireless\nnetworks are, the different standards and\n\n223\n00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:34.433\nhe also mentions how many others\ndifferent types of wireless networks.\n\n224\n00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:38.414\nLike 802.111 or WiFi as we like\nto call it, is not the only\n\n225\n00:12:38.414 --> 00:12:43.356\nwireless standard we can use or wireless\nprotocol we can use to network with, or\n\n226\n00:12:43.356 --> 00:12:48.705\nthat we have to worry about checking to\nsee if there's any vulnerabilities, right?\n\n227\n00:12:48.705 --> 00:12:51.736\n>> Yes, relatively speaking,\n\n228\n00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:56.713\nthere are a lot of wireless\nstandards out there.\n\n229\n00:12:56.713 --> 00:12:59.573\nWell, more than just the 802.11\nthat people are familiar with.\n\n230\n00:12:59.573 --> 00:13:03.993\nAnd you say, wireless most people\ngo directly to 802.11 nowadays.\n\n231\n00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:08.621\nThey don't take into account that\nBluetooth is a wireless standard.\n\n232\n00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.322\nThey know it in their head, but\nthey're not gonna just spit that out and\n\n233\n00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:13.441\nso, oh, wireless.\n\n234\n00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:16.596\nThey're gonna say, it's the WiFi\nnetwork and I've got one at home.\n\n235\n00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:19.703\nIt's like, well, Bluetooth is wireless.\n\n236\n00:13:19.703 --> 00:13:22.423\nDo you see those things plugged together?\n\n237\n00:13:22.423 --> 00:13:26.531\nIt's not just using dreams and\ngood will to push the data over.\n\n238\n00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:30.321\nIt's actually using RF, so\nit does classify as a wireless network, or\n\n239\n00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:31.593\nwireless technology.\n\n240\n00:13:31.593 --> 00:13:36.196\nAnd it actually is a networking\ntechnology when you get down to it.\n\n241\n00:13:36.196 --> 00:13:38.214\nIt's short-range, of course.\n\n242\n00:13:38.214 --> 00:13:42.267\nThe stuff that we're familiar with,\nat least, is short-range,\n\n243\n00:13:42.267 --> 00:13:44.196\nand goes out to about 30 feet.\n\n244\n00:13:44.196 --> 00:13:47.527\n>> Most of it was a class-2 radius,\nI think, which is what you find\n\n245\n00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:51.949\nin most of those Bluetooth devices, 30\nfeet, but that's still pretty good range,\n\n246\n00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:55.723\nwe've got people that, with phones,\neverybody got their smartphone.\n\n247\n00:13:55.723 --> 00:13:57.671\nMost people have Bluetooth enabled.\n\n248\n00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:00.517\nSome even do auto-pairing and\nstuff like this.\n\n249\n00:14:00.517 --> 00:14:02.556\nThat's not a good scenario.\n\n250\n00:14:02.556 --> 00:14:06.804\n>> There's a lot of things to\nthink about with Bluetooth.\n\n251\n00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:11.827\nIn a number of ways, I look at Bluetooth\nas being more of a security issue,\n\n252\n00:14:11.827 --> 00:14:16.526\neven an 802.11, in a number of cases,\nbecause like you said,\n\n253\n00:14:16.526 --> 00:14:21.163\nit's turned on a lot of the times and\nthey have these pairing set up.\n\n254\n00:14:21.163 --> 00:14:24.535\nPeople just leave that stuff on all\nthe time, because they want it so\n\n255\n00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:27.150\nwhen they go into the car,\nit hooks up immediately.\n\n256\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.212\nThey wanna do it when they get out of\nthe car, it clicks onto their headset, or\n\n257\n00:14:31.212 --> 00:14:32.411\npairs with whatever.\n\n258\n00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.667\nThey want to have that, so it's always on.\n\n259\n00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.875\nDownside of that is we have a lot\nof tools that can pick up that\n\n260\n00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:45.010\ninformation from Bluetooth and say,\nhey, I know that you're there and\n\n261\n00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.132\nbe able to read device IDs and\nstuff like that off of it, and\n\n262\n00:14:49.132 --> 00:14:54.639\neven brute force it, and read services and\neverything else that are on that.\n\n263\n00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.749\nAnd that's just the tip of\nthe iceberg as they say.\n\n264\n00:14:57.749 --> 00:15:02.552\nThere's more stuff that we can do\nonce we've gotten to that point.\n\n265\n00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:07.308\nSo, yeah, Bluetooth is a definite issue,\nand it was built for convenience,\n\n266\n00:15:07.308 --> 00:15:09.265\nit wasn't built for security.\n\n267\n00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:11.476\nThey stuck security on afterwards.\n\n268\n00:15:11.476 --> 00:15:15.695\nBut, it's still not really implemented\nas well as it could be, and\n\n269\n00:15:15.695 --> 00:15:20.223\na system's only as good as the people\nthat are configuring and using it.\n\n270\n00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:24.158\nAnd so, most of the people that use\ncell phones, and smart phones that have\n\n271\n00:15:24.158 --> 00:15:28.416\nthese things on it, they're just thinking\nabout the convenience aspect of it.\n\n272\n00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:33.723\nThere's no security whatsoever,\nas far as they're concerned.\n\n273\n00:15:33.723 --> 00:15:37.496\nThat's just one of the other\nwireless technologies but\n\n274\n00:15:37.496 --> 00:15:40.311\neven then, that's not covering it all.\n\n275\n00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:45.173\nThere are other ones that are out\nthere that you could run into,\n\n276\n00:15:45.173 --> 00:15:48.313\nor will run into in just a matter of time.\n\n277\n00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:51.466\nOne that you can run into is ZigBee.\n\n278\n00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:55.918\nYou don't run into that one too much but\nthat one's for medical and industrial,\n\n279\n00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:58.426\nit's very specific to those environments.\n\n280\n00:15:58.426 --> 00:15:59.936\n>> Home automation,\nI have some at my house.\n\n281\n00:15:59.936 --> 00:16:00.556\nThe what?\n\n282\n00:16:00.556 --> 00:16:01.436\n>> Home automation tech.\n\n283\n00:16:01.436 --> 00:16:02.966\n>> Okay.\n\n284\n00:16:02.966 --> 00:16:04.206\n>> Wall switches and things like that.\n\n285\n00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:05.000\nSo yeah.\n\n286\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.654\n>> I'm going to hack your stuff man.\n\n287\n00:16:06.654 --> 00:16:07.154\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, yeah.\n\n288\n00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:08.617\n[LAUGH]\n\n289\n00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:10.266\n>> It's convenient but anybody can now\n\n290\n00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:13.503\nturn on my lights from wherever you want.\n[LAUGH]\n\n291\n00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:14.615\n>> Make it look like your house is\n\n292\n00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:17.070\nhaunted.\nStart flicking lights around.\n\n293\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.120\nBut yes, you've got Bluetooth,\n\n294\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.560\nyou've got things like and there's\na bunch of those you might run into.\n\n295\n00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.750\nNow, when it comes to RFID,\n\n296\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.020\nis that something we have\nto worry about in the test?\n\n297\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.400\nI know it's such a short range, typically.\n\n298\n00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.970\nI see it used a lot in door sensors,\n\n299\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.160\nlike we use key fobs here to get\nthrough all of our access ways.\n\n300\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.080\nIs that something we have\nto worry about testing?\n\n301\n00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.810\nIs there anything there?\n\n302\n00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.160\n>> I wouldn't take it off the menu,\nif it's in that environment,\n\n303\n00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.950\nit's something that should be checked\nbecause traditionally it has had its\n\n304\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:56.990\nlittle areas of concern,\ngrief just kind of surrounding it.\n\n305\n00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.520\nSo, I would check it or kinda think\nabout checking it if it's there.\n\n306\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.120\nAll we have to do is look through\nnews stories of the last what,\n\n307\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.500\nmaybe five years and see cases where\nthey've been worried about people reading\n\n308\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:17.410\nRFID stuff out of passports and\ncredit cards and everything else.\n\n309\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:21.450\nYou know, so it's something\nto really kinda think about.\n\n310\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.160\nAnd they wanna put more\nRFID chips on stuff.\n\n311\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.620\nThat's something that's picking up\nmore and more and more and more.\n\n312\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.390\nAnd the thought isn't over security.\n\n313\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.100\nAgain, it's convenience.\n\n314\n00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.550\nAnd they've been talking for\n\n315\n00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.610\na long time about having\neverything in a grocery store.\n\n316\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.730\nBelieve it or not, having RFID tag on it\nso just throw the stuff in your cart and\n\n317\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.560\nwhen you walk out, there's like an arch\nthat sees all stuff in your cart and\n\n318\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.010\nsees you and just bills it to you\nautomatically when you go out.\n\n319\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.490\n>> All about it, woo hoo!\n\n320\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:57.540\nAgain, you think about the convenience\nversus security, right?\n\n321\n00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.360\nThat means that system might be able\nto pick up all the food in your cart,\n\n322\n00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.270\nit also has to figure out who you are,\nfigure out how to bill you,\n\n323\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:09.310\nthat means they've got information\non file and stuff like that.\n\n324\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.980\nSo Sean, when it comes to some common\nmistakes we see in wireless networks.\n\n325\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.150\nLet's talk about some of\nthe misconfigurations,\n\n326\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.230\nthe things we should be looking for.\n\n327\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.430\nIf we're tasked with doing a pen test on\na network, we find out that they have\n\n328\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:26.890\nwireless, what are some of the common\nthings we see wrong in wireless networks?\n\n329\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.810\n>> Well, [LAUGH] the things that we see,\nI mean, try and say common things.\n\n330\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.670\nYeah.\nThere's a bunch.\n\n331\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.000\nMisconfiguration is still a very big one.\n\n332\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.450\nI don't know if I'd put it right at\nthe top but it's definitely up there or\n\n333\n00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:43.420\ngetting close to it.\n\n334\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.220\nPeople getting the technology,\nand getting that,\n\n335\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.100\noh whiz factor,\nthat they want to have it installed.\n\n336\n00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.110\nAnd they just plug it in,\nthe lights come on, and\n\n337\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.690\nthey can't wait to get their notebook, or\ntablet or what ever out and connect to it,\n\n338\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.060\nand they're like, oh look it works.\n\n339\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.160\nThey're real happy about it and\n\n340\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.080\nthey don't actually read\nthe rest of the instructions,\n\n341\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.560\nsay hey you gotta secure that.\n\n342\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.210\nThey're just it works.\n\n343\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.040\nSo you do still see a fair amount of that\n\n344\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.250\nI've seen not just the misconfiguration.\n\n345\n00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.160\nI have seen, or leaving defaults in place.\n\n346\n00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.152\nI have seen where people put settings in\nthere that are less then optimal that\n\n347\n00:19:23.152 --> 00:19:26.357\ndo lend themselves to\nbeing busted a lot easier.\n\n348\n00:19:26.357 --> 00:19:32.207\nOther ones, I've seen some people\npushing wireless way beyond its limits,\n\n349\n00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:38.147\nand when you do that you do risk pushing\nit so far that you're applying it in a way\n\n350\n00:19:38.147 --> 00:19:44.110\nthat it wasn't intended for and\nthen opening up security holes with it.\n\n351\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.700\nThere could be a number of them out there.\n\n352\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.480\nI'd even say using some of the older\ntechnologies that they haven't\n\n353\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.720\nupgraded for whatever reason.\n\n354\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.000\nOne of the biggest things you\nhave with technology is people\n\n355\n00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.040\nstill have the mindset\nof you buy something.\n\n356\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.120\nYou pay all this money on it.\n\n357\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.820\nYou should keep using it til it just fries\nand you throw it away and buy a new one.\n\n358\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:13.120\nWell, I understand that way of thinking\nthere but it's not ideal for this field.\n\n359\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.650\nI mean, there's still tons of people that,\nand it's kind of a scary thing,\n\n360\n00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.510\njust to give an example of this.\n\n361\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.360\nOf that type of thinking, at least.\n\n362\n00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.000\nThey're, it's been said that they\nbelieve that there's still millions and\n\n363\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.940\nmillions of computers sitting in\npeople's attics and garages and\n\n364\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.620\nstuff like that, from, you know,\nthe early 80s and throughout the 80s.\n\n365\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.640\nBecause these people spend thousands\nof dollars on these things, and.\n\n366\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.800\nThey're not going to chuck it.\n\n367\n00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.920\nThey stuck it in there figuring, well,\nmaybe there's something I can do with it.\n\n368\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.740\nThere never going to do anything with it,\n\n369\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.080\nit's going to be a museum piece or\neventually when that person croaks or\n\n370\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.570\nfinally decides that, and\nI'm being really sensitive saying croak.\n\n371\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.165\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I learned that as being a counselor\n\n372\n00:20:53.165 --> 00:20:54.985\nyears ago.\n\n373\n00:20:54.985 --> 00:20:55.775\n>> I can tell.\n\n374\n00:20:55.775 --> 00:20:59.015\n>> That stuffs gonna end up in a land\nfill, and a lot of those computers from\n\n375\n00:20:59.015 --> 00:21:03.710\nthose days, from that day and age,\nhad toxic, very toxic stuff in it.\n\n376\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.100\nSo they've already had them up here in\nlandfills and it's just that sense of\n\n377\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.260\npeople don't want to get rid of something\nthat they pay that amount of money for.\n\n378\n00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.170\nIt's the same thing with wireless and\nother technologies.\n\n379\n00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.770\nThey're gonna keep it around until\nthey don't have a reason to keep it\n\n380\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.535\naround anymore.\n\n381\n00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:17.350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n382\n00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.340\n>> And in this case it means you have\nsecurity problems could be creeping in.\n\n383\n00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.260\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be that\nthey don't want to replace it because it\n\n384\n00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.060\nstill works,\nit can be that it's still good technology\n\n385\n00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.980\nif you kept things like\nthe firmware more up to date.\n\n386\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.400\nThey don't do that,\nthey're just, it works and\n\n387\n00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.150\nI am going to leave it that way and\nuntil someone forces me.\n\n388\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.740\nTo get you know new firmware or something\nfor it, I am just not going to do it.\n\n389\n00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.053\n>> So, devices that aren't patched,\nlike access points and\n\n390\n00:21:46.053 --> 00:21:50.310\nthings that aren't running on the latest\nOS for those devices or firmware.\n\n391\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.833\nOr misconfigured, using their older\nprotocols, or the wrong protocols,\n\n392\n00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:57.640\nnot upgrading equipment as you said still\nrunning some of those older protocols.\n\n393\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.540\nOr not understanding the security\noptions that are available when\n\n394\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.560\nthey configure the wireless access point.\n\n395\n00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.310\nPicking the different authentication and\nencryption methods.\n\n396\n00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.420\nYou got a choice between WEP, and WPA,\n\n397\n00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:13.270\nWPA2 and maybe they pick WEP\nbecause they don't know any better.\n\n398\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.190\nSo misconfiguration there.\n\n399\n00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.310\nWeak passwords is another big one I think\nwe see a lot of times on access points,\n\n400\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.260\nespecially because they don't change.\n\n401\n00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.350\nAs often as they should.\n\n402\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.860\nThat's one of the things I've always seen\nis as a user, we can use policies within\n\n403\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.960\nour network to force users to change\ntheir password every 30 days or\n\n404\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.450\nevery 45 days or something.\n\n405\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.590\nWhen's the last time anybody's changed the\npassword on your wireless network, right?\n\n406\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.100\nIt's the same password it's been for\nthe last three years.\n\n407\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.490\nSo weak passwords and\nthen not changing those passwords,\n\n408\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.989\npicking the wrong authentication and\nsecurity options,\n\n409\n00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.320\nall of that starts compiling and\nmaking for a very vulnerable situation.\n\n410\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.240\nThese wireless networks.\n\n411\n00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.390\n>> Yeah, and again this is just\nthe tip of the whole thing.\n\n412\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.570\nYou think of other stuff,\n\n413\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:05.570\npeople can set up access points a lot\neasier than they could a few years ago.\n\n414\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.712\nProbably a lot of you\nwatching this can whip\n\n415\n00:23:09.712 --> 00:23:14.212\nout your smartphone and\nset it up as a hot spot.\n\n416\n00:23:14.212 --> 00:23:16.910\nThat's something that you\ncouldn't do a few years ago.\n\n417\n00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.490\nWhat are you going to do in your company\nif you have someone that's got a wireless\n\n418\n00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.620\ncard in their notebook,\nor whatever device, and\n\n419\n00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.980\nthey've also hardwired\nit onto the network?\n\n420\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.610\nWell.\n\n421\n00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.850\nThey could very well connect to\nboth of them, and all of a sudden,\n\n422\n00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:33.230\nthey've got a direct line from\nthe outside world bypassing everything\n\n423\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.910\nright into your network, and\nthat's just obviously not a good thing.\n\n424\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.680\nBut people do that.\n\n425\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.010\nThey do it all the time.\n\n426\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:45.070\nYou know, so it's one of those\nsituations where you really have to do\n\n427\n00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.070\nyour due diligence, and\nreally check these things.\n\n428\n00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.750\nBecause people will do little\nnonsense things like that,\n\n429\n00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:57.580\nto kind of get their way,\nrather than deal with it.\n\n430\n00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.540\n>> Right.\n>> And follow security protocols that\n\n431\n00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.309\nyou've established.\n\n432\n00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.720\n>> All right.\nWell Sean, I'll tell you what,\n\n433\n00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.470\nthat was a lot of good information\nabout wireless networks.\n\n434\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.820\nJust kind of a basic understanding\nof wireless networks, so we can\n\n435\n00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.810\ntalk a little bit more intelligently\nas we get into our tools part.\n\n436\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.010\nBut looking at our clock,\nit's about time for us to take a break.\n\n437\n00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:19.190\nSo, why don't we wrap this one up, and\nwhen we come back with another episode,\n\n438\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.150\nmaybe we can take a look at some of the\nstuff that Kali's going to bring to bear\n\n439\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.790\nthat will allow us to do our penetration\ntests against these wireless networks.\n\n440\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.670\nSound like a plan?\n\n441\n00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:28.490\n>> Sounds good.\n\n442\n00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.270\nAfter the break we're going back to Kali.\n\n443\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.520\n>> Going back to Kali.\n\n444\n00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.530\nI like it.\n\n445\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.585\nWell, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n446\n00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:35.755\nWe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n447\n00:24:35.755 --> 00:24:37.985\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n448\n00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:38.985\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n449\n00:24:38.985 --> 00:24:40.103\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n450\n00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:46.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.502\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.360\nSean Oriyano, how you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.740\n>> I'm going pretty good, how you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.120\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\n\n7\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.730\nwe've got another exciting episode\nof IT Pro TV coming your way.\n\n8\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.050\nWe've got our Kali Linux\nseries going on right now, and\n\n9\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.180\nin this episode Sean we're going\nto take another look at wireless.\n\n10\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.830\nIf you've missed our previous episode,\ngo back into the library and check it out.\n\n11\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.680\nWe started talking about wireless networks\nin general and some of the different\n\n12\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.530\nstandards and some of the vulnerabilities\nthat these wireless networks introduce.\n\n13\n00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.060\nAnd now Sean, we want to take a look\nat some of the tools we can use.\n\n14\n00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.380\nIf we're doing a pen test and\nthe company has a wireless network, what\n\n15\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.220\ndoes Kali bring to us that we can use to\ntest their network and things like that.\n\n16\n00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.450\nSo, Sean,\nlet's talk about wireless again and\n\n17\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.690\nwhat kind of tools we got\navailable here in Kali.\n\n18\n00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.950\n>> Yeah, there's, when we look at\nwireless, yeah, we talked about just sort\n\n19\n00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.140\nof the different standards that\nare out there in our previous segment,\n\n20\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.780\ntalked about Bluetooth,\nwe talked about RFID.\n\n21\n00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430\nAnd we mentioned a little bit NFC.\n\n22\n00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.610\nBut those are the main types of wireless\nyou're going to see out there, but\n\n23\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.500\nthen there's, when we look at wireless in\ngenerally, typically we're talking 802.11,\n\n24\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.660\nthat's what most people associate with it.\n\n25\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.760\nNow as far as Kali goes, Kali actually\nhas a lot of tools that can be used\n\n26\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.940\nto assess and break into and\ndo other stuff to 802.11 networks.\n\n27\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.310\nThey really really came\nprepared in this area.\n\n28\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.190\nSomething I'm going to\ntell you about here makes,\n\n29\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.629\nwhen you're using Kali in here is that.\n\n30\n00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.140\nThere are ways to do this.\n\n31\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.150\nWe haven't bothered doing it here, but\n\n32\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.030\nbe aware of the fact that if you're\nrunning Kali in a virtualized environment,\n\n33\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.600\nif you have a wireless card,\nit's not going to pick that wireless card,\n\n34\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.970\ntypically it's not going pick that\nwireless card up as a wireless card.\n\n35\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.040\nWe both have a wireless card\nphysically installed in these systems,\n\n36\n00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.550\nlike most computers do nowadays.\n\n37\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.970\nAnd why the virtual assistant\nwill pick it up and\n\n38\n00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.080\nKali will pick it up because\nthe virtual system picked it up.\n\n39\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.410\nIt will be picked up as\na network connection,\n\n40\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.085\nnot a wireless, just a network connection.\n\n41\n00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:29.800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that means that,\n\n42\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.956\nas far as using really any of\nthese wireless tools, you can't.\n\n43\n00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:36.620\nBecause it's going to query it and\nlook for\n\n44\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.090\nthe capabilities of a wireless device and\nsince it's not showing up as that,\n\n45\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.330\nit's going to say no wireless device\nis found and it will shut right down.\n\n46\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.490\nDoesn't mean we can't discuss and\ntalk about the different tools do and\n\n47\n00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.710\nshow some of the stuff in there, but\nwe're not going to be, you know,\n\n48\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.290\nbreaking into any of them.\n\n49\n00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.820\nThe other thing I would add into this is\nthat that means that you've got a choice.\n\n50\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.240\nYou can, in some cases,\nget a USB wireless adapter and\n\n51\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.450\nplug it in and do a pass-through on\nsome of the virtualization platforms.\n\n52\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.280\nAnd if you do that, it will pick up\nthe wireless adapter you plug in\n\n53\n00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.289\nas wireless in the virtual environment.\n\n54\n00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.580\nVirtual Box will do that, and\nVMWare is supposed to be able to do that.\n\n55\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.955\nI never really got into\ndoing it in VMWare,\n\n56\n00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:26.530\nbecause I don't really\nuse it all that often.\n\n57\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.260\nSo, Virtual Box, I never really\nhad any great luck with it, but\n\n58\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.600\nit's supposed to be possible.\n\n59\n00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.360\nI think you were saying Hyper-V does that?\n\n60\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.580\n>> Yeah, Hyper-V seems to work right.\n\n61\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.350\nBut, then again, now that I think about\nit, when I was using it with Hyper-V,\n\n62\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.910\nI was just able to get network access and\ntalk to other machines.\n\n63\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.110\nI don't know that Hyper-V represented\nit as wireless network adapters,\n\n64\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.870\nso it very well could be.\n\n65\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.030\nSo this might be one of the areas where if\nyou want to practice with the stuff and\n\n66\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.650\nplay with Kali Linux and that, this is one\nof the areas where having it installed\n\n67\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.860\nphysically on a machine\nmight be the best way to go.\n\n68\n00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.330\nVirtualization lets me do a whole lot,\nbut with the wireless adapters,\n\n69\n00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.040\nthe way they work,\nit's difficult to get that virtualized,\n\n70\n00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040\nat least now with what we've got, so.\n\n71\n00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.840\nSomething to think about,\nif you're setting up sandbox and\n\n72\n00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.680\nyou've got an old laptop that you want\na duel boot to or a blow away and\n\n73\n00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.860\nput Kali on there and\n\n74\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.470\nit's got a wireless adapter, then you can\ntake full advantage of all these tools.\n\n75\n00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.880\nAnd the same thing's going\nto go with the other ones.\n\n76\n00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.350\nRight?\nI mean like Bluetooth,\n\n77\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.340\nI would need some type of Bluetooth\nreceiver on the machine that's running\n\n78\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.740\nKali, just take advantage of those tools\nand the RFID and the NFC type tools.\n\n79\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.450\n>> Yeah, Kali, in my case recognizes\nthat Bluetooth is there and\n\n80\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.840\nlet's me turn it on and off, but I don't\nthink it really is turning on and off.\n\n81\n00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.240\nIt thinks it is, but I think it's\njust turning the service on and off.\n\n82\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.460\nIt's not actually doing anything\nwith the physical state\n\n83\n00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.150\nof the adapter on\nthe actual machine itself.\n\n84\n00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.180\n>> That's good.\nThose device,\n\n85\n00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.590\nthey're just not virtualized, right?\n\n86\n00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.650\nThe hard drive I have in my computer might\nsupport Bluetooth but It's not being\n\n87\n00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.030\nvirtualized by my virtualization platform\nand exposing it to the virtual machines.\n\n88\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.090\n>> Yeah, so definitely keep that in\nmind and you know it's not uncommon for\n\n89\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.220\npen testers just to have this installed\non physical hardware anyway that they\n\n90\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.180\ndo just grab an old notebook or something\nand put it on there and go from there.\n\n91\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.990\nSo, there are some limitations when\nyou use it in this environment.\n\n92\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.760\nThis is one of the ones\nthat is pretty much known,\n\n93\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.700\nand there's always little\nworkarounds that people have,\n\n94\n00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.430\nbut they just seem to be\nnever really all that great.\n\n95\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.290\nI spent some time trying\nto get the wireless adapter\n\n96\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.090\nrecognized in the virtual machine and\ndid it.\n\n97\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.760\nI was like,\n\"oh great!\" It was then when I realized\n\n98\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.470\nit was only recognizing it as a network\nadapter the first time I did it.\n\n99\n00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.710\nThat's not helping me.\n\n100\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.770\nSo I was still stuck.\n\n101\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.300\nBut, if any of you guys find a way,\ngo ahead and and go for it.\n\n102\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.300\nHey, share it with the rest [LAUGH] of\nus too, if you get it to work reliably.\n\n103\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.920\nBut with that being said,\nwe're going to talk about\n\n104\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.630\nthe tools that are here for\nyou to do your wireless audits.\n\n105\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.070\nAnd there's just so many of them and\nwe'll take a look at a handful of these.\n\n106\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.532\nSo, what I'm going to do is I have Kali\nsitting right up here on my screen again.\n\n107\n00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:31.250\nAnd I'm under the wireless\nattacks section of that menu.\n\n108\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.250\nAnd you can see that we have our own\nmenu dedicated to, specifically,\n\n109\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.990\nto wireless attacks itself.\n\n110\n00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.500\nSo if we take a look, and\n\n111\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.100\nI'll just scroll right on down here,\nTo give you the whole look at it.\n\n112\n00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.200\nSo you can see, yeah,\n\n113\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.210\nit definitely does have a lot\nof things it comes to play with.\n\n114\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.210\nAnd while we won't spend\ntime on all of these,\n\n115\n00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.210\nyou can see that there are a heck of a lot\nof them there for you to do stuff with.\n\n116\n00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.540\nIt looks like some of those then\nare designed to, like Aircrack,\n\n117\n00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.660\nI recognized as a tool I can use to crack\npasswords on, wireless access points.\n\n118\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.970\n>> Exactly.\n>> Other ones in there look\n\n119\n00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.360\nlike they might be more geared\ntowards just capturing data or\n\n120\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.790\nfinding wireless access points.\n\n121\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.110\nSo it looks like we got a whole\nrange of tools available.\n\n122\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.270\n>> Yeah.\nYou really do.\n\n123\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.200\nYou really have a broad\nrange of tools in here.\n\n124\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.750\nThe Aircrack one, that's one that\nwas even mentioned in the CEH.\n\n125\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.824\nThat one is a command line tool that's\nspecifically designed to go through and\n\n126\n00:07:30.824 --> 00:07:35.520\nanalyze traffic and go over and\nretrieve the keys out of it.\n\n127\n00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.700\nBy the way,\nthe whole Aircrack NG suite is there.\n\n128\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.420\nIf you recall from the CEH,\nthey call the whole thing Aircrack NG and\n\n129\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.030\nthere's a bunch of stuff within it.\n\n130\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.340\nWell this is just one component of it.\n\n131\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.471\nThe whole thing is there.\n\n132\n00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:52.083\nSo that's just kind of one\nyou can use to retrieve,\n\n133\n00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:57.291\nespecially you see WEP keys down there,\nit's got a section right there,\n\n134\n00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.402\nright in the bottom of\nthe The screen there.\n\n135\n00:08:00.402 --> 00:08:01.517\nI will just move it up.\n\n136\n00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:06.660\nThis is just showing you stuff that\nyou can do to retrieve web keys.\n\n137\n00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.745\nSo that's kind of a really good thing.\n\n138\n00:08:08.745 --> 00:08:11.790\nThere's WPA stuff you can do.\n\n139\n00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.680\nAnd so, it's got stuff in here\nthat can definitely help you out.\n\n140\n00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.750\nSo that's Aircrack.\n\n141\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:23.550\nThat's one that is still very popular\nbecause it does work very well.\n\n142\n00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.236\nIn fact, a lot of those tests\nwhere you see people break and\n\n143\n00:08:27.236 --> 00:08:30.997\nretrieve web keys, and\nmaybe 10 to 15 to 30 seconds,\n\n144\n00:08:30.997 --> 00:08:35.910\nthis is what they're using to do it to\nactually retrieve that out of the data.\n\n145\n00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:38.981\nBut, again, they're not\nthe only ones that can do this,\n\n146\n00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:43.780\nthere are other tools that can do\nthe same thing, retrieve keys, for you.\n\n147\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:50.060\nSo if I go to my applications again,\nas we pick through it.\n\n148\n00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.550\nSo there's my 80211 stuff again.\n\n149\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.835\nOther ones we have in there, I like\nsome of these names, bully and cowpatty.\n\n150\n00:08:57.835 --> 00:09:00.797\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've got to love anything called\n\n151\n00:09:00.797 --> 00:09:02.390\ncowpatty when you click on it.\n\n152\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.300\nHey look it's cowpatty!\n\n153\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.660\nSo look out for cow patties.\n\n154\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.065\nSo this is what you can use\nto actually go through again,\n\n155\n00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:17.750\nand retrieve stuff out of a PCAT file.\n\n156\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.120\nI wonder if they made a second\nversion's called meadow muffins?\n\n157\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.960\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n158\n00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.170\n>> I've got way too much time on my hands.\n\n159\n00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.543\nWe figured out during the break that\nI'm eating too much sugar back here, so\n\n160\n00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:28.500\nI'm getting hyper.\n\n161\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've got that, but\n\n162\n00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.210\nlet me point out some of\nthese other ones we got.\n\n163\n00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.130\nThis is one that they're starting\nto give more attention to,\n\n164\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.350\nis this Fern Wifi Cracker.\n\n165\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:46.840\nIt is a GUI based tool.\n\n166\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.600\nI'm not gonna worry about updating it.\n\n167\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.130\nBut what this one can do is, it's not\nfinding a wireless adaptor on this system.\n\n168\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.270\nBut we already been down that road.\n\n169\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.210\nIf we did have a wireless adaptor\non the system what would happen\n\n170\n00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.730\nis we would just select it off the list.\n\n171\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.810\nAnd we could go through and\ntell it to start scanning for\n\n172\n00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.440\nwireless access points, and it would scan,\nand return a list back to us, and\n\n173\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.880\nthen once we're done we could actually\nuse this program to target it, and\n\n174\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.720\nhelp collect traffic and crack the key.\n\n175\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.138\nThis one is actually,\nwhen it's working at its optimal,\n\n176\n00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:26.110\nit will retrieve keys pretty quickly,\nand break them.\n\n177\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.680\nSo it will treat the traffic and\nbreak those keys very, very quickly.\n\n178\n00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.400\nSo very, very neat utility to have.\n\n179\n00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.890\nIt may not be as fast and robust as\nusing something like Aircrack is,\n\n180\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.330\nbut it has gained some popularity.\n\n181\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.590\nIf you don't want to learn a command line,\nyou just don't feel comfortable with it,\n\n182\n00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.660\nthis could be an alternative.\n\n183\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.490\nBut do remember there are some\nlimitations with that.\n\n184\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:55.740\nSo that is just the Fern Wifi deal or\nutility.\n\n185\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.820\nAnd then just browsing through this, just\na couple other things to throw out here.\n\n186\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.090\nKismet, I won't worry about\nstarting that one up.\n\n187\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:11.350\nKismet is a utility used to\ndetect wireless access points.\n\n188\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.080\nBut what really sets this on apart\nis that it has the ability to pick\n\n189\n00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.540\nthem up even if someone has cloaked them,\nturned off the broadcast SSID.\n\n190\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.555\nIt can still pick that up by just\nsitting there and listening for\n\n191\n00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.080\ntraffic as it flows by.\n\n192\n00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.172\nYou can sit there and read the frames\nthat are floating through the air and\n\n193\n00:11:29.172 --> 00:11:31.070\nfigure out where they're going.\n\n194\n00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.980\nAnd tell you, hey,\nthere's an access point there.\n\n195\n00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.770\nThat's not why you can't see it.\n\n196\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.540\nI can see stuff going to it,\nso I know it's there.\n\n197\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.815\nIt has the ability to do that,\n\n198\n00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:43.780\nalso has the ability to do\nsomething else that's really cool.\n\n199\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.200\nIt can also read probe requests.\n\n200\n00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.025\nSo when your system is sitting there and\nhas Kismet running,\n\n201\n00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:54.450\nif I had running on this system\nright now I would be any wireless\n\n202\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.175\ndevice within range of this notebook\nwhen it, it would start popping up and\n\n203\n00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:03.840\nsaying, as it starts to that probe\nrequest, is the wireless card was on.\n\n204\n00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.004\nWe start sending out probe requests, this\nguy would pick up the probe request and\n\n205\n00:12:08.004 --> 00:12:10.060\nsay, yep, there you go.\n\n206\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.920\nAnd you could usually tell\nit's a client pretty quickly,\n\n207\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.590\nbecause of if you don't look at any\nother stuff, you can see that it starts,\n\n208\n00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.480\nas it keeps going through\ndifferent scan cycles,\n\n209\n00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.070\nyou'll see the same address looking for\na different access point.\n\n210\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:29.076\nSo it's a really kind of interesting\nway to tell what someone's been doing,\n\n211\n00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:30.700\nor where they've been.\n\n212\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.045\nWith a little bit of social engineering,\na little bit of common sense,\n\n213\n00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:37.580\nyou could actually start to track people\nusing just those types of things.\n\n214\n00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.612\nThere's actually, if you guys\nreally wanna take a look at it,\n\n215\n00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:41.880\ninteresting thing on it.\n\n216\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.140\nYou can go to TED Talks,\nTED Talks have a guy by the name\n\n217\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.520\nof Jimmy Lin that's a security researcher,\nand he was showing you how you could\n\n218\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:59.550\nmake a lot of really good guesses off of\nsomeone's probe requests on their device.\n\n219\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.840\nKind of an interesting, but also kind of\nfrightening, one to a certain degree.\n\n220\n00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.100\n>> Yeah, it's a big security thing,\nwe talk about in our Windows classes.\n\n221\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.800\nHow if you're gonna disable\nthe broadcast SSID on the client,\n\n222\n00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.350\nyou should really turn\noff the AutoConnect.\n\n223\n00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.480\nNobody does because that's a pain.\n\n224\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.920\nThat means I've gotta type in the name of\nthat access point that I wanna connect to.\n\n225\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.200\nBut as you said, if I leave that\nAutoConnect on, that means as soon as it's\n\n226\n00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.870\nin range of that wireless access point,\nit's gonna connect.\n\n227\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.810\nThat's great.\n\n228\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.740\nThe problem is how does it know when\nit's in range of that access point?\n\n229\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.880\nWell, your card sits there and\nconstantly sends out these probes.\n\n230\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.150\nSo your at Starbucks, Sean's running\nKismet he sees your network or\n\n231\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.370\nnotebook looking for\nan access point called Work123 or\n\n232\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.720\nwhatever, and start picking up all\nkinds of information about it.\n\n233\n00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.930\nSo as you said about it if it's got five\nor six in there that are automatically\n\n234\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.670\nconnecting you get all of those and\nyou know all the places I like to hangout.\n\n235\n00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.590\n>> Yep.\n\n236\n00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.190\n>> I'd also like to\npoint out that you said,\n\n237\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.500\nI'm sitting there with Kismet it would be\nme, because that's the type of stuff I do.\n\n238\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.000\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n239\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.473\n>> Desniff and what was that,\n\n240\n00:14:03.473 --> 00:14:06.880\nthe one that grabs all the pictures\nI know you like that one too.\n\n241\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.460\n>> Drift net.\n\n242\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.600\n>> Drift net there you go.\nGotta have that one running.\n\n243\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.190\n>> Yeah that's how I blackmail people\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n244\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.040\nlot of tools then available for\nour wireless.\n\n245\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.710\nI like that list.\n\n246\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.510\nThere's other ones in there,\nSean for Bluetooth.\n\n247\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.870\nSo it's got stuff I can do\nwith Bluetooth as well.\n\n248\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.280\n>> Yes there are ones in here for\n\n249\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.420\nBluetooth, it's got it's\nown little menu in here.\n\n250\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.470\nAnd the things we have that are Bluetooth,\nthey're actually quite interesting,\n\n251\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.760\nreally when you get down to it.\n\n252\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.820\nThese all do stuff relating to the,\n\n253\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.190\nall these do different things\nrelating to Bluetooth.\n\n254\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.980\nSome of them actually relate back\nto stuff we talk about in the CEH.\n\n255\n00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.070\nWe've got stuff like BT Scanner,\nthis one will go through and\n\n256\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.050\nstart looking and\nattach to a Bluetooth interface.\n\n257\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.280\nReason why it's not gonna do that\nhere is because we really can't see\n\n258\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.280\nthe Bluetooth interface.\n\n259\n00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.150\nBut what it'll do is it'll start running,\nand start sweeping the area\n\n260\n00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.770\nusing the Bluetooth interface, and\nsee what Bluetooth devices are around.\n\n261\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.200\nAnd that can help you,\nbecause it tells you the name.\n\n262\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.450\nAnd it tells you the device ID.\n\n263\n00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.213\nOnce you have the device ID, which is\nessentially a Mac address, when you see\n\n264\n00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:23.580\nthat, now you have the specific address\nto that device, you can target it.\n\n265\n00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.740\nAnd you could target it with\none of our other attacks and\n\n266\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.780\nonce you do know that, for example,\nif you go through this list,\n\n267\n00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.820\nand use something like,\nyou'll use BT scanner.\n\n268\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.050\nYou pick up a Bluetooth device.\n\n269\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:41.915\nYou can go down this list to\nsomething called Bluesnarfer and\n\n270\n00:15:41.915 --> 00:15:46.630\nagain, we mention this one\nin the CEH course what\n\n271\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.578\nyou can do with this one\nis you turn on Bluesnarfer.\n\n272\n00:15:51.578 --> 00:15:55.634\nYou can turn this on and\nwhat you can do is you can\n\n273\n00:15:55.634 --> 00:15:59.797\nactually target a specific\nBluetooth device,\n\n274\n00:15:59.797 --> 00:16:04.598\nyou'll notice right here\nat the end It says bt_addr.\n\n275\n00:16:04.598 --> 00:16:09.910\nThat is that MAC address that you\nget from something like BT Scanner.\n\n276\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.790\nYou drop it in there, and\nthen you can give it, for the rest of it,\n\n277\n00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.790\ngive it what options you think are gonna\ngive you the result that you want.\n\n278\n00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.210\nNow, if you're wondering\nwhat those options are and\n\n279\n00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.770\nactions you can take, you know,\nkind of look through the list in here and\n\n280\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.780\nkind of let that settle in and\nsink in what's happening.\n\n281\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.100\nIf you look, you know,\ndown the list, what do you see?\n\n282\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.970\nSee, well, the ATCND.\n\n283\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.000\nThe one right there up top.\n\n284\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.190\nWhat you see there,\nyou may remember the AT commands.\n\n285\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.480\nThose are the ones we\nused to use with modems.\n\n286\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.390\nYou can actually use the same things here\nto use someone's device as a modem to\n\n287\n00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.440\nstart pushing data through it or\neven if you know what you've doing,\n\n288\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.330\nmaking calls through that.\n\n289\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.060\nOther ones we have, we go down\nthe list you can tell it to start to\n\n290\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.610\nretrieve stuff out of the actual SIM card,\nit says the phonebook on here.\n\n291\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:06.740\nYou can read the dialed and\n\n292\n00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.900\nreceived called list out of\nsomeone's device using this.\n\n293\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.330\nThen you can even see down towards\nthe bottom, read the phonebook,\n\n294\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.160\ndelete the phonebook.\n\n295\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.640\nSo you could just blast\nthem on his phone and\n\n296\n00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.140\njust get rid of the whole deal for them.\n\n297\n00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Image what kind of mess that would be.\n\n298\n00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:33.355\nHow many of you actually know people's\nnumbers in your cell phone now.\n\n299\n00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:37.055\nYou're like what was that number again,\nyou got to pick it out and go like this.\n\n300\n00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.345\nThat would mess you up.\n\n301\n00:17:38.345 --> 00:17:39.660\n>> Yes.\n>> If I did that to you.\n\n302\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's something you could do.\n\n303\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.896\nI always thought find someone I don't\nlike and just swap their numbers around.\n\n304\n00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:51.147\n>> Uh-huh.\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n305\n00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:53.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> Call up the wrong people.\n\n306\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.886\n>> I'd never be able to call my dad again.\n\n307\n00:17:55.886 --> 00:17:57.088\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n308\n00:17:57.088 --> 00:17:58.780\n>> I'd like to get a hold of you, but\n\n309\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.570\nI just can't!\n\n310\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.270\n>> Yeah.\n\n311\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.480\nSean switched my numbers around.\n\n312\n00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.665\nSo we got lots of tools we\ncan do it with Bluetooth.\n\n313\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.147\nWhat else was in there [INAUDIBLE],\nthere was that one GUI one,\n\n314\n00:18:10.147 --> 00:18:12.642\nthat Blue Maco I think it was called.\n\n315\n00:18:12.642 --> 00:18:17.030\nAgain, I can't get it to\npick up our virtual line.\n\n316\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.290\n>> Yeah, its just not going to do that.\n\n317\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.690\nBut this one combines.\n\n318\n00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.030\nJust a number of things.\n\n319\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.130\nThis is what it's doing\nwhat BT Scanner does and\n\n320\n00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.000\nit's got some of the stuff\nthat Blue Snarfer can do.\n\n321\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.020\nBut it's got a nice little\ninterface like this.\n\n322\n00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.020\nAs far as it working inside\nthis virtual environment, no,\n\n323\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.520\nit's just not gonna do that.\n\n324\n00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.750\nBut it's another capable utility.\n\n325\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.290\nIt'll sit there and\nscan and find them, and\n\n326\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.240\nthen you can start\ntargeting those devices.\n\n327\n00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.170\nSo that's another great thing.\n\n328\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:53.720\nSomething I do wanna mention shows you\na little bit of the danger with Bluetooth,\n\n329\n00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.650\nis you go to the Bluetooth tools in here\nonce again, you'll notice that as we\n\n330\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.275\ngo through this list we'll see\nsomething right here called RedFang.\n\n331\n00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:10.080\nIf we open up RedFang,\nwhat it will do for us is that it's\n\n332\n00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:16.190\nsomething that allows us to scan\nan area for bluetooth devices\n\n333\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:22.510\nthat are really in essence just turned\noff, or discovery's turned off.\n\n334\n00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:26.330\nSo it can find them and then it can\nactually do little manipulations on\n\n335\n00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:30.870\nthe device ID to start finding out\nwhat services that thing has exposed.\n\n336\n00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.370\nThen, once it has that,\nand brute forces it and\n\n337\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.990\nfinds these things, now you have\nthe address for it, you can target it.\n\n338\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:46.970\nThat address, you can target it even\nthough discoverability is turned off.\n\n339\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.490\nThe bluetooth stuff is turned on, but\nthe discoverability aspect of it is turned\n\n340\n00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.790\noff so it's not broadcasting that\nit's there but it's still on.\n\n341\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.750\n>> So we do the thing right,\nwe turn off the discoverability and\n\n342\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.220\nyou guys can still attack us.\n\n343\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.390\n>> Yeah, and\nlet me kind of throw something out here,\n\n344\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.580\na little piece of I guess maybe trivia.\n\n345\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.365\nWhen you're looking at\nsomething like RedFang.\n\n346\n00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:12.960\nRedFang, I believe I mentioned\nit in passing in the CEH course.\n\n347\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.510\nOne of the things that is interesting\nabout seeing it here, or significant about\n\n348\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.160\nseeing it here like this, is that, yeah,\nyou notice I just clicked on the menu and\n\n349\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.430\nit came up and said what options\ndo you want, how do you run this?\n\n350\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.430\nOkay, well doesn't seem like a big\ndeal considering all the stuff we've\n\n351\n00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.145\ndoing all week.\n\n352\n00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:28.910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n353\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.190\n>> But, one of the things I\nsaid in the past in the CEH\n\n354\n00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.240\ncourse is that this is very hard\nto find in a compiled form.\n\n355\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.290\nThey want you to have to compile it.\n\n356\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.160\nAnd the reason why\nthe creators of this did that\n\n357\n00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.000\nis because they wanted\nthe people that got this.\n\n358\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.970\nTo make sure they knew\nwhat they were doing and\n\n359\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.520\nunderstood what they were undertaking.\n\n360\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.400\nSo they made it that, hey, if you really\nwanna use this tool, you're gonna have\n\n361\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.170\nto either learn how to compile it,\nor you already have those skills.\n\n362\n00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.200\nAnd they're hoping that someone that has\nthat knowledge will be a little better\n\n363\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.075\nbehaved with it.\n\n364\n00:21:05.075 --> 00:21:05.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n365\n00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.930\n>> And that was the idea.\n\n366\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.160\nSo, it was very hard to\nfind it in compiled form.\n\n367\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.050\nSo, here in Kali, we can see,\nI didn't do anything special.\n\n368\n00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:19.000\nThis is the exact same distro that you\nguys would download right off kali.org.\n\n369\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.020\nIt's compiled right in there,\nready for use.\n\n370\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:30.190\nAnd so I think it's okay it's compiled in\nthere, because when you think about it.\n\n371\n00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.520\nSomeone's getting Kali, we're hoping\nthat someone's doing pen testing\n\n372\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.210\nis going to be a little more responsible.\n\n373\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.180\nOf course we know anyone\ncan get a hold of it.\n\n374\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.320\nSo, who knows?\n\n375\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.770\nBut, hey.\n\n376\n00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.510\nMaybe it stopped some people.\n\n377\n00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.455\n>> Keeps some of those script keys at bay.\n\n378\n00:21:45.455 --> 00:21:46.418\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right, so\n\n379\n00:21:46.418 --> 00:21:50.300\nwe've got lots of 802.11\ntype tools we can use.\n\n380\n00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.140\nWe've got a lot of bluetooth.\n\n381\n00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.710\nAnd then there's even others in there\nthat we haven't looked at yet, right?\n\n382\n00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.770\n>> Yeah.\nThere's other ones you have,\n\n383\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.200\nthings for ZigBee sitting here.\n\n384\n00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.100\nAnd then, you even have stuff in here for\nRFID and NFC.\n\n385\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.550\nIf you really want to dig into, whoops,\nif you really want to dig into that,\n\n386\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.770\nyou can get into that stuff.\n\n387\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:17.760\nThere's just all sorts of things in here\nthat you can monkey with if you really,\n\n388\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.650\nreally want to see what those do.\n\n389\n00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.360\nI would tell you with the RFID stuff,\nthose ones are just getting to be so\n\n390\n00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.900\npopular now that you better\nstart ramping up your knowledge.\n\n391\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.640\nOn it because they're using\nthem in just so many places.\n\n392\n00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.930\nI've got a friend that\nworks over in Hawaii,\n\n393\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:47.970\nand when he's in the place where he works,\nhe was telling me that one of the hotels\n\n394\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:55.270\ngives their guests RFID lanyards\nwith the RFID chip in it.\n\n395\n00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.970\nAnd when they walk around they\nalways know where those people are.\n\n396\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.570\nWhen they walk around the facility for\nthe whole time they're there,\n\n397\n00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.200\nthey know exactly where you are and so\nthey're tracking you the whole time.\n\n398\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.318\nAnd then they can deliver\ncertain content to you, so\n\n399\n00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:11.130\nthe idea is to give you\na better experience, but\n\n400\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:16.380\nit's also been shown that RFID tags\npeople will do other stuff with it.\n\n401\n00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.880\nThey can beam stuff out to it and\nextract information off those tags and\n\n402\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.590\nonce they do that, you know, who knows.\n\n403\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:29.110\nAnd even to the next level on top of that,\nsome may have found about four or\n\n404\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.470\nfive years ago that you can even\ntransmit malware through RFID tag.\n\n405\n00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.640\nSomething that's not even supposed\nto do anything even close to that.\n\n406\n00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.170\nSomeone found a way to inject code that\n\n407\n00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.540\ncould spread malware into\nthe RFID chip itself.\n\n408\n00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.870\nSo if you came by and it activated,\n\n409\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.366\nit could actually spread it out to\nyour device or whatever is reading it.\n\n410\n00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:50.313\nWow.\n>> So, yeah,\n\n411\n00:23:50.313 --> 00:23:54.128\n[LAUGH] little experimentation there\nsomeone found out how to do that with.\n\n412\n00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:57.288\n>> I mean, I like the idea of my pina\ncolada being able to find me where I am\n\n413\n00:23:57.288 --> 00:23:57.951\nin the hotel.\n\n414\n00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:00.981\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a good thing, but\n\n415\n00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:06.495\nI don't want anybody RFID-ing any\nmalware to me, we don't want that.\n\n416\n00:24:06.495 --> 00:24:11.468\n>> I think they use the same type\nof technology at Disney World,\n\n417\n00:24:11.468 --> 00:24:14.200\nI believe, the RFID.\n\n418\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.680\nSo, the RFID bands.\n\n419\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.350\nSo, it is becoming,\nyou know it is popular in so\n\n420\n00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.860\nmany different places,\nand I will tell you what.\n\n421\n00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.455\nIf I have to go to Disney World again\nI am going to need Pina Coladas.\n\n422\n00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:28.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n423\n00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.080\nwell I tell you what Sean that's a good\nlook at a lot of different tools.\n\n424\n00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.350\nKali really does bring a lot to\nthe table when it comes to wireless,\n\n425\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.920\nfrom 802.11 to Bluetooth,\nto near-field communication, to RFID,\n\n426\n00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.900\nthey've got the whole gamut covered there.\n\n427\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.740\nAgain, the one big thing with that one,\nthough,\n\n428\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.410\nwe've been talking all week about setting\nup your Sandbox, using virtualization,\n\n429\n00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:53.310\nstart playing with these tools, and\npracticing your Pen Test skills.\n\n430\n00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.610\nThe wireless one is going to be\na little bit of a challenge.\n\n431\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:01.050\nProbably better off finding an old machine\nand installing Kali on it physically\n\n432\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.740\nbecause most of these virtualization\nplatforms don't virtualize the wireless\n\n433\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.668\nin a way that it appears as a wireless\ndevice to the virtual machine.\n\n434\n00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:12.636\nSo that's unfortunate, but hey, that's\njust another reason to convince the spouse\n\n435\n00:25:12.636 --> 00:25:14.830\nthat you've gotta buy another machine and\n\n436\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.410\nyou've gotta install Kali on it and\nall that good stuff.\n\n437\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.010\nRight?\n\n438\n00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.438\n>> Of course, if you're a real hacker,\nyou don't pay for it anyway.\n\n439\n00:25:20.438 --> 00:25:21.975\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n440\n00:25:21.975 --> 00:25:24.780\n[LAUGH] Hacker, thief, I don't know.\n\n441\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.490\n>> But, you know, it's a fine line.\n\n442\n00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.410\n>> It is. [LAUGH] >> I'm testing\nto see if you're paying attention.\n\n443\n00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.650\nIf you don't, it's mine now.\n\n444\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:36.760\nAnd by the way, do remember when you're,\nif you do need to purchase a piece\n\n445\n00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.510\nof hardware to run Kali on,\nyou don't need to go out there and\n\n446\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:48.420\nbuy one of these really top-of-the-line\nnotebooks or whatever to do that.\n\n447\n00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:53.120\nYou could actually buy a fairly\nmid-range or even low-range one.\n\n448\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.690\nThat will work perfectly fine.\n\n449\n00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.850\nThis thing does not\nconsume tons of resources.\n\n450\n00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.020\nSo, you can run it on very little.\n\n451\n00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.250\nI also believe just, FYI, I'm looking\n\n452\n00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:12.340\non the Kali website I believe they also\n\n453\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.205\nhave a version that works\non was it tablets now?\n\n454\n00:26:17.205 --> 00:26:20.380\n>> Mm-hm, on their Arm stuff?\n\n455\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.460\n>> Yeah, it's, no that's for\nRaspberry Pie.\n\n456\n00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.350\nThey've got [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n457\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:29.770\n>> This one the NetHunter\nruns on Nexus devices.\n\n458\n00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.570\nSo you've got even other options.\n\n459\n00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.340\nAnd I will tell you to look at that,\na 10, a 7, and a 5.\n\n460\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.880\n>> And you know your phone has wireless\nand bluetooth and near field and\n\n461\n00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.230\nall that good stuff.\n\n462\n00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:46.810\n>> And you can get the Nexus 5,\nthat's a generation old, I believe.\n\n463\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.180\nOr maybe it is current generation.\n\n464\n00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.060\nI don't know.\n\n465\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:53.630\nBut you can get those things off eBay for\na couple hundred bucks and\n\n466\n00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.250\njust go ahead and do your thing with it.\n\n467\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.690\nAnd same thing with a Nexus 7.\n\n468\n00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:01.630\nYou can get those things for\npretty cheap and Kali Linux is free.\n\n469\n00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.480\nThe thing I would remember with any\nof these devices, as opposed to using\n\n470\n00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.630\na notebook like we've been using here is,\ncarrying around a tablet,\n\n471\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:17.900\nor on the other side a mobile phone,\nthat's not conspicuous nowadays.\n\n472\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.270\nIf someone's sitting in the corner\ngoing tap tap tap on their phone,\n\n473\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.030\nthey think you're either browsing\nthe Internet or checking text messages.\n\n474\n00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.230\nMeanwhile you're just\nsweeping their network and\n\n475\n00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.450\ndoing a bunch of nastiness with it.\n\n476\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.191\nSo, these things can be\nvery easily concealed, so\n\n477\n00:27:35.191 --> 00:27:40.681\nthat's an extra advantage if you're\ngoing to be doing this sort of thing.\n\n478\n00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:41.366\n>> Nice!\n\n479\n00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:44.180\nAll right, well I'm on my way to\neBay to find my Nexus right now.\n\n480\n00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.130\nLadies and gentlemen, that is going\nto do it for this particular episode!\n\n481\n00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.970\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n482\n00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.240\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n483\n00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.280\n>> And I'm Shawn Oriyano.\n\n484\n00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.964\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n485\n00:27:55.964 --> 00:28:01.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.070\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.080\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.020\n>> I'm doing pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.700\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.360\n>> It's a great day to be here.\n\n8\n00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.050\nWe got our Kali Linux\nseries continuing on.\n\n9\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.420\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're going to\ntalk about IDSs, firewalls and honeypots.\n\n10\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.370\nA whole slew of things\nwe need to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.720\nSo where do we start?\n\n12\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.740\nI guess the first thing we need to talk\nabout is, what the heck is a IDS and\n\n13\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.460\na firewall and a honeypot?\n\n14\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.060\nAnd I know a lot of our viewers out\nthere at this level already have\n\n15\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.170\na good idea of it.\n\n16\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.150\nI'm gonna give you just a quick\nrecap of what we're talking about\n\n17\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.510\nwhen we talk about firewalls,\nand honeypots, and IDSs.\n\n18\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.900\n>> Yeah, it's always a good thing to do\na little quick review when you're talking\n\n19\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.740\nabout stuff like this because it\ncan help you get an idea of how to\n\n20\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.550\npotentially evade these\nguys if they are present.\n\n21\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.100\nWell, what they are,\n\n22\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.230\njust kinda look at it,\nwe have IDS as firewalls and honeypots.\n\n23\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.685\nAnd when we look at things like\na firewall, a firewall is a hardware,\n\n24\n00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:17.975\nsoftware device that acts as\na border between your world and\n\n25\n00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:22.255\nthe outside world or\na couple different zones that\n\n26\n00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:26.165\naren't trusted the same way as\nthey would on the other side.\n\n27\n00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:29.585\nThat's a firewall's gonna fulfill that\npurpose where it's going say okay,\n\n28\n00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:32.445\nthese aren't trusted the same, well I'm\ngoing to put a line right here in the sand\n\n29\n00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:36.300\nto make sure stuff just can't walk\nfrom here to over here and vice versa.\n\n30\n00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.020\nThat's what they do.\n\n31\n00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.810\nAnd of course there's many\ndifferent generations of firewalls.\n\n32\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.750\nWe don't really need to worry\nabout that here too much, but\n\n33\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.000\nthere are different generations.\n\n34\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.810\nThose different generations could\nrequire different forms of testing.\n\n35\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.210\nSo, there is that.\n\n36\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.700\nBut then we also have\nsome of our other things.\n\n37\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.800\nWe have IDSs, and\nreally IPSs fit in that same category.\n\n38\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.500\nIDSes are a detection mechanism and they\nare something that works at the host or\n\n39\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.780\nthe network level, and they will\npick up anything that deviates or\n\n40\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690\njust doesn't look like it should be there.\n\n41\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.740\nAnd it's going to happen with stuff\nflowing across the network or\n\n42\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.110\nit's going to be something that's\ndone on a local system and say hey,\n\n43\n00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.135\nthat's not supposed to be happening,\nor someone's misusing something there.\n\n44\n00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.760\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's gonna send up the red flag and\n\n45\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.880\nyou will go ahead, hopefully,\nand at least examine it or\n\n46\n00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.630\ntake some sort of action if necessary.\n\n47\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.150\nWhere an IPS will actually\ntake action on its own.\n\n48\n00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.430\nOnce it attacks it will alert you, but\nthen it will also take that action.\n\n49\n00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.910\nAnd the last one of that trio,\nthe honeypots.\n\n50\n00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.750\nA honeypot is a decoy mechanism.\n\n51\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.500\nIt's used specifically to\nattract traffic to it or\n\n52\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.000\nan attacker to it with the intention\nthat we attract them there.\n\n53\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.360\nOnce we attract them there, they spend\ntheir time and spin their wheels trying to\n\n54\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.980\nget someplace where they're not gonna get\nany place and we can pick that up and\n\n55\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.260\nuse that as time to move more\nvaluable resources out of the way.\n\n56\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.030\nOr perhaps track them back\nto wherever they came from.\n\n57\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.440\nOr even use them to get evidence that they\nwere up to no good and prosecute them.\n\n58\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.457\nThat can happen as well.\n\n59\n00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:16.515\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n60\n00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:19.830\nSo as a penetration tester I have\nto be aware of these things,\n\n61\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.625\nbecause I've got to know\none that they're there,\n\n62\n00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:26.655\nbe able to detect that they're there and\nthen possibly try to evade them so\n\n63\n00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:30.180\nI can continue my test on and\ngo past these guys.\n\n64\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.510\nSo, firewalls.\n\n65\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.650\nHow do we even go around\ngetting around a firewall?\n\n66\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.350\nIf a firewall is blocking ports,\n\n67\n00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.090\nis there anything I can do\nto work my way around that?\n\n68\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.790\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a couple things you can do to\n\n69\n00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.580\nreally kind of get an idea\nof what you're dealing with.\n\n70\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.220\nOne of them is a technique that\n\n71\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.950\nwe didn't directly address it here in\nthis course but it was in the CEH and\n\n72\n00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.390\nwe'll mention it here since we're\ntalking about firewalls again.\n\n73\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.610\nYou can use really any\ntype of packet crafter or\n\n74\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.180\nyou could use just plain old NMAP or\na port scanner to fire off a single\n\n75\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.490\npacket towards the firewall and\nwith an app response on it.\n\n76\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.730\nAnd depending on whether or not with\nthat app we get a reset response back or\n\n77\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.210\nnot tells us whether or not there's\na firewall in place filtering in anyway.\n\n78\n00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.882\nAnd that will tell you the presence\nof a stateful firewall, whether or\n\n79\n00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.381\nnot there's a response\ncoming back from that.\n\n80\n00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.340\nSo that's one thing you can do,\n\n81\n00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.610\nto send that one ping over to that.\n\n82\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.500\nSounds like Red October, one ping only!\n\n83\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.690\nI wish I could do Sean Connery's\naccess right now!\n\n84\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.350\nJust one ping only, lad.\n\n85\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.880\nOkay, you could do that.\n\n86\n00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.810\nNow, the other one you could do and so\n\n87\n00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.150\nyou really kind of flush out\nwhat's going with the firewall.\n\n88\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.130\nThere is a tool in Kaley called firewalk,\nand it is a script.\n\n89\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.980\nAnd what you will do with that\nis you do some configuration and\n\n90\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.700\ntell it where the firewall is, and\ntell it how aggressive you want it to be,\n\n91\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.210\nand a couple other things.\n\n92\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.450\nAnd what it will do is it will\nsend a series of scans and\n\n93\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.970\npackets at that firewall and\nwatch to see what the responses are and\n\n94\n00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.800\nwhat it gets back and how things react\noverall and say, yeah, I know there's\n\n95\n00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.850\na firewall there already cuz I knew\nthat coming into the whole thing.\n\n96\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.770\nNow firewalking actually reverse\nengineered its whole rule set and\n\n97\n00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.900\nsaid yeah,\nhere's how that thing's configured.\n\n98\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.740\nI can see it right now.\n\n99\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.900\nSo another really great tool in there.\n\n100\n00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.860\n>> Trying to determine what\nports are being allowed, or\n\n101\n00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.300\nallowing traffic to go through?\n\n102\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.750\nThat kind of thing?\n>> Exactly.\n\n103\n00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.056\nBy firing specially crafted packets and\ndoing Systematic sweeps of that firewall,\n\n104\n00:05:46.056 --> 00:05:50.315\nit can tell by what it gets back and\nwhat it doesn't.\n\n105\n00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:54.864\nIt can start building the rule set based\non that and say, okay this is what\n\n106\n00:05:54.864 --> 00:05:59.711\nthe rule set looks like and now once you\nhave that rule set you can say yeah I know\n\n107\n00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:04.889\nprecisely how to strike at that firewall,\nso it has little chance of stopping me.\n\n108\n00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.913\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n109\n00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:09.709\nAnd then when it comes to firewalls,\nwe can use tools like firewalking, and\n\n110\n00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:11.990\nthat's the other thing Kali Linux, right?\n\n111\n00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.390\nFirewalk or firewalking?\n\n112\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.060\n>> Yes, we do have that built right in and\nready to go.\n\n113\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.741\nYou just have to give it the address to\nthe firewall and some other things, and\n\n114\n00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.428\nfine tune it, and it will give\nyou what you need to have done.\n\n115\n00:06:25.428 --> 00:06:28.278\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n116\n00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:31.410\nSo we also got to worry about\nintrusion detection systems and\n\n117\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.380\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n118\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.790\nAnd they can be host based or\nthey can be network based.\n\n119\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.330\nDo you give us any special\ntools to deal with those?\n\n120\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.680\n>> Yeah we do have a special\nseries of tools that deals with\n\n121\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.840\nthat which I have just\nbrought up the menu for.\n\n122\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.350\nThese IDS and IPS deals, what they have,\n\n123\n00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.460\nis you can see they have\nways of fragmenting traffic.\n\n124\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.880\nAs well as a couple other tools that\n\n125\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.120\ncan do testing against an IDS-IPS\nto see what the reaction is.\n\n126\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.449\nAnd in the fragmenty ones are fairly\nstraight forward, but they have ones like\n\n127\n00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.842\nthis one, like F test that actually sends\nyou know, different forms of packets\n\n128\n00:07:10.842 --> 00:07:14.597\nagainst it and with different flags\nset on it to see how it responds.\n\n129\n00:07:14.597 --> 00:07:18.915\nSo we've got you know that one and then,\n\n130\n00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:24.122\njust to go through some of\nthe other ones we have,\n\n131\n00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:29.340\nor at least to mention\nthem within this segment.\n\n132\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.180\nWe have the load balancing one,\nto kind of give you an idea.\n\n133\n00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.796\n>> Load balance detector.\n\n134\n00:07:33.796 --> 00:07:36.880\n>> Yeah.\nTo see what the environment looks like.\n\n135\n00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.405\nThen, werewolf I kind of like that.\n\n136\n00:07:42.405 --> 00:07:47.958\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, all right what this is,\n\n137\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.751\nis this one you can see\nweb application firewall,\n\n138\n00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:54.590\nwell that's our [INAUDIBLE] sorry.\n\n139\n00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.830\nStill sounds cool.\n\n140\n00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.355\nI'm going with mine.\n\n141\n00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not wearing my glasses.\n\n142\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.800\nIt's Friday.\n\n143\n00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.684\nI don't care.\n\n144\n00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:04.878\nGuys [INAUDIBLE] coming here for\na three day weekend.\n\n145\n00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:08.279\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n146\n00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.253\nAll this talk about freedom and\nI'm working.\n\n147\n00:08:10.253 --> 00:08:10.810\n>> All right.\n\n148\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.947\n>> All right.\n\n149\n00:08:11.947 --> 00:08:12.865\n>> We got to pay for our freedom.\n\n150\n00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:17.530\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n151\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.890\nWhat this does is this\nwill literally also do\n\n152\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.340\nspecial checks against these web\napplication firewalls to see\n\n153\n00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.150\nwhat specifically that\nconfiguration looks like too.\n\n154\n00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.560\nSo it's got a lot of stuff\nto really kind of figure\n\n155\n00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.660\nout what's going on and\nreport that information back to you.\n\n156\n00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.750\nYou kinda gotta like this kind of stuff,\ncause it tells you\n\n157\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.690\nwhat you're dealing with, and\nthey're pretty stealthy about it.\n\n158\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.310\nThe only reason they wouldn't be\nstealthy is if you decide to really be\n\n159\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.920\naggressive and turn all the options on and\ndid all that crazy stuff.\n\n160\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.222\nThen it's gonna know specifically,\nwhat you're trying to do.\n\n161\n00:08:58.222 --> 00:09:00.730\n>> All right and then the other one\nthat we were going to talk about is\n\n162\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.670\nthe honeypots.\n\n163\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.370\nAgain, a honeypot, we talked about is\na system that is set up that's a couple\n\n164\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.810\nof different ways they can do it.\n\n165\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.400\nBut they set it up\nintentionally vulnerable or\n\n166\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.280\nwith some obvious vulnerabilities and\nhopefully the attacker attacks\n\n167\n00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.350\nthat instead of a system that has\nactual confidential information on it.\n\n168\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.040\nWe can detect that and maybe stop them or\ntrack what they're doing,\n\n169\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.300\ntrying to learn more about\ntheir attack method.\n\n170\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.530\nWhat does Kali bring to us for\nworking with honeypots?\n\n171\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.430\nGive us the ability to setup honeypots or\n\n172\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.680\nmore about trying to determine\nwe're dealing with a honeypot.\n\n173\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.750\nBecause probably one of the things we\nwanna do as a pen tester is the same\n\n174\n00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.250\nthing as the bad guy.\n\n175\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.620\nI don't wanna waste all my time trying\nto work on this honeypot, right?\n\n176\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.760\n>> Yeah, and that's the thing with\nhoneypots as far as Kali's concerned,\n\n177\n00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.060\nyou really have the tools\nalready to detect honeypots.\n\n178\n00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.850\nYou just haven't really\nemployed them as that yet.\n\n179\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.410\nTo detect a honeypot, the most\ncommon methods you would have are,\n\n180\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:09.390\ndoing targeted scans, using something\nlike N Map, to use things like\n\n181\n00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.180\nH Ping 3, which is a packet crafter to\nfire specially designed packets at,\n\n182\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.630\nto see how those are responded to.\n\n183\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.400\nWith the goal that once you do these\nthings, you can start reading the results,\n\n184\n00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.330\nmaybe do banner grabs against open ports,\nand start seeing what's being returned.\n\n185\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.300\nAnd hopefully if you're\nexperienced enough and\n\n186\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.880\nmaybe if you're just lucky enough to\nhit pay dirt, you will see that, yeah,\n\n187\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.770\nit's identifying itself outright as\na honeypot if you look in the right spot.\n\n188\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.060\nOr it might be that there\nis just not enough there.\n\n189\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.700\nSometimes you will poke around and you\nwill find out that there's the look and\n\n190\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.800\nfeel of a real system there, but\n\n191\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.800\nonce you start digging behind it,\nnothing really exists.\n\n192\n00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.790\nYou can have something that\nlooks like a mail server and\n\n193\n00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.020\nyou start digging into those services and\ntrying to enumerate things,\n\n194\n00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.470\nand you find out that it's not\nreturning any users, at all.\n\n195\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.650\nThere's no mailboxes there.\n\n196\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.750\nCuz you're doing your whole thing where\nyou're crawling through an open SMTP\n\n197\n00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.770\nrelay, and you're doing all your stuff and\n\n198\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:10.460\nyou find out there's either no users or\nthere's a very small number.\n\n199\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.760\nMaybe there's 5, 6 users on there.\n\n200\n00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.790\nMakes sense that someone set up\nan enterprise mail system for five or\n\n201\n00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.640\nsix users.\n\n202\n00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.720\nIt happens, but probably not.\n\n203\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.970\n>> Probably not all that often.\n\n204\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:24.230\n>> So you would take that and\nfile it with other stuff that you find and\n\n205\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.080\nonce you've collected all that, pull them\nall out and look at it collectively and\n\n206\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.280\nsay, yeah, this is definitely a honeypot,\n\n207\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.940\nbecause there's too many questions here\nand too many things that don't add up.\n\n208\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.420\n>> So, it's not so much we have\na tool to detect a honeypot, but\n\n209\n00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.690\nusing our normal tools and\n\n210\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.950\nthen our common sense or experience can\nkind of lead us to that conclusion.\n\n211\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.970\nHere is an exchange server\nthat it has two users on it.\n\n212\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.910\nOr here's a web server, but\n\n213\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.330\nthere's no actual websites being\nhosted by it, things like that.\n\n214\n00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.490\nIt is just the default\nconfiguration of IIS.\n\n215\n00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.790\n>> Yeah, that would indeed be what it\nis is that there's something missing\n\n216\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.340\nwhen you get into it.\n\n217\n00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.620\nNow, that's not to say that that's just\nbecause it doesn't have anything in it,\n\n218\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.240\nit's a honeypot.\n\n219\n00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.200\nYou could have systems that have, they're\nfully populated with everything and\n\n220\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.490\nit's a honeypot.\n\n221\n00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.800\nBecause they've gotten wise to this.\n\n222\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.940\nSo they have low interaction and\nhigh interaction honeypots.\n\n223\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.520\nThe high interaction ones emulate\na whole network inside of them and\n\n224\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.620\nthen they even have systems on\nit that have full accounts and\n\n225\n00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.000\nmailboxes and everything else all set up.\n\n226\n00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.233\nSo when you start poking around in\nthere like oh, everything is here.\n\n227\n00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:41.156\nBut still, if you poke around enough and\nmaybe you start sniffing traffic and\n\n228\n00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:45.550\nreally examine anything's closer,\nyou'll find out that there's\n\n229\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:51.220\nthe appearance of movement and life there,\nbut there really isn't life there.\n\n230\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.750\nKind of like the government.\n\n231\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.620\nSo you'll find out that that's the way,\nthat's what it is,\n\n232\n00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.580\nthere's nothing really happening there.\n\n233\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.960\nIt's just using your common sense when\nyou're digging through that to say,\n\n234\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.030\nyeah my experience tells me that\nthere's something just not here.\n\n235\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.720\nI also want to emphasize\nthat some vendors and\n\n236\n00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.480\nsome best practices have been put\nout there saying, if you do a scan\n\n237\n00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.000\nof something that you suspect is\na honeypot, they've set it up so\n\n238\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.390\nthere's a specific port always open\nthat's reserved for that honeypot.\n\n239\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.300\nAnd they want you to do a banner,\nit's put up there so\n\n240\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.470\nyou can not only find it open, but\nyou do a banner grab against it, and\n\n241\n00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.980\nit will identify itself right\nfrom the get go as a honeypot.\n\n242\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.900\nThey're doing that just to say,\nhey you're staring at one.\n\n243\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.780\nAnd they're hoping that if you see\nthat it'll act as a deterrent saying\n\n244\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.890\ngo someplace else.\n\n245\n00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.523\nThis person has deployed stuff and\nis ready for you.\n\n246\n00:13:47.523 --> 00:13:48.232\n>> Right.\n\n247\n00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:49.172\nOkay.\n\n248\n00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:51.950\nYou know, Sean, I was having trouble,\nand I know you did that earlier.\n\n249\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.450\nWhere was, I didn't find firewalk on here.\n\n250\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.000\nYou know where that one was buried at?\n\n251\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.960\n>> It is, where'd they put it?\n\n252\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:08.170\nThis is probably the problems with some\nof these things is that they really\n\n253\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.420\nget kinda buried down in there.\n\n254\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.442\n>> I just seen it too myself.\n\n255\n00:14:12.442 --> 00:14:15.260\n>> All right so\nfar we have firewalk and HPing 3.\n\n256\n00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.460\nWe've got a lot of tools we can\nuse to discover firewalls and\n\n257\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.500\nIDS's and\nhoneypots is another interesting one.\n\n258\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.470\nAs a penetration tester,\n\n259\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.030\nthese are things I've gotta worry about\nwhen I'm doing a penetration test?\n\n260\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.890\n>> Yeah,\nyou are gonna have to worry about them,\n\n261\n00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:35.750\nbecause they are always deployed,\nreally, when you get down to it.\n\n262\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.080\nWell, maybe except for\nthe case of honey pots.\n\n263\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.940\nThey're pretty much always in\nthese larger environments.\n\n264\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.480\nFirewalls, we're gonna see all\nover the place, IDSes and IPSes.\n\n265\n00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.510\nCommon devices in the medium\nto large scale businesses,\n\n266\n00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.090\nbecause of what they can do.\n\n267\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.580\nThey can give you that first\nindication that an attack is happening.\n\n268\n00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.610\nInstead of just a firewall that is\nstopping it right there at the outer edge,\n\n269\n00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.320\nor limiting traffic there,\nnow we have something that can say,\n\n270\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.760\nwell something got over the firewall and\ngot into a certain point.\n\n271\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.390\nAnd we can see it, and detect it and\nrespond to it before it goes any further.\n\n272\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.620\nNow with the last one, with the honeypot,\n\n273\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:23.700\nit's not something you would expect to see\nall the time because of their very nature.\n\n274\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.050\nThey have to be maintained a certain way.\n\n275\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.150\nYou have to be careful with them\nbecause they can be used as launching\n\n276\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.770\nplatforms for\nfurther strikes into your network.\n\n277\n00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.870\nNot every company's just\ngoing to see a need for that.\n\n278\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.490\nI mean, yeah, their main purpose is to\nbe a decoy to attract someone away from\n\n279\n00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.270\nyour valuable assets.\n\n280\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:48.470\nBut companies may decide, instead of\nsaying we're gonna spend money on this\n\n281\n00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.750\nasset, I'm gonna spend more money on\nhardening these assets over here to make\n\n282\n00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.719\nsure that that becomes a reality where\nI have to decoy them away, anyway.\n\n283\n00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:00.506\nBut they all are in play.\n\n284\n00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:03.095\nThey absolutely are all in play 100%.\n\n285\n00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.069\nSo definitely firewalls,\n\n286\n00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:09.543\nmore like you've gonna see an IDS,\nif not IPS then Honeypot.\n\n287\n00:16:09.543 --> 00:16:14.080\nIt depends, but do expect to see them\nout there at least some of the time.\n\n288\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.100\n>> And as a penetration tester\nwe've got to find them and\n\n289\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.270\nthen test them to see if\nwe can get around them.\n\n290\n00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.200\nBecause we've got to know if\nthe bad guy is going to be able to\n\n291\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.630\nGet around those devices or\nevade those types of devices.\n\n292\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.530\n>> Yeah it's either gonna be in the case\nof something like firewalk to see if they\n\n293\n00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:35.610\ncan determine what the rule set looks like\nreliably and be able to get through it.\n\n294\n00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.180\nOnce they're able to reliably determine\nwhat that rule set looks like then it's\n\n295\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.080\njust a matter of getting things\nmoving the right way and\n\n296\n00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.530\ncrafting your tact the right\nway to get around it.\n\n297\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.230\nIn the case of an IDS or\n\n298\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:54.010\nIPS once you detect something like\nthat now you know that you have to be\n\n299\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.290\neven more cautious about your attack\nto make sure you don't trigger it.\n\n300\n00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.230\nAnd then the final one with a honeypot,\n\n301\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.640\nas far as you're concerned you want to\nbe able find out if you can get in.\n\n302\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.300\nIs there, using your methods,\n\n303\n00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.440\nis there a way for you to detect that\nyou're even dealing with a honeypot?\n\n304\n00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.880\nBecause remember,\nwhile you maybe have been given\n\n305\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.140\nprivy to the fact that you\ndo have a honeypot there and\n\n306\n00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.960\nit's a decoy, the attacker's not going\nto have that same level of knowledge.\n\n307\n00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.030\nThey're going to say there's\na system there, a system there,\n\n308\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.280\na system there, and\nthey're all on the same footing.\n\n309\n00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.580\nIt's like no,\nthese two are actual production systems,\n\n310\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.590\nthis one's a honeypot, and\neven though they all look the same,\n\n311\n00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.940\nand that one is indeed different,\nthis one won't take you anywhere.\n\n312\n00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.340\nThis one is a padded cell.\n\n313\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.580\nThat one's gonna get you in there,\n\n314\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.190\nand you're gonna beat your head against\nthe wall trying to get out, you're stuck.\n\n315\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.030\nAnd so we want to make sure that\nthe attacker can't pick that up.\n\n316\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.090\nThat it is safe and sound enough that it\nwill keep them occupied and there is no\n\n317\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.050\nreal obvious way for them to pick up that\nthat is what that thing's purpose is.\n\n318\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.040\n>> I didn't even think about that.\n\n319\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.940\nWe were trying to figure out if we\ncould detect if it was a honeypot\n\n320\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.860\nbecause we need to see how easy it is\nto figure out that it's a honeypot.\n\n321\n00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.520\nIf it's too easy then it's not\ngonna do it's job as a honeypot.\n\n322\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.380\nIt's not gonna attract the bad guys for\nvery long, they're gonna be moving off to\n\n323\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.292\nother servers and\nnow hitting my actual resources.\n\n324\n00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:18.710\n>> Yeah you wanna be able to\nthink in those terms that, yeah,\n\n325\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.980\nit may not be a case of can I break it or\nget around it?\n\n326\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:29.640\nIt may be a case of, can you,\nin this case, can you even detect it?\n\n327\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.340\nIf you dig a big hole in the ground and\nexpect something to fall into it, yeah,\n\n328\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.960\nsomeone is eventually gonna fall into it.\n\n329\n00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.640\nBut if you're trying to trap someone or\nI'll go and yeah, I'll walk around it.\n\n330\n00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.270\nAm I going to fall into that?\n\n331\n00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.450\nWhat are you thinking?\n\n332\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.270\nSo-\n>> This with some m and m s in there.\n\n333\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.160\n>> Yeah, give us some m and\nms or something like that.\n\n334\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.570\n>> Or\na new case of Reese's peanut butter cups.\n\n335\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.476\n>> Yeah, maybe something like that.\n\n336\n00:18:49.476 --> 00:18:53.775\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's just being smart about these\n\n337\n00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:57.640\nthings is that,\nthink about what that device is used for.\n\n338\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.570\n>> All right, well Sean,\na lot of great information there about,\n\n339\n00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.030\nif I can even say it,\nfirewalls and honeypots and\n\n340\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.170\nintrusion detection systems,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n341\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.480\nThese are things we are going to\nrun into as penetration testers.\n\n342\n00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.910\nWe have to be aware\nthat they're out there.\n\n343\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.180\nWe have to be able to\ndetect that they're there.\n\n344\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.520\nAnd in some cases try to evade them,\nget around them or get through them, so\n\n345\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.430\nwe can see what those bad\nguys can do to the never.\n\n346\n00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.430\nSo anything else we want to go over\nbefore we wrap up this episode?\n\n347\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:30.200\n>> Well, do remember you\nare going to see devices like this\n\n348\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.110\nin environments you test.\n\n349\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.450\nIt's very easy to go through something\nlike the CEH or play with any of the tools\n\n350\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:40.190\nthat we've talked about during the week\nand just assume that you can just\n\n351\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:44.310\nreadily deploy those and throw caution\nto the wind and go and do whatever.\n\n352\n00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.700\nNo.\nIf you do that, you're gonna get caught.\n\n353\n00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.784\nYou will get caught.\n\n354\n00:19:48.784 --> 00:19:52.480\nSo what you need to do is first of\nall learn how to use the tools and\n\n355\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.380\nlearn how to them effectively and\nbecome a master at that.\n\n356\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.320\nAnd then once you've done that,\nlearn how you can be more conservative and\n\n357\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.410\nwhat techniques will lower your\nchances of being detected versus which\n\n358\n00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.270\nones will increase your\nchances of being detected.\n\n359\n00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.040\nYou don't necessarily want to be detected.\n\n360\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:14.000\nSo you need to be thinking ahead,\nbut first plan what they are, or\n\n361\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.040\nfigure out, I should say figure out\nwhat the tools do and how they work.\n\n362\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.860\nOnce you got how they work, then start\nsaying okay well I do know there's\n\n363\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.420\ndetected devices on here, and\nby the way, you can get IDSs, and IPSs,\n\n364\n00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:34.050\nand honey pots, and firewalls,\nyou can get all of those for free online.\n\n365\n00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.510\nYou have Linux distros that\ndo that specifically, and\n\n366\n00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.120\nin some cases they have stuff like Snork\nthat takes care of the IDS function.\n\n367\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.410\nSo you can build these things from scratch\nand then test actively against those.\n\n368\n00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.125\nAnd once you have that information,\n\n369\n00:20:46.125 --> 00:20:50.165\nyou could start planning out your\nattack to be much much better and\n\n370\n00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.765\nmuch much more effective than\nit would have been otherwise.\n\n371\n00:20:52.765 --> 00:20:56.015\nSo those are the types of\nthings you should be doing.\n\n372\n00:20:56.015 --> 00:21:01.097\nGo ahead and practice, without concern\nyourself those devices are there,\n\n373\n00:21:01.097 --> 00:21:06.197\nthen once you get better start figuring\nout those devices will be there.\n\n374\n00:21:06.197 --> 00:21:10.477\nHow can I get around them and tiptoe and\ncrawl around without them picking me up?\n\n375\n00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.060\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you enjoyed watching this show.\n\n376\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.670\nFor now, signing off ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n377\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.430\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n378\n00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.445\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n379\n00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.510\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.890\nI am your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.810\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.600\n>> I am pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.220\nHow you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.590\n>> I am doing fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.850\nWe've got another one of our\nKali Linux episodes coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.300\nIn this episode we're going\nto be talking about reports.\n\n10\n00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.720\nAnd reports are one of those things that\ndoesn't sound all that exciting at first,\n\n11\n00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.190\nbut it is an invaluable part of a pen\ntester's capabilities, right Sean?\n\n12\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.810\n>> Yeah, this is something that you\njust have to do, it's part of the job.\n\n13\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.970\nIt's probably not the most\nexciting part of the job, but\n\n14\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.980\nit's something that you gotta do.\n\n15\n00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:53.470\nSo keeping that in mind, Kali does\ninclude some basic reporting tools.\n\n16\n00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.930\nThey're passable.\n\n17\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.950\nYou may actually end up at some point\njust printing your own reports and\n\n18\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.480\ninstalling something like open office or\n[INAUDIBLE] office or something in here.\n\n19\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.020\nBut you know, the stuff they have in\nthere is actually a pretty good start and\n\n20\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.020\nit is definitely useable so\nthat's a good thing.\n\n21\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.170\nYou will have to do reports, you will\nhave to find some tool that you're\n\n22\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.240\ngoing to be comfortable and you're\ngonna have to learn to be organized and\n\n23\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.430\nbe meticulous and\njust stay on top of things.\n\n24\n00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.948\nYou can't go to a client and send a hot\nmess to them and say hey, here you go!\n\n25\n00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:32.260\nYou can't [INAUDIBLE] it down in Post It\nnotes and say, yeah here you go.\n\n26\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.490\nNo, it won't work.\n\n27\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.900\n>> Dump out your shoebox full of notes and\nall that good stuff on the desk and\n\n28\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.830\nsay, yeah, Amy.\n\n29\n00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.110\nNot going to fly.\n\n30\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.250\n>> Yeah, don't do that type of stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.080\nJust shake it.\n\n32\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.550\nIt's like,\nyou pick the problem out of there.\n\n33\n00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.250\nYou know it's in there.\n\n34\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.610\n>> So we have to be able to\ndocument all the time we've spent,\n\n35\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.750\nthe process we've gone through,\nwhat we've discovered.\n\n36\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.380\nRecommendations and\n\n37\n00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.490\nall that kind of stuff is included in\nthis report that we present at the end?\n\n38\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.370\n>> Yeah, and\nall that stuff is gonna be in there.\n\n39\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.939\nIt's gonna be a report of what you did,\nwhat you found and if requested,\n\n40\n00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.964\nit's gonna include what your\nrecommendations are to go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:15.996\naddress these problems.\n\n42\n00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:20.266\nAnd then you will hand that off to the\nclient, and they'll review it, either by\n\n43\n00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:24.280\nthemselves or with you or with their own\nstaff, and either get back to you or\n\n44\n00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.800\njust say hey, here's a check,\nthank you and we'll call you next time.\n\n45\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.660\nAny one of those scenarios could play out,\nbut all of them involve having a report\n\n46\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.770\nthat passes from you as the pen tester\nover to them that they will keep and\n\n47\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.800\nuse as part of their organization\nto fix things as necessary.\n\n48\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.240\nOr, to show that they\ndid have a test done.\n\n49\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.290\nIn some industries it is\nrequired that you do these tests.\n\n50\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.560\nThey're not really concerned about, well,\n\n51\n00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.790\nthey are concerned about what you\nfind if there's a big problem there.\n\n52\n00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.040\nBut even if there isn't a problem there\nyou have to have it, because It's just\n\n53\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.080\nsomething they need to have to show\nthat your doing your do diligence and\n\n54\n00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.110\nmaking sure there's not any big\nproblems creeping up on you.\n\n55\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.250\n>> Okay, so it might not be the fact that\nwe want to get a penetration test done so\n\n56\n00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.870\nwe can see where the vulnerabilities\nare so we can prevent those attacks.\n\n57\n00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.190\nBut it also might be a situation where I'm\nrequired by some governmental or industry\n\n58\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.830\nregulation to prove that I'm getting them\ndone on a regular basis by a third party,\n\n59\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.460\nsomebody else in the organization.\n\n60\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.450\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n61\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.870\nIt may not have anything to do with\nspecifically finding a problem.\n\n62\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.470\nIt may just fall in the category\nof really being an audit,\n\n63\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.840\nthat which you are running an audit to see\nif everything's working as designed and\n\n64\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.330\nif it's not where it's out of compliance.\n\n65\n00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.560\nAnd then you can make recommendations on\nhow it's out of compliance and hand that\n\n66\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.200\noff to the client, and they can figure\nout what the next steps for them are.\n\n67\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.830\nIf they're just gonna leave it as it is,\n\n68\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.670\nif they're going to take other\naction against it or whatever.\n\n69\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.920\nSo, there's a number of\nthings that could actually\n\n70\n00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.710\nbecome part of the process\nafter the report's turned in.\n\n71\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.250\nBut you will still have to have\na report in any case you go to.\n\n72\n00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.182\nIf you don't, it's kind of\nquestionable if you're useful.\n\n73\n00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:14.590\n>> [LAUGH] Now is there any kind\nof standard we have to follow or\n\n74\n00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.450\nanything like that?\n\n75\n00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.400\nOr is it,\nyou're pretty much left to your own and\n\n76\n00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.870\norganize it the way you feel\nbest fits that scenario?\n\n77\n00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.060\n>> You know that is a great question\nbecause I've encountered that one\n\n78\n00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.370\nmultiple times over the years,\nfrom just doing my to work.\n\n79\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.960\nTo doing stuff like the CEH,\nto you name it, is there a format?\n\n80\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.690\nAnd the answer is one of those really\ncrappy poor answers, is like yes and no.\n\n81\n00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.700\nI'm telling you nothing\nby giving you that.\n\n82\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.850\nOkay so, and I'm okay with that.\n\n83\n00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.755\n>> I'm what it is, Sean.\n\n84\n00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:53.082\n>> [LAUGH] I don't have to\nexplain myself to you people.\n\n85\n00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:56.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, the reason why I say yes and no,\n\n86\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.168\nin regards to format, is it's kind of like\n\n87\n00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:08.250\nit depends situation.\n\n88\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.680\nIf it's just a client that wants one done,\nand they're not regulated in any way,\n\n89\n00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.290\nthat it may be that you just are able,\nyou just have to,\n\n90\n00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.070\nyou're able to make your own decisions and\nput it in a format that's understandable.\n\n91\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.280\nIf that's the case, typically,\nyou put a summary and\n\n92\n00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.870\nyou put what the goals of the test\nwere and then start going through and\n\n93\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.180\nsaying what you found and do kind of\nlike an executive summary type deal.\n\n94\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.050\nAnd in my case I'll do\nthat executive summary and\n\n95\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.320\nexplain stuff in as non-technical\nnasty stuff as I can.\n\n96\n00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.460\nAnd then I'll report all the more\ntechnical in-depth information as\n\n97\n00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.790\nan attachment or appendix to that document\nwith the idea being whoever's ordering\n\n98\n00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.060\nthat test may be showing it to a board\nof directors, or something like that.\n\n99\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.120\nAnd they don't wanna see all\nthat technical jargon or\n\n100\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.530\nanything else like that.\n\n101\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.720\nSo they see right up front something\nthat's nice and easy to read,\n\n102\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.210\nhopefully, and they can process.\n\n103\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.260\nIf they do wanna dive into the technical\ndata, it is there too, okay?\n\n104\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.350\nThat's one way I formatted it when I\ndon't have a requirement to put it\n\n105\n00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.680\nin a specific format.\n\n106\n00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.210\nIf it's changed to a situation where you\ndo need to put stuff in a specific format,\n\n107\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.070\nthen what happens is if\nthat industry's regulated,\n\n108\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.950\ntypically your client's going to tell you\nthat there's a format you have to follow.\n\n109\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.960\nOr you will do your due diligence and\nfind the correct template to put stuff in.\n\n110\n00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.870\nIf it's a PCI, Hipa,\nSarbox whatever based audit,\n\n111\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.850\nthey may very well have sample reports and\nthings that you can use for\n\n112\n00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.540\ntemplates to build your own report to\nbe in compliance with their standards.\n\n113\n00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.610\nSo that's kind of where the it depends or\nyes and no scenario comes in.\n\n114\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.800\nWhat's the reason for doing the testing?\n\n115\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.110\nWhat's the environment for the test?\n\n116\n00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.560\nIf it's just,\nit's a non-regulated business and\n\n117\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.430\nthey just want to have the test done\nto make sure things are compliant,\n\n118\n00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.150\nokay let's just go ahead and do it.\n\n119\n00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.870\nI'll do the test and\nI'll use a rough format,\n\n120\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.160\ngeneric type format for\nit and hand it to you.\n\n121\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.700\nBut if it's one of these other ones\nthen I will put it in a specific format.\n\n122\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.350\nBut just make sure if you're doing the one\nthat you don't have a template for or\n\n123\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.620\ndon't require one, make sure that\nyou are still providing full and\n\n124\n00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.770\ncomplete information.\n\n125\n00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.370\nAnd it's something that is easy to follow,\nI would actually even consider\n\n126\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.050\nputting together a internal template\nyourself if you're gonna do this.\n\n127\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.470\nThat you can use for these specific\nsituations where you can just\n\n128\n00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.070\nhave it ready and drop the stuff in and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n129\n00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.613\nI suggest that because not only does\nit save you time later on when you\n\n130\n00:07:54.613 --> 00:07:57.858\nare writing the report you don't\nhave to think of a template.\n\n131\n00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:03.026\nYou're also in a situation where\nhopefully if you create the template.\n\n132\n00:08:03.026 --> 00:08:06.705\nYou're doing it before you\nare required to use it for\n\n133\n00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:10.660\none of these generic type jobs,\nas I like to say.\n\n134\n00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.010\nYou can think about it and really kind of\n\n135\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.010\nplan things out instead of being rushed\nto kind of just jam things together.\n\n136\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.770\nYou can be really careful and\narrange stuff and all that.\n\n137\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.160\nTo make sure that what you need\nis there and it's a good format,\n\n138\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.350\nto make it easy for them to digest.\n\n139\n00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.670\nSo, a little prior planning can\nmake it a little professional,\n\n140\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.870\nmake sure I'm not forgetting everything or\nanything.\n\n141\n00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.530\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Certain things like that.\n\n142\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.770\nAll right, so Natale brought all\nkinds of tools to bury throughout\n\n143\n00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.170\nthis entire series.\n\n144\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.000\nWe're seeing every step of the way.\n\n145\n00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.617\nKali has a choice of tools, not just\none or two that will do the job, but\n\n146\n00:08:46.617 --> 00:08:48.194\ntypically multiples.\n\n147\n00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.641\nProbably no exception when\nit comes to reporting?\n\n148\n00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:51.706\n>> Yeah definitely,\n\n149\n00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:56.640\nit's got a handful of tools that can\nhelp you with the documentation process.\n\n150\n00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.820\nSome of them are actually pretty decent.\n\n151\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.130\nOther ones you might actually kind of\nwonder if it's really useful to you.\n\n152\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.480\nBut when we zoom in on here and\nwe take a look at Adam,\n\n153\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.560\nyou can see I have my\nreporting tools menu, and\n\n154\n00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.980\nI have three sections here: documentation,\nevidence management, and media capture.\n\n155\n00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.950\nNow, the documentation one on\nthe top it's got two things,\n\n156\n00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.710\nit's got dradis, and it's got keepnote.\n\n157\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.280\nThey are both fairly generic\nin the way they do reports,\n\n158\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.220\nbut they are able to do reports period.\n\n159\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.960\nNow the second one, evidence management,\nthis one is probably more useful for\n\n160\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.810\nyou if you are doing a forensic\ninvestigation, because the way\n\n161\n00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.140\nthey're treating this is they're telling\nyou right there, evidence management.\n\n162\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:56.090\nEvidence management means an incident or\nsomething happened, and you need to\n\n163\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.830\nmake sure that's collected in a certain\nway and preserved and documented.\n\n164\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.060\nSo we have that.\n\n165\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.080\nThen if you even go down to the bottom\nof this menu here, what do you see?\n\n166\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.530\nYou see true crypt.\n\n167\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.550\nOne of the things you'd want\nto do with a forensics report,\n\n168\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.820\nconsidering it's something\nthat could potentially make or\n\n169\n00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:17.300\nbreak someone's freedom, I guess is\nthe way to put it if it's bad enough,\n\n170\n00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.180\nyou would have it encrypted, so\nit doesn't get leaked inadvertently.\n\n171\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.120\nSo that would kind of fit in there,\nproviding all that stuff there.\n\n172\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.440\nAnd then this last section for\nmedia capture.\n\n173\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:34.170\nThis media capture stuff is done to,\nwhen you start one of these things up like\n\n174\n00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.770\nthis one, the cutey cap I guess\nis what their calling it.\n\n175\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.500\nThis one can be used to\ngrab all sorts of different\n\n176\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.990\ninformation off the screen and\npreserve it.\n\n177\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:54.380\nThen we also have the other one\non that list under documentation.\n\n178\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.110\nIf we go down to the bottom here and\n\n179\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.150\nreceive reporting tools,\nyou can see this record my desktop.\n\n180\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.790\nWell, it tells you what it's doing.\n\n181\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.840\nIt's designed to take a snap\nphoto of what's there.\n\n182\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.890\nThat, I think, would be not a bad\nidea to have a tool like that,\n\n183\n00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.570\nbecause if you think about it,\nyou may be writing a task and\n\n184\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.670\nyou start seeing a pattern or\nsomething emerging and it's dynamic.\n\n185\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.860\nIt might be worthwhile just taking\nsome snapshots of the screen,\n\n186\n00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:30.170\nand those things can go right into your\nreport to enhance it's understanding\n\n187\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.420\nwith the people that may\nnot be techies like you.\n\n188\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.440\nThey can see screenshots and it starts\nmaking it more relatable to them, so\n\n189\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.755\nthat's a great thing to have.\n\n190\n00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:48.430\nSo we do have a broad spectrum of tools\nwe can actually use to generate reports.\n\n191\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:54.250\nNow, to check this out we've\ngot two of the tools started.\n\n192\n00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.520\nI have Dradis up here.\n\n193\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.560\nWhat Dradis is, as you can see it's\njust something that, you go ahead and\n\n194\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.300\nstart it up.\n\n195\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.430\nI pulled it right off the menu.\n\n196\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.910\nWhen you go ahead and start the thing up,\n\n197\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:12.580\nit gives you just a really kind of\nsimplistic and basic thing to look at.\n\n198\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.700\nYou can go through the thing.\n\n199\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.750\nAnd it can do, for example,\nit can generate full reports on stuff,\n\n200\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.520\nwhich I think this is neat.\n\n201\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.610\nIt can actually format in HTML.\n\n202\n00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:26.160\nIt can even export them out to a Word\ndoc once you save this information.\n\n203\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.430\nYou can just do all sorts\nof little neat things, and\n\n204\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.850\nyou can tell it is\na browser-based utility.\n\n205\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.180\nSo, you can go in here and\ntake your notes and\n\n206\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:41.370\neverything right there inside of it,\nand be ready to go.\n\n207\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.780\nIt's really kind of a neat thing for\nyou to have.\n\n208\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:53.280\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, I really kind of like\n\n209\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.770\nthis whole product,\nbecause it makes stuff really, really,\n\n210\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:01.740\nreally easy for\nyou to get in and work with.\n\n211\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.720\nSo if I go over here,\n\n212\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.590\nI'd have to set up a new user into it.\n\n213\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:17.168\nWell, let me just go ahead and\nput a new user in here of this product,\n\n214\n00:13:18.608 --> 00:13:22.828\nAnd I'll go ahead and initialize that.\n\n215\n00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.350\nAnd so, okay, oh, well.\n\n216\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.850\nReally?\n\n217\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:35.610\nYeah I didn't say that, I didn't, I put my\npassword in, I forgot what my, where's my,\n\n218\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.780\nwhere's my user name.\n\n219\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.790\nDid I put my user name in?\n\n220\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.980\n>> Wait, go back to that for a second.\n\n221\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.870\nI think it said to-\n>> Choose a user name.\n\n222\n00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.480\n>> Choose a user name, yep.\n\n223\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.520\nAnd then just type your password.\n\n224\n00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.140\n>> All right, whatever.\n\n225\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.790\nI don't even.\n>> Let's see if it works, first.\n\n226\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.345\n>> All right.\n\n227\n00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:56.935\n>> It likes to remember your passwords.\n\n228\n00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:02.076\n>> Think I put that in so, there we go.\n\n229\n00:14:02.076 --> 00:14:04.963\nAll right.\n\n230\n00:14:04.963 --> 00:14:11.580\nSo it's got a pretty\ndecent interface in here.\n\n231\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.700\nYou can see over on this side, what you\ndo is you can actually start to lay out\n\n232\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.580\nthe different sections of your report and\norganize your data underneath it.\n\n233\n00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.700\nYou kind of got to really like\nthe fact that you can do this.\n\n234\n00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:30.750\nYou can add notes underneath the stuff and\njust start organizing your data in here.\n\n235\n00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:37.560\nIf I go over here and say add note,\nI can say I began the test,\n\n236\n00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:43.020\nnot trying to be really detailed\n\n237\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.940\nwith it here, so\nI've started adding notes into this,\n\n238\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.640\nand I can just start organizing, you know,\nmy data, you know, right in here.\n\n239\n00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.350\nI can drag and\ndrop it underneath there and\n\n240\n00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.060\nI've got my whole reporting starting\nto just go ahead and get laid out.\n\n241\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.440\n>> Much better than a legal pad or\na three ring binder.\n\n242\n00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.590\nI mean you've got it all right here.\n\n243\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:08.480\nEasy to manipulate, easy to organize,\neasy to prepare that report then.\n\n244\n00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.880\n>> Yeah I definitely,\nwell I would somewhat agree with that.\n\n245\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.410\nBecause I don't know,\nit's I, first of all--\n\n246\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.190\n>> Still pen and paper kind of guy.\n\n247\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.450\n>> I'll admit my writing sucks.\n\n248\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.870\nI have no business writing anything\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n249\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.990\n>> So, I want you to actually take all\n\n250\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.105\nthe pens out of my house and burn them.\n\n251\n00:15:24.105 --> 00:15:26.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because that's how bad I am.\n\n252\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.510\nBut I still do think, even though I'm not\nreally a pen and paper guy, but there's\n\n253\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:39.420\npeople in my situation who just aren't\nreally good at their writing skills.\n\n254\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.400\nAnd I mean, actually physically writing\nit, not obviously bad writing skills,\n\n255\n00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.345\nlike yeah, we've seen your book.\n\n256\n00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:48.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hey, you bought it.\n\n257\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.340\nI got royalties.\n\n258\n00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.356\nI don't care.\n\n259\n00:15:52.356 --> 00:15:57.482\nIn any case,\nI still find it valuable to keep one\n\n260\n00:15:57.482 --> 00:16:02.481\nof those small Those\nsmall notebooks with me,\n\n261\n00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:05.313\nnot the big ones in there.\n\n262\n00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:06.840\nThat's just clunky.\n\n263\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.010\nI want something that I can quickly,\nif I get an IP address or something or\n\n264\n00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.400\nwhatever, I can quickly do it.\n\n265\n00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.120\nIt's much easier to do it quicker to do it\nthat way than have something like this so.\n\n266\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.610\n>> Maybe come back and input your\ndata here later if you needed to.\n\n267\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.505\n>> Yeah I can use both those,\nI find that myself useful.\n\n268\n00:16:23.505 --> 00:16:28.015\nI know some individuals that will\nuse like a little recorder or\n\n269\n00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:31.765\ncellphone and they'll talk into it.\n\n270\n00:16:31.765 --> 00:16:32.985\nI feel stupid doing that.\n\n271\n00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.575\nI've never been able to talk into it,\nit's like, oh and\n\n272\n00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:38.695\ntoday, well this way I feel\nlike I'm just like really.\n\n273\n00:16:38.695 --> 00:16:41.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Taking it too far.\n\n274\n00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.740\nI find it useful just to keep one of\nthe small ones around and put it in as\n\n275\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.330\npart of, put in as all my stuff as part of\nmy test where I hand it off to the client.\n\n276\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.150\nThey have my raw notes too.\n\n277\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.980\nSo you don't have to do that.\n\n278\n00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.652\nThat's the way I find it to be easy to me.\n\n279\n00:16:56.652 --> 00:17:00.190\nI even know people that will go\nthrough and get their cell phone and\n\n280\n00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.110\njust tap the stuff on there.\n\n281\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.240\nI find that's just, I don't need\nall that gadgets to do everything.\n\n282\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.400\nSometimes pen and\npaper is a very useful thing to have.\n\n283\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.901\nBut anyway, that's Dradis.\n\n284\n00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:19.265\nThe other one we have is KeepNote.\n\n285\n00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:25.030\nKeepNote just give you a peek at it,\nit is organized in a similar way.\n\n286\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.250\nYou can see the case over here on the left\nhand side, and you can actually just\n\n287\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.610\narrange notes and stuff like that\nunderneath it, just like we had in Dradis.\n\n288\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.890\nIt's not as pretty, but you do the same\ntype of thing and put your nodes and\n\n289\n00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.130\nall in this guy.\n\n290\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.420\nAnd these are both included\nright with the product,\n\n291\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.790\nso you don't have to do anything\nspecial really to get this.\n\n292\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.490\nSomething I also like mentioning\nwith this is Dradis and this guy.\n\n293\n00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.220\nOne of things we've been doing during the\nweek, when we collected information and\n\n294\n00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.380\nrank commands.\n\n295\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.220\nWe put that greater than sign and\npiped it out to a TXT.\n\n296\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.750\nBoth these utilities will allow\nyou to take those text files\n\n297\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.290\nand add them in there.\n\n298\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.520\nSo, you can just take that text file and\nattach it right to a node inside of here.\n\n299\n00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.300\nAnd have it all organized\nas one big case so\n\n300\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.890\nthey can even see your stuff in\nthere too that you've collected.\n\n301\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.430\n>> Nice.\n\n302\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.290\n>> So, great way to organize stuff and\nmake it easier on you.\n\n303\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.780\nAll you have to do now is\nremember to actually do it.\n\n304\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.030\nThese things can't force you to do it.\n\n305\n00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.060\nYou have to get in there and\ndo this stuff.\n\n306\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.110\nRoll your sleeves up, get your hands\ndirty and write this stuff down.\n\n307\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.938\nIt takes time to really create that habit,\nbut\n\n308\n00:18:37.938 --> 00:18:43.150\nyou can create the habit and\nget really well organized with it.\n\n309\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.470\nThose are the two things that really kind\nof make you shine cuz think about it.\n\n310\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.590\nThe client, what they're seeing, the thing\nthat's gonna wow them and impress them,\n\n311\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:59.180\nis if you have a well thought out,\norganized, informational document.\n\n312\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.610\nThey see that,\nyou're gonna get that wow factor,\n\n313\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.270\nit's gonna get shown around and\nit will impress people and\n\n314\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.820\nthat way you will get invited back and\nget other business off of that too.\n\n315\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.570\n>> That really is the deliverable\nin the end, right?\n\n316\n00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.700\nThey don't see you sitting there\nrunning your different tests,\n\n317\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.530\nusing all these different tools and\nany of that.\n\n318\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.500\nAll they know is, at the end, you're\ngonna walk in and hand them that report.\n\n319\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.990\nAnd that's what they have\nto base your whole job on.\n\n320\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.520\nEverything that you've done,\n\n321\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.110\na lot of times that report is what\nthey're going to use to base that on.\n\n322\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.840\nSo it's got to be done well,\nit's got to be organized.\n\n323\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.280\nIt's got to be clearer to read.\n\n324\n00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.100\nIt's got to present the information in\na way that even a non technical person\n\n325\n00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.930\ncan understand.\n\n326\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.870\n>> Yeah that's absolutely essential.\n\n327\n00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.020\nAnd I would tell you,\neven if you aren't writing it for\n\n328\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.940\nsomeone that is non technical.\n\n329\n00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:59.110\nSometimes that wouldn't be the audience,\nso make sure you're being aware of that.\n\n330\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.600\nNow, if you write something\na little more technical,\n\n331\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.980\nI try not to go overboard with\ntechnical jargon as much as I can.\n\n332\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.530\nI will try to do the same\nthing I did before.\n\n333\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.450\nI will try to put the report together and\n\n334\n00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.740\nthen attach on an appendix with my\nactual technical details on it,\n\n335\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.520\nbecause it seems to make things easier and\nmore understandable.\n\n336\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.540\nPeople like being able to see a report\nthat they can go through just\n\n337\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.650\nkinda quickly.\n\n338\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.140\nAnd see right up front what your\nconclusions were and what you found.\n\n339\n00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:33.200\nFind your supporting evidence and then get\nto the end, find your remediation stuff,\n\n340\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.790\nand go boom, done, okay,\nlike it, we're ready to go.\n\n341\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.760\nAnd then they also like the fact\nthat there's a bunch of stuff,\n\n342\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.610\na bunch of other pages back here.\n\n343\n00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.520\nThat's the raw data that's the actual\ntest itself showing you that.\n\n344\n00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.810\nI included it cuz heck,\nyou paid me to do all the stuff.\n\n345\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:56.140\nThere's all the stuff that you paid me to\ndo right there and you can look at it, and\n\n346\n00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.810\nyou can have your own technical\nguys look at it, scrutinize it too.\n\n347\n00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.250\nIf there's something that\nthey have a question about,\n\n348\n00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:05.340\nit's right there and\nthey're usually happy to see that.\n\n349\n00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.570\nBut making a good report really\ndoes make a good impression.\n\n350\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.640\nI've had, heck, over the last half year,\n\n351\n00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.700\nI've already had two clients\nsay that they love the way\n\n352\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.430\nmy reports actually looked\nwhen they came to them.\n\n353\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.090\nCuz they said they liked the way that they\ncould just look at it and see at a glance\n\n354\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.880\nthey had everything all numbered out and\nall color coded and all.\n\n355\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.180\nThey liked the way that really looked.\n\n356\n00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.440\nSo it impressed them.\n\n357\n00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.830\nIt was the best money ever spent\nto have someone do it for me.\n\n358\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.515\n>> [LAUGH] I knew that was coming.\n\n359\n00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:46.830\nBut it is true though, right because\nthat's what they're gonna use.\n\n360\n00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.970\nThey've got a choice of who they want to\ndo their pin test and a lot of times,\n\n361\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.530\nhow do you separate yourself\nfrom the competition.\n\n362\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.930\nYou obviously your skills come into play,\nbut\n\n363\n00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.390\nyou haven't done anything for them yet.\n\n364\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.628\nSo it's word of mouth, or\ntalking to other people.\n\n365\n00:22:01.628 --> 00:22:05.924\nAnd most pen testers have access to\nthe same tools, the same skills,\n\n366\n00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.430\nthings like that.\n\n367\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:12.360\nThat report can be a really big difference\nbetween you and somebody else and mean,\n\n368\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.770\nas you say, getting other business.\n\n369\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.290\nThey're gonna turn around and\ntalk to other people,\n\n370\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.950\nsay if you ever need one of these done,\nhere's a great person to call.\n\n371\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.840\nAnd they can show that report to them and\ngo, holy cow,\n\n372\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.660\nthis is what they did for you?\n\n373\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.690\nIt's almost like one of\nyour business cards.\n\n374\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.705\n>> It really is it absolutely is.\n\n375\n00:22:29.705 --> 00:22:33.795\nIs that when they see that,\nit makes an impression.\n\n376\n00:22:33.795 --> 00:22:36.735\nThese two companies I was talking about,\n\n377\n00:22:36.735 --> 00:22:42.700\nthey're not the first ones to\nreally say something like that.\n\n378\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.920\nIt was just, I mean I don't get\nit all the time but I do get it.\n\n379\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.400\nIt's just that I don't wanna have\nsomething that is just standard and\n\n380\n00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.130\nbland looking.\n\n381\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.460\nI like to have a little\nkind of creative freedom,\n\n382\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.840\nif you will with it to make\nit look more presentable.\n\n383\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.960\nOne of the things that they,\nthat I've heard that most people don't do,\n\n384\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.335\nthat I do is I will use\ndifferent colors in there.\n\n385\n00:23:07.335 --> 00:23:12.250\nIn the report to draw attention to certain\npoints and to prioritize different\n\n386\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.340\npoints and everything in there,\nthat is something I joke around.\n\n387\n00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.300\nI've done this for years, I've joked\naround and I call it the Manager's View.\n\n388\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.530\nOr I call it the USA Today Plan,\nafter those little\n\n389\n00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.510\ngraphs they have on the front page\nthat always say something stupid.\n\n390\n00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.465\nIt's like, oh, this many crackers\nwere eaten on Tuesday, or whatever.\n\n391\n00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:31.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They always have some weird graphic in\n\n392\n00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.930\nUSA Today.\n\n393\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.523\nBut I call it that because\nyou look at these things and\n\n394\n00:23:36.523 --> 00:23:41.422\ntry to kind of keep those graphs that\nthey do in USA Today as well as the way\n\n395\n00:23:41.422 --> 00:23:45.440\npeople react with different colors,\nI put that in there.\n\n396\n00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.697\nI use a few colors but\nI keep it in there because it makes,\n\n397\n00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:53.698\nit just looks flashier and\nit gets the point across.\n\n398\n00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:57.998\nIf you can see that there's,\nthey can see red, yellow and green.\n\n399\n00:23:57.998 --> 00:24:00.573\nFor different priority levels?\n\n400\n00:24:00.573 --> 00:24:03.760\n>> Most people are gonna understand what\nthat scale means right out of the box.\n\n401\n00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.300\n>> Yeah,\nI don't have to explain anything on that.\n\n402\n00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.260\nTheir eyes are drawn right to it.\n\n403\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.240\nThey see a matrix in there.\n\n404\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:18.130\nI will put a legend on there, but that\nmatrix, they see these rows with a light\n\n405\n00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:23.790\nred background, a light yellow, a light\ngreen background, it explains itself.\n\n406\n00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.800\nI've just made it so much easier.\n\n407\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.780\nThey don't have to call me up.\n\n408\n00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.150\nIt's like, hey, could you explain to us\nwhich ones are more serious than others?\n\n409\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.840\nIt's like, well,\nthat's your top ten list and\n\n410\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.730\nthen here's some other\nstuff back in the appendix.\n\n411\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.580\nThat's a full listing and\nthat one happens to be color-coded, too.\n\n412\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.480\nIt's just things that are done to\nmake things more consumable to\n\n413\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.700\nwhoever is receiving it.\n\n414\n00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.575\nAlways remember the target\naudience you're writing for.\n\n415\n00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:55.165\nThat's one of the things\nthey tell us as an author,\n\n416\n00:24:55.165 --> 00:24:58.725\nthey tell me that all the time when I\nwrite a book, who is your target audience?\n\n417\n00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:02.109\nThat's one of the first things you think\nabout once you're gonna write that book,\n\n418\n00:25:02.109 --> 00:25:03.328\nwho's the target audience.\n\n419\n00:25:03.328 --> 00:25:06.650\nBecause you don't wanna write above them,\nyou don't wanna write below them.\n\n420\n00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.550\nAnd so, try to make something\nthat is understandable for that.\n\n421\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.280\nSomething else I'm gonna throw\nin when you're doing reports,\n\n422\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.570\nthese things can't help you with that,\nis try to do a report that stays away from\n\n423\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.540\nusing big flashy words and\nstuff like that.\n\n424\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.440\nI don't care what your vocabulary is,\nI really don't.\n\n425\n00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.940\nAnd no one else does either,\nquite frankly.\n\n426\n00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.490\nSo don't start using these words that\nare like 15 syllables because look,\n\n427\n00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.190\nI know what that means.\n\n428\n00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.140\nWow, whoop de do.\n\n429\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.480\nWe're not playing Scrabble.\n\n430\n00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.849\nWell, you're not getting a triple word\nscore for that so get it out of here.\n\n431\n00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:41.298\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you wanna do is you wanna use\n\n432\n00:25:41.298 --> 00:25:47.550\nwords that are nice and easy and simple\nand unambiguous and go right through it.\n\n433\n00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.580\nIn fact, one of the things they say for\nsome books is write them for\n\n434\n00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.435\npeople at an eighth or ninth grade level.\n\n435\n00:25:52.435 --> 00:25:54.040\n>> Mm-hm, I've heard that.\n\n436\n00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.160\n>> And it makes it so\npeople aren't getting confused or\n\n437\n00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.870\ncrazy or anything like that.\n\n438\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.850\nDon't use slang,\ndon't use anything like that.\n\n439\n00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:09.700\nAs much as you may be wanting to do that,\navoid the temptation to do it.\n\n440\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.830\nIt's amazing that you should have\nto say that, to avoid slang, but\n\n441\n00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.930\npeople seem to be using it more and\nmore and more.\n\n442\n00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.447\nStuff I've seen over the years people\nhave done with reports and even resumes.\n\n443\n00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:25.000\nIt's like, wow,\nsomeone told you that was okay?\n\n444\n00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.360\n>> Well, hey,\nit's in the urban dictionary.\n\n445\n00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.190\nIt's gotta be a real word.\n\n446\n00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.151\n>> Yeah, totally.\n\n447\n00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.344\n>> Yeah, I saw it on Wikipedia.\n\n448\n00:26:31.344 --> 00:26:33.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> I saw a resume.\n\n449\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.760\nWhen I think about this stuff, I got\na resume years ago and it ain't me, okay?\n\n450\n00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.230\nSo I don't wanna hear\nany garbage like that.\n\n451\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.980\nBut somebody,\nI had a friend of mine show me,\n\n452\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.730\nthat was in charge of interviewing\npeople for a company.\n\n453\n00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.380\nHe was stunned when he saw this resume.\n\n454\n00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.630\nAnd it kind of shows you the type\nof thought process that goes in,\n\n455\n00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.860\nand why you have to tell people.\n\n456\n00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.380\nDon't just do crazy stuff,\nuse something that looks professional,\n\n457\n00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.650\nlooks like it wasn't\nwritten by a psychopath,\n\n458\n00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.630\nuse words that everyone can understand and\nare on the same page with.\n\n459\n00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.380\nDon't go crazy with it because\nthis guy's resume he sent to me,\n\n460\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.530\nhe said you got to see this\nguy's resume that I got.\n\n461\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.570\nHe was like don't share it with anybody,\nbut you gotta take a look.\n\n462\n00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:14.638\nHe says, you just have to see it.\n\n463\n00:27:14.638 --> 00:27:19.260\nI looked at him, like oh, wow.\n\n464\n00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.960\nThe person actually had\n\n465\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.770\nstill photos from the original\nStar Trek series pasted in his resume.\n\n466\n00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.830\nAnd then had quotes from the different\nseries on the bottom and\n\n467\n00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.580\ntop of every page.\n\n468\n00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.610\nAnd he even had listed as\none of his memberships,\n\n469\n00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.680\nhe was a part of a starship\ncrew in some place.\n\n470\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.820\nHe didn't get the job.\n\n471\n00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.820\n>> Surprisingly.\n\n472\n00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.171\n>> Yeah, it's like, what?\n\n473\n00:27:42.171 --> 00:27:45.850\nThis guy seems like he's got\nhis head screwed on right.\n\n474\n00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.700\nSo when we turn in our reports for\nour pentests,\n\n475\n00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.180\nlet's not put in crazy graphics and\npop culture and things like that, huh?\n\n476\n00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.440\n>> Yeah.\nIt should be, I'm not someone that's gonna\n\n477\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.895\ntell you that you have to\nmake the thing very clinical.\n\n478\n00:28:02.895 --> 00:28:09.235\nSome people will tell you to do that, but\nwhen you create a report, don't do slang.\n\n479\n00:28:09.235 --> 00:28:12.975\nKeep stuff so it's very readable and\nit flows nicely and\n\n480\n00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:15.725\nit's not something that people\nare gonna ask a bunch of questions.\n\n481\n00:28:15.725 --> 00:28:18.670\nRemember, you're not the one reading it.\n\n482\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.070\nThey're the ones consuming it, and\n\n483\n00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.860\nI hope when you read the thing you can go,\nokay, I know what I was doing.\n\n484\n00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.100\nWell, of course, you knew what you\nwere doing, you conducted the test.\n\n485\n00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.840\nYou can fill in all the gaps, they can't.\n\n486\n00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.590\nSo, avoid the jargon.\n\n487\n00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.075\nIf you find that you can't avoid\nthe jargon,and I'm well aware that's\n\n488\n00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:34.820\nthe point.\n\n489\n00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.130\nThere's other little things\nthat you can keep in mind.\n\n490\n00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.350\nYou can put an additional appendix\nwith all the jargon that you used and\n\n491\n00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.480\ntheir definitions after it.\n\n492\n00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.980\nYou may actually create something\nlike that ahead of time,\n\n493\n00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.250\nthat you can just slip into any report.\n\n494\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.580\nOr you can do the one that\nwe do in books all the time,\n\n495\n00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.280\nwhere the first time you use a term,\nyou put right after it what it means.\n\n496\n00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.995\nThat way, they encounter it the first\ntime, they see what it means.\n\n497\n00:29:00.995 --> 00:29:03.865\nFrom there on out, you just can put\nthe term there because you've already\n\n498\n00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:06.205\ndefined it once somewhere in the document.\n\n499\n00:29:06.205 --> 00:29:09.352\nBut the thing is,\nthese tools won't help you do that.\n\n500\n00:29:09.352 --> 00:29:12.277\nAnd I'm emphasizing these points cuz\nwhile these tools won't help you do that,\n\n501\n00:29:12.277 --> 00:29:14.292\nthey will get you pretty far.\n\n502\n00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:17.932\nBut you still have to build this with your\nown stuff to make it even look better and\n\n503\n00:29:17.932 --> 00:29:19.662\nget that extra polish.\n\n504\n00:29:19.662 --> 00:29:22.372\n>> Question for you then,\nwhat about the format?\n\n505\n00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:24.752\nI don't mean the format like the layout.\n\n506\n00:29:24.752 --> 00:29:25.912\nElectronic versus printed?\n\n507\n00:29:25.912 --> 00:29:31.922\nDo you have a preference there or do your\ncustomers tend to prefer one or the other?\n\n508\n00:29:31.922 --> 00:29:35.550\nDo you create a PDF or do you print\nit out on physical paper and...\n\n509\n00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.960\nAnd hand it to them.\n\n510\n00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.310\n>> If I have the opportunity,\nI'll give it to them.\n\n511\n00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.000\nIf I don't, I'll put it on a flash drive.\n\n512\n00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.619\nThen I'll put the other, and\nI'll put a printed a copy,\n\n513\n00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:46.030\nand stick it in an envelope and\ngive them both.\n\n514\n00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.780\nIf that's what, if that opportunity\npresents itself to do that.\n\n515\n00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.830\nBut a lot of times it's just I'll\nemail you the report when I'm done.\n\n516\n00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.990\nThey'll print it out and circulate it.\n\n517\n00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.376\nSo you can do either one.\n\n518\n00:29:59.376 --> 00:30:02.780\nFor me, like I said, if I have\nthe opportunity to hand it to them or\n\n519\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.000\nto mail it to them, I will put a flash\ndrive with that in there as well, and\n\n520\n00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.870\nfire it off to them.\n\n521\n00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.030\nAnd then,\nthat way they have the electronic and\n\n522\n00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.640\nthey've got the printed\ncopy in the same package.\n\n523\n00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:21.020\nBut if you don't have that option to\nsend a printed copy out because it's\n\n524\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.150\ninconvenient or whatever,\nthen do an electronic copy.\n\n525\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.870\n>> They can always print\nit if they need to.\n\n526\n00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.206\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n527\n00:30:28.206 --> 00:30:29.851\n>> And then more than one copy, therefore,\n\n528\n00:30:29.851 --> 00:30:31.850\nwe don't send the only copy over to them,\nright?\n\n529\n00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.150\n>> You always keep a copy.\n\n530\n00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.890\nAlways, always, always, keep a copy and\nremember when you keep a copy,\n\n531\n00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.080\nthat copy you should be keeping for\na certain period of time.\n\n532\n00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:46.877\nMaybe five to seven years and then after\nthat you can shred it if you want.\n\n533\n00:30:46.877 --> 00:30:50.735\nNowadays, I don't even know if that's\nnecessary considering that you're\n\n534\n00:30:50.735 --> 00:30:54.531\nprobably, the copy you're probably\nkeeping is on an external hard drive or\n\n535\n00:30:54.531 --> 00:30:56.380\nsomething like that.\n\n536\n00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.507\nJust make sure it's getting backed up.\n\n537\n00:30:58.507 --> 00:30:59.239\n>> Very good.\n\n538\n00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:01.965\nAll right, again,\na lot of great information.\n\n539\n00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:06.800\nI covered reporting and some of\nthe tools that Kali brings to bear that\n\n540\n00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.220\nis gonna help us generate those reports or\n\n541\n00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.070\nat least keep track of all\nthe information that we're generating.\n\n542\n00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:16.140\nBecause if we go back through the\nepisodes, we've generated a ton of info,\n\n543\n00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.400\nall the way from the very first phase,\nreconnaissance, to the very end there.\n\n544\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.705\nSo, a way to organize that information,\nbring it all together in the end and\n\n545\n00:31:24.705 --> 00:31:28.105\nthen make it all presentable so\nthat we can turn it in to our customer\n\n546\n00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:32.145\nas a final deliverable on a,\nsay, a penetration test.\n\n547\n00:31:32.145 --> 00:31:33.479\nSo, a lot of good info.\n\n548\n00:31:33.479 --> 00:31:37.905\nAnything else we wanna throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n549\n00:31:37.905 --> 00:31:39.188\nYeah, well, practice, practice, practice.\n\n550\n00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:44.468\nAnd as far as reports go,\nif you're someone that's\n\n551\n00:31:44.468 --> 00:31:50.460\nnot a good writer,\nyou may wanna start practicing a bit.\n\n552\n00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:56.820\nWriting skills are one of those ones that,\nthere's a lot of [LAUGH] issues there.\n\n553\n00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.070\nI'm not gonna say I'm the best\nwriter out there, but\n\n554\n00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.520\nit took me a while to get to\na point where I could write books.\n\n555\n00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.300\nI still gotta depend on\nsomeone to go through and\n\n556\n00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.960\nclean up my stuff and make sure it's\nactually flowing the right way,\n\n557\n00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.050\nwhich, I totally understand it,\neveryone has to have that.\n\n558\n00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.780\nSo be prepared.\n\n559\n00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.900\nYou may not have that as your safety net.\n\n560\n00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.520\nSo it's important that\nyou get ready to really\n\n561\n00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.550\nwrite those things as\nwell as be prepared to\n\n562\n00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:30.910\nreread those a few times to make sure\nyou are getting across what you want.\n\n563\n00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.060\nIt's tough because when you\nreread those things and\n\n564\n00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.720\nmake sure you're getting across to\nthe audience you're targeting it towards,\n\n565\n00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.900\nyou kinda gotta go in there and turn\noff your brain as a pentester and say,\n\n566\n00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:47.080\nwould it be understandable to\na person that didn't do that test.\n\n567\n00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.600\nSo just a tip there,\npractice your writing skills.\n\n568\n00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.928\nGet used to writing these things in\na way that's easy to understand,\n\n569\n00:32:54.928 --> 00:32:57.475\nmakes sense, and then go on from there.\n\n570\n00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.998\n>> Very good.\n\n571\n00:32:58.998 --> 00:33:02.480\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n572\n00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.640\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Sean Oriana.\n\n573\n00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.405\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n574\n00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:13.640\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
