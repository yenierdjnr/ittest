00:00:13.370\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.350\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n5\n00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.910\n>> I'm doing pretty good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.110\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n7\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.430\nI'm excited because we've got Mr Sean\nOriyano standing right next to me and\n\n8\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.850\nwe're getting ready to start\nour series on Kali Linux.\n\n9\n00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.970\nAnd Sean, Kali Linux is a very\npopular version of Linux nowadays for\n\n10\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.070\nseveral reasons.\n\n11\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.280\nBut, tell us why we want to\nlearn all about Kali Linux.\n\n12\n00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.710\nWhat's so great about it?\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.790\n>> Well there's a lot of great\nthings about it, to be honest.\n\n14\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.440\nIt is, like you said a very powerful\noperating system is definitely what it is.\n\n15\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.550\nIt's a Linux based operating system.\n\n16\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.210\nIt's highly customized so it's not\nthe generic type, like Ubuntu or Fedora or\n\n17\n00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.060\nanything like that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.640\nIt's specifically built for\npenetration testing.\n\n19\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.100\nAnd it also, quite interestingly,\nhas a role in forensics, too.\n\n20\n00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.440\nIt can do that.\n\n21\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.410\nAnd it can do just\na whole range of things.\n\n22\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.160\nIf you have been through our CEH course, a\nlot of the stuff we did in there, in fact,\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.240\nall of the stuff we did\nin there was Windows.\n\n24\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.350\nWhat we're gonna be doing in here is\nshowing a lot of the same stuff that we\n\n25\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.720\ndid in there, but showing you how\nto do those same things on Kali.\n\n26\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.420\nAnd the reason why you would do this,\nsaying, well,\n\n27\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.610\nwhy would you do it on windows and and\nthen do the same thing on Kali is that,\n\n28\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.320\nthere's different approaches, shows\nyou different approaches to something.\n\n29\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.620\nAnd there's also quite frankly\nmore tools available and\n\n30\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.110\ndiverse tools available in the Linux side\nthan there just are on the Window side.\n\n31\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.050\nYou have more flexibility,\nmore power, more options.\n\n32\n00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.290\nAnd so this is just to open\nup a world even more for you.\n\n33\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.190\nSo this is something that you can use\nto just really enhance your power and\n\n34\n00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.690\ncapabilities more than they already are.\n\n35\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.070\nSo if you've taken the CEH,\n\n36\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.850\nyou're gonna get to see\na different viewpoint on things.\n\n37\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.780\nIf you haven't, well that's fine.\n\n38\n00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.150\nWe're gonna show you how it fits in and\nshow you the process and\n\n39\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.610\nshow you the tools you use along the way.\n\n40\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.160\nTalk about the differences and all that\ngood stuff to really kind of get you\n\n41\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.870\ngoing, get you more comfortable with it.\n\n42\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.335\nThen you can do more exploring\non your own afterwards.\n\n43\n00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:06.340\nCuz there's still plenty that we won't\neven get to in here, there's just so\n\n44\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.510\nmuch with this tool.\n\n45\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.090\nBut this is really just to\nkind of get you going, and\n\n46\n00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.350\nyou'll definitely be able to after all is\nsaid and done with this series of courses.\n\n47\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.510\nYou'll be able to say, oh, let me explore\nsome more here and try some stuff out.\n\n48\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.297\n>> Fantastic.\n\n49\n00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.656\nAll right, well I hope that got\nyou as excited as it got me,\n\n50\n00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:25.780\nI'm really dying to learn\na lot more about this.\n\n51\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.090\nI'm a Windows guy by nature,\n\n52\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.290\nI've played with a bunch of\ndifferent versions of Linux.\n\n53\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.390\nThis one just seems to have\neverything built in to it.\n\n54\n00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.290\nI don't have a lot of compiling,\nor extra tools to do.\n\n55\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.900\nWe can do quite a lot with it.\n\n56\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.120\nSo hopefully everybody is ready.\n\n57\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.130\nSo stay tuned.\n\n58\n00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.972\nWe'll be back with more on Kali Linux.\n\n59\n00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:42.472\n[SOUND]\n\n",
