          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.940\n[SOUND] Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n2\n00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.020\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose and\nthis a really exciting new certification.\n\n3\n00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.640\nSo you guys might not have been\nable to research ahead of time,\n\n4\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.080\nso we have the expert,\nthe developer in house today.\n\n5\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.392\nHer name is Dr. Tara.\n\n6\n00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:26.669\nAnd she's gonna tell us a little\nbit about where to take the exam,\n\n7\n00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.120\nhow to take the exam,\nwhat to study for the exam.\n\n8\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.420\nSo thank you for being here today Doctor.\n\n9\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.695\n&gt;&gt; What do we look at?\n\n11\n00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:36.380\nWe decide that we wanna work\nin project management or\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.350\nmaybe this is a requirement for\na company that I work for.\n\n13\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.010\nSo where do I begin?\n\n14\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.809\n&gt;&gt; Well the new Lean and Agile Project\nManagement Certification right\n\n15\n00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.859\nnow is only offered through SSV Global,\nand that's my company, but,\n\n16\n00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.677\nover the next couple of months\nit'll be offered by other entities.\n\n17\n00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:58.130\nSo that's the first thing\nthat you wanna keep in mind.\n\n18\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.930\nIt's based on the book Lean and\nAgile Project Management.\n\n19\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.090\nAnd the concept behind it is that there's\ntraditional project management that can be\n\n20\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.140\nmade better, faster, more cost effective\nby using Lean and Agile tools.\n\n21\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.000\nSo that's the concept.\n\n22\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.060\nSo the very first thing\nthat we did is we leaned\n\n23\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.570\nout the project management lifecycle.\n\n24\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.620\nAnd we call it the project\nlifecycle composite.\n\n25\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.730\nSo different bodies of\nknowledge have different\n\n26\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.090\nphases that are supposed to\nbe recognized in the model.\n\n27\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.770\nWe really linked that out.\n\n28\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.880\nSo even if you don't have\na background in project management,\n\n29\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.440\nyou can now look at a project and\nmanage it in a very structured way.\n\n30\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.090\nHowever, within that structure, within\nthat framework, you can use lean and\n\n31\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.380\nagile tools to make any project\nthat you're working on better,\n\n32\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.210\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n33\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.290\nWhat I think is really valuable\nabout this course is that\n\n34\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.730\nif you're managing some household\nprojects as well, not just IT projects or\n\n35\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.800\nprojects for your company in general,\n\n36\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.940\nyou can use this kind of structure to\nwork through your personal life as well.\n\n37\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.930\nSo what you do for\nthis particular certification\n\n38\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.650\nis that you would go to our\nwebsite at SSD global solutions,\n\n39\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.800\nyou would locate the ITProTV student link,\nwhich is right on the home page.\n\n40\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.990\nAnd there are some prerequisites that you\nneed to do in order to sit for the exam.\n\n41\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.690\nOne of the major prerequisites\nwould be satisfied\n\n42\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.550\nby watching this series because\nthat's the educational requirement.\n\n43\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.230\nSo you would sign an affidavit\nthat you did, in fact,\n\n44\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.520\nwatch all of the shows in the series.\n\n45\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.790\nBut there are some reading assignments\nwith some questions and answers.\n\n46\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.380\nWe do require that you submit a project.\n\n47\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.290\nHowever, we give you the template.\n\n48\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.100\nWe want you to submit a project using\nthe new PLC, the Project Life Cycle.\n\n49\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.410\nYou can rework an old project.\n\n50\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.190\nIf you don't have a project, we have\nhundreds of projects available that you\n\n51\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.160\ncan work on that are actually real\nprojects, so that kinda makes it more fun.\n\n52\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.761\nAnd then you sit for the exam.\n\n53\n00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:08.661\nOnce you pass the exam,\nyou are considered LAPM level one.\n\n54\n00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:11.369\nThere's only going to be\ntwo levels to the LAPM,\n\n55\n00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.352\nthere's a lot of interest\nin the industry right now.\n\n56\n00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.430\nSo you would be on the cutting edge.\n\n57\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.436\nAnd I think one of the sort of the\nadvantages for ITProTV students is that,\n\n58\n00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:26.683\nif you come in and take the test within\nthe next few months, there really are no\n\n59\n00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:31.887\ncontinuing education things that you\nhave to do to keep the certification.\n\n60\n00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:34.538\nThe certification is your\ncertification for life.\n\n61\n00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:39.225\nThat will be changing as well because\nsince the continuing education\n\n62\n00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:43.200\ncredits haven't really been\ncompletely developed yet.\n\n63\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.200\nAs people are taking the test before that,\nthey'll be grandfathered.\n\n64\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.684\nSo, I think that's kinda fun.\n\n65\n00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:51.643\nAlthough, I know everyone out\nthere will want to learn anyway.\n\n66\n00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:56.390\nSo if you end up taking the test and still\nhave to do those continuing education\n\n67\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.445\ncredits, I think that they're\ngonna be valuable to the craft.\n\n68\n00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:02.385\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI hope I can find some time to do this.\n\n69\n00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:06.289\nI just have a couple other certifications\nthat I'm looking at as well but\n\n70\n00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.809\nhaving a certification that you\ndon't have to re-certify every\n\n71\n00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.799\nfew years is a really great concept.\n\n72\n00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:12.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\n\n73\n00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:17.890\nI think really the take away from this is\nthat as we move forward in this universe.\n\n74\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.040\nPeople are starting to realize that we can\nkind of piece meal things together and\n\n75\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.870\njust take the best of the best.\n\n76\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.550\nSo being able to make my project better,\nfaster, and\n\n77\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.050\nmore cost effective by using lean and\n\n78\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.150\nagile tools to do that, I'm touching\nall these different methodologies.\n\n79\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.660\nAnd I think what the LAPM Level one\nexam buys you on your resume is\n\n80\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.420\nthat if you go into an environment where\nthere's been mergers and acquisitions and\n\n81\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.610\neveryone's kind of working on their own\nthing, it's a way that you can say,\n\n82\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120\nyou know what,\nI'm familiar with all these methodologies.\n\n83\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.990\nAnd maybe I'm not an expert but I get it.\n\n84\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.090\nAnd as an IT professional,\n\n85\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.620\nI think I could work at this company\nno matter what you're working on.\n\n86\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.490\n&gt;&gt; So what should we bo looking at,\n\n87\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.050\nor what are we going to be looking at\nas we continue through this series?\n\n88\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.454\n&gt;&gt; Well the first thing that we'll\ntalk about is how to get certified,\n\n89\n00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.792\nwhich we've kind of\ncovered in this segment.\n\n90\n00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:11.894\nBut the big thing that we're gonna focus\non is that right now there are three\n\n91\n00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:14.890\nbodies of traditional project management.\n\n92\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.460\nAnd so it used to be really easy,\n\n93\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.370\nthere used to be one that everyone\nwas pretty much following.\n\n94\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.340\nBut now there's kind of\na few different spins.\n\n95\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.250\nSo we took all that information, and\n\n96\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.330\nwe condensed it into our version\nof the project lifecycle.\n\n97\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.070\nAnd we're saying, you know what?\n\n98\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.800\nIn four phases you can\nhit all the high points.\n\n99\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.880\nSo we're gonna spend a lot of time\ntalking about the actual model to\n\n100\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.560\nuse if you wanna make your projects\nbetter, faster and more cost effective.\n\n101\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.980\nAnd then of course we're\ngonna cover lean and\n\n102\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.410\nagile tools that play into\neach one of those phases.\n\n103\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.290\nSo for example the first phase\nof our model is selection, so\n\n104\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.090\nwe have all kinds of selection tools.\n\n105\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.200\nHow do I know I've selected\nthe right project?\n\n106\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.740\nHow do I get by in that type of thing?\n\n107\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.764\nAnd then when we move to planning,\nwe remind you of the traditional project\n\n108\n00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:08.568\nmanagement tools because that might\nbe the environment that you go in.\n\n109\n00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:12.510\nBut then we talk to you about how\nlean in and agile plans project so\n\n110\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.410\nthat you have more tools\nthan your tool chest, right?\n\n111\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.826\nAnd then we go to the third phase\nof the model which is execution and\n\n112\n00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:22.762\nwe give you tips and tricks.\n\n113\n00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:27.303\nAnd then, of course, on the student page,\nthere's other handouts that will kind of\n\n114\n00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:31.290\nget you thinking, how can I execute\nthis project in a seamless way?\n\n115\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.965\nAnd then finally in closing,\nwe talk about some things such as the 5S\n\n116\n00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:40.720\nModel which is really a Lean Six Sigma\nModel that agile people are using\n\n117\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.640\nthat helps us keep physically organized.\n\n118\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.889\n&gt;&gt; Well I don't know about you, but\nI'm really excited to go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.380\nlearn this brand new content.\n\n120\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.610\nAnd the way that it's been packaged for\nthis brand new certification.\n\n121\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.770\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n122\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.440\nIf you plan on learning our Lean and\nAgile project management, stay tuned.\n\n123\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.910\nWe have some really great\ninformation headed your way.\n\n124\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.220\nSee you.\n\n125\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.644\n[SOUND]\n\n",
