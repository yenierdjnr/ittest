          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.940\n[SOUND] Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n2\n00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.020\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose and\nthis a really exciting new certification.\n\n3\n00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.640\nSo you guys might not have been\nable to research ahead of time,\n\n4\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.080\nso we have the expert,\nthe developer in house today.\n\n5\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.392\nHer name is Dr. Tara.\n\n6\n00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:26.669\nAnd she's gonna tell us a little\nbit about where to take the exam,\n\n7\n00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.120\nhow to take the exam,\nwhat to study for the exam.\n\n8\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.420\nSo thank you for being here today Doctor.\n\n9\n00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.695\n&gt;&gt; What do we look at?\n\n11\n00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:36.380\nWe decide that we wanna work\nin project management or\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.350\nmaybe this is a requirement for\na company that I work for.\n\n13\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.010\nSo where do I begin?\n\n14\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.809\n&gt;&gt; Well the new Lean and Agile Project\nManagement Certification right\n\n15\n00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.859\nnow is only offered through SSV Global,\nand that's my company, but,\n\n16\n00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.677\nover the next couple of months\nit'll be offered by other entities.\n\n17\n00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:58.130\nSo that's the first thing\nthat you wanna keep in mind.\n\n18\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.930\nIt's based on the book Lean and\nAgile Project Management.\n\n19\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.090\nAnd the concept behind it is that there's\ntraditional project management that can be\n\n20\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.140\nmade better, faster, more cost effective\nby using Lean and Agile tools.\n\n21\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.000\nSo that's the concept.\n\n22\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.060\nSo the very first thing\nthat we did is we leaned\n\n23\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.570\nout the project management lifecycle.\n\n24\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.620\nAnd we call it the project\nlifecycle composite.\n\n25\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.730\nSo different bodies of\nknowledge have different\n\n26\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.090\nphases that are supposed to\nbe recognized in the model.\n\n27\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.770\nWe really linked that out.\n\n28\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.880\nSo even if you don't have\na background in project management,\n\n29\n00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.440\nyou can now look at a project and\nmanage it in a very structured way.\n\n30\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.090\nHowever, within that structure, within\nthat framework, you can use lean and\n\n31\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.380\nagile tools to make any project\nthat you're working on better,\n\n32\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.210\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n33\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.290\nWhat I think is really valuable\nabout this course is that\n\n34\n00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.730\nif you're managing some household\nprojects as well, not just IT projects or\n\n35\n00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.800\nprojects for your company in general,\n\n36\n00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.940\nyou can use this kind of structure to\nwork through your personal life as well.\n\n37\n00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.930\nSo what you do for\nthis particular certification\n\n38\n00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.650\nis that you would go to our\nwebsite at SSD global solutions,\n\n39\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.800\nyou would locate the ITProTV student link,\nwhich is right on the home page.\n\n40\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.990\nAnd there are some prerequisites that you\nneed to do in order to sit for the exam.\n\n41\n00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.690\nOne of the major prerequisites\nwould be satisfied\n\n42\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.550\nby watching this series because\nthat's the educational requirement.\n\n43\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.230\nSo you would sign an affidavit\nthat you did, in fact,\n\n44\n00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.520\nwatch all of the shows in the series.\n\n45\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.790\nBut there are some reading assignments\nwith some questions and answers.\n\n46\n00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.380\nWe do require that you submit a project.\n\n47\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.290\nHowever, we give you the template.\n\n48\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.100\nWe want you to submit a project using\nthe new PLC, the Project Life Cycle.\n\n49\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.410\nYou can rework an old project.\n\n50\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.190\nIf you don't have a project, we have\nhundreds of projects available that you\n\n51\n00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.160\ncan work on that are actually real\nprojects, so that kinda makes it more fun.\n\n52\n00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.761\nAnd then you sit for the exam.\n\n53\n00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:08.661\nOnce you pass the exam,\nyou are considered LAPM level one.\n\n54\n00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:11.369\nThere's only going to be\ntwo levels to the LAPM,\n\n55\n00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.352\nthere's a lot of interest\nin the industry right now.\n\n56\n00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.430\nSo you would be on the cutting edge.\n\n57\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.436\nAnd I think one of the sort of the\nadvantages for ITProTV students is that,\n\n58\n00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:26.683\nif you come in and take the test within\nthe next few months, there really are no\n\n59\n00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:31.887\ncontinuing education things that you\nhave to do to keep the certification.\n\n60\n00:03:31.887 --> 00:03:34.538\nThe certification is your\ncertification for life.\n\n61\n00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:39.225\nThat will be changing as well because\nsince the continuing education\n\n62\n00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:43.200\ncredits haven't really been\ncompletely developed yet.\n\n63\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.200\nAs people are taking the test before that,\nthey'll be grandfathered.\n\n64\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.684\nSo, I think that's kinda fun.\n\n65\n00:03:48.684 --> 00:03:51.643\nAlthough, I know everyone out\nthere will want to learn anyway.\n\n66\n00:03:51.643 --> 00:03:56.390\nSo if you end up taking the test and still\nhave to do those continuing education\n\n67\n00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.445\ncredits, I think that they're\ngonna be valuable to the craft.\n\n68\n00:04:00.445 --> 00:04:02.385\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI hope I can find some time to do this.\n\n69\n00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:06.289\nI just have a couple other certifications\nthat I'm looking at as well but\n\n70\n00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.809\nhaving a certification that you\ndon't have to re-certify every\n\n71\n00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.799\nfew years is a really great concept.\n\n72\n00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:12.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly and\n\n73\n00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:17.890\nI think really the take away from this is\nthat as we move forward in this universe.\n\n74\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.040\nPeople are starting to realize that we can\nkind of piece meal things together and\n\n75\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.870\njust take the best of the best.\n\n76\n00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.550\nSo being able to make my project better,\nfaster, and\n\n77\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.050\nmore cost effective by using lean and\n\n78\n00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.150\nagile tools to do that, I'm touching\nall these different methodologies.\n\n79\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.660\nAnd I think what the LAPM Level one\nexam buys you on your resume is\n\n80\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.420\nthat if you go into an environment where\nthere's been mergers and acquisitions and\n\n81\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.610\neveryone's kind of working on their own\nthing, it's a way that you can say,\n\n82\n00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120\nyou know what,\nI'm familiar with all these methodologies.\n\n83\n00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.990\nAnd maybe I'm not an expert but I get it.\n\n84\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.090\nAnd as an IT professional,\n\n85\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.620\nI think I could work at this company\nno matter what you're working on.\n\n86\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.490\n&gt;&gt; So what should we bo looking at,\n\n87\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.050\nor what are we going to be looking at\nas we continue through this series?\n\n88\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.454\n&gt;&gt; Well the first thing that we'll\ntalk about is how to get certified,\n\n89\n00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.792\nwhich we've kind of\ncovered in this segment.\n\n90\n00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:11.894\nBut the big thing that we're gonna focus\non is that right now there are three\n\n91\n00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:14.890\nbodies of traditional project management.\n\n92\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.460\nAnd so it used to be really easy,\n\n93\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.370\nthere used to be one that everyone\nwas pretty much following.\n\n94\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.340\nBut now there's kind of\na few different spins.\n\n95\n00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.250\nSo we took all that information, and\n\n96\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.330\nwe condensed it into our version\nof the project lifecycle.\n\n97\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.070\nAnd we're saying, you know what?\n\n98\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.800\nIn four phases you can\nhit all the high points.\n\n99\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.880\nSo we're gonna spend a lot of time\ntalking about the actual model to\n\n100\n00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.560\nuse if you wanna make your projects\nbetter, faster and more cost effective.\n\n101\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.980\nAnd then of course we're\ngonna cover lean and\n\n102\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.410\nagile tools that play into\neach one of those phases.\n\n103\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.290\nSo for example the first phase\nof our model is selection, so\n\n104\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.090\nwe have all kinds of selection tools.\n\n105\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.200\nHow do I know I've selected\nthe right project?\n\n106\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.740\nHow do I get by in that type of thing?\n\n107\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.764\nAnd then when we move to planning,\nwe remind you of the traditional project\n\n108\n00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:08.568\nmanagement tools because that might\nbe the environment that you go in.\n\n109\n00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:12.510\nBut then we talk to you about how\nlean in and agile plans project so\n\n110\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.410\nthat you have more tools\nthan your tool chest, right?\n\n111\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.826\nAnd then we go to the third phase\nof the model which is execution and\n\n112\n00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:22.762\nwe give you tips and tricks.\n\n113\n00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:27.303\nAnd then, of course, on the student page,\nthere's other handouts that will kind of\n\n114\n00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:31.290\nget you thinking, how can I execute\nthis project in a seamless way?\n\n115\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.965\nAnd then finally in closing,\nwe talk about some things such as the 5S\n\n116\n00:06:35.965 --> 00:06:40.720\nModel which is really a Lean Six Sigma\nModel that agile people are using\n\n117\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.640\nthat helps us keep physically organized.\n\n118\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.889\n&gt;&gt; Well I don't know about you, but\nI'm really excited to go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.380\nlearn this brand new content.\n\n120\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.610\nAnd the way that it's been packaged for\nthis brand new certification.\n\n121\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.770\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n122\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.440\nIf you plan on learning our Lean and\nAgile project management, stay tuned.\n\n123\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.910\nWe have some really great\ninformation headed your way.\n\n124\n00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.220\nSee you.\n\n125\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.644\n[SOUND]\n\n",

Thank you Cherokee, and again,\n\n14\n00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.740\nI'm excited too because many people have\nbeen talking about how we could blend\n\n15\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.140\nLean and Agile into project management for\nabout a decade.\n\n16\n00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.050\nAnd we've had some attempts where\nwe've had Lean Project Management,\n\n17\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.090\nAgile Project Management, and in fact,\nyou may have taken some courses in there.\n\n18\n00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.790\nHowever, my company, SSD Global Solutions,\n\n19\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.050\nis the first to publish Lean &amp;\nAgile Project Management together.\n\n20\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.140\nSo I am very very excited.\n\n21\n00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.210\n&gt;&gt; Well congratulations.\n\n22\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.050\nThat's great news.\n\n23\n00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.290\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n24\n00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.310\nNow in the Lean &amp;\nAgile Project Management,\n\n25\n00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.550\nthe objectives are that\nwe wanna introduce you.\n\n26\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.263\nI mean the real objective is we wanna\nshow you how you can use Lean &amp; Agile\n\n27\n00:01:21.263 --> 00:01:25.740\ntools to make your projects better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n28\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.490\nThe other thing that we want to do\nis we want to explain the LAPM exam.\n\n29\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.725\nSo the LAPM exam, sorry,\n\n30\n00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:40.950\nis only now available\nthrough SSD Global Solutions\n\n31\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.160\nbecause we created the exam and\nwe have the base core material.\n\n32\n00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.600\nSo we will be the industry standard.\n\n33\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.720\nIn another year or two there will be other\ncompanies that you can take it from.\n\n34\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.240\nNow the advantage is that if you\ndo take it in the next year or\n\n35\n00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.300\nso, there's not going to be any\nCEUs that you have to do to keep up\n\n36\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.880\nthat certification like you would normally\ndo in most certification programs.\n\n37\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.530\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nSo technically you'd essentially be\n\n38\n00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.500\ngrandfathered in.\n\n39\n00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.580\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n40\n00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.180\nSo you'd be grandfathered\ninto the program.\n\n41\n00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.050\nAnd you would also be on the cutting edge\nof those people that say they're Level I.\n\n42\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.330\nThe LAPM right now were only going\nto have a Level I and a Level II.\n\n43\n00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.530\nSo, those of you that\nare interested in Level I,\n\n44\n00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.840\nthere is a Level II to go to if you\ndecide that you wanna continue.\n\n45\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; But right now it will just be\n\n46\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.460\nthe LAPM Level I Exam.\n\n47\n00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.230\nNow the whole purpose of Lean &amp; Agile\nProject Management, as I said before,\n\n48\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.230\nis to teach you how to make a project\nbetter, faster, and more cost effective.\n\n49\n00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.740\nIn the past this has been something\nthat's been dedicated to process\n\n50\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.150\nimprovement projects.\n\n51\n00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.020\nThe difference between a project and\na process improvement project,\n\n52\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.495\nis that a project you pretty much\nknow what you're going to do.\n\n53\n00:02:55.495 --> 00:02:58.200\nYou know the beginning and\nend, you know the problem,\n\n54\n00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.250\nyou know the solution, you may even\nhave a project plan available.\n\n55\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.723\nAnd how the project process\nimprovement tools can help you is\n\n56\n00:03:06.723 --> 00:03:11.510\nyou can kind of streamline some\nof those things that you're\n\n57\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.590\ndoing in a project right now by\ncapitalizing on process improvement tools.\n\n58\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.430\nSo a process improvement project\nusually you know the problem,\n\n59\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.710\nbut you don't know the solution.\n\n60\n00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.670\nSo there's a whole bevy of\ncritical thinking skills\n\n61\n00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.980\nthat we have figured out how to apply\nto just regular project management.\n\n62\n00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.240\n&gt;&gt; Well great, let's go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.470\nget started with all this\nnew brand new information.\n\n64\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920\nI'm super excited and I hope you are too.\n\n65\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.930\nBut for this particular episode,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap up, and\n\n66\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.470\nI'll sign off as your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n67\n00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.320\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n68\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.164\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n69\n00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:55.476\n[MUSIC]\n\n70\n00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:58.813\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.630\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.970\nHere in session 1, we're gonna talk\nabout well, where to begin and\n\n7\n00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.700\nhow to get started for\nthis brand new certification learning.\n\n8\n00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.460\nSo, in studio today, we have Dr.\n\n9\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.560\nTara Vansant Stern, thank you for\njoining us today, doctor.\n\n10\n00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.350\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Cherokee,\nthis is a very exciting program.\n\n11\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.990\n&gt;&gt; So where are we gonna begin?\n\n12\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Well I think what I\nwanna do is I want to go\n\n13\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.880\nover a little bit about the certification,\ncuz it's still so new.\n\n14\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n15\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.863\n&gt;&gt; So this certification,\nas I said, is a new exam.\n\n16\n00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:53.245\nAnd the idea is if you take\nall of the ITProTV courses and\n\n17\n00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:58.780\nwant to be certified, you can go to\nthe SSD Global website to do that.\n\n18\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.206\nRight now, we're the only ones that\nare offering that level one exam.\n\n19\n00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:07.702\nThat's gonna change over the next few\nmonths but right now it's still sort of a,\n\n20\n00:01:07.702 --> 00:01:08.552\n&gt;&gt; Brand new yeah.\n\n21\n00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:10.250\n&gt;&gt; It's like brand new.\n\n22\n00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.340\nBut I also wanna stress that if you're\njust going to attend these sessions and\n\n23\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360\nyou're already a project manager or\nyou' re already familiar with Lean or\n\n24\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.080\nwith Agile, this is just a good primer\nto teach you how to apply Lean and\n\n25\n00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.340\nAgile to project management.\n\n26\n00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.100\nIn the environments now, and I think we\neven mentioned this in the introduction,\n\n27\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.320\nthere's so many mergers and acquisitions\ngoing on that you as an IT person\n\n28\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.728\nmight find yourself in an environment\nwhere there are several different\n\n29\n00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:41.200\nmethodologies going on, and even\ndifferent forms of project management.\n\n30\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.210\nThe goal of this program, I mean that's\nthe book that we just we just published.\n\n31\n00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.514\nThe goal of this program is to\nmake projects better, faster and\n\n32\n00:01:51.514 --> 00:01:53.003\nmore cost effective.\n\n33\n00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.934\nMany of the tools and\nthings that we do that we\n\n34\n00:01:55.934 --> 00:02:00.387\nuse in process improvement can be\napplied to project management.\n\n35\n00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:06.520\nSo I just wanna quickly explain a project\nversus a process improvement project.\n\n36\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So a project has a beginning and\n\n37\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.870\nan end, and there's usually not\na continuous improvement piece.\n\n38\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.520\nA process improvement project,\na house that continuous improvement peace.\n\n39\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.770\nThe other thing that makes it\ndifference is that in a project,\n\n40\n00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.580\nyou generally have a high level idea\nof what it is you wanna do, and\n\n41\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.120\nhow you're gonna accomplish those goals.\n\n42\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.035\nSo you have a problem and\nyou have a solution.\n\n43\n00:02:30.035 --> 00:02:35.150\nIn a process improvement project,\nyou have the problem but not the solution.\n\n44\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.640\nSo what happens is in\nprocess improvement and\n\n45\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.770\nnot just Lean Six Sigma or\nsome of the other programs out there.\n\n46\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.130\nThere's a lot of critical\nthinking tools that go along\n\n47\n00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.000\nwith that particular kind of program.\n\n48\n00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.220\nLots of ways to kind of reason\nout what it is you wanna do.\n\n49\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.570\nSo we've taken many of those tools and\n\n50\n00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.980\napplied them to just\nstraight project management.\n\n51\n00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.820\nThere are a lot of theories of thought\nout there just Lean project management,\n\n52\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.090\njust Agile project management.\n\n53\n00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.820\nLean and Agile project management\nblends the concepts of Lean Six Sigma,\n\n54\n00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.160\neven though it just says Lean and\nAgile to make projects better, faster,\n\n55\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.440\nmore cost effective.\n\n56\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.650\n&gt;&gt; So it sounds to me like\nyou're just taking the best of\n\n57\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.280\nall the different certification\nthat are currently out there and\n\n58\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.990\ncompiling them to make you\na more efficient individual.\n\n59\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\n\n60\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.370\nwhat I think that buys you as an employee\nis that you're knowledgeable of all these\n\n61\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.140\ndifferent areas like maybe the employers\nwanting to take a chance on you but\n\n62\n00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.190\nthey say, you know, you've only worked in\nan agile environment and I'm just not sure\n\n63\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.130\nhow you would do in our traditional\nproject management environment.\n\n64\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.540\nSo, I see being at least aware\nof different methodologies and\n\n65\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.360\ndifferent ways that we can handle\nthings as being a real plus.\n\n66\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n67\n00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.600\n&gt;&gt; So the first place we're gonna\nstart is project management theory.\n\n68\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.375\nAnd it used to be that the PM-BOK\nwas pretty much the king.\n\n69\n00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:01.329\nPM-BOK stands for\nProject Management Body of Knowledge.\n\n70\n00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.740\nAnd that's what we use\nmostly here in the US.\n\n71\n00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.289\nIn Canada and the UK and\nSouth Africa and Australia,\n\n72\n00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:14.292\nthey also use the PM-BOK, but those\ncountries have a tendency to also use\n\n73\n00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:19.554\na different project management body of\nknowledge which is called Prince 2.\n\n74\n00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:23.268\nPrince 2 is owned by the UK Government and\n\n75\n00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:27.519\nthen the new kid on\nthe block is ISO 21500.\n\n76\n00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.486\nAnd the first thing that I wanna say\nabout ISO is the numbering system\n\n77\n00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:34.420\ndoesn't make any sense.\n\n78\n00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.786\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here in the States,\n\n79\n00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:40.257\nwe work with ISO 9,000 and 14,000, and\n\n80\n00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:45.310\nthose are sort of a global\nenterprise-wide ISO certification.\n\n81\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.130\nISO, however, has over 360 things\nthat you can be certified in.\n\n82\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.900\nSome of you may be familiar with\nthe ISO standard for like say,\n\n83\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.210\nmedical device or ISO standard for labs.\n\n84\n00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.000\nThe 9000 series and\n\n85\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000\nthe 14000 series are kind of\numbrella terms and your company is\n\n86\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.830\nrequired to do a lot of different\nstandards in order to be certified.\n\n87\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.550\nBut the trend over the last few\nyears is that ISO has developed some\n\n88\n00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.980\nkind of targeted standards, right?\n\n89\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.548\nOne of the targeted standards that's\nconsidered the new kid on the block, cuz\n\n90\n00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:24.405\nit's only been out for a couple of years,\nis their standard on project management.\n\n91\n00:05:24.405 --> 00:05:27.704\nRight now, they're calling it\na guide to project management.\n\n92\n00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:30.637\nBut with the entry of ISO 21500,\n\n93\n00:05:30.637 --> 00:05:36.260\nit's also coming a lot of chatter and\ntalk about certification.\n\n94\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.520\nNow, in most ISO products,\nit's the company that gets certified.\n\n95\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.430\nHowever, there's a lot of discussion\nright now among the ISO community that\n\n96\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.780\npeople could be certified as project\nmanagers through this ISO standard\n\n97\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.320\nas a standard becomes more developed.\n\n98\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.530\nSo, it adds an international appeal and\n\n99\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.265\nsuddenly, even though PM-BOK and being\ncertified through the project management\n\n100\n00:06:01.265 --> 00:06:06.010\ninstitute,still seems to be the most\npopular way to be certified.\n\n101\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.990\nI wouldn't say it's losing ground,\nthere's just suddenly some competitors.\n\n102\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.820\nNow, one of the things that I really love\nabout Prince 2 and keep in mind that's\n\n103\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.330\nthe one that's owned by the UK government,\nespecially for IT people is that Prince 2\n\n104\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.090\nhas a tendency to focus on project\nmanagement in the IT world.\n\n105\n00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.070\nNow they're not putting it out there\nas an IT product, but I've noticed when\n\n106\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.610\nyou go through their curriculum,\nthere's a lot of IT specific things.\n\n107\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.141\nThe thing I think is absolutely\nbrilliant is that Prince 2\n\n108\n00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.129\noffers a lot of public domain forms and\ntemplates.\n\n109\n00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.657\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've seen those out.\n\n110\n00:06:43.657 --> 00:06:44.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:46.026\n&gt;&gt; When I was just studying online.\n\n112\n00:06:46.026 --> 00:06:48.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's so cool.\n\n113\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.740\nNow, when you take those forms and\ntemplates which they're given to us,\n\n114\n00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.810\nyou have to change it from the,\nif you're in the States,\n\n115\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.980\nyou would changed it from\nthe UK English to the American English.\n\n116\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.600\nOf course if you're in the UK or\nSouth Africa or Australia or Canada,\n\n117\n00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.520\nyou can just leave it as is.\n\n118\n00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.990\nBut these forms are so brilliant that\nyou can almost teach yourself project\n\n119\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.580\nmanagement just by looking at their forms,\nand they just gave them to us.\n\n120\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.250\nSo I loved that.\n\n121\n00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.372\nPrince 2 has a level one and\nlevel two exam.\n\n122\n00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:22.250\nAnd so\nin level one you're learning the theory.\n\n123\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.290\nAnd then in level two,\nyou're learning the tools.\n\n124\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.380\nSo there are Prince 2 people that\ntake one or the other or both.\n\n125\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.214\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then I've already explained that\n\n126\n00:07:32.214 --> 00:07:37.122\nISO is in the process of trying to\ncome up with a certification process.\n\n127\n00:07:37.122 --> 00:07:39.947\nThey're a little far away from that,\nbut it's in the work.\n\n128\n00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:43.877\n&gt;&gt; I could only imagine that they\nwould be really structured and\n\n129\n00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:48.658\nfocused on teaching or explaining in\nthat certification process related\n\n130\n00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:53.051\ndirectly to those particular industries,\nfor the ISO standards so\n\n131\n00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:57.466\nthat it just kind of naturally goes\ninto place within that company.\n\n132\n00:07:57.466 --> 00:08:00.145\nSo you'd have your individual\nemployees working for\n\n133\n00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:02.179\nthat company who is also ISO certified.\n\n134\n00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:02.974\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n135\n00:08:02.974 --> 00:08:06.824\nthe other thing that I think that\nyou wanna kinda consider about ISO.\n\n136\n00:08:06.824 --> 00:08:11.398\nIs it really is the first international\nstandard for project management.\n\n137\n00:08:11.398 --> 00:08:16.020\nProject management is handled\ndifferently in other countries.\n\n138\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.619\nSo they're trying to establish\nkind of a mainstream baseline.\n\n139\n00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.490\nAll of us should be doing this.\n\n140\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.970\nNow the PMBOK, which is supported by\nthe Project Management Institute.\n\n141\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.098\nAnd that's also\nthe certification that I have.\n\n142\n00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:34.569\nThe PMP, they've done such a great\njob of laying out the information.\n\n143\n00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:39.533\nAnd over the years the PMBOK has been\nrevised to a point where it's a very\n\n144\n00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:40.480\neasy read.\n\n145\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.100\nIt's over 300 pages, but\nit's not difficult to understand.\n\n146\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.522\nThe point is is that the first thing you\nhave to decide when you're applying lean\n\n147\n00:08:49.522 --> 00:08:51.306\nand agile project management.\n\n148\n00:08:51.306 --> 00:08:56.691\nIs if the company has just developed\ntheir own project management process or\n\n149\n00:08:56.691 --> 00:09:00.070\nif they're subscribing\nto one of these three.\n\n150\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.330\nBecause the way you do your\nprojects is gonna have a lot\n\n151\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.060\nto do with the body of knowledge, right?\n\n152\n00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.016\nSo what we did in Lean and Agile,\none of the things that we thought kinda\n\n153\n00:09:11.016 --> 00:09:15.724\nmade it leaner, is that we took\neverything that people agreed on.\n\n154\n00:09:15.724 --> 00:09:21.126\nAnd we're teaching that because there\nare some differences between the PMBOK,\n\n155\n00:09:21.126 --> 00:09:25.150\nthe ISO standard and PRINCE2,\nsome small differences.\n\n156\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.590\nI mean they're saying a lot\nof the same things, but\n\n157\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.670\nthey're saying a lot of\ndifferent things too.\n\n158\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.480\nSo we took all of that together and\nwe made a compilation right and for\n\n159\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.380\nexample, the thing that we're gonna\nbe basing most of this course on is\n\n160\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.040\nthe SSD Global's version\nof the project life cycle.\n\n161\n00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.241\nSo if you're studying for the PMBOK or\nyou're studying to be certified for\n\n162\n00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:49.375\nPrince 2 or\nyou're just reading the ISO literature for\n\n163\n00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.523\nthe project management guidelines.\n\n164\n00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:55.361\nKeep in mind their project life\ncycle is going to look similar, but\n\n165\n00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.380\nit could have more or less phases.\n\n166\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.080\nSo we tried to simplify\nit to make it leaner.\n\n167\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.560\nAnd these are the phases that\nthe project goes through.\n\n168\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.640\nSo you'll be seeing\nthis slide periodically\n\n169\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.710\nas we tackle each one of these\nareas throughout this program.\n\n170\n00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.826\nSo one way to lean things out,\n\n171\n00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:16.545\nright off the bat, is we're gonna\nlearn what everyone agrees on.\n\n172\n00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:17.504\nWhich is what I just said.\n\n173\n00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:18.860\n&gt;&gt; That was good, all right.\n\n174\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.940\n&gt;&gt; So there's extras stuff, and certainly\nyou can go study kind of on your own.\n\n175\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.170\nBut we thought the best way is to focus\non, if you're a project manager, it\n\n176\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.130\ndoesn't really matter which one of those\nthree environments that you subscribe to.\n\n177\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.718\nOr, keep in mind, that you have your\nown project management program.\n\n178\n00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:40.528\nThere's a lot of defense firms that have\ndeveloped their own method of project\n\n179\n00:10:40.528 --> 00:10:41.230\nmanagement.\n\n180\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.897\nSo, it really doesn't matter.\n\n181\n00:10:42.897 --> 00:10:44.800\nEveryone says this is important.\n\n182\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.666\nSo the first one, the first series\nof things I'd like to tell you,\n\n183\n00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:53.949\nis that all PM BOKs, and it's okay if\nyou're not familiar with these things yet,\n\n184\n00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:55.772\nbecause we will be covering them.\n\n185\n00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:56.402\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But for\n\n186\n00:10:56.402 --> 00:10:58.572\nthose of you who are already\nproject managers, or\n\n187\n00:10:58.572 --> 00:11:01.290\nhave been in project\nmanagement environments.\n\n188\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.300\nEveryone says, we should be using\na work breakdown structure.\n\n189\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.130\nAnd that's just the specialized outline\nthat says, step one, step two, step three.\n\n190\n00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:15.961\nAnd then we go back and we say,\nstep one might have a 1.1, a 1.2, a 1.3.\n\n191\n00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:20.990\nEveryone agrees that project\nreports need to have a baseline.\n\n192\n00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.180\nNow, baseline can be a very confusing\nword because in some environments\n\n193\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.830\nwe use the term baseline\nto be like a benchmark.\n\n194\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.890\nIn project reports, we use the word\nbaseline to say, this is how long\n\n195\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:37.000\nthis project is going to take, and\nthis is how much it's gonna cost.\n\n196\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.169\nNow, if we do a completely developed WBS,\nthat's not as difficult.\n\n197\n00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.390\nAll project management agrees\nthat when we do a project,\n\n198\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.320\nthere's some assumptions and constraints.\n\n199\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.370\nAnd, an assumption is that\nI'm gonna do this project,\n\n200\n00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.590\nI'm gonna write up my plan, but I assume\nthat you're gonna do some things for me.\n\n201\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.820\nSo, maybe a small\nassumption might be that,\n\n202\n00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.880\nI get to work inside instead\nof outside the office.\n\n203\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.480\nAnd it sounds kinda funny but if I'm doing\nsome construction project management,\n\n204\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.480\nmaybe I assume that you're gonna provide\nan office when I'm not outside doing my\n\n205\n00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.020\nconstruction thing so\nI can look at my plans.\n\n206\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.381\nIf I haven't made that\nclear in my project report,\n\n207\n00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:23.202\neveryone could be a little disappointed.\n\n208\n00:12:23.202 --> 00:12:24.825\n&gt;&gt; And as far as those restraints,\n\n209\n00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:28.870\nare those going to be typical to what we\nmay have seen in other trainings before?\n\n210\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:34.378\nLike we saw our scope, quality,\ntime, budget, risk, am I missing one?\n\n211\n00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:35.882\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely,\n\n212\n00:12:35.882 --> 00:12:39.740\nbecause the core part of project\nmanagement doesn't change.\n\n213\n00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.470\nAnd what we wanna do is we just wanna\nmake project management not as difficult,\n\n214\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.230\nnot as wordy, not as hard to do.\n\n215\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.920\nAnd maybe lighten it up a bit.\n\n216\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.529\nNow there's some projects\nthat are very complicated and\n\n217\n00:12:51.529 --> 00:12:54.747\nyou're going want to stick to more\ntraditional project management.\n\n218\n00:12:54.747 --> 00:12:58.861\nBut in many cases if you're working on a\nsmaller project or a project that's pretty\n\n219\n00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:03.034\neasy to understand, then you might want to\njust apply some Lean and Agile techniques\n\n220\n00:13:03.034 --> 00:13:07.120\nto that project to make it better,\nfaster, and more cost effective.\n\n221\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.910\nSo another thing that everyone\nagrees on is the definition.\n\n222\n00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.280\nWe said the definition of assumptions,\nand that one's easy.\n\n223\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.470\nI assume you're going to do\nthese particular things for me.\n\n224\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.140\nThe only thing is that we wanna make\nsure that we put those assumptions\n\n225\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.300\nin our project charter or project plan.\n\n226\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.690\nWhen we first start talking about\nthe project that we wanna do,\n\n227\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.770\nwe wanna make sure that everyone's\naware of our assumptions, right?\n\n228\n00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.760\nSo and constraints are sorta\nthe flip side of that.\n\n229\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.898\nConstraints are things that just get\nin the way for things that we wanna do.\n\n230\n00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:41.212\nAnd that's another place where lean and\nagile can kinda jump in and\n\n231\n00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:42.540\nreally help us.\n\n232\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.650\nSo kinda keep in mind all\nthree bodies of knowledge.\n\n233\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:50.390\nAnd if you've got a specialized body,\na proprietary body of knowledge at your\n\n234\n00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.210\ncompany, everyone agrees on the terms\nassumptions and constraints.\n\n235\n00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.910\nConstraints being anything that gets in\nyour way from getting your project done.\n\n236\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:05.139\nAnd then everyone, again, agrees on the\ndefinition of milestones and deliverables.\n\n237\n00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:09.396\nNow this I think is kind of interesting\nCherokee because even project managers\n\n238\n00:14:09.396 --> 00:14:13.201\nthat have been project managers for\na really long time, sometimes get\n\n239\n00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:17.412\ninto discussions about what is\na milestone, what is a deliverable, right?\n\n240\n00:14:17.412 --> 00:14:19.532\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe fact that everyone could come to for\n\n241\n00:14:19.532 --> 00:14:21.760\nthese particular topics is\njust a little different.\n\n242\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.671\n&gt;&gt; I know, the fact that these\nbodies of knowledge say, okay,\n\n243\n00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:29.270\nthis is a milestone [LAUGH],\nand this is a deliverable.\n\n244\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:30.454\nI think that's huge,\n\n245\n00:14:30.454 --> 00:14:34.143\nbecause in the project management\ncommunity you can give a scenario.\n\n246\n00:14:34.143 --> 00:14:37.500\nAnd you can ask a group of\nseasoned project managers, okay.\n\n247\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.740\nHere's this scenario, what are the\nmilestones, what are the deliverables?\n\n248\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.070\nAnd they'll have some discussion there.\n\n249\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.240\nSo, what the three bodies\nof knowledge agree on,\n\n250\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.050\nis that a milestone is something\nthat you pass through.\n\n251\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.710\nIt's a marker.\n\n252\n00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.410\nNow if you were working with a particular\nmodel such as the dmaic model in\n\n253\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.780\nthe Lean Six Sigma environment,\n\n254\n00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.330\nthat model has defined measure,\nanalyze, improve and control.\n\n255\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:07.740\nAnd so the milestone might be I'm leaving\ndefine and I'm moving into measure.\n\n256\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.030\nThat might be a milestone.\n\n257\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.450\nYour child's birthday\ncould be a milestone.\n\n258\n00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.490\nThe fact that sometimes it could be\na completed task is a milestone.\n\n259\n00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.020\nOr part of something is done, right?\n\n260\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.220\nA deliverable, on the other hand,\nis anything I promise the client.\n\n261\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.950\nSo I might have promised\nthem a status report.\n\n262\n00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:31.125\nI might have promised them a what\nelse could I have promised my client?\n\n263\n00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.792\nA status report.\n\n264\n00:15:32.792 --> 00:15:33.502\n&gt;&gt; A meeting?\n\n265\n00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:34.425\n&gt;&gt; A meeting.\n\n266\n00:15:34.425 --> 00:15:37.505\nSo any of those types of\nthings are deliverables right?\n\n267\n00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:42.105\nSo anything I give, anything told you\nthat I'm going to give is a deliverable.\n\n268\n00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:44.085\nAnd then another interesting thing, and\n\n269\n00:15:44.085 --> 00:15:47.905\nwe'll be looking at this,\nis that all the bodies of knowledge\n\n270\n00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:51.680\nagree that they're are seven important\ntools that we should be using.\n\n271\n00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.100\nAnd so we'll be looking,\nwe'll be taking a quick look at that.\n\n272\n00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.410\nSo those are some of the synergies,\nnow there's a few more synergies and\n\n273\n00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.088\nwe'll be trying to address those as we\ngo through these particular sessions.\n\n274\n00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.667\nDo we have time, Cherokee,\nto talk about the WBS, the [CROSSTALK]?\n\n275\n00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:09.453\n&gt;&gt; I think we do, it is pretty\nimportant but we'll go ahead and\n\n276\n00:16:09.453 --> 00:16:10.751\ncover that in this series.\n\n277\n00:16:10.751 --> 00:16:12.481\nOr in this episode [LAUGH].\n\n278\n00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:13.236\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n279\n00:16:13.236 --> 00:16:15.820\nI just wanted to make sure,\nI wanted to do a time check.\n\n280\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.430\nWe don't wanna overwhelm anyone out there.\n\n281\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:22.450\nOkay so work breakdown structure, and\nif you've seen some of my other videos,\n\n282\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.330\nI do a Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt,\nand a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n283\n00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.600\nYou may be familiar with the concept\nof work breakdown structure.\n\n284\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.680\nYou might just be familiar with it\nbecause you knew it to begin with.\n\n285\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.280\nBut I think it's huge and like I said,\n\n286\n00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.310\nall three bodies of knowledge say\nthis is something that's important.\n\n287\n00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.520\nSo you're used to seeing WBSs.\n\n288\n00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.920\nIf you do any work on Wikipedia,\nfor example, and in this case,\n\n289\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:55.240\nthis work breakdown structure is used to\ntell you what material is on that site.\n\n290\n00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.300\nSo you see that kind of all the time and\n\n291\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.020\nthe one that we're looking at right now\nis the one on project management right?\n\n292\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.990\nSo I'm gonna give you\na second to look at that.\n\n293\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.179\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and what we're looking is that\ntypical linear fashion with the text but\n\n294\n00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:13.190\nyou can have this in different\nstyles as well, right,\n\n295\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.227\nfor your work breakdown structure.\n\n296\n00:17:15.227 --> 00:17:20.137\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly,\nnow we're gonna do a quick WBS for\n\n297\n00:17:20.137 --> 00:17:23.020\nan office party, okay\n&gt;&gt; I love parties.\n\n298\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, office party,\n\n300\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.910\nwell now you'll see that\non our first example,\n\n301\n00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.780\nour number one task is\nto send out invitations.\n\n302\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.980\nAnd our number two task\nis to find a location.\n\n303\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.620\nAnd then our number three task\nis to find entertainment.\n\n304\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.496\nAll right?\n\n305\n00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:40.445\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Now, we're already have a couple of\n\n306\n00:17:40.445 --> 00:17:41.430\nthings under one.\n\n307\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.640\nWe have a 1.1.\nWho the heck are we gonna invite?\n\n308\n00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.020\nAnd a 1.3, print the invitations.\n\n309\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.820\nAnd a 1.4.\n\n310\n00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:54.330\nNow you'll notice in this work breakdown\nstructure that the other column say cost,\n\n311\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.140\ntime and resource.\n\n312\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.040\nSo which shall we knew this and\na little bit leaner fashion so\n\n313\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.460\nthat you can make your projects better,\nfaster and more cost-effective.\n\n314\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.898\nIf you are looking at this and any one\nof the project bodies of knowledge,\n\n315\n00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:18.190\na PMBOK PRINCE2 or the ISO standard,\na WBS is just those first two columns.\n\n316\n00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.140\nTo kind of lean it out,\n\n317\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.440\nwe're going to show you other\nthings that you can do with a WBS.\n\n318\n00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.260\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure.\n\n319\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.660\nHere, you could just add a quick glance\nlook and see if any of those resources\n\n320\n00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.540\nwould be conflicting, and it's all\nin the same page, pretty convenient.\n\n321\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n322\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.520\nIt makes it just a lot easier.\n\n323\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.170\nA lot of software,\n\n324\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.230\na lot of project management software\nwill automatically add that in.\n\n325\n00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.140\nBut before we go there I want to explain\nthe concept of baseline because, again,\n\n326\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.150\nthis is something all three\nbodies of knowledge agree on and\n\n327\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.060\nit's important to know that because\nI would focus in on, if you're not\n\n328\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.420\na project manager I would focus in on\nanything that they all three agree on.\n\n329\n00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.010\nThat just makes sense, right?\n\n330\n00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:01.030\nSo if I were looking at my WBS, what I\nwould wanna do to create my baseline\n\n331\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.480\nis that each one of those categories,\nand I'll move back up here quickly,\n\n332\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.580\neach one of those categories,\neven the 1.1, the 1.2, 1.3,\n\n333\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.950\nwhat I'm gonna do is, I'm going to\nassign a time and a cost to those.\n\n334\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.900\nNow, when I'm completely done creating my\nproject using work breakdown structure,\n\n335\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.420\nI can add up all my costs, and I will have\nsomething called a cost estimate, right?\n\n336\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.740\nSo I can go to you, and I can say,\n\n337\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.240\nthis is how much that office\nparty's gonna cost, right?\n\n338\n00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.480\nI can also have a time estimate,\nbut time gets a little trickier.\n\n339\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.750\nAnd the reason it gets trickier is that\nthere's some things that are gonna\n\n340\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.230\nhappen in tandem.\n\n341\n00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.730\nSo for example,\nif I'm waiting on a signature for\n\n342\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.070\ntwo days, I'm still probably\ngonna be doing some work.\n\n343\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.980\nWould that make sense?\n\n344\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n345\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.050\n&gt;&gt; You just don't wanna halt\n\n346\n00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.740\nthe entire project for\nsomething like that.\n\n347\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.160\nAny kind of delay there.\n\n348\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nif I did time in a linear fashion,\n\n349\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:59.020\nmy office party might take\nme two years just to do.\n\n350\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.920\nSo, it get's a little tricky.\n\n351\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.560\nSo, cost I could just add up.\n\n352\n00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.960\nAnd, time, I just want to see what\nkind of things can happen in tandem.\n\n353\n00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.850\nI also might want to consider what needs\nto happen before something else happens.\n\n354\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.120\nI might want to look at my dependencies,\nright.\n\n355\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.380\n&gt;&gt; So\nnow let's go back to our office party,\n\n356\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.990\nand you'll see we've kind\nof filled these things in.\n\n357\n00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.020\n&gt;&gt; Assigned roles.\n\n358\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.480\n&gt;&gt; And we've assigned roles.\n\n359\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.290\nAnd we have Don, and Dr. Stern, and\nthe front receptionist right now.\n\n360\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.350\nAnd we've also assigned cost and time.\n\n361\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:36.360\nSo, once again, leaner project management,\nwhere project management and all\n\n362\n00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.790\nthree of those bodies of knowledge talk\nabout work breakdown structure, right?\n\n363\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.887\nThey're talking about\nthose first two columns.\n\n364\n00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:48.739\nWhen you're taking lean and agile\nproject management, we say you know as\n\n365\n00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:54.280\nlong as you have to learn this stuff,\nwhy not add those other components in?\n\n366\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.124\nThose other three columns technically\naren't part of the work breakdown\n\n367\n00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:02.095\nstructure but that's what we use to\ndetermine our cost and our timeline so,\n\n368\n00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:11.830\nNow when we're talking about baseline,\nit becomes very, very tricky.\n\n369\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.940\nBecause once I've established my cost and\n\n370\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.900\nmy timeline,\nthat's what I'm judged on forever, okay?\n\n371\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.930\nAnd, the sad thing is that sometimes, even\nif the project should of been scrapped,\n\n372\n00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.770\nwe shouldn't even be doing that project,\nsometimes we get into situations where\n\n373\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.310\nwe're still just graded on\ndid I get it in on time.\n\n374\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.410\nDid it cost what I say it was gonna cost,\nright?\n\n375\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:41.390\nSo the objective, obviously,\nis to hit that baseline.\n\n376\n00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.470\nIf I go a little over the baseline,\nwhat do you think happens Cherokee?\n\n377\n00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:49.005\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You might get in a little\nbit of trouble depending how far you\n\n378\n00:21:49.005 --> 00:21:52.055\nwere from your budget there,\nand the timeline also.\n\n379\n00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:54.645\n&gt;&gt; And what if I go way over my baseline?\n\n380\n00:21:54.645 --> 00:21:58.875\n&gt;&gt; Well, you might be overlapping another\nproject to getting the company behind you,\n\n381\n00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:00.770\nmay even be terminated.\n\n382\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.105\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so,\n\n383\n00:22:02.105 --> 00:22:05.970\nif I come a little below baseline,\nusually they're happy.\n\n384\n00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.270\nSo if I'm on baseline or a little below\npeople are like rah, rah, sis, boom,\n\n385\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.760\nba you did a great job.\n\n386\n00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.310\nIf I go way below baseline\nthat could be a problem too.\n\n387\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.920\nCan you think of some problems that there\nmight be with going way below my baseline?\n\n388\n00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.510\n&gt;&gt; It might raise a red flag\nas if you weren't experienced,\n\n389\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.120\nyou weren't able to\nefficiently estimate or\n\n390\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.950\nperhaps you decreased quality in an area\nthat they really didn't want to,\n\n391\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.360\nif you were creating some kind of product,\nor service, or something like that?\n\n392\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Right, and sometimes if I get things,\nme personally,\n\n393\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.400\nif I get things too quickly I'm thinking,\nwhat did they not give me?\n\n394\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.685\n&gt;&gt; Or what did I miss.\n\n395\n00:22:41.685 --> 00:22:44.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or what did I forget, right exactly.\n\n396\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:49.040\nSo this thing about, and it's a really\nbig deal when you're studying traditional\n\n397\n00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.120\nproject management, no matter which\nof those three bodies of knowledge.\n\n398\n00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:59.100\nA lot of training, a lot of work on how\nto estimate your time and your cost line.\n\n399\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.790\nBut if you do it using the work\nbreakdown structure, it's leaner and\n\n400\n00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.430\nfaster and easier.\n\n401\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:09.119\nNow another way that you can use the work\nbreakdown structure to help you is when\n\n402\n00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:11.409\nyour boss gives you the project to do.\n\n403\n00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:15.597\nThey just coming and they say this is how\nlong is gonna take, I'm gonna have you\n\n404\n00:23:15.597 --> 00:23:19.276\ndo this project and this is how much\nmoney I'm gonna budget for you and\n\n405\n00:23:19.276 --> 00:23:24.460\nthis is how long, I need it in two weeks I\nam gonna give you $10,000 to do it, right?\n\n406\n00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.270\nThey're gonna give you\nsome sort of parameters.\n\n407\n00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:31.850\nIf you immediately go back to your desk\nand just first list, like your one, two,\n\n408\n00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.150\nthree, four, five list.\n\n409\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.240\nYou say these are all the things\nthat need to happen right.\n\n410\n00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.770\nAnd then maybe you're gonna order them,\n\n411\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.720\nlike at first you might not\nthink of sequential order.\n\n412\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.080\nSo I'm just gonna write down everything\nthat has to happen in this project.\n\n413\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.850\nAnd then probably step two what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna go back and\n\n414\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.890\nI'm gonna try to put them\nin some sort of order.\n\n415\n00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.630\nLike this should happen\nbefore that happens, right?\n\n416\n00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.370\nThen I'll go and break them down.\n\n417\n00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.520\nLike okay on number one task\nthere's a 1.1, there's a 1.2, 1.3.\n\n418\n00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.262\nThen I'll take those extra steps\nthat we saw in our diagram here,\n\n419\n00:24:03.262 --> 00:24:06.900\nand I'll say cost and\ntime and resource, right.\n\n420\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.671\nAnd then I'll just kind of step back and\nsay, what did I come up with?\n\n421\n00:24:11.671 --> 00:24:16.231\nSo let's say my boss said,\nwe're gonna budget $10,000 for\n\n422\n00:24:16.231 --> 00:24:19.355\nthis project and I came up with 10,500.\n\n423\n00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:22.633\nI'm probably gonna go back through\nmy work breakdown structure and\n\n424\n00:24:22.633 --> 00:24:24.240\nsee what can I tweak up.\n\n425\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.050\nBecause it's just a little over what\nthey're telling me I can spend, right?\n\n426\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.402\nHowever, if I go through\nthat entire project and\n\n427\n00:24:31.402 --> 00:24:34.526\nI come up with twice that, $20,000.\n\n428\n00:24:34.526 --> 00:24:37.800\nNow what I can do is,\nI am not saying no to my boss.\n\n429\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.930\nI'm going back in with my work\nbreakdown structure and I'm saying,\n\n430\n00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:45.360\nwhen I did my estimate,\nthis is everything I came up with.\n\n431\n00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.372\nHere, what I'd like you to do is tell\nme what you want me to take out.\n\n432\n00:24:49.372 --> 00:24:54.662\nSo, and there is that small percentage\nof bosses who are unreasonable and\n\n433\n00:24:54.662 --> 00:24:55.779\nkind of crazy.\n\n434\n00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:59.703\nBut for the most part, if you take this\ndocument to your boss and you show them,\n\n435\n00:24:59.703 --> 00:25:03.038\nthese are the things, because they\nmight not have thought it out.\n\n436\n00:25:03.038 --> 00:25:05.890\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Sure, it's something\ntangible and they're able to look at it\n\n437\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.069\nand say, you know what, maybe I wasn't\nbeing realistic with this expectation.\n\n438\n00:25:09.069 --> 00:25:11.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and the same thing with time.\n\n439\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.020\nSo your boss says, this thing\nhas to be done on Monday, right?\n\n440\n00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.990\nSo in this case I'm looking\nat the time column and\n\n441\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:23.750\nI'm looking at each one of those things\nand I'm saying, how long is it gonna take,\n\n442\n00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.680\nand I'm looking, if I don't know,\nlike history, remember, trumps anything.\n\n443\n00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.560\nSo if I know the cost of something,\nthat's what I'm gonna put down.\n\n444\n00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.010\nBut what I'm gonna tell you with\ntime will also work with cost.\n\n445\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.170\nSo if I've done this task before and\nI know how long it's gonna take,\n\n446\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.600\nI can just put that down.\n\n447\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.720\nBut if I don't know,\nwhat I could do is I could say, well,\n\n448\n00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.420\nwhat was the longest time\nit ever took me to do it?\n\n449\n00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.090\nWhat was the shortest time?\n\n450\n00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.050\nAnd I'm gonna use my hands here.\n\n451\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.980\nSome of you may have seen this in our Lean\nSix Sigma program, that I use my hands.\n\n452\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.500\nOkay, so\nwhat was the longest time it took me?\n\n453\n00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.630\nWhat was the shortest time it took me?\n\n454\n00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.890\nAnd what does it normally take me?\n\n455\n00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.980\nAnd I'm gonna give that four counts.\n\n456\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.980\nSo I have six.\n\n457\n00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:11.160\nI have longest time, shortest time and\nfour times most likely, right?\n\n458\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.200\nSo I'm going to add that all together.\n\n459\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.840\nI'm gonna add the lowest and highest time.\n\n460\n00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.740\nAnd then I'm going to go four\ntimes the most likely time and\n\n461\n00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.700\ndivide that by six, right?\n\n462\n00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.190\nAnd so now I have a time estimate.\n\n463\n00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.424\nRemember, history trumps everything.\n\n464\n00:26:25.424 --> 00:26:27.510\nYou can do that with cost as well.\n\n465\n00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.900\nSo let's say I'm going through,\n\n466\n00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.830\nmy boss says, I have to have this\nproject on my desk by Monday.\n\n467\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.585\nIt's still, even though I'm in a panic\nnow cuz I've gotta work as fast as I can.\n\n468\n00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:41.260\nIf I sit down and\nI work on my timeline and I come up with\n\n469\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.160\ntwice the amount of time, I'm probably\ngonna do the same thing I did with cost.\n\n470\n00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.000\nI'm gonna go in and\nI'm gonna say here's all the things,\n\n471\n00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.740\nI did this work breakdown structure,\nit's simple to understand, simple outline.\n\n472\n00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.800\nHere's all the things that need to\nhappen to facilitate this request,\n\n473\n00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.530\nwhich one would you take out?\n\n474\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.970\nAnd consequently,\njust like we said with cost,\n\n475\n00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:05.860\nif they say it has to be done by Monday,\nand let's say I have 40 work\n\n476\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.250\nhours left to do that, and it turns out\nit's gonna take 43 work hours, well yeah.\n\n477\n00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.440\nI'm gonna stay a little late.\n\n478\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.460\nI'm gonna find someone that can help me.\n\n479\n00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.690\nI'm gonna tweak it up.\n\n480\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:20.290\nBut a lot of times,\npeople ask us to do unrealistic things and\n\n481\n00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.450\nthat's not lean or agile.\n\n482\n00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.116\nIf we've been given a task, and\n\n483\n00:27:24.116 --> 00:27:28.377\nthat's an unfair cost or timeline, one of\nthe beautiful things is that we can fall\n\n484\n00:27:28.377 --> 00:27:31.053\nback on this beautiful\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n485\n00:27:33.693 --> 00:27:36.270\n&gt;&gt; So looks like we're\ngetting close on time here.\n\n486\n00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.986\nIf you don't have any\nother final thoughts,\n\n487\n00:27:37.986 --> 00:27:39.985\nis this a good place where\nwe can go ahead and wrap up?\n\n488\n00:27:39.985 --> 00:27:41.310\n&gt;&gt; I think so, Cherokee.\n\n489\n00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.830\nI think work breakdown structure\nis probably the most magical tool\n\n490\n00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.840\nin the traditional project management\ntoolbox that's out there, seriously.\n\n491\n00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.190\nSo getting used to doing that, and\n\n492\n00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.700\neven in your daily strategy,\nit's a good time management tool.\n\n493\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.259\nIf you wake up in the morning and you feel\nterribly overwhelmed, we have some other\n\n494\n00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:05.377\ntime management tools we'll introduce\nyou to but this is a good fast one.\n\n495\n00:28:05.377 --> 00:28:09.560\nJust write down everything you need\nto do and kind of segment it out.\n\n496\n00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.530\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, well, I think that does\nabout wrap it up for session one, but\n\n497\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.574\ndon't go anywhere,\nwe have some really great Lean and\n\n498\n00:28:16.574 --> 00:28:20.569\nAgile project management information\nheaded your way in session two.\n\n499\n00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:24.368\nFor this episode, we'll go ahead and\nsign out, and I'm your show host,\n\n500\n00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:25.303\nCherokee Boose.\n\n501\n00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:29.582\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:16.500\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.020\nWe're gonna go ahead and begin with\nsession number two, in session one we\n\n7\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.320\nended talking about WBS work breakdown\nstructure, and we're gonna go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.100\nI believe we'll pick up there but we have\nDoctor Terra Vanzant-Stern in studios\n\n9\n00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.660\ntoday to go ahead and\nhelp us with these topics.\n\n10\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.230\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n11\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.338\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:39.520\n&gt;&gt; So, is that a safe place\nto go ahead and pick up or?\n\n13\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n14\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and get started.\n\n15\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.630\nIf we can go to my slide deck,\nthe last thing that we were in session two\n\n16\n00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.630\nand this is just a reminder\nof the book and one of\n\n17\n00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.300\nthe things that we talked about in session\none that everyone agrees in all those\n\n18\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.760\ndifferent project management bodies of\nknowledge that we need a project plan.\n\n19\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.440\nSo another thing that everyone is\nconcerned about is something called\n\n20\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.360\nproject scope.\n\n21\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.260\nAnd we always kind of look at\nthis from the opposite direction.\n\n22\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.730\nWhy is scope creep such a big deal?\n\n23\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.130\nSo I'm gonna take us back to\nour office party example,\n\n24\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.380\nand we're gonna look at\nproject scope in this example.\n\n25\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.670\nSo the idea is if I were looking,\nand this is, I think,\n\n26\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.850\nwas the second page of our project plan,\n\n27\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.430\nlet's say someone came in and\nasked me to do something extra.\n\n28\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.490\nI've already done my time and baseline.\n\n29\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.780\nAnd if you'll remember from session\none that means I've already told you\n\n30\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.520\nhow long it's gonna take and how much it's\ngonna cost for me to do that project.\n\n31\n00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.757\nSo, if you come in and give me one\nmore task, what's gonna happen?\n\n32\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.070\n&gt;&gt; It'll probably add,\ndepending on what the task is,\n\n33\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.150\nif there's a monetary\nvalue attached to it.\n\n34\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.570\nLike if I asked you to have a photo booth\nso we could take photos at the party or\n\n35\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.190\nsomething like that,\nyou would need to pay that vendor and\n\n36\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.870\nyou would take extra time to schedule and\n\n37\n00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.940\nmaybe do a little bit of research to\nsee which vendor you wanted to choose.\n\n38\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.430\nSo time and money.\n\n39\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it could push that time and\nmoney line out.\n\n40\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.590\nAnd so that's why people are so concerned\nabout something called project scope.\n\n41\n00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.230\nProject scope is sometimes\nan overcomplicated idea\n\n42\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.340\nwhen all you're really saying\nis this is what I'm gonna do.\n\n43\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.610\nSo, I am planning the office party but\nI'm planning the office party for\n\n44\n00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.920\nthis month but I'm not planning\nthe office party fro the next few months.\n\n45\n00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.620\nI'm just sticking to this one thing.\n\n46\n00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.490\nSo, something to kind of keep in mind.\n\n47\n00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.850\nProject scope is a very important concept.\n\n48\n00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.070\nWhat is it that exactly I'm gonna do?\n\n49\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.570\nAnd you almost have to think\nof it from the opposite side\n\n50\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.200\nof what I'm not gonna do,\nto make it really make sense.\n\n51\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.230\n&gt;&gt; Define that, sure.\n\n52\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so another thing that all\nthe project bodies acknowledge, and\n\n53\n00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.090\nremember we said there's the PMBOK,\nthere's the PRINCE2.\n\n54\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.280\nThere's also a new ISO standard.\n\n55\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.300\nIt's been out for a few years, but\nit's much newer than the other two,\n\n56\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.775\nso it's still being referred\nto as the new ISO standard.\n\n57\n00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:17.360\nAll believe in the seven\nanalytical problem solving tools.\n\n58\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.110\nNow each body of knowledge does call\nthem something slightly different, but\n\n59\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.450\nwe're gonna quickly look at those tools.\n\n60\n00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.270\nIf you want a more in depth conversation\non these tools you can go back and\n\n61\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.190\nlook at the Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt\nclass and locate where we're\n\n62\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.430\ntalking about those tools because we go\nway into depth in that particular session.\n\n63\n00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I remember that.\n\n64\n00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so these are the seven quality\ntools that are sometimes called\n\n65\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.550\nthe critical thinking tools,\n\n66\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.890\nwhich are sometimes called\nthe seven tools of data analysis.\n\n67\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.710\nAnd we're just gonna briefly\nlook at each one of these.\n\n68\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.590\nSo the first one, this is the chocolate\nmaking process and this is a flow chart.\n\n69\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.000\nAnd you'll notice on this particular flow\nchart we don't have a lot of symbols.\n\n70\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.630\nThere are some standard flow charting\nsymbols but mostly in project\n\n71\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.149\nmanagement you're looking at the decision\nsymbols, and the start and stop symbols.\n\n72\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.560\nThese are the ones that are the most\ncommon symbols that are used.\n\n73\n00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.560\nAs a project manager, if you use these\nsymbols you're usually going to be okay.\n\n74\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.890\nThere are additional symbols when you're\nlooking internationally that mean\n\n75\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.550\nother things.\n\n76\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.410\nBut everyone pretty much\nagrees on these symbols.\n\n77\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.460\nAnd they're intuitive, I just want\nto quickly go over a couple of them.\n\n78\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.160\nTransportation and transmission,\n\n79\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.840\nthe difference between transportation\nis that it's any physical movement, and\n\n80\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.730\ntransition is any movement through\nthe computer, any electronic movement.\n\n81\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.408\nDo you see any others there,\nCherokee, that need some explanation?\n\n82\n00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:50.380\n&gt;&gt; Maybe that input/output.\n\n83\n00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.970\nWhat would be the difference there?\n\n84\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\neverything that goes into the system,\n\n85\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.910\neverything that goes out of the system.\n\n86\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.300\nAnd that's a really good question,\n\n87\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.820\nbecause inputs in different literature\nare referred to different things.\n\n88\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.620\nSo primarily in lean and even in agile\nenvironments, your inputs are your xs.\n\n89\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.070\nThose are the core things that\nare going into the process.\n\n90\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd your outputs are your ys.\n\n91\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.700\nSo a large Y would mean your major output.\n\n92\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.310\nA small y would be maybe\nsome smaller outputs.\n\n93\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.320\nAnd the same things with xs and ys.\n\n94\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.870\nSo anything that goes into the process,\nanything that goes out of the process.\n\n95\n00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.470\nWhen you're doing a typical flow chart for\nproject management,\n\n96\n00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.860\nyou're gonna have some major outputs.\n\n97\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, and the only other\none that I could see that maybe poses\n\n98\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.760\na question would be next to operation.\n\n99\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.060\nYou have two symbols.\n\n100\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.970\nDoes that just mean that\neither one can be used?\n\n101\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it means that either one\n&gt;&gt; The circle or the square.\n\n102\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.330\nIn the US we have a tendency\nto use the square.\n\n103\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.060\nIn other countries a lot of\ntimes they use the circle.\n\n104\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n105\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.160\n&gt;&gt; So, the next one we're gonna look at is\nwe're gonna look at a fishbone diagram.\n\n106\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.790\nAnd in a fishbone diagram we put in\nthe head of the fish, the problem, right?\n\n107\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.035\n&gt;&gt; Sure, no one likes bad coffee.\n\n108\n00:06:04.035 --> 00:06:05.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the one we're gonna fit,\n\n109\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.540\nwe're gonna put bad coffee\nin the head of the fish.\n\n110\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.360\nThen the major contributors to the fish\nare the major factors you think,\n\n111\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.810\nthe big bones.\n\n112\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.720\nThe ones right now that say personnel,\nmethod, material, and\n\n113\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.560\nequipment, those bones.\n\n114\n00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.390\nThose are the major things\nthat play into the problem.\n\n115\n00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.920\nYou can use a naming convention,\nsuch as the three Ps,\n\n116\n00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.440\nwhich is people, process, product/service.\n\n117\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.840\nYou can use the six Ms which\nis there's a series of those\n\n118\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.620\nthat will be in your student package.\n\n119\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.600\nBut, machines, mankind, mother nature.\n\n120\n00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.070\nIt has to get kinda clever.\n\n121\n00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.940\nOr you can just your own.\n\n122\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.970\nThe theory behind the fish bonechart,\nis the further out I get with those bones,\n\n123\n00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.580\nthe more likely I'm going\nto identify the root cause.\n\n124\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.370\nSo, for example,\nif we were looking at beans quality,\n\n125\n00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.380\nwhat are some things Cherokee that you\nthink might play into beans quality?\n\n126\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.860\n&gt;&gt; Age, perhaps the geographical region,\nfrom where they were harvested.\n\n127\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.930\nMaybe how they're being stored.\n\n128\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.550\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so the theory behind the\nfishbone diagram is the further we get it\n\n129\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.280\nout there, the more likely we\nare to identify the root cause.\n\n130\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.570\nSo the next of the seven.\n\n131\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.010\nSo far we've looked at a flow chart.\n\n132\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.040\nWe've looked at a fishbone diagram.\n\n133\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.550\nThe next one we're looking\nat is a check sheet.\n\n134\n00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.430\nThis one's always near and dear to my\nheart, because back in the day, one of\n\n135\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.580\nthe very first jobs I had was at Lolly\nLowell School of Secretarial Science,\n\n136\n00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.210\nwhere we taught our girls to smarkle,\nthat's half smile and half sparkle.\n\n137\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.505\nI love telling that story.\n\n138\n00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Across the hall from me,\n\n139\n00:07:46.442 --> 00:07:49.354\nI had a teacher who actually\ngraded typing tests And\n\n140\n00:07:49.354 --> 00:07:51.669\nshe had something that looked similar.\n\n141\n00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:53.826\nSo every time I see this,\nI have to kind of smile.\n\n142\n00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.122\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Smarkle.\n\n143\n00:07:55.122 --> 00:07:56.163\n&gt;&gt; Smarkle.\n\n144\n00:07:56.163 --> 00:08:00.729\n[LAUGH] So the next one that we're\ngonna talk about is the histogram, and\n\n145\n00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:05.450\nI usually like to talk about\nhistograms and Pareto charts together.\n\n146\n00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.330\nSo remember there's seven\ntools that all the bodies of\n\n147\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.600\nknowledge say these are the most important\nanalytical problem solving tools.\n\n148\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.940\nThese tools are called different\nthings in different environments.\n\n149\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.690\nWe have a tendency in Lean to\ncall them the quality tools, but\n\n150\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.060\nthese are analytical problem solving\ntools and the next is a histogram.\n\n151\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.650\nNow usually a histogram tracks\nthe history of a particular event.\n\n152\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.490\nSo maybe I'm tracking the history\nof how many phone calls we get.\n\n153\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.660\nBut a histogram can also be used\nto determine normal distribution,\n\n154\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.140\ndetermine distribution models,\nwhen we see something that looks like\n\n155\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.200\na bell if we're recording\na particular process.\n\n156\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.580\nIf we see something that looks\nlike a bell then we say that,\n\n157\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.390\nthat process has normal distribution.\n\n158\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.160\nAnd so sometimes that's what\npeople use histograms for.\n\n159\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.965\nNow you'll be happy to know that on\nthe student on the ITProTV student page,\n\n160\n00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:03.833\nthere's templates for all of these things.\n\n161\n00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:04.428\n&gt;&gt; That's amazing.\n\n162\n00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:05.265\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n163\n00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:09.819\nAnd so here's an example of the Histogram\nwhere it's just collecting buckets\n\n164\n00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.400\nof information.\n\n165\n00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.010\nAnd on this thing it's\nlooking at final test scores.\n\n166\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.800\nAnd so it's saying there's\na certain percentage of people.\n\n167\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.750\nA certain number of students rather that\nmade between 80 and 100 on the exam.\n\n168\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.450\nBut it looks like a lot of students\nmaade between 60 and 80 on this exam.\n\n169\n00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthe little red all the way to the left.\n\n170\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.970\nMaybe those are the scores\nthat we can have dropped,\n\n171\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.420\nthe class overall can have a better score.\n\n172\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n173\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.590\nNow here's An example of\nanother type of histogram and\n\n174\n00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:41.950\nit's putting things in buckets.\n\n175\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.350\nSo it's looking at a typical garage sale,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.020\nAnd so, if I look at this garage sale,\nI might say,\n\n177\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.740\nlet's say I'm doing a community garage\nsale and I'm taking it over from\n\n178\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.780\nthe people that have been doing it once\na year for like the last few years.\n\n179\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.581\nSo, I might collect all of my information\nand say how many items in the $1\n\n180\n00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:06.440\nto $5 price range was\nsold all the way through.\n\n181\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.151\nAnd what this is telling me\nis that because on the side,\n\n182\n00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:15.100\nthat x axis is,\ncould be representing 100, 200, 300.\n\n183\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.790\nSo we're looking at 800 items\nthat were sold between 1 and $5,\n\n184\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.510\nso I might wanna start including those.\n\n185\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.070\nIf I look over to the 26 to $30,\n\n186\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.980\nright, then that might be where\nI made the most money, right?\n\n187\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.970\nAnd you see in this case,\n\n188\n00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.310\nthe bars are touching because\nthey can be touching or separate.\n\n189\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.767\nIf they're touching it's\nkind of accommodating for\n\n190\n00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:41.312\nthat 510, 515, 550 right?\n\n191\n00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:42.976\nIf it falls a little closer to that bar.\n\n192\n00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.645\n&gt;&gt; In between.\n\n193\n00:10:43.645 --> 00:10:44.145\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\n\n194\n00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.500\nSo the next one we're gonna\ntalk about is a Pareto chart.\n\n195\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.050\nWhereas a histogram tracks\nthe history of an event,\n\n196\n00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.810\na Pareto chart tracks the type of event.\n\n197\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.780\n&gt;&gt; So back to our phone calls If we were\ntracking the types of phone calls that\n\n198\n00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.800\nthe IT test got, they might be things\nlike, I mean if we were tracking\n\n199\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.540\nthe history of that, the IT helpdesk\nmight have got 50 calls one day,\n\n200\n00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.740\n40 calls the next day 30 calls and\n50 calls.\n\n201\n00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.590\nEach day they might of got\na different number of calls.\n\n202\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.270\nIf I were doing a Pareto chart,\n\n203\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.310\nI would be looking at the types\nof calls they were getting.\n\n204\n00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:27.410\n&gt;&gt; And I can see how this is very helpful\nbecause if there's a repetition or\n\n205\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.920\nwe see one particular type of\ncall happening more than others,\n\n206\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, maybe it's for piece of software.\n\n207\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.780\nAnd then we just roll out some\nkind of training to help produce\n\n208\n00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.110\nthe amount of calls that\nhelpdesk is getting.\n\n209\n00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:38.890\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n210\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.930\nAnd so the Pareto chart is\nlooking at the types of events.\n\n211\n00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.190\nAnd right now what you're looking at is\nthe types of events that are happening\n\n212\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.190\nin a Body Shop, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.450\nNow, this is a check sheet,\nthis is an example of a check sheet.\n\n214\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.690\n&gt;&gt; I take the check sheet, and\nI put it on a Pareto Chart.\n\n215\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.270\nAnd even on the Check Sheet,\n\n216\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:01.660\nwe noticed that the biggest thing people\nhad were dents in their cars, right?\n\n217\n00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.220\nAnd that gives me some information\nas the project manager,\n\n218\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.750\nI may wanna start doing some\nthings around dents, right?\n\n219\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.230\nBut when I take the same information,\nI put it on a Pareto chart,\n\n220\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.070\nIt's more fluid and it's something that I\ncan really understand a little bit better.\n\n221\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.780\n&gt;&gt; It's very easy, yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very easy to understand.\n\n223\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.850\nAnd if I'm trying to do this as\na presentation like maybe I ask everyone\n\n224\n00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.928\nin the body shop to gather up all\nthe different things that they could,\n\n225\n00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:28.390\nthat they've been doing and\n\n226\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.440\nthen I have them put them on a chart then\nthis might be something I show them.\n\n227\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.200\nRight as well so remember the difference\nbetween a Pareto chart and\n\n228\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.790\na histogram is that the Pareto\nchart tracks the type of event,\n\n229\n00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.440\nthe histogram tracks\nthe history of the event.\n\n230\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n231\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.460\n&gt;&gt; So when we're looking at the seven\ntools one of the things about\n\n232\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.260\nPareto charts that's very helpful to\nproject managers Is if we go ahead and\n\n233\n00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.810\nput a tracking line in there.\n\n234\n00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.320\nThe tracking line says how much,\n\n235\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.920\nit kind of shows us if we handle\na particular problem, in this case,\n\n236\n00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.680\nit's a big box store at a pharmacy, and\nif we handle wrong dose We look across,\n\n237\n00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.300\nlike if you look at the data\npoint at the top of that bar.\n\n238\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.890\nYou look across the right hand side and\nyou'll see if we handle that one problem,\n\n239\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.320\nthat's 50%.\n\n240\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.250\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n241\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.070\n&gt;&gt; So we can also use a Pareto\nchart kind of as a burn down chart.\n\n242\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.245\nWe'll be looking at that\na little bit later.\n\n243\n00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:34.450\nBut if I wanted to collect all my bodies\nof information or all the things I wanted\n\n244\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.480\nto work on, I could kind of look at it as,\nhow much have I completed?\n\n245\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.380\nSo I could still use the same\ntype of chart for that.\n\n246\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.228\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now another chart in those seven most\n\n247\n00:13:47.228 --> 00:13:50.517\nimportant tools that\na project manager can use for\n\n248\n00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:54.500\nanalytical problem solving\nis a scatter plot.\n\n249\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.830\nWe can also use this for\nthings such as correlation.\n\n250\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.850\nIn this example, what we're doing is\nwe're trying to look at the intersection\n\n251\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.250\npoints and in this case the intersection\npoint between height and weight.\n\n252\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.480\nSo each one of these data points\nwould represent a player and\n\n253\n00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.920\nrather than looking at a ton\nof Excel spreadsheets.\n\n254\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.400\nLet's say a whole bunch of people\ncame out to try out for the team.\n\n255\n00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.070\n&gt;&gt; With all their statistics in one easy,\nclear view.\n\n256\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n257\n00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.620\nI can look at it all at once.\n\n258\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.760\nNow I can also use a scatter\nplot to do correlation and\n\n259\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.350\nthese are just some examples of\nways things could correlate.\n\n260\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.160\nThe top two examples are showing\nyou positive correlation.\n\n261\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.500\nWell they're both showing you positive\ncorrelation, but you can see the first\n\n262\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.200\none, is showing tighter correlation\ncuz the data points are together.\n\n263\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.130\n&gt;&gt; So it'd be more likely that\nthose two components are related.\n\n264\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n265\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.160\nAnd I should point out\nif you're studying for\n\n266\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.190\nthe project management exam these\nare charts that you need to know as well.\n\n267\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.030\nIf you're studying for\nthe one under the pin bock.\n\n268\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n269\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.070\n&gt;&gt; Now you'll just, you'll be\nintroduced to these in prints two and\n\n270\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.040\nin the ISO standard one.\n\n271\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.850\nBut for the pin bock you\nactually need to study these.\n\n272\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.390\nRight.\nSo the last one is Control Chart.\n\n273\n00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.110\nAnd in the Control Chart, what you'll\nnotice is there is a middle line.\n\n274\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.410\nThat middle line in the Control Chart\ncould represent a number of things usually\n\n275\n00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.300\nrepresents an average.\n\n276\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.790\nAnd so,\nwhat I'm trying to do is I'm trying to\n\n277\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.710\nplot my process against the average.\n\n278\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.760\nAnd you'll notice on this particular\nDiagram that we've established in\n\n279\n00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.570\nupper and a lower control limit.\n\n280\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.650\nSo those data points that\ngo outside the upper and\n\n281\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.670\nlower control limit are called outliers.\n\n282\n00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.054\n&gt;&gt; All right, and that's what we're trying\nto avoid because we wanna have like\n\n283\n00:15:43.054 --> 00:15:45.149\na stable process or\nstable output I should say.\n\n284\n00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:49.207\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so sometimes when\nyou're involved in doing a project,\n\n285\n00:15:49.207 --> 00:15:52.453\nyou wanna look at all\nthe processes that are around you.\n\n286\n00:15:52.453 --> 00:15:54.146\nNow there may be some processes.\n\n287\n00:15:54.146 --> 00:15:57.745\nThat you want to improve and\nmaybe you'll want to go back and watch\n\n288\n00:15:57.745 --> 00:16:02.890\nthe Lean Six Sigma green belt or yellow\nbelt because that's all about improvement.\n\n289\n00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:08.360\nAs a project manager,\nyou're looking at these charts and\n\n290\n00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.820\ngraphs as historical information.\n\n291\n00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.190\nSo you're not really trying to do any\nmore than gather up information, and\n\n292\n00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.530\nthis is a fast way.\n\n293\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.110\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n294\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in review, very quickly,\nbefore we move on to the next slide.\n\n295\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.678\nThere's seven tools, and the seven\ntools in project management are usually\n\n296\n00:16:27.678 --> 00:16:31.347\nreferred to,\nis analytical problem solving tools, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:31.347 --> 00:16:32.004\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n298\n00:16:32.004 --> 00:16:34.584\n&gt;&gt; So even though they're called\nbe a lot of different names,\n\n299\n00:16:34.584 --> 00:16:38.800\nthat's what they're called in most bodies\nof knowledge for project management.\n\n300\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.930\nYou're primarily using those\ntools to gather historical data\n\n301\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.920\nto move forward in your project.\n\n302\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.660\nDoes that make sense?\n\n303\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.346\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n304\n00:16:47.346 --> 00:16:50.455\nwell so we talked about the three\nBodies of Knowledge, and\n\n305\n00:16:50.455 --> 00:16:52.490\nwe keep bringing those back up again.\n\n306\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.136\nThat's the PMBOK from PMI,\nPRINCE2 which is from the UK, and\n\n307\n00:16:57.136 --> 00:17:01.698\nthen the International Standards\nOrganization has a project\n\n308\n00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:05.572\nmanagement guideline called 12500, right.\n\n309\n00:17:05.572 --> 00:17:09.287\nSo in addition to those,\nbefore you can start applying lean and\n\n310\n00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:13.916\nagile techniques to project management,\nyou need to be aware of the different\n\n311\n00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:17.590\ntypes of project management\nmodels that you can use.\n\n312\n00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.240\nThe first one is PDCA and\nthat's very prevalent.\n\n313\n00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.010\nAnd then the other two\nare the DMAIC model and Agile, and\n\n314\n00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.540\nwe're just gonna briefly\ngo through these models.\n\n315\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.754\nAnd if you decide that you would\nrather have a more in-depth\n\n316\n00:17:30.754 --> 00:17:35.976\nunderstanding of at least two of these\nmodels, those are captured in both\n\n317\n00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:40.962\nthe Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt class and\nthe Lean Six Sigma Green belt.\n\n318\n00:17:40.962 --> 00:17:45.415\nSo, the first two that we're gonna\ntalk about in conjunction is,\n\n319\n00:17:45.415 --> 00:17:48.844\ntogether rather, is the PDCA and\nthe DMAIC model.\n\n320\n00:17:51.262 --> 00:17:54.972\n&gt;&gt; Now, with the The Green Belt\ncertification, I know we focused\n\n321\n00:17:54.972 --> 00:17:59.312\na little more heavily with the DMAIC,\nbut for these types of industries,\n\n322\n00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:03.310\nor these bodies, should we kind of\ngive them equal playing ground?\n\n323\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.880\nOr how do they relate in that aspect?\n\n324\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, this is a very good question,\nCherokee and the deal is as a project\n\n325\n00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.800\nmanager that's applying Lean and\nthat wants to say I'm using Lean,\n\n326\n00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.695\nwhich we're saying lean short for Lean Six\nSigma Lean and Agile tools is that you\n\n327\n00:18:21.695 --> 00:18:26.625\njust wanna be familiar with the types of\nmethodologies that company might be using.\n\n328\n00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:27.345\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n329\n00:18:27.345 --> 00:18:32.395\nif I'm a traditional project manager or\nI'm a lean project manager and\n\n330\n00:18:32.395 --> 00:18:35.595\nall of a sudden,\nI'm exposed to this agile environment.\n\n331\n00:18:35.595 --> 00:18:40.150\nSo, what we're trying to do in this\nseries and also with the certification.\n\n332\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.060\nIs demonstrate that it\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n333\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.530\nI have these skills and\nI can put all these skills together, and\n\n334\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.760\nwhatever your company wants to do,\nI'm capable of doing that.\n\n335\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.700\n&gt;&gt; But I should know the steps for\neach of these.\n\n336\n00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.030\n&gt;&gt; You should, absolutely.\n\n337\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.810\nBecause you could very easily\nget into an environment.\n\n338\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.460\nThat is using PDCA or is using DMAIC,\nand as a project manager,\n\n339\n00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.810\nthat's something that you need to know.\n\n340\n00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.460\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n341\n00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.890\nAll right so, the first one, PDCA,\n\n342\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.810\nthis is an accepted projected\nprocess that's in just everything.\n\n343\n00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.150\nIt also is good for\nif you're trying to organize a report or\n\n344\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.280\na presentation, so\nthere's a lot of advantages to the PDCA.\n\n345\n00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.790\nSo the first phase,\nit's a four step phase and\n\n346\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.020\nthe first phase is very\nintuitive which is plan.\n\n347\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.670\nThe second one is due which means execute,\nthe third one is check which means I'm\n\n348\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:36.320\ngonna back and check what I did, and\nthen I'm going to act, abandon, or adopt.\n\n349\n00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.330\nNow in order to check my work,\n\n350\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.730\nit's really a good idea to start\nplanning those metrics in plan.\n\n351\n00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:44.230\nSo that when I get to check.\n\n352\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.730\nIn fact, the PDCA model is\nkind of an interesting one.\n\n353\n00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.560\nBecause if I do everything\nI'm supposed to do and plan.\n\n354\n00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.300\nWhen I get to do, which is execute,\nI just do the plan.\n\n355\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.900\n&gt;&gt; Follow it.\n\n356\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.375\n&gt;&gt; And then in check,\nI just check the plan.\n\n357\n00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:59.545\nAnd hopefully when I get\nthose three components,\n\n358\n00:19:59.545 --> 00:20:02.675\nI'll know if I wanna act,\nabandon or adapt.\n\n359\n00:20:02.675 --> 00:20:04.945\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And adapt in this case was just so\n\n360\n00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:06.375\nthat they could keep the A-word.\n\n361\n00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:08.265\nAnd that means I'm gonna go around and\ntweak it up.\n\n362\n00:20:10.094 --> 00:20:13.370\nSo, here's just a little\nbit more information.\n\n363\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.180\nOne of the things I wanna point\nout with the PDCA is many times\n\n364\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.780\nit's used as a pilot.\n\n365\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:24.180\nSo as a project manager, if you have\nthe opportunity to pilot your project\n\n366\n00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.510\nbefore you roll it out, that's huge.\n\n367\n00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.830\nNow, in process improvement projects,\npiloting is essential In project\n\n368\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.750\nmanagement projects, you sort of get to\nmake that decision, but piloting is huge.\n\n369\n00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.355\nAnd why do you think we would need to our,\nwhy is it lean to pilot?\n\n370\n00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:44.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, just speaking from\nexperience especially with things like\n\n371\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.400\nany kind of update deployments,\nyou never want to roll anything\n\n372\n00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.520\nnew out any kind of system,\nsoftware, without testing it.\n\n373\n00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.840\nBecause well in an IT environment,\nyou don't know if there's any kind of\n\n374\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.790\nconflicts with pre-existing equipment or\njust end-user training.\n\n375\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.420\nAnything like that really there's\na slew of things that could go wrong so\n\n376\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.010\nif I test it in a controlled environment,\n\n377\n00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.710\nI can kind of foresee those problems, fix\nthem before I roll them out company wide.\n\n378\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n379\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.250\nAnd so this is just taking that Plan,\nDo, Checkout, one more step.\n\n380\n00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.220\nDiscover the current condition of\nthe problem, develop the solution and\n\n381\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.470\nexperiment on a pilot basis,\n\n382\n00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:33.620\nif we were doing it as a pilot, Check,\nEvaluate the results of that pilot.\n\n383\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.550\n&gt;&gt; And then act hopefully.\n\n384\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:41.430\nCuz we could also abandon, we could also\nsay this is just totally over, right?\n\n385\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\nthen IT sometimes we use that word ignore.\n\n386\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.380\nAnd it's not that you're\nignoring the problem but\n\n387\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.220\nyou just might not at that\ntime have resources or\n\n388\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.280\nsome other reason as to why you're going\nto be executing at that moment in time.\n\n389\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n390\n00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.610\nHere you are, the schematic you're\nlooking at right now is just kind of\n\n391\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.610\na linear vision of the PDCA.\n\n392\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.240\nNow one of the reasons why project\nmanagement loves the PDCA is, guess what?\n\n393\n00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.780\nI can apply a work rate\ndownstructure to this.\n\n394\n00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.280\nSo PLAN could be 1, DO could be 2,\n3 could be Check, right?\n\n395\n00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.770\nSo even when I'm in the very beginning\nstages of what I'm going to do,\n\n396\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.270\nI could put it in WBS.\n\n397\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:24.020\nNow ideally I want to leave planned\nwith a fully developed WBS.\n\n398\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.180\nBut if I'm just trying\nto manage like four or\n\n399\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.950\nfive projects, I can go ahead and\nPDCA all of them.\n\n400\n00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.400\nPut work breakdown structures and\n\n401\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.610\nthere might be some synergy between\nsome of the numbers that I come up with.\n\n402\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.190\nSo for example when I'm executing,\n\n403\n00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.800\nthere maybe components of another\nproject that I could execute.\n\n404\n00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.675\n&gt;&gt; Apply?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n405\n00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:44.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n406\n00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.370\n&gt;&gt; So\nideally you lead plan with a WBS, but\n\n407\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.100\neven when you're just getting\nstarted you can apply those numbers.\n\n408\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.350\nNow I think we'll probably be\ntalking about the other models\n\n409\n00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.550\nin our next session, but\njust as a reminder, the reason why we're\n\n410\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.980\ntalking about these different models is\nthat we're trying to build a foundation so\n\n411\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:09.760\nthat you can apply Lean and Agile tools\nto your traditional project management.\n\n412\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.610\nAnd it's important to know\nwhat traditional project\n\n413\n00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.530\nmanagement models are out there.\n\n414\n00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's great.\n\n415\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.550\nIn this episode we were able to go\nahead and look at our PDCA model.\n\n416\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.460\nHowever, we'll wrap it up for\nthis one, but stay tuned.\n\n417\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.360\nDon't go anywhere, because we're\ngonna take a look at our DMAIC model,\n\n418\n00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.580\nas well as Agile.\n\n419\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.317\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and sign off\nas your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n420\n00:23:32.317 --> 00:23:36.281\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr.Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n421\n00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:40.042\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV\n\n422\n00:23:40.042 --> 00:23:45.798\n[MUSIC]\n\n423\n00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:49.738\n&gt;&gt;

Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.860\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.540\nIn the previous episode,\nwe looked at our seven tools of quality.\n\n9\n00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.840\nAnd we also started with different models,\nand we looked at the PDCA model.\n\n10\n00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.870\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna further explore those models.\n\n11\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.010\nAnd with us to go ahead and\nconceptualize those ideas,\n\n12\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.820\nwe have Doctor Terra Vanzant-Stern\nin studios.\n\n13\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.320\nThank you for joining us today, doctor.\n\n14\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.390\n&gt;&gt;

That sounds great.\n\n18\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.820\nAnd I just wanna remind everyone that\nthe reason we're looking at these model\n\n19\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.770\nis that in order to apply Lean and\nAgile principles to\n\n20\n00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.830\ntraditional project management,\nyou have to kinda understand those tools.\n\n21\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.130\nAnd we looked at those seven quality\ntools as Cherokee mentioned.\n\n22\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.810\nBut you also need to be familiar\nwith the various models.\n\n23\n00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.720\nThe model we're going to look at next is a\nSix Sigma and also a Lean Six Sigma model.\n\n24\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.720\nEven though this program is called Lean,\n\n25\n00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.790\nin Agile project management, it really\nis Lean Six Sigma and Agile management.\n\n26\n00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.149\nIt was just leaner to say Lean and\nAgile project management.\n\n27\n00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.484\nWith that in mind,\nthis is just a reminder of the book,\n\n28\n00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.669\nLean &amp; Agile Project Management.\n\n29\n00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:34.905\nAnd I wanted to side by side show\nyou we look at the PDCA model and\n\n30\n00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:38.450\nnow we're gonna look at the DMAIC model.\n\n31\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.170\nNow the DMAIC model typically is\nused to do process improvement.\n\n32\n00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.120\nHowever, a lot of times\nas a project manager,\n\n33\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.460\nyou're gonna bump up against this model.\n\n34\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.830\nAlso, even though we talk about this\nmodel in context of a full blown model,\n\n35\n00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.560\nwhat I'd like you to think\nof as a project manager\n\n36\n00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.690\nis that as you start having issues and\nproblems,\n\n37\n00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.210\nyou can actually use DMAIC as a thinking\nprocess as a critical thinking tool.\n\n38\n00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.620\nSo if you go through\nthese different phases.\n\n39\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.490\nIf you're interested in more in depth\nknowledge of each one of these phases,\n\n40\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.160\nthat is captured in our\nLean Six Sigma green belt program.\n\n41\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.261\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So first explain.\n\n42\n00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:26.340\nD means define, M is for\nmeasure, A, analyze, I for\n\n43\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.860\nimprove, although the slide says\nimplement, and C for control.\n\n44\n00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.240\nSo define means just what it says,\n\n45\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.340\nI'm gonna make sure I'm\nworking on the right problem.\n\n46\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.570\nMeasurement or measure means that\nI'm gonna get clearer as is picture.\n\n47\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.030\nAnalyze means I'm gonna go back and\nsee why that picture looks that way.\n\n48\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.090\nAnd although our slide says implement,\nit should say improve.\n\n49\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.760\nIn improve, a myriad of activities would\nhappen if I were using it as a process\n\n50\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.950\nimprovement model.\n\n51\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.220\nThis is where I get buy in,\n\n52\n00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.220\nthis is where I form my project plan\nin a work break down structure.\n\n53\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.570\nI'd stay and improve until I felt like\nthere was an improvement made and then\n\n54\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.210\nI would move into control and in control\nI would articulate those improvements and\n\n55\n00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.560\nthen I would give you a plan for\nsustainability.\n\n56\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.620\nSo if we're looking at the first model.\n\n57\n00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.410\nThe DMAIC method is a problem solving\nmodel used within the Six Sigma or\n\n58\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.600\nLean Six Sigma strategy.\n\n59\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.730\nAnd it's used to help reduce variation.\n\n60\n00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.320\nThere's a thought in Six Sigma,\nthat if I identify and\n\n61\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.400\nstart reducing variation I may have\nan automatic process improvement.\n\n62\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.870\nI would like to point out that in all\nprocess improvement environments,\n\n63\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.870\nsomething that you wanna remember is that\nat some point it does become a project.\n\n64\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.087\nSo even process improvement people,\nat some point become project managers.\n\n65\n00:03:57.068 --> 00:04:00.280\nAs mentioned,\nthe DMAIC follows these 5 steps.\n\n66\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.740\nDefine, measure, analyze,\nimprove and control.\n\n67\n00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.610\nAnd I'm happy to say that the slide says\nthe right thing this time, Cherokee.\n\n68\n00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nAnd like Dr. Stern had mentioned,\n\n69\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.260\nif you have any question about\na specific phase, individually,\n\n70\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.070\nwell we covered them in great depth in\nthat green belt certification series,\n\n71\n00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.350\nso jump on over and\ncheck those out as well.\n\n72\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.430\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so in Define,\nthere's a number of tools that we'll\n\n73\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.830\nbe talking about that that you can use\nin Lean and Agile project management.\n\n74\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.690\nBut I'm gonna briefly go over and\n\n75\n00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.050\ndefine the voice of the customer\nis really a big deal.\n\n76\n00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.610\nOkay so,\nwhat the customer thinks is a big deal.\n\n77\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.180\nCritical to quality means\nwhat is critical to success,\n\n78\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.990\nyou can use that as your project too.\n\n79\n00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.890\nWhat is gonna make this\nproject successful?\n\n80\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.240\nAnd sometimes when we're thinking about\ncritical to quality, we're just thinking\n\n81\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.910\nabout ourselves, and we're thinking\nwhats critical to quality to me.\n\n82\n00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.130\nBut as a project manager,\n\n83\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.050\nyou wanna think about what is critical to\nquality some of those other people right.\n\n84\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.630\n&gt;&gt; Sure, getting different perspectives.\n\n85\n00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n86\n00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.580\nNow also what happens in define is when\nyou come up with the project charter.\n\n87\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.980\nThe project charter in\ntraditional project management.\n\n88\n00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.740\nAnd in define are very, very similar.\n\n89\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.960\nHowever, there are some tools in in define\nthat might make your project charter\n\n90\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.500\na little bit more robust.\n\n91\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.090\nSIPOC Mapping means that I'm\ngoing to look at the suppliers,\n\n92\n00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.070\nthe input, the process,\nthe output and, the control.\n\n93\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.560\nAnd I'm gonna see what people and\nthings are associated with that.\n\n94\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.800\nSo again, SIPOC is a tool that's\ntypically used in Define.\n\n95\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.906\nBut if you have a project and\nyou're trying to figure out who\n\n96\n00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:47.310\nare the major stakeholders, it's a tool\nthat you can use as a project manager.\n\n97\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.000\nIt's not typically used.\n\n98\n00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.760\nValue stream mapping is\na very interesting process.\n\n99\n00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.540\nWhen you do a process map,\nwhich, as project managers,\n\n100\n00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.950\nwe're pretty familiar with.\n\n101\n00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.850\nPlus, it's one of the seven\nanalytical problem solving tools.\n\n102\n00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.930\nIn those environments,\n\n103\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.450\nin a process mapping environment,\nI'm trying to collect every single piece\n\n104\n00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.580\nof information that I need to see\nwhat's going on in that process.\n\n105\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.550\nSometimes as a project manager,\nI end up with the process map because I've\n\n106\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.690\ndone the project and now I wanna show you\nthe steps that I took to do the project.\n\n107\n00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.400\nAnd so sometimes the In the define model,\n\n108\n00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.270\nthe process map happens first, because\nI don't know how to solve the problem.\n\n109\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.020\nIn project management, a lot of times\nthat it comes after the fact, but\n\n110\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.990\nthe difference between that and a value\nstream map is on the value stream map,\n\n111\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.460\nI'm only collecting the actual things that\nare essential for that process to work.\n\n112\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.440\nAs a project manager,\nwhy that might be important,\n\n113\n00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.430\nis I may have a project\nwithin a very large process.\n\n114\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.160\nSo if I'm trying to determine\nwhat's going on around my project,\n\n115\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.830\ndoing a value stream map\nmight be incredibly helpful.\n\n116\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.680\n&gt;&gt; So this is a little bit\nof a random question, but\n\n117\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.690\nI wanted to throw it out there, because\nbefore we had started this series or\n\n118\n00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.440\nearlier today, we were kind of talking\nabout making this exam a little leaner.\n\n119\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.610\nAnd looking at some of these\nterms like that acronym SIPOC,\n\n120\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.440\nwe serve Suppliers, Input,\nProcess, Output, and Customers.\n\n121\n00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.350\nAnd then our VOC for\nVoices of Our Customers.\n\n122\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.540\nFor these acronyms, is that still\nsomething that's really relevant and\n\n123\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.640\nimportant for\nthis particular certification?\n\n124\n00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.580\nWe need to know those.\n\n125\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.350\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n126\n00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.446\nI think that you need to know the core\ntools in each one of the models.\n\n127\n00:07:32.446 --> 00:07:37.810\nAll of the models can go like\n\n128\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.470\ninto infinity almost, so you can take\neach phase, even of the PDCA model.\n\n129\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.260\nWhich is a much more simpler model than\nthe one we're looking at right now.\n\n130\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.500\nAnd you can kind of take\nthem into infinity.\n\n131\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.820\nSo what this program is gonna show you\nis the key ones that you need to know.\n\n132\n00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.970\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n133\n00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.084\n&gt;&gt; The ones that you can use.\n\n134\n00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:58.780\nNow the cool thing about this is that some\nof the tools, even though in the DMAIC\n\n135\n00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.151\nthat I'm introducing them these\nare in Define, these are in Measure.\n\n136\n00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.176\nThey can be used throughout the model and\nindependently.\n\n137\n00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:09.683\nSo as a project manager if you decide to\ntake something through the DMAIC model,\n\n138\n00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:13.047\nmaybe you're unclear,\nmaybe you've changed your mind or\n\n139\n00:08:13.047 --> 00:08:17.060\nyour unclear about the direction\nyou want to take your project in.\n\n140\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.830\nKinda keep in mind even though we're\nusing these tools to the specific model,\n\n141\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.990\nyou can use them independently.\n\n142\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.790\n&gt;&gt; Pretty flexible.\n\n143\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n144\n00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:29.550\nSo then we move to measure, that's\nthe second phase of the DMAIC model.\n\n145\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.520\nSo we could have been exposed to\nan environment that's using PDCA.\n\n146\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.270\nWe could as project managers be exposed\nto an environment that's using the DMAIC.\n\n147\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.270\nThe second phase in\nthe DMAIC model is measure.\n\n148\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.371\nNow one of the other things that you\nwanna remember about the DMAIC model\n\n149\n00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:51.013\nas a project manager is that you could be\ndoing a project in any one of these steps,\n\n150\n00:08:51.013 --> 00:08:55.270\ndefine, measure, analyze, improve and\ncontrol within those phases.\n\n151\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.300\nSo the infrastructure might be\nrecognizing the DMAIC model.\n\n152\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.430\nYou may be just doing\na project within that.\n\n153\n00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.910\nEspecially if you're on a Six Sigma\nproject, which is typically very large.\n\n154\n00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.790\nIn the Lean Six Sigma projects\na lot of times you're\n\n155\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.800\nmoving from these phases fairly quickly.\n\n156\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Rapid rates.\n\n157\n00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, but in a Six Sigma project,\n\n158\n00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.720\nwhere they're working\nwith millions of dollars.\n\n159\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.100\n&gt;&gt; Especially with government's entities,\nit could be yeah, span a decade or so.\n\n160\n00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.080\n&gt;&gt; So within measure of the DMAIC model,\nyou might have a number of projects.\n\n161\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.070\nSo in measure, what, typically what\nyou're trying to do is get a clear as\n\n162\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:37.310\nis picture to where you are today and\nsometimes that take a lot of research.\n\n163\n00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.270\nOne way you can kind of figure out,\nget a kind of a temperature\n\n164\n00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.480\nis if you did CTQs and\ncustomer requirements are always CTQs.\n\n165\n00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.590\nBut we said just in our earlier phase\n\n166\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.590\nCTQs are also anything that would make\nyou successful or would be satisfiers.\n\n167\n00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.660\nSo if you're trying to get\na really quick idea of clear or\n\n168\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.540\nas is state, you could just say,\nwell, how are we doing on those\n\n169\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.690\ncustomer requirements on a scale from\none to ten, or one to five even?\n\n170\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.640\nA lot of times what you're doing in\nmeasure is you're just working through\n\n171\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.630\ntrying to pick out what is\nthe appropriate measure?\n\n172\n00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.920\nHow should I measure that?\n\n173\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.560\nAnd a very poplar tool\nis just observation.\n\n174\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n175\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.660\n&gt;&gt; So the other thing that I'm doing, and\nthis part I think gets very confusing for\n\n176\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.040\nproject managers,\nis I'm trying to gain baseline data.\n\n177\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.960\nAnd I'm gonna establish\na baseline performance and\n\n178\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.170\nthose terms are still used.\n\n179\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:36.050\nAs a project manager, remember baseline,\nin this case, can mean a benchmark,\n\n180\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.680\nor a standard, or I'm just trying\nto get some foundation information.\n\n181\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.510\nBut baseline on a project plan,\nas mentioned in an earlier session.\n\n182\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.120\nBaseline on a project plan is how long is\ngonna take, and how much is it gonna cost?\n\n183\n00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.790\nSo even as a project manager,\n\n184\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.430\nwhen you're presenting your baseline a lot\nof times I think you have to spell it out.\n\n185\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.860\nI'm saying how long it's gonna take,\nhow much it's gonna cost because measure,\n\n186\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.360\nwhere I'm trying to get a clear picture,\na lot of times that word is used.\n\n187\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and even in IT we use the term\nbaseline to get that as its picture so\n\n188\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.930\nyou can have something to compare\nsomething to identify any anomalies or\n\n189\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.470\nany divergence there, so\nit does have a dual meaning.\n\n190\n00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and as a project manager you\njust need to be aware that if you're\n\n191\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.550\nconfused, then your audience is\nprobably pretty confused too.\n\n192\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.280\nOkay, so\nif you were looking at the DMAIC model,\n\n193\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.970\nthe third phase of\nthe DMAIC model is analyze.\n\n194\n00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.790\nAnd in a lot of classes, if you were\ntaking the Lean Six Sigma class like say\n\n195\n00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.590\noutside, or even if you were listening\nto it a little bit on ITProTV.\n\n196\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:44.910\nThere's a tendency in the analyse space\nof the DMAIC model to concentrate\n\n197\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.280\non those seven analytical\nproblem solving tools.\n\n198\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.990\nHowever, a lot of things\nare going on in analyse.\n\n199\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.040\nOne of the things that's going on in\nanalyse is that you're looking for\n\n200\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.360\nforward key positions.\n\n201\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.400\nOne is you're trying to\nfigure out root cause.\n\n202\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.640\nYou've got your information for\n\n203\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.770\nmeasure, now what you're trying to do is\nyour trying to figure out root cause.\n\n204\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.570\nYou're also looking for correlations,\nyou're looking for impact and\n\n205\n00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.740\nyou're also looking for variation.\n\n206\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.322\nSometimes in order to do that you need\none of those seven analytical problem\n\n207\n00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:18.824\nsolving tools and\nthat's why it pops up a lot in analyze.\n\n208\n00:12:18.824 --> 00:12:24.038\nAs a project manager, the cool\nthing about analyze is that analyze\n\n209\n00:12:24.038 --> 00:12:29.370\nhas all kinds of tips and\ntricks on how to present your logic.\n\n210\n00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.260\nLet's say you already have your\nlogic completely thought out,\n\n211\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.860\nyou've got your project plan,\nyou've rolled it out.\n\n212\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.000\nBut you know that you're gonna\nneed a little bit of buy in.\n\n213\n00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000\nWhen you present your project or\nyour project idea.\n\n214\n00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.030\nSo analyze is a good place to go\nto get some other ideas of how to\n\n215\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.500\npackage that particular knowledge.\n\n216\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.920\nOne of the things that\n\n217\n00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.950\nanalyze looks at is something called\na Failure Mode Effect Analysis, and\n\n218\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.950\nthat's a tool that we'll be looking\nat a little bit later in our session.\n\n219\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:05.100\nSo this particular tool can be at a lot\nof different places in the project\n\n220\n00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.320\nlife cycle that we've developed, but\none place we can use it is in analyze.\n\n221\n00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.940\nAnd the reason why we're\nbringing it up now,\n\n222\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.430\nis it allows you to look at all the risk.\n\n223\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.960\nSo if I'm analyzing my project and\nmaybe I've made my project plan that I\n\n224\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.150\nhaven't really thought about the risk and\nI haven't built in any risk contingencies,\n\n225\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.820\nanalyze and\nthe DMAIC model is a great place to go.\n\n226\n00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of forces you to think\nabout it before you get into that improve\n\n227\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.620\nphase and actually roll it out.\n\n228\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so this last one that's,\nor the next to the last phase.\n\n229\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.880\nI'm sorry, getting a little ahead of\nmyself, in the DMAIC model is improve.\n\n230\n00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.520\nNow improve,\n\n231\n00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.570\nthe trickiest part about improve is\nthat if you're using the DMAIC model or\n\n232\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:52.930\nyou are a project manager participating\nin one of these particular phases.\n\n233\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.900\nImprove is where all\nthe work is happening.\n\n234\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.510\nThis is where you actually do\nturn into a project manager.\n\n235\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.180\nSo if you're a project manager and\nyou go somewhere and they say, well we use\n\n236\n00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:08.250\nthe DMAIC model, you might have to\nresearch, define, measure, analyze, right?\n\n237\n00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.758\nBut when you get to improve,\nyou're back to being a project manager, so\n\n238\n00:14:11.758 --> 00:14:14.649\nyou've got that phase completely\nunder control, right?\n\n239\n00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:19.385\nHowever, what a lot of people forget when\nthey are part of DMAIC model is that\n\n240\n00:14:19.385 --> 00:14:23.233\neven though you should spend as\nmuch time in define as you can,\n\n241\n00:14:23.233 --> 00:14:26.430\nimproves where all the action happens.\n\n242\n00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.180\nAnd so it improve,\nI'm looking at air proofing,\n\n243\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.680\nI'm looking at standardization, I'm\nlooking at visual management, I'm looking\n\n244\n00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.351\nat Kanban systems which we'll talk about\na little bit later in this sessions.\n\n245\n00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:42.690\nBut I'm looking at all kinds of things and\nI'm doing all kinds of things.\n\n246\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.660\nIn the PDCA model, execute happens in due.\n\n247\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.930\nSo I have PDCA execute's\nhappening right after I plan.\n\n248\n00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:56.040\nAnd in the DMAIC model that\nexecution as being a project manager\n\n249\n00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.860\ndoesn't happen til this phase So\nif you're brought in as a project manager,\n\n250\n00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.030\nsomeone could have done\nall the planning already.\n\n251\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if there was a project planner.\n\n252\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.620\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nif there was a project planner.\n\n253\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.070\nAnd so you're doing PDCA and the very\nnext thing you do is execute, right.\n\n254\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.100\nIf you were brought in\nas a project manager\n\n255\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.130\nIn the DMAIC model you might\nnot even get involved.\n\n256\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.530\nEspecially in the Six Sigma environment\nwhere the projects are huge.\n\n257\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.530\nYou might not even be involved\nuntil the bottom part improved.\n\n258\n00:15:25.616 --> 00:15:30.530\nAnd so on the DMAIC model continuing,\nI'm gonna close it up right now.\n\n259\n00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.640\nI'm gonna close up my process and\nimprovement and what are the big things\n\n260\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.400\nI need to do is I need to articulate\nthe benefits that I gave you.\n\n261\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.940\nSo wanna tell you this\nis what I set out to do.\n\n262\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.050\nThis is why I did it.\n\n263\n00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.076\nAnd this is what I.\n\n264\n00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:45.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is what I'm doing for\nthe past five months or whatever.\n\n265\n00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n266\n00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.764\n&gt;&gt; This is what I made you, saved you,\nor avoided you spending, right?.\n\n267\n00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:57.028\nAnd then the biggest part of the control\nplan is actually the sustainability.\n\n268\n00:15:57.028 --> 00:15:58.424\nThat's hard to say.\n\n269\n00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.848\nHow am I gonna keep that process in place.\n\n270\n00:16:00.848 --> 00:16:05.680\nAnd then the last part, again, it goes\nback to just being a project manager.\n\n271\n00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.200\nWhat kinds of things do I need\nto close up this project?\n\n272\n00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.950\nSo Cherokee, can you think of just some\nbasic things that I need to close it up?\n\n273\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.590\n&gt;&gt; Well for the sustainability, maybe\nyou would wanna implement something like\n\n274\n00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.748\na standard operating procedure that\nyour employees need to follow.\n\n275\n00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.990\nYou might wanna implement some form of\ntraining to make sure that they understand\n\n276\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.170\nthose policies and procedures.\n\n277\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.230\nAnd then you might also wanna have a bit\nof a party so that you can kind of keep\n\n278\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.420\nthe morale up and make them happy\nabout implementing this project.\n\n279\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n280\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.730\none of the other things that I think that\nis really valuable about the DMAIC model\n\n281\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.970\nis that there's lots of reasons why\npeople don't buy into our projects.\n\n282\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.770\nSo let's say I'm a project manager,\nand I've developed this project, and\n\n283\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.710\nI'm ready to go.\n\n284\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.322\nI've got my plan and everything,\nbut now I've gotta get buy in.\n\n285\n00:16:53.322 --> 00:16:53.896\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n[LAUGH]\n\n286\n00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:55.750\n&gt;&gt; The number one reason people,\n\n287\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.890\nand this is just using the DMAIC\nmodel as sort of a promotional model.\n\n288\n00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.426\nThe number one reason people\ndon't buy into our ideas and\n\n289\n00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:06.880\nour projects is they\nflat don't understand.\n\n290\n00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.960\nThey just don't get what\nyou're trying to say.\n\n291\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.640\nSo, if you were to go back to\nthe DMAIC model and look at define,\n\n292\n00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.630\nthere's all kinds of tools there that\nhelp you help people understand.\n\n293\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.250\n&gt;&gt;

And exactly, and\nyou mentioned observation.\n\n301\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.420\nBut what if the observation is a bit\nskewed because that person had\n\n302\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.720\ncreated that process, or whatever?\n\n303\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.270\nAnother really common thing\nthat we're seeing a lot is\n\n304\n00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.770\nlike you mentioned on a scale of\none to five like that Likert scale.\n\n305\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.687\nWe see a lot of surveys,\nI see surveys everywhere.\n\n306\n00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:58.120\nOn almost all of my receipts, there's some\nkind of survey that you could fill out.\n\n307\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.470\nSo, that's one way where we could\nkind of create our own measurement,\n\n308\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.030\nour own metric, so to speak.\n\n309\n00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.213\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nI'm talking to this person and\n\n310\n00:18:06.213 --> 00:18:10.100\nI'm trying to get their buy in it, I mean\nI'm ready to go, I'm ready to roll it out.\n\n311\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.770\nI have my project plan, I have my WDS.\n\n312\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.689\nI have my cost, I have my resources,\nI have my time.\n\n313\n00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:21.560\nAnd let's say they do understand so\nI'm okay with that.\n\n314\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.260\nAnd let's say they do agree\nthat it's really broken.\n\n315\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.250\nBut guess what,\nwhy did you go that direction?\n\n316\n00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.790\nWhy didn't you do something else, right?\n\n317\n00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:34.100\nAnd so, that's another good thing as\na Lean and Agile Project Manager,\n\n318\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:39.695\nis that you can go back to\nanalyze because analyze is packed\n\n319\n00:18:39.695 --> 00:18:46.410\nwith tools to help you explain\nyour critical thought.\n\n320\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.490\nSo it gives you all kinds of ideas,\nall kinds of graphs and charts.\n\n321\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.600\nIf you're trying, you know,\nthey're saying, well, hate it.\n\n322\n00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.140\n&gt;&gt; Like we didn't just have a blindfold\nand randomly choose something.\n\n323\n00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.430\nWe had a logical step by step process.\n\n324\n00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.990\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.490\nAnd so if you're talking to that person\nand you all of a sudden you just see that\n\n326\n00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.154\ndeer in the headlight look,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n327\n00:19:03.154 --> 00:19:05.155\n&gt;&gt; And you know they just don't get why\n\n328\n00:19:05.155 --> 00:19:09.930\nyou went that direction, analyze gives you\nthat help to show that to them, right?\n\n329\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.540\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n330\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and\nthen one of the biggest reasons that\n\n331\n00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.250\npeople don't buy into our ideas, and\nthese are like the top five, and it\n\n332\n00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.000\njust aligns so well with the DMAIC model-\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm interested [LAUGH] because\n\n333\n00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.040\nI'm like okay-\n&gt;&gt; It's so cool.\n\n334\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.990\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] what do I need\nto work on here, right?\n\n335\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so all right, so they don't\nunderstand, right, we fixed that.\n\n336\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.340\nThey don't think, they think we\nfix something that wasn't broken,\n\n337\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.500\nwe fixed that, they don't understand\nour logic, we fixed that.\n\n338\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.900\nAnd they could start at any point, right?\n\n339\n00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.080\nThey could just go straight to\nI don't get your logic, right?\n\n340\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.100\nBut the next thing is\nthat people don't like\n\n341\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.870\nto do things where they\ndon't have a choice.\n\n342\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.810\nSo improve offers you choices.\n\n343\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.284\nSo improve shows you ways that\nyou can present, you're three or\n\n344\n00:19:50.284 --> 00:19:53.305\nfour to five choices in a way\nthat makes sense to people so\n\n345\n00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:56.168\nthat they feel like they're [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They've contributed as well.\n\n346\n00:19:56.168 --> 00:19:56.981\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes.\n\n347\n00:19:56.981 --> 00:20:01.320\nBecause the moment we say it's my way or\nthe high way, we kinda lose people.\n\n348\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.190\nPeople just stop thinking,\nthey just keep thinking,\n\n349\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.060\nI bet there's another way to do it,\neven if there's not, right?\n\n350\n00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.050\nSo, improve kinda helps us remember that.\n\n351\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.010\nAnd, even though there's not a whole\nlot of tips and tricks and improve.\n\n352\n00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.170\nIt's just a way of\nremembering you know what,\n\n353\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.390\nthey might not feel like\nthey had a choice, right?\n\n354\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:22.480\nAnd the final reason of the top\nreasons people don't buy into things\n\n355\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.220\nis they don't think it's sustainable.\n\n356\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.665\nSo they say hey,\nI can clean up the, in fact,\n\n357\n00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:31.135\nwe get that from our kids all the time or\nour grandchildren in my case.\n\n358\n00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:33.289\nIt's like, why clean the dishes, they're\njust gonna be dirty again tomorrow.\n\n359\n00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.916\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n360\n00:20:33.916 --> 00:20:36.114\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why go clean the supply closet or\n\n361\n00:20:36.114 --> 00:20:38.025\nmy room, it's just gonna go back.\n\n362\n00:20:38.025 --> 00:20:41.085\nSo one of the reasons people don't\nbuy into our projects, its like, wow,\n\n363\n00:20:41.085 --> 00:20:42.445\nyou're gonna do all this work or\n\n364\n00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:46.575\nyou're gonna ask me to do all this work\nand then what the heck is gonna happen?\n\n365\n00:20:46.575 --> 00:20:49.015\nIt's just gonna go back to the way it was.\n\n366\n00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:53.660\nWell in control,\nit teaches us how to present things so\n\n367\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.764\nthat they're gonna be ongoing.\n\n368\n00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:55.267\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n369\n00:20:55.267 --> 00:20:57.021\nyou could show that sustainability,\nexactly.\n\n370\n00:20:57.021 --> 00:20:59.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly,\nit gives you tips on how to do that.\n\n371\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:04.143\nSo I think the DMAIC model, if you're lean\nand agile project manager There's a couple\n\n372\n00:21:04.143 --> 00:21:06.950\nof reasons why you wanna\nknow about the DMAIC.\n\n373\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.790\nOne you can very well be\nworking in an environment that\n\n374\n00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.290\nhas adopted the DMAIC model.\n\n375\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.250\nBecause it is becoming sick sigma and\nlink sick sigma are incredibly popular\n\n376\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.180\nmethodologies that companies\nhave embraced our military,\n\n377\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.300\nour hospital systems is just, It's crazy.\n\n378\n00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.600\nSo as a project manager, you may be\nworking in one of those phases and\n\n379\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.520\nyou certainly want to know\nhow those connect together.\n\n380\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.640\nAnd the other one is I just think it's\na good way if you're trying to get by in.\n\n381\n00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.180\nBecause if you start\nspeaking to someone and\n\n382\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.680\nyou can identify why are they\nnot buying into this?\n\n383\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.230\nDo they not feel like they have a choice?\n\n384\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.840\nDo they not feel it's sustainable?\n\n385\n00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.440\nDo they just not get what I have to say,\n\n386\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.280\nthe DMAIC model is filled with tools\nto fix that particular condition.\n\n387\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.290\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and also it kinda give\nus a little confidence and\n\n388\n00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:59.480\nyou as a project manager to say look,\nthey have a rigid structured plan here.\n\n389\n00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.460\nAt least they know where they\nwanna go with this project.\n\n390\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n391\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:09.489\nSo Cherokee, do we have time\nto discuss the [CROSSTALK] or\n\n392\n00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:13.690\ndo you want to-\n&gt;&gt; I've never seen the Agile methodology,\n\n393\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.120\nso I think I can't really give\na good judgment on the estimation.\n\n394\n00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.930\nLet's go ahead and pause and wrap up Peer.\n\n395\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.840\nAnd then we'll spend the next series\nintroducing the Agile method so\n\n396\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.460\nthat we can continue and make sure we\nhave enough time to cover it in detail.\n\n397\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.510\nHow does that sound?\n\n398\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.260\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great, Cherokee.\n\n399\n00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then for this particular\nepisode I'm gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n400\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.790\nAs your show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n401\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.800\nAnd this is Dr. Tara Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n402\n00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.148\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.210\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.990\nIf you've been following along, we've\nalready taken a look at our PBCA model and\n\n9\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.700\nwe also looked at our DMAIC model, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.810\nnow we have to go ahead and\ntake a look at our Agile methodology.\n\n11\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.510\nSo with us today in studios\nto help explain this\n\n12\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.820\nconcept is Dr Terra Vanzant Stern.\n\n13\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.610\nSo thank you for\nbeing with us today Doctor.\n\n14\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.860\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee.\n\n15\n00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.080\n&gt;&gt; So how does that sound?\n\n16\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.970\n&gt;&gt; That sounds perfect.\n\n17\n00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.770\nCan we go ahead and start?\n\n18\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's do it.\n\n19\n00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in our last sessions,\n\n20\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.910\nwe were talking about, and\nI'll go over to my slide deck.\n\n21\n00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.850\nIn our last sessions, we were talking\nabout the PDCA and the DMAIC model.\n\n22\n00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.830\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about the Agile Model.\n\n23\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.670\nNow, some of the Agile model, the biggest\npiece that we're gonna be talking about,\n\n24\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.040\nwill be when we go back to\nthe project life cycle.\n\n25\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.386\nIn the project life cycle remember\nthat's a composite that we built for\n\n26\n00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:15.677\nLean &amp; Agile Project Management that\nlooks at the project life cycle of\n\n27\n00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:21.250\nthe PMBOK and the PRINCE2 and\nthe ISO standard looks at.\n\n28\n00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.860\nWe took a composite and so\n\n29\n00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.930\nit looks little different than\nany one of those individually.\n\n30\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd there's a lot of things that\nare different in Agile in the start part,\n\n31\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.430\nif you're looking at that model.\n\n32\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.990\nSo that's where we'll be covering a lot of\nAgile, but I wanna briefly go over It now.\n\n33\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n34\n00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.620\n&gt;&gt; So the first thing is I\nwanna bring up the idea of\n\n35\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.200\na traditional project management,\na traditional project manager's role.\n\n36\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.280\nSo this would be, if you were\nlooking at those three bodies of\n\n37\n00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.550\nknowledge, PMBOK, I have to keep\nsaying them to myself, too, sometimes.\n\n38\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.250\nThe PMBOK, PRINCE2, and the ISO standard.\n\n39\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.160\nThis is the way they typically\nsee a project manager.\n\n40\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.750\nAnd probably the biggest thing\nthat I see that's different in\n\n41\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620\nAgile is the way we look\nat Agile project managers.\n\n42\n00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.400\nSo I just wanna remind you,\na traditional project manager leads,\n\n43\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.720\nthey plan, they define, they complete.\n\n44\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.560\nThey take a bit of a martial like role.\n\n45\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.120\nSo if I'm the project manager,\nI may have a project\n\n46\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.430\ndeputy role in a really large project,\nand they do all the admin parts.\n\n47\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.920\nBut as a project manager,\n\n48\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.660\nI'm pretty much, after I've developed\nthe project, walking around and\n\n49\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.100\nmaking sure everyone's doing their job and\nkind of checking in with people.\n\n50\n00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.570\nSo I'm sort of like the supervisor or\nthe marshal of the project.\n\n51\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.840\nIn Agile,\n\n52\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.680\nthe Agile project manager's role takes\nmore of that servant leadership role.\n\n53\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.320\nI don't know,\nthe idea is that I'm there to help you.\n\n54\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.260\nSo I know you're looking at the slide but\njust kind of in a conceptual way,\n\n55\n00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.110\nI bring people into meetings, and\nI'm looking for the obstacles.\n\n56\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.900\nAnd as the project manager, which is also\ncalled the Scrum Master, what I'm doing,\n\n57\n00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.050\nis I'm listening to what you have to say,\nand I'm trying to remove those obstacles.\n\n58\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, is there anything that I can\ndo to help kind of concept [CROSSTALK].\n\n59\n00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.329\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n60\n00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.874\nAnd so that's probably the major\ndifference between the traditional\n\n61\n00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:27.415\nproject manager and the Scrum Master or\n\n62\n00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:31.150\nthe project manager as we\ntalk about them in Agile.\n\n63\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.501\nAnd it's huge because it\nchanges the entire [CROSSTALK].\n\n64\n00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:35.435\n&gt;&gt; Dynamic in the field.\n\n65\n00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:38.067\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n66\n00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:39.940\n&gt;&gt; Lead by example, right?\n\n67\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.810\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so here are some of\nthe things that the Scrum Master role.\n\n68\n00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.430\nI'll go back up just very quickly.\n\n69\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.750\nRemember this is the traditional\nProject Manager role, so\n\n70\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.840\njust kind of look at that for a second.\n\n71\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.610\nIn your student packet there is\na copy of this particular handout and\n\n72\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.090\nthen if I'm looking at\nthe Scrum Master role,\n\n73\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.680\nwhat are some of the things\nthat kind of jump out at you?\n\n74\n00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.320\nAnything interesting?\n\n75\n00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.330\n&gt;&gt; Let me take a look here.\n\n76\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.390\nRemoves impediments,\nwe just stated that, and.\n\n77\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.390\n&gt;&gt; Which is huge.\n\n78\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.770\nI mean, that's a big difference.\n\n79\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.630\nIn a typical project manager role,\n\n80\n00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.130\nyou're expected to just do\nwhat the project manager says.\n\n81\n00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.340\n&gt;&gt; Also shield the team from\nexternal interferences.\n\n82\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.660\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that cool?\n\n83\n00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.130\nI mean one of the things that I\nreally love about the take on\n\n84\n00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.060\nproject managers in the Agile environment\nis they're there to protect us.\n\n85\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.930\nThey're more like a mom.\n\n86\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.370\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; I like it too.\n\n87\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.140\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of what we do here\nat ITProTV, although I've never,\n\n88\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.130\nlike you said before, sometimes you'll\nbe familiar with these concepts, but\n\n89\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.440\nyou might not know exactly\nwhat they're called.\n\n90\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.900\nBut every day we have our standup,\nand it's just a brief, basically\n\n91\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.410\nwe're telling our Scrum Master any kind\nof obstacles that we may be facing.\n\n92\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.430\nAnd then they, as cumulatively as a group,\nyou can add any kind of suggestions or\n\n93\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.560\nhelp that you want to go ahead and\nthrow out there, so it's pretty cool.\n\n94\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.840\n&gt;&gt; I do, I think that's just awesome.\n\n95\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.190\nAnother thing that the Scrum Master does\nis that they're sort of responsible in\n\n96\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.280\nan informal kind of way of helping\nyou identify your competencies.\n\n97\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.960\nWhen you are in an Agile environment,\nit's not necessarily,\n\n98\n00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.150\nyou don't always have\na specific job description.\n\n99\n00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.400\nWe're always kinda trying to\nbe a little bit more flexible.\n\n100\n00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.350\nI'm gonna compare this again against\na traditional project management role.\n\n101\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.240\nYou come in,\nyou have a set of responsibilities,\n\n102\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.388\nthings that you're supposed to do.\n\n103\n00:05:40.388 --> 00:05:45.280\nIn the Agile environment, as teams start\nworking together, they start realizing\n\n104\n00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.910\ntheir individual competencies,\nand sometime people share work.\n\n105\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.120\nThe other thing that's different in\nan Agile environment is in the project\n\n106\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.550\nmanagement environment there's the\ntendency to roll out the project plan and\n\n107\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.180\neveryone kind of marches to that song,\nright?\n\n108\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.170\nIn the Agile project manager environment,\n\n109\n00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.560\nwe're always reassessing\nevery couple of weeks.\n\n110\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.080\nWhich we'll talk about when we talk about\nselection in the project management\n\n111\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.000\nlife cycle.\n\n112\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.020\nOr the project life cycle, rather.\n\n113\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.740\nSo I'm always looking to\nmassage it to make it better,\n\n114\n00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.300\nmake sure that people\nare working together.\n\n115\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.910\nThere's a lot more talking in\nthe Agile environments as well,\n\n116\n00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.890\na lot more face to face.\n\n117\n00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.490\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so someone would step in if\nthey saw that you were struggling\n\n118\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.070\nwith something.\n\n119\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.817\nIt's not necessarily, that's your role.\n\n120\n00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:30.810\nYou should be responsible for that.\n\n121\n00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n122\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.980\nAnd probably that's one of my favorite\nthings about the Agile environment.\n\n123\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.420\nIs that it's everyone pitches in.\n\n124\n00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.500\nI do like that piece of it.\n\n125\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.340\nSo the other thing is our teaming.\n\n126\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.050\nNow in project management,\n\n127\n00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.780\nwe are encouraged to have\ncross functional teams, right?\n\n128\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.370\nHowever a lot of times those team, the\npeople in the cross functional team may be\n\n129\n00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.020\nworking independently, so they go away.\n\n130\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.220\nAnd the way we work in teams a lot\nof times in project management,\n\n131\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.790\nin traditional project management is\npeople come and they give their report.\n\n132\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.050\nI'm sure you've been in meetings where,\nthe person facilitating the meeting,\n\n133\n00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.360\nat the end of the meeting, has everyone\ngo around and say a last word.\n\n134\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.570\nSo, it's sort of very organized,\nthere's an agenda.\n\n135\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.300\nWe try to stick to\nthe agenda with our teams.\n\n136\n00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.540\nAnd in an Agile project environment,\nalthough there is some structure and,\n\n137\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.690\nespecially in those stand up\nmeetings that you were referring to.\n\n138\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.720\nThere's a certain method\nof how we're gonna report,\n\n139\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.500\nhowever, there's some flexibility with\nteam meetings where if something comes up\n\n140\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.330\nthat's of concern, or\nthere's a lot more talk about next steps.\n\n141\n00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.090\nSo in a typical traditional\nproject manager meeting, agenda,\n\n142\n00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.350\nwe're gonna stick to the agenda.\n\n143\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.480\nIn fact, sometimes you even have\na timekeeper that says, okay,\n\n144\n00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.730\nwe're done with that topic.\n\n145\n00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.685\nAnd it doesn't really matter if\nyou're done with that topic or not.\n\n146\n00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:54.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's kinda funny.\n\n147\n00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:58.643\nWe have a consultant that comes in\nevery few months here at ITProTV.\n\n148\n00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:02.017\nAnd because they hadn't been here in\na while, they said, you know what?\n\n149\n00:08:02.017 --> 00:08:03.807\nI'm, and we are allotted 30 seconds\n\n150\n00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:04.847\nto go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:08:04.847 --> 00:08:05.704\n&gt;&gt; And give our\n\n152\n00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:07.940\nlittle spiel in the mornings.\n\n153\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.130\nAnd they said, I've been saving mine up.\n\n154\n00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.843\nSo I get extra time to talk here.\n\n155\n00:08:11.843 --> 00:08:13.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's kinda funny that way.\n\n156\n00:08:13.223 --> 00:08:15.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very structured.\n\n157\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.750\nSo if you're in a typical\nproject management environment,\n\n158\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.400\nyou're looking at a lot of structure,\nagendas, timing, that type of thing.\n\n159\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.310\nIn an Agile environment, and there's\nnot as many rules in Agile, so you're\n\n160\n00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.450\ngonna see different kind of manifestations\nof how those teams are handled.\n\n161\n00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.960\nBut basically it's all about being\nmore flexible, sharing responsibility,\n\n162\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.180\ndoing a lot more face\nto face communications.\n\n163\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.210\nSo the project management model is\njust a little bit different than\n\n164\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.880\nwhat we're used to.\n\n165\n00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure many of you guys can relate to\nmeetings that have just kind of dragged\n\n166\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.750\non and on\n&gt;&gt; And yeah they can extend past that\n\n167\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.900\nspecified duration but\nnot past the point of being productive.\n\n168\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.690\nThat's the key thing, right.\n\n169\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n170\n00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.270\nSo in a perfect world,\nif I'm a traditional project manager,\n\n171\n00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.160\nI have a cross functional team.\n\n172\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:09.340\nAnd I have a project manager, I have\na project deputy, a subject matter expert.\n\n173\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.840\nI obviously have a client that I'm working\nfor, and the client could be internal or\n\n174\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.440\nexternal.\n\n175\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.520\nNow depending on the type of company,\n\n176\n00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.550\nin a traditional project\nmanagement environment.\n\n177\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.790\nI could have something called a PMO\nwhich is a Project Management Office.\n\n178\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.270\nNow, PMO's, according to the people\nthat support that which would be\n\n179\n00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:35.080\nnot all three bodies of knowledge\neven support a PMO, but\n\n180\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.730\nin the ones that do support a PMO, it can\nkinda go in two different directions.\n\n181\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.940\nSo a PMO can be sort of the administrative\nplace that's collecting all of the project\n\n182\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.260\ninformation, or\nit can be a group of project\n\n183\n00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.490\nmanagers that are used to go out\ninto other areas of the company.\n\n184\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.730\nSo even within a PMO,\nit could be kind of administrative or\n\n185\n00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.060\nit could be the type of\nsituation where you've\n\n186\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.990\ngot these resources,\nthese project manager resources.\n\n187\n00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.880\nSo different departments would come and\ntake advantage of that, right.\n\n188\n00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n189\n00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:13.280\n&gt;&gt; So in an Agile environment, because\nthat's kind of what I'm trying to do as,\n\n190\n00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.040\nwe're more familiar with traditional\nproject management, or at least,\n\n191\n00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.840\nbecause those three bodies of knowledge\npush traditional project management.\n\n192\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.920\nThat's why I keep comparing those two.\n\n193\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.540\nSo in an Agile environment,\nthere's very rarely a PMO.\n\n194\n00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.210\nSo that's something to\nkind of keep in mind.\n\n195\n00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.930\nEveryone's working together.\n\n196\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.700\nThere's not like this one department\nthat's in charge of all the projects.\n\n197\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.400\nSo that's one difference.\n\n198\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.660\nAnother difference is\nthe rolls a lot of time, and\n\n199\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.318\nI did mention this before,\nare not as clearly defined.\n\n200\n00:10:45.318 --> 00:10:49.268\nIn traditional project management,\nI am the project manager,\n\n201\n00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:53.060\nyou are the deputy,\nyou are the subject matter expert.\n\n202\n00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.600\nWhereas in the Agile environments\nthose lines can be a little blurred.\n\n203\n00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.560\nI might have a subject matter expertise\nin a particular area that you don't and\n\n204\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.390\nit's okay to offer that up.\n\n205\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.250\nSo again, what I would say in the Agile\nproject management environment,\n\n206\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.980\nwe're gonna learn a lot more when\nwe go through those actual phases,\n\n207\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.950\nhow Agile handles things as opposed\nto traditional project management.\n\n208\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.360\nBut I would say the word that I\nwant you to take away, is flexible.\n\n209\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Very, very flexible.\n\n210\n00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.560\nSo, some people say,\nwell why wouldn't everybody just be Agile?\n\n211\n00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.830\nAnd that's because if it's\na very large project,\n\n212\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.500\nif the project is very timely,\nif the project is related to compliance.\n\n213\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.310\nThere's lots of different reasons why\nwe're gonna fall back on traditional\n\n214\n00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.610\nproject management.\n\n215\n00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.890\nWhat I think I want our students\nto know is that it's an option.\n\n216\n00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.370\nAll projects don't have to be handled\nin a traditional way to be successful.\n\n217\n00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.430\nSo both groups, Agile project managers,\nas well as regular project managers\n\n218\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.410\nstill kind of believe in\nthat four stages of a team,\n\n219\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.130\nwhich was introduced by Bruce Tuckman\nin 1965, if you can believe it.\n\n220\n00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.300\nBut those four phases are forming,\nstorming, norming, and\n\n221\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.990\nthe one that's not listed\nthere is performing, right?\n\n222\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.670\nSo the performing is different.\n\n223\n00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.970\nThe first three are the same.\n\n224\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.041\nForming, I bring everyone together.\n\n225\n00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:17.560\nStorming, there's usually\ngonna be some kind of\n\n226\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.540\ndiscussion about what we're doing and\nif there's not some kind of discussion,\n\n227\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.000\nit doesn't have to be crazy where\neverybody takes their dolls and go home.\n\n228\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.020\nAlthough, that does happen in teaming.\n\n229\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.440\nI'm sure a lot of you have been exposed\nto teams where everyone started fighting,\n\n230\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.450\nand it was just over.\n\n231\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.220\nIt's kinda sad.\n\n232\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n233\n00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:41.030\nAnd it's kind of that phase where people\njust naturally and intuitively can tell\n\n234\n00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.620\nwho's the alpha or who am I gonna work\nwell with or who am I gonna listen to.\n\n235\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.800\nAnd it's just building and establishing\nthat relationship before you get started.\n\n236\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.010\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n237\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:54.770\nAnd then the next thing that happens\nif you're following these four stages.\n\n238\n00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.960\nIs if the very first thing that happens.\n\n239\n00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.240\nYou form and\nthen you might have some storming period.\n\n240\n00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.190\nAnd if you're the project manager and\nyou're not having some storming or\n\n241\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.950\nsome feedback.\n\n242\n00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.130\nAnd people are just like,\nlet's just do that.\n\n243\n00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.050\nThat could be a red flag, right.\n\n244\n00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.950\nSo after you get past that, the norming.\n\n245\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.280\nAnd that's where everybody\nkind of kisses and makes up.\n\n246\n00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.020\nAnd everyone's okay again.\n\n247\n00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.450\nBut you might still not be performing.\n\n248\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.940\nSo, performing in the traditional project\nenvironment would be, I'm going to\n\n249\n00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.090\nnow subscribe to the WBS, I'm gonna just\nstick with this project until it's over.\n\n250\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.150\nBut, forming on the Agile side,\nthere's still a lot of discussion, and\n\n251\n00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.755\nthat's the other thing, is that even\nthough both recognize the four phases of\n\n252\n00:13:36.755 --> 00:13:40.200\na team, it's only those first three\nphases that you're seeing right now.\n\n253\n00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.930\nForming, storming,\nnorming that are the same.\n\n254\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.250\nBecause in a traditional\nproject management,\n\n255\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.960\nonce I agree I'm gonna perform,\nI'm basically saying,\n\n256\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.395\nI pledge allegiance to\nthe work breakdown structure.\n\n257\n00:13:52.395 --> 00:13:53.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n258\n00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.240\nWhereas in the Agile environment,\nI'm actually still communicating,\n\n259\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.040\nI'm still talking, I'm still\nchunking out the project in small.\n\n260\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.500\nSo my performing, part of my performing\nis still massive communication.\n\n261\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.520\nWhereas in traditional project management,\nthat communication takes place in\n\n262\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.070\nthe first three phases and\nthen you're kind of done for a while.\n\n263\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.220\nDoes that make sense?\n\n264\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n265\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.353\n&gt;&gt; Both Agile and traditional project\nmanagements have a fondness for\n\n266\n00:14:19.353 --> 00:14:24.280\na piece of literature that was developed\nin 2002 called the 5 dysfunctions\n\n267\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.000\nof a team\n&gt;&gt; So if you're not familiar with that,\n\n268\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.440\nwe're just gonna briefly talk\nabout the 5 dysfunctions because\n\n269\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.260\nsometimes in Agile environments,\nthey do lunch and learns over this.\n\n270\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that's something I was\ngonna mention because we see more\n\n271\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.208\nof a time constraint with Agile,\nexcuse me,\n\n272\n00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:47.760\nAgile projects,\nsometimes during the storming or\n\n273\n00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.640\neven during that time frame, you might\ngo on a little, I don't know maybe\n\n274\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.700\nlike a field trip, so that you're removing\nthe pressure of your work environment.\n\n275\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.690\nBut in an environment like this, you\nmight not have the extra time to go and\n\n276\n00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.110\nhave that fun, or just that meeting phase.\n\n277\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.904\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n278\n00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:08.730\nAnd I think back to that.\n\n279\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.440\nThe four phases of the team.\n\n280\n00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.120\nI think that's the whole thing is that in\nAgile environments they consider stuff\n\n281\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.700\nlike that, whereas in project management\nenvironments it's really kind of\n\n282\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.950\nthe communication plan is pretty set like\nwhen she start entering in the project.\n\n283\n00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.250\nIt's just, we're not gonna be as creative.\n\n284\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.500\nWe're just gonna subscribe to [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so like a lunch and\n\n285\n00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.630\nlearn would be an acceptable form\nof during that storming phase-\n\n286\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n287\n00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Something, okay.\n\n288\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n289\n00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.370\nAnd so, and like I said,\nin some Agile environments.\n\n290\n00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.889\nEven though this literature is from 2002,\nit has been updated multiple times.\n\n291\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.502\nBut when we're looking at\nthe 5 dysfunctions of a team,\n\n292\n00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:52.552\ntraditional project managers\nstudy this as well.\n\n293\n00:15:52.552 --> 00:15:55.883\nSo outside those three\nbodies of knowledge,\n\n294\n00:15:55.883 --> 00:16:00.190\nthis is like a very popular\nwork if I'm having to do teams.\n\n295\n00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.640\nSo absence of trust is the first one.\n\n296\n00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.070\nAnd I know you can read this bullets,\nso I'm just doing the highlights.\n\n297\n00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.438\nFear of conflict, lack of commitment,\n\n298\n00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:15.890\navoidance of accountability,\nand inattention to results.\n\n299\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:21.370\nSo if I'm trying to\nmake my team strong and\n\n300\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.830\nI'm the project manager, the nice thing to\nknow is that if I go into an environment\n\n301\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.400\nwhere they're split, like some\nare traditional and some are agile.\n\n302\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.080\nAgain, happening all the time with\nglobal mergers and acquisitions.\n\n303\n00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.060\nThat was a hard thing to say,\nwith our global mergers and\n\n304\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.360\nacquisitions, all the time\nyou got blended groups.\n\n305\n00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.140\nEven in IT, you've got people that\nare working on different platforms in\n\n306\n00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.860\naddition to working on different models.\n\n307\n00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.270\n&gt;&gt; And even different standard\noperating procedures,\n\n308\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.740\ncoming from their different backgrounds.\n\n309\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.182\nTheir company didn't do things\nthe way that the new company does.\n\n310\n00:16:54.182 --> 00:16:56.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So it's gonna be a challenge at times.\n\n311\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.560\n&gt;&gt; So this is like,\nthese five dysfunctions,\n\n312\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.420\nthis is a safe place as\na project manager to go.\n\n313\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.210\nBecause everyone seems to like this work,\nand, like I said,\n\n314\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.140\neven though it came out in 2002,\nthere's a lot more updated models.\n\n315\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.860\nThe thing that I think that's\ninteresting about the 5 dysfunctions is,\n\n316\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:19.850\nthere's a couple of things there that go\nback to old TQM, Total Quality Management.\n\n317\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.792\nThat we've been saying this for\na really, really long time so,\n\n318\n00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:26.500\nit's just something to kinda keep in mind.\n\n319\n00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:33.995\nSo when we're looking at Scrum teams,\nwhen we're looking at a project\n\n320\n00:17:33.995 --> 00:17:38.640\nmanagement team, it's almost\nlike whoever we can get, right?\n\n321\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.470\nFrom these different\ncross-functional areas.\n\n322\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.820\nWhen we're looking at a Scrum team,\nit's usually five to ten people,\n\n323\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.910\nthat's like optimum.\n\n324\n00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.205\nAnd this, remember, in a perfect world.\n\n325\n00:17:47.205 --> 00:17:48.940\nCross-functional.\n\n326\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:54.064\nSo I want to have, and I would think some\nagile people might disagree with this.\n\n327\n00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:58.170\nBut I want some quality auditors\non my team, those type of people.\n\n328\n00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.260\nMembers of the Scrum team\nare supposed to be full-time.\n\n329\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:08.260\nSo in a traditional project\nmanagement environment,\n\n330\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.340\na lot of times they're matrixed.\n\n331\n00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.390\nAnd so that means I have someone\nthat's working on my team, but\n\n332\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.590\nthey're dedicated to other things, okay?\n\n333\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.915\nSo Scrum teams,\nin an ideal perfect environment,\n\n334\n00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:22.174\nthey're dedicated to\nthat particular project.\n\n335\n00:18:22.174 --> 00:18:24.700\nTeams are self-organizing.\n\n336\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.048\nWhen you're thinking about\nself-organizing teams Kind of\n\n337\n00:18:29.048 --> 00:18:32.125\nthink you can vote someone off the island.\n\n338\n00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:36.430\n[LAUGH] They might need to go be\nsomeone on someone else's team.\n\n339\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.450\nAgain, in traditional project management,\nand like I said the reason I\n\n340\n00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.920\nkeep comparing it back to that is the\nthree primary project management bodies of\n\n341\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.320\nknowledge support traditional over\nagile project management, right?\n\n342\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.190\nAnd so in a traditional project management\nenvironment you're kinda stuck.\n\n343\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.230\nThe people you have on your team are the\npeople you're gonna have on your team.\n\n344\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.286\nThere's really not a lot of flexibility\nto vote people off the island, or maybe-\n\n345\n00:19:01.286 --> 00:19:01.799\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\n\n346\n00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:05.566\nif you see that two people really are\ncohesive, and maybe they just bring it out\n\n347\n00:19:05.566 --> 00:19:09.470\nto others, they make each other shine,\nthen why not put them together, right?\n\n348\n00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.665\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then membership can\njust change only between Sprints,\n\n349\n00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:15.384\nwhich we'll be talking about\nin the selection part of the-\n\n350\n00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:16.688\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n351\n00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:22.789\n&gt;&gt; So, pretty much, you're on that team,\nyou're dedicated to that team, right?\n\n352\n00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:25.484\nBut in-between you can do it.\n\n353\n00:19:25.484 --> 00:19:29.463\nAll right, so we talked a lot\nabout agile project management\n\n354\n00:19:29.463 --> 00:19:32.282\nversus traditional project management.\n\n355\n00:19:32.282 --> 00:19:35.286\nSo I think I'd like to end\nup with this schematic.\n\n356\n00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:38.370\nBecause this gives a good comparison,\nagile, traditional.\n\n357\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.840\nSo the first one says, Focus on\ncustomer satisfaction and interaction.\n\n358\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.370\nThe traditional project managements\nhas Focus on plans and artifacts.\n\n359\n00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.700\nNow, artifacts are things\nthat are left over, but\n\n360\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.030\nfocusing on the plan is not a bad thing.\n\n361\n00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.056\nWould you agree, Cherokee?\n\n362\n00:19:55.056 --> 00:19:58.447\n&gt;&gt; Right you have to keep that in mind,\nthat's what your goal is, right?\n\n363\n00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.462\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but sometimes we're so\n\n364\n00:20:00.462 --> 00:20:04.290\nmarried to the plan that we forget\nabout customer satisfaction.\n\n365\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:09.080\nSo when we say agile versus traditional\nwe're not saying good versus bad.\n\n366\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.510\nAnd keep in mind the bodies of knowledge\nsupport traditional over agile.\n\n367\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.600\nSo we've got a lot of supporters\nof that traditional thing.\n\n368\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.130\nIt's just that just agile is looking\nat it through a different lens.\n\n369\n00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.950\nI will say that lean project management,\n\n370\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.930\nbecause you could be studying just lean\nproject management, not lean and agile.\n\n371\n00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.130\nLean has a closer alliance with agile\n\n372\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.790\nthan it does with traditional\nproject management, if that helps.\n\n373\n00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.730\nOkay, so the next one,\nResponse to change via adaptive action.\n\n374\n00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.880\nSo in the traditional project\nmanagement environment,\n\n375\n00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.120\nif something goes wrong,\nwe have a tendency,\n\n376\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.130\nif you're looking at that second column,\nto do a corrective action procedure.\n\n377\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.850\nAnd in fact, a lot of times it's\ncalled a change order, right?\n\n378\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:02.086\nSo in the agile environment,\nyou're a little bit more able to adapt,\n\n379\n00:21:02.086 --> 00:21:05.657\nas opposed to,\nI'm gonna file a change order.\n\n380\n00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:06.690\n&gt;&gt; Getting the approval.\n\n381\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna get the approval.\n\n382\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.400\nI can do a little bit more\nchanging on the fly, and\n\n383\n00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.490\nin some cases that's really a good deal.\n\n384\n00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.350\nWe don't have to look at all of them.\n\n385\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.800\nThis is a handout that you're going\nto get in your student package.\n\n386\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.560\nBut I'd like to look at a couple of more.\n\n387\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.160\nIs there anything there that\nlooks interesting to you?\n\n388\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Let's see.\n\n389\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:28.744\nWe've got Customer prioritized, time-boxed\ndelivery, over Manager negotiated.\n\n390\n00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:33.708\nSo it looks like, under that bullet point,\nthat the customer does have a bit\n\n391\n00:21:33.708 --> 00:21:37.913\nof a input as far as timeline,\nand how things will be delivered.\n\n392\n00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:38.877\nWhat else?\n\n393\n00:21:38.877 --> 00:21:42.416\nCollaboration on self-disciplined and\nself-organizing team,\n\n394\n00:21:42.416 --> 00:21:46.710\nversus a hierarchical, top-down control,\nthat traditional style.\n\n395\n00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.925\nWe also see a Minimal set\nof context-sensitive,\n\n396\n00:21:50.925 --> 00:21:56.000\ngenerative practices,\nversus Prescriptive, heavyweight methods.\n\n397\n00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.540\nSo there's definitely a difference there.\n\n398\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:04.340\nAnd then we also see, on the agile side,\nEssential, or value-focused metrics.\n\n399\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.139\nWhereas on the traditional side we see\nthose Non-value added controls, so.\n\n400\n00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:11.268\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nit happens in project management,\n\n401\n00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:15.970\nfrequently about, there's a report\nthat we always do on Friday, right?\n\n402\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.280\nAnd so it's harder for\ntraditional project management to let go\n\n403\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.730\nof some of those non-value added metrics,\nit's just harder.\n\n404\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.131\nNow this schematic, again,\nis kind of indicating good/bad.\n\n405\n00:22:27.131 --> 00:22:31.721\nAnd I need you to remember that\nit's just a different lens, right?\n\n406\n00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:35.710\nAnd there really are projects\nthat can't be agile.\n\n407\n00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:38.220\nWe can still use some of the agile\ntools that we're gonna learn.\n\n408\n00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.640\nAnd we can still kind of\nadopt some of those concepts.\n\n409\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.800\nBut there's a lot of times when we're\nin a compliance environment, and\n\n410\n00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.340\nwe have to do traditional.\n\n411\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:53.610\nOr the project is so large, we can't\nreally afford a lot of flexibility.\n\n412\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, well thank you for\nexplaining the agile methodology.\n\n413\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.054\nThat was actually the first time I've\never formally taken a look at that.\n\n414\n00:22:59.054 --> 00:23:01.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I appreciate that very much.\n\n415\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.670\nAnd thank you guys for\ntuning in and watching.\n\n416\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.110\nDon't go anywhere, because we have\na lot more information headed your way.\n\n417\n00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.070\nI think we'll be looking\nat why projects fail.\n\n418\n00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.570\nSo get comfortable, stay tuned.\n\n419\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.380\nBut for this episode,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n420\n00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.380\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n421\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.070\n&gt;&gt;

Now there's certain things that\n\n17\n00:00:57.984 --> 00:01:03.384\nare given, a lot of times projects failed\nbecause of those triple constraints.\n\n18\n00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:08.152\nNow, triple constraints in project\nmanagement gets a little confusing\n\n19\n00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:12.470\nbecause not everyone agrees on\nwhat the triple constraints are.\n\n20\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.940\nHowever, most people will say time,\nmoney, and resources, right?\n\n21\n00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.880\nAnd sometimes they'll say quality or\nscope and\n\n22\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.410\nthen that's five triple constraints,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.350\nBut a lot of times it's related\nto things such as that, right?\n\n24\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.718\nBut sometimes there's certain\nthings that we need to consider.\n\n25\n00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:36.352\nFor example, architecture and design,\nconfiguration, how do the decision process\n\n26\n00:01:36.352 --> 00:01:41.927\nis making how that's going, how do people\nmake decisions, bad estimates, right?\n\n27\n00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:46.832\nSo that's a little different than money\nbecause my project could fail because of\n\n28\n00:01:46.832 --> 00:01:52.200\nmoney, time, or resources but if I made a\nbad judgement, I just made a bad estimate.\n\n29\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.104\nI see that it's slightly different,\nso it's still related to money and\n\n30\n00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:59.560\nthen not paying enough attention\nto the Theory of Constraints,\n\n31\n00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.480\nwhich we're also going to look at.\n\n32\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.624\n&gt;&gt; I guess it also depends on how\nbad of an estimate you've made.\n\n33\n00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:08.239\nIf you can compensate by kind\nof shifting your budget around,\n\n34\n00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.126\nmaybe it's not as noticeable.\n\n35\n00:02:10.126 --> 00:02:12.264\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n36\n00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:16.528\nSo even though it's still one of the\ntriple constraints, no matter what model\n\n37\n00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:20.980\nyou look at, people will say that\nthe reason projects fail is the money.\n\n38\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.771\nBut actually, a lot of studies have\nbeen done and projects that fail\n\n39\n00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:29.516\nhave more to do with the people [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; I could believe that.\n\n40\n00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.517\n&gt;&gt; Than the money.\n\n41\n00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:36.024\nSo one reason a project could fail\nis the architecture and design.\n\n42\n00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.711\nI actually think this is quite clever,\nbut I'm just showing you this\n\n43\n00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.286\npicture to give you an example of\nwhat architecture and design is.\n\n44\n00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:47.656\nSo one of the reasons projects\nfail is because of that, right?\n\n45\n00:02:47.656 --> 00:02:53.296\nAnd then configuration and\ninformation management,\n\n46\n00:02:53.296 --> 00:03:01.640\nwhat impact does what I have to do as a\nproject have over the entire organization?\n\n47\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.839\nSo, sometimes projects\nfail because of that.\n\n48\n00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:08.348\nSo I'm a project manager and\nI realize I'm in charge of a project that\n\n49\n00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:11.474\nis very dependent on architecture and\ndesign.\n\n50\n00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:15.182\nWell then, if I'm not an architecture and\ndesign person,\n\n51\n00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:20.311\nI'm just the project manager, I wanna go\nback and make sure that that looks okay.\n\n52\n00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:23.600\nAnd I want it tested out by some\nsubject matter experts, right?\n\n53\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.326\nConfiguration management and information\nmanagement has a little bit more\n\n54\n00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:31.866\nto do with just being aware\nof the other departments, and\n\n55\n00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:34.301\nother things that I'm impacting, and\n\n56\n00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:39.205\neven some of the software stuff that\nI'm putting into my department, right?\n\n57\n00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:41.705\nHow is that all interfacing,\ndoes that make sense?\n\n58\n00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:44.588\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just as long as we don't\nhave any compatibility conflicts,\n\n59\n00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:45.860\nis that what you're saying?\n\n60\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.795\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, in fact that's probably\neven a better way of saying it.\n\n61\n00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:54.002\nAnother reason projects fail is\nthe decision-making process.\n\n62\n00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.576\nAnd sometimes that's\ncalled the DM Process.\n\n63\n00:03:56.576 --> 00:04:00.290\nSo if I'm looking at this,\nI don't know what to do.\n\n64\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.834\n&gt;&gt; I guess I can stand there,\nand that really looks about it.\n\n65\n00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.909\n&gt;&gt; That's my choice, I can stop,\nbut where do I go, right?\n\n66\n00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.589\nSo, I wanna make sure that people\nare giving me clear directions.\n\n67\n00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.928\nSo when we talk about decisions,\n\n68\n00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:17.444\nthe outcome of the decision\nas a project manager.\n\n69\n00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:21.935\nI can make a decision but if people don't\nknow what to do with that decision,\n\n70\n00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:26.017\nif my decision is too complicated,\nthey're not gonna follow that.\n\n71\n00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:30.677\nSo, the decision making process as well\nas the way I delivered that decision,\n\n72\n00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:32.028\ndoes that make sense?\n\n73\n00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:33.380\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n74\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.889\n&gt;&gt; So another reason things fail\nis because of bad estimation.\n\n75\n00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.646\nNow, in one of the segments, we already\ncovered that a good estimating tool,\n\n76\n00:04:42.646 --> 00:04:45.891\nit's pretty much accepted\nby all project managers,\n\n77\n00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:49.012\nis that tool that I always\nhave to use my hands with.\n\n78\n00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:54.284\nIf I'm trying to estimate something,\nnow remember, history trumps everything.\n\n79\n00:04:54.284 --> 00:04:56.300\nIf I know how much it costs,\nI don't have to estimate, right?\n\n80\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.181\n&gt;&gt; Use that number.\n\n81\n00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:58.389\n&gt;&gt; I'm done.\n\n82\n00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.972\nBut if I'm trying to estimate a cost, what\nI would do is I would take the highest\n\n83\n00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:05.063\ncost and this also works with time.\n\n84\n00:05:05.063 --> 00:05:08.720\nBut I'd take the highest cost,\nthe lowest cost, and\n\n85\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.329\nthen four times the most likely cost.\n\n86\n00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.042\nNow I have six fingers up,\nnow I divide that number by six and\n\n87\n00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:20.300\nthat's gonna give me-\n&gt;&gt; An estimated, like a projection.\n\n88\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.774\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nnow we use estimates all the time.\n\n89\n00:05:22.774 --> 00:05:24.649\nSo let's say, for example,\n\n90\n00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.707\nI would like to turn one of my\nclosets into a wine cellar, right.\n\n91\n00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:32.011\nOkay, well,\nthat's kind of an odd request and\n\n92\n00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:35.490\nI might not know if I have\nenough budget to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.363\nSo I'm gonna go out to the community and\nsay look, this is what I have,\n\n94\n00:05:39.363 --> 00:05:42.265\nthis is what I wanna do,\ncan you give me an estimate?\n\n95\n00:05:42.265 --> 00:05:45.504\nAnd based on that estimate I'm\ngonna make a decision, right.\n\n96\n00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So if it's like crazy insane,\n\n97\n00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.864\nI'm probably gonna put it off for a while.\n\n98\n00:05:49.864 --> 00:05:52.341\nBut if it's something within my budget,\nI'm gonna move forward.\n\n99\n00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:58.348\nSo being able to budget things well\nis a core skill for project managers.\n\n100\n00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:02.356\nI think also you can go and\nlook at the mode.\n\n101\n00:06:02.356 --> 00:06:09.626\nThere are three measures of central\ntendency, median, mode and mean.\n\n102\n00:06:09.626 --> 00:06:11.660\nAnd mean is the one that\nwe work with all the time.\n\n103\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.253\n&gt;&gt; Average.\n&gt;&gt; That's an average, right.\n\n104\n00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:18.025\nBut in this case I might wanna go out,\nso mean is an average,\n\n105\n00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:22.426\nmean average and\nmean average all mean the same thing.\n\n106\n00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:25.630\nMedian would be that number\nthat's in the middle, right?\n\n107\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.233\nA mode would be the number\nthat happens the most often.\n\n108\n00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:33.779\nSo I have a tendency when I'm doing\ncost estimating to look at the mode.\n\n109\n00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.243\nWhat is most people charging for\nthat table?\n\n110\n00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:40.132\n&gt;&gt; Well, right, because geographically\nsomething may cost more in one area\n\n111\n00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:43.846\nthan it does in another, so you have\nto kind of keep that in mind as well.\n\n112\n00:06:43.846 --> 00:06:44.712\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n113\n00:06:44.712 --> 00:06:49.332\nSo one of the reasons projects fail\nis because of the bad money estimate.\n\n114\n00:06:49.332 --> 00:06:52.192\nBut we could also make\na bad time estimate.\n\n115\n00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:57.346\nAnd like I said, even though we did cover\nthat estimation formula in another series,\n\n116\n00:06:57.346 --> 00:06:59.363\nyou could use it for time as well.\n\n117\n00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:01.684\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every day I'm trying to estimate,\n\n118\n00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:04.465\nhow long is this concept\ngoing to take us to convey?\n\n119\n00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:08.506\nWe try to keep our shows in 30 minute\nsegments but as you guys already know,\n\n120\n00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:10.562\nit doesn't always work out that way.\n\n121\n00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:13.326\nSo really, it's kind of an art.\n\n122\n00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:15.831\nAfter a while,\nafter experience you get better at it, but\n\n123\n00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:17.378\nyou sometimes you just never know.\n\n124\n00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:21.199\n&gt;&gt; It is, again, just a core skill for\na project manager, but\n\n125\n00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:26.488\nit's one of the biggest reasons things\nfail, bad estimate, bad time estimate.\n\n126\n00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:30.967\nAnd remember, we discussed this in another\nsession, your baseline, what you tell\n\n127\n00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:35.340\npeople, this is how long it's going to\ntake and this is how much it's gonna cost.\n\n128\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.709\nAs soon as you come up with that line,\nas soon as you say that,\n\n129\n00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.548\nthat's what you're graded against.\n\n130\n00:07:42.548 --> 00:07:46.878\nEven if it's not fair, even if there's\nsome kind of weird thing that happens that\n\n131\n00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:48.398\nyou hadn't accounted for.\n\n132\n00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:53.130\nSo, another reason projects fail\nis something called constraints.\n\n133\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.379\nWe don't pay enough attention\nto the constraints.\n\n134\n00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:59.370\nNow a constraint is anything\nthat gets in our way.\n\n135\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.940\nTriple constraints, many time people, or\nif you're looking at a different model.\n\n136\n00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.690\nSomewhere in that model they're\nincluding scope and quality, right?\n\n137\n00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.070\nHowever, there are other\nareas of constraints, and\n\n138\n00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.170\nthat's what we're gonna talk about next.\n\n139\n00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.990\nTypically in project management,\nregardless if you're a traditional project\n\n140\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.350\nmanager or an agile project manager, this\nisn't something we really think about.\n\n141\n00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.140\nAnd so as a Lean and\nAgile project manager,\n\n142\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.720\ncuz this comes a little bit more from the\nLean side, this is a tip that we can use.\n\n143\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.480\nSo first I just wanna give credit,\nEli Goldratt was\n\n144\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.680\nthe person who came up with\na book called The Goal in 1992.\n\n145\n00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.740\nHe's passed a few years ago, but\n\n146\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.760\nthis book in 1992 is why we use terms like\nempowerment and those types of things.\n\n147\n00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.320\nHe wrote a novel about a man\nthat went to work and was\n\n148\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.090\nsubjected to a lot of different meetings\nand came up with those types of words.\n\n149\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.190\nBut one of the things that he did,\nI mean that's one of his biggest pieces,\n\n150\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.120\nsome of you may have read it, some of\nyou may be too young to have read it.\n\n151\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.460\nIt's still a good book.\n\n152\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.320\nIt's a little dated.\n\n153\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.400\nBut what I think is kind of interesting\nis terms we throw around all the time.\n\n154\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.620\nThese days kinda came from that work.\n\n155\n00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.540\n&gt;&gt; Like the win-win-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n\n156\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.268\n&gt;&gt; Team building.\n\n157\n00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, this type of things,\nthose are things that,\n\n158\n00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.538\nI mean I'm sure there were some people\nbefore '92 saying it, but after '92,\n\n159\n00:09:28.538 --> 00:09:32.730\nit became part of our vocabulary\nit's such a piece of our vocabulary.\n\n160\n00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.600\nNow we didn't always know\nwhere that originated.\n\n161\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.160\nSo this gentleman that came up with that\n\n162\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.940\nalso came up with the body of knowledge\ncalled the Theory of Constraints.\n\n163\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.250\nNow the types of constraints,\n\n164\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.170\nthis is the first thing that I think\nproject managers can benefit from\n\n165\n00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.650\nis that there's a lot more constraints\nthan we usually think about.\n\n166\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.560\nFor example, there's a market constraint.\n\n167\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.150\nThere's a capacity constraint.\n\n168\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.350\nMy process might not be capable of doing\nwhat you want me to do in this project.\n\n169\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.049\nThere could be a resource constraint\nthat goes back to those basic ones.\n\n170\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.540\nThere could be a supplier constraint.\n\n171\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.790\nNow, there is a tendency on the Lean side,\nnot so much on Agile, but\n\n172\n00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.160\non the Lean side to still\nrefer to vendors as suppliers.\n\n173\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.172\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But what I want you to kind of think\n\n174\n00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:24.860\nof as a supplier might be\njust someone that you're\n\n175\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.426\ndepending on to get-\n&gt;&gt; Internally.\n\n176\n00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:27.380\n&gt;&gt; Your work done.\n\n177\n00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.340\nExactly.\n\n178\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.040\nAnd the example I usually use is\nif you have to get a signature\n\n179\n00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.390\non something before you can move forward,\ntechnically they're your supplier.\n\n180\n00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n181\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.054\n&gt;&gt; However if we think more\nfrom a bigger deal as a vendor,\n\n182\n00:10:41.054 --> 00:10:46.013\nif I'm a project manager and I need\nnonhuman resources from a supplier, and\n\n183\n00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:49.669\nthey're not available,\nhey, that's a constraint.\n\n184\n00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:53.050\nAnd that's might not be something I\ngo into the project thinking about.\n\n185\n00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:59.880\nThe Lean and Agile project manager\nstarts thinking about their constraints\n\n186\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.160\nbefore the project even gets started.\n\n187\n00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.400\nSo here's another one with finance.\n\n188\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.180\nAnd again remember finance\n\n189\n00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.000\nis part of that triple constraints when\nwe're thinking time, money, resources.\n\n190\n00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.070\nKnowledge or competence, and\nthis one always kinda thrills me.\n\n191\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:22.080\nDo I have a knowledge constraint,\nlike people are just not that smart?\n\n192\n00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.350\nDo I have a competency constraint?\n\n193\n00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.660\nLike there are people who.\n\n194\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.400\nAnd this could run the gamut from they\ndon't understand to they just don't care.\n\n195\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.090\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n196\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.259\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n197\n00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:36.004\n&gt;&gt; And so finally a policy constraint.\n\n198\n00:11:36.004 --> 00:11:37.660\nCould I have a policy constraint?\n\n199\n00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.008\nSo I've got this really great idea, but we\nhave a policy against doing that, right?\n\n200\n00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:42.537\n&gt;&gt; It's prohibiting.\n\n201\n00:11:42.537 --> 00:11:44.280\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n202\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:51.240\nSo, as I'm going through my project,\nmy goal is to get the project done, right?\n\n203\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.190\nAnd I've created, let's say in this case,\nI've created my project plan.\n\n204\n00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.556\nI wanna finish.\n\n205\n00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:02.285\nThe Lean and Agile project manager\nsits down and thinks about these\n\n206\n00:12:02.285 --> 00:12:07.146\nconstraints before they move forward,\nwhereas in traditional project management,\n\n207\n00:12:07.146 --> 00:12:11.310\nwe kinda have the tendency when\nthey come up, we deal with them.\n\n208\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.029\nAnd guess what, if we're dealing with\na constraint that we weren't anticipating,\n\n209\n00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:18.180\nit can push our project off, right?\n\n210\n00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.130\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n&gt;&gt; Our timeline, our cost, so\n\n211\n00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.381\nthinking about these\nconstraints is really huge.\n\n212\n00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:28.734\nNow, the other thing that Eli talks\nabout that's good for the Lean and\n\n213\n00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:34.670\nAgile project manager, is this whole\nconcept of uncertainty, right?\n\n214\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.330\nSo what are we gonna do if\nsomething unplanned happens?\n\n215\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.420\nNow an example of planning for\n\n216\n00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.140\nuncertainty would be let's\nsay I have a project budget.\n\n217\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.301\nI might go ahead and\n\n218\n00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:51.317\ngive you permission to spend up to $300\nwithout coming to consult me, right?\n\n219\n00:12:51.317 --> 00:12:54.420\nSo there might be something\nout there that comes up.\n\n220\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.160\nI don't want you having to come to\nme from [CROSSTALK] Exactly and so\n\n221\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.590\nthat's another thing.\n\n222\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.802\nThe Lean and Agile project manager wants\nto recognize that there are probably\n\n223\n00:13:03.802 --> 00:13:05.485\nthings, I mean it's highly,\n\n224\n00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:10.310\nhighly unlikely that you're gonna do\na project without a constraint coming up.\n\n225\n00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.320\nSo if you can talk through those\nconstraints before you even start\n\n226\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.830\nthe project that's a good thing, right?\n\n227\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.220\n&gt;&gt; It's very hard to be able to foresee\nall the different possibilities that could\n\n228\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.790\narise within your project.\n\n229\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.497\nBut that's why certain people\nget paid the big bucks, right?\n\n230\n00:13:24.497 --> 00:13:25.265\nIt's just from experience and\nunderstanding\n\n231\n00:13:25.265 --> 00:13:27.498\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n232\n00:13:27.498 --> 00:13:29.593\n&gt;&gt; Being able to see\nthings from another view.\n\n233\n00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:31.858\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\none of the things that I think is so\n\n234\n00:13:31.858 --> 00:13:35.534\ninteresting about Eli's work for\nthe Lean and Agile project manager,\n\n235\n00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:38.779\nOne of the things I think is\ninteresting is that, we don't even\n\n236\n00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:43.160\nspend time talking about normal things\nthat could go wrong with our project.\n\n237\n00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.580\nNow, we covered a couple of them,\narchitecture and design and configuration.\n\n238\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.720\nThose types of things.\n\n239\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.580\nBut even simple things like,\n\n240\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.880\nwe just don't get along with\nthe people that we have to work with.\n\n241\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.760\nI mean we don't even spend\ntime talking about that.\n\n242\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.110\nSo Eli kind of forces our hand.\n\n243\n00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.320\nIf we wanna be Lean and Agile why not\ndiscuss all of this stuff up front.\n\n244\n00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.030\nWe know we're gonna have\nan element of uncertainty.\n\n245\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:13.098\nOne of my favorite parts of Eli's work is\nthe concept of exploiting our constraints.\n\n246\n00:14:13.098 --> 00:14:15.200\nAnd so if we exploit our constraints,\n\n247\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.980\nwhat that means is that someone throws\nsomething at us and we try to figure out\n\n248\n00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.260\nhow can we do something really cool\nwith that thing that we've been given.\n\n249\n00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.130\nSo, for example, when you're designing\nprograms such as this, if you wanna stay\n\n250\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:33.570\nendorsed by the universities and\njust different association entities,\n\n251\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.720\nthey're always giving you one more\nrequirement, one more requirement.\n\n252\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.135\nAnd we used to, at SSD Global Solutions,\n\n253\n00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:44.210\ngirl I can't believe In order to get\nthis endorsement, now I have to do this.\n\n254\n00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.550\nWell now what we do instead of complaining\nabout it, is we promote it on our website.\n\n255\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.630\nWe say hey, we are now offering this.\n\n256\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:57.490\nNow not that we have a choice [LAUGH] But\nwe kind of use it as a promotional thing.\n\n257\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.694\nSo the idea of taking your constraint and\nexploiting that constraint is one step\n\n258\n00:15:01.694 --> 00:15:04.659\nbeyond, I got lemons,\nI'm gonna make lemonade.\n\n259\n00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:07.298\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's saying, hey, I'm gonna take this\n\n260\n00:15:07.298 --> 00:15:11.314\nthing that you threw at me, this\nconstraint that's meant to slow me down,\n\n261\n00:15:11.314 --> 00:15:13.960\nand I'm gonna do something\nreally cool with it.\n\n262\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.762\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo I'm not just making lemonade, but\n\n263\n00:15:15.762 --> 00:15:18.790\nmaybe I'm setting up a lemonade stand,\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n264\n00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm setting up lemonade stand\nfranchises, and I'm making a ton of money.\n\n265\n00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.660\nAnd I think, as a project manager, because\nthere's always things that get in your\n\n266\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.460\nway, you can do the perfect project\nplan and something will show up.\n\n267\n00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.930\nI think it's really change my attitude in\nproject management altogether to just say,\n\n268\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.950\nhey, hit me with your best shot.\n\n269\n00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.930\nBecause when you do that, I'm gonna take\nit and I'm gonna make it work for me.\n\n270\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.400\nSo finally, the last thing.\n\n271\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.050\nWell, I shouldn't say it's the last thing\nbecause he has a plethora of lots of\n\n272\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.257\nphilosophical things on how to\nmake projects work better, faster,\n\n273\n00:15:49.257 --> 00:15:50.327\nmore cost effective.\n\n274\n00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:53.708\nWhich is why we're talking about it,\nLean and Agile project management.\n\n275\n00:15:53.708 --> 00:15:58.426\nBut Eli also had a lot of tips on\nhow to manage multiple projects.\n\n276\n00:15:58.426 --> 00:16:02.054\nI mean, what would it be like if I\nonly had one project to manage, and\n\n277\n00:16:02.054 --> 00:16:04.551\nI didn't have all my\npersonal projects to do?\n\n278\n00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:07.900\nAnd so I'm sure some of you\ndo just have one project.\n\n279\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.770\nBut I think most of us, if we look at\na project as having an end, I mean,\n\n280\n00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.670\nhaving a beginning and an end.\n\n281\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.588\nAnd I'm trying to accomplish\nsomething within a certain timeframe,\n\n282\n00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:19.376\nI think most of us have multiple projects.\n\n283\n00:16:19.376 --> 00:16:20.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n284\n00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:23.750\nsome of the tips is that we\nwanna prioritize the project.\n\n285\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.510\nAnd even though that sounds incredibly\nintuitive, we're a reactive society.\n\n286\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.880\nSomeone brings us a problem,\nwe start working on that project.\n\n287\n00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.550\nSomeone else brings us a problem,\nwe start working on that.\n\n288\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.350\nSo just staying cognizant and just\nstaying focused that I've got all these\n\n289\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.310\nprojects on my desk, which ones do I\nreally need to be working on first.\n\n290\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.100\nIt's just kind of keeping that in mind.\n\n291\n00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.240\nIt says plan projects as\nper the critical chain,\n\n292\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.988\none of the things in project management\nthat all three bodies of knowledge\n\n293\n00:16:53.988 --> 00:16:56.730\nagree on is that there is a critical path.\n\n294\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.950\nSo I want you to go back and\nthink about your WBS, right?\n\n295\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you look at your work breakdown\n\n296\n00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.335\nstructure, there are certain things that\nhave to be accomplished on a certain time\n\n297\n00:17:06.335 --> 00:17:09.630\nframe, or\nyour whole project is gonna tank, right?\n\n298\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.880\nSo there's a chart called the PERT chart\nthat actually helps you with this, and\n\n299\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.550\nit might pop up a little\nbit later in our sessions.\n\n300\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.770\nBut the thing is is that I need,\nif I have multiple projects,\n\n301\n00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.480\nI need to be aware of what\nitems on my WBS that,\n\n302\n00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.360\nif they slip, if they go longer than\nI think they're supposed to go.\n\n303\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.190\nI need to be cognizant of those so that\nI'm looking at all my project plans and\n\n304\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.600\nI've got those, maybe in red.\n\n305\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.000\nA lot of times,\ncritical path is demonstrated in red.\n\n306\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.115\nJust so I stay aware when I\nget there in the morning.\n\n307\n00:17:41.115 --> 00:17:45.011\nIt's like, okay, I've got this to do,\nI've got this to do, I've got this to do.\n\n308\n00:17:45.011 --> 00:17:47.679\nBut, wait a second, these three red task,\n\n309\n00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:51.013\nthey have to happen or\nthose projects are gonna fall behind.\n\n310\n00:17:51.013 --> 00:17:55.630\n&gt;&gt; So maybe you could modify your priority\nlevels because Agile is so flexible.\n\n311\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n312\n00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.170\nAnd then, staggering the projects,\n\n313\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.930\nI always think this is kind\nof funny when I read this.\n\n314\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.748\nBecause, yeah, in a perfect world,\n[LAUGH] I'd stagger my projects.\n\n315\n00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:07.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n316\n00:18:07.408 --> 00:18:11.487\n&gt;&gt; And then it talks about,\nreport the buffers, and\n\n317\n00:18:11.487 --> 00:18:15.189\nbuffers are just what\nit kind of sounds like.\n\n318\n00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:20.950\nI wanna give myself, Eli calls it safety\ntime, and all that means is extra time.\n\n319\n00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.570\nI'm trying to give myself extra time,\nand then manage those buffers.\n\n320\n00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.930\nSo I've got downtime, I've got safety\ntime, what am I gonna do in that downtime?\n\n321\n00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.290\nI mean what can I do that's productive for\nother things?\n\n322\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:37.027\nI know we all have it tendency to\nschedule ourselves up a little\n\n323\n00:18:37.027 --> 00:18:39.480\nbit more than we need to.\n\n324\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.884\nSo it's saying, hey, watch that.\n\n325\n00:18:42.884 --> 00:18:45.180\nMake sure that you build some time in for\nsafety.\n\n326\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.860\nYou build in some buffers so\nthat if things don't work exactly the way\n\n327\n00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.690\nyou want them to work,\nyou've got some time to re-strategize.\n\n328\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.560\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n329\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.330\nSo we've seen our theory\nof our constraints.\n\n330\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.060\nWe've seen the types of\nconstraints that are available.\n\n331\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.810\nWe've looked at managing\nmultiple projects.\n\n332\n00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:09.820\nWe also thought about our different\nreasons as to why a project would fail.\n\n333\n00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.625\nBut are there any other contributing\nfactors that we should be aware of,\n\n334\n00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:14.950\nDr Stern?\n\n335\n00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Well, actually, I'd like to go back\nto my slide deck, cuz are a couple.\n\n336\n00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.080\nI think these are pretty intuitive ones.\n\n337\n00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.650\nHowever, one of the reasons that\nprojects fail that are very common\n\n338\n00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.520\nis goal and vision.\n\n339\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.280\nWe just have a different idea of what\nwe're trying to include in our scope.\n\n340\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.010\nOne of my favorite books is,\nWhy Smart Executives Fail, and\n\n341\n00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:42.410\nthey have an entire chapter devoted to\nbrilliantly fulfilling the wrong mission.\n\n342\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.259\nSo I think that that happens sometimes.\n\n343\n00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.970\nAnother reason, and\nthis is another common, intuitive one, but\n\n344\n00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:54.160\nwe don't really discuss it a lot,\nis leadership and governance.\n\n345\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.370\nSo, leadership would be\nhow the project is led,\n\n346\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.950\ngovernance would be kind\nof how it's managed, right?\n\n347\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.140\nAnd a lot of times it's easy.\n\n348\n00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.352\nAnd then, finally, another reason, and\nthat just happens to be our next topic.\n\n349\n00:20:08.352 --> 00:20:14.109\nA lot of times, the reason projects fail\nis because they aren't planned properly,\n\n350\n00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:17.200\nor they're not tracked properly, or both.\n\n351\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.730\nSo I think I'd like to end with this\nlast slide, which is Parkinson's Law.\n\n352\n00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.160\nI've heard this all my life,\nI didn't realize it was Parkinson's Law.\n\n353\n00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.480\nAnd it says,\nwork expands to fill the time available.\n\n354\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.630\nSo you wanna be very careful\nwith your project planning and\n\n355\n00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.150\ntracking, which, like I said,\nis what we talk about next.\n\n356\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.087\n&gt;&gt; I know, you think about,\ndefinitely is applicable to my life.\n\n357\n00:20:40.087 --> 00:20:42.997\nI think, I'm becoming really efficient or\ngood at something,\n\n358\n00:20:42.997 --> 00:20:45.665\nand then I find myself picking\nup little things here and there.\n\n359\n00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:50.270\nAnd I'm always just so busy, but\nI definitely think that is very true.\n\n360\n00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.430\nYou're right, I think we are out of time,\nso we'll go ahead and wrap up here.\n\n361\n00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.660\nIt's a perfect place.\n\n362\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.200\nWe'll pick back up with Parkinson's Law,\n\n363\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.140\nand I think we'll go ahead and\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n364\n00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.540\nAnd just as a reminder,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n365\n00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.440\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr. Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n366\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.312\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe'll see you very soon here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n367\n00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:17.560\n[MUSIC]\n\n368\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.810\nThank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.420\nIn the last episode, we were looking at\nthings like our types of constraints,\n\n7\n00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.110\nand we also looked at\nmanaging multiple projects.\n\n8\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.610\nWe also looked at reasons\nas to why projects fail.\n\n9\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.910\nI believe we left off\nlooking at

it.\n\n14\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.360\n&gt;&gt; So, do you think that's a good place\njust to kind of pick up and recap?\n\n15\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.285\n&gt;&gt; I do, absolutely.\n\n16\n00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:53.050\nSo, when we're thinking\nabout project failure,\n\n17\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.210\none of the things that can happen\nis the way we track our projects.\n\n18\n00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.740\nBecause we can do a great job planning.\n\n19\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.430\nBut then maybe the tracking goes awry.\n\n20\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.470\nAnd so there's some difference in\ntraditional versus Agile project tracking.\n\n21\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.290\nAnd that's what I think\nwe'll talk about next.\n\n22\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n23\n00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.120\n&gt;&gt; So the first thing that you wanna\nremember is that in project planning and\n\n24\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.850\nproject tracking, there's formal,\nthere's informal and\n\n25\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.940\nthere's visual versus the outline, right.\n\n26\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.620\nAnd so when we say formal,\na lot of times I kinda think of\n\n27\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.850\nMS project software but there's also\nother project software out there.\n\n28\n00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.620\nWhen I'm thinking informal,\nI'm just tracking on a spreadsheet.\n\n29\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.040\nAnd when I'm thinking visual versus\nan outline, we could have a chart or\n\n30\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.670\na graph or a process flow map,\nor not really a process,\n\n31\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.270\na project map that shows us,\nor we could have that WBS.\n\n32\n00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.420\nSo a lot of that depends on how\nthe item that I pick depends\n\n33\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.790\non how much of commitment do I want, so-\n&gt;&gt; And Probably also what the company is\n\n34\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.540\nalready using-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n35\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.760\n&gt;&gt; If they're kind of married to an idea.\n\n36\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n37\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.350\nThat's a really good point, Cherokee.\n\n38\n00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.910\nBecause what they're using,\nthat's what I wanna use too, right?\n\n39\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.780\nSo the more formal types of\nproject management software\n\n40\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.359\nreally do take a committment, but\nthey can do some really cool stuff.\n\n41\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.630\nSo here's an example of different\nways I might track, you'll see here,\n\n42\n00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.580\nthat's kind of a visual tracking method.\n\n43\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.200\nAnother example of visual tracking\nmethod is the Gantt chart, and\n\n44\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.060\nthis is basically taking the WBS and\njust putting a picture to it.\n\n45\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.710\nYou'll notice along top there where\nit has the date, generally speaking,\n\n46\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.910\nGantt charts are going to have some\nkind of time-bound thing on that line.\n\n47\n00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790\nIt could be even by hours.\n\n48\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or by quarters.\n\n49\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.160\nAnd on the left hand side I'm\ngonna have my WBS, basically.\n\n50\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.830\nNow this one doesn't have\nthe numbers associated with it but\n\n51\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.290\na lot of times your project software will\njust go ahead and renumber, for example,\n\n52\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.580\nif I wanna add a 1.2.3,\nI can go in there and renumber it.\n\n53\n00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.630\nI can do a Gantt chart on Excel,\nI'm just doing it in a manual way.\n\n54\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we look at things\nlike Microsoft Project\n\n55\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.840\nit looks very similar to Excel but just\nwith a ton more features, it seems like.\n\n56\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\n\n57\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.710\nand in project software you can add\nthings like schedules and all kinds\n\n58\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.340\nof different things that you have to just\nput on manually on your spreadsheet.\n\n59\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.190\nSo, one of the things that we wanna\nthink about is our project plan,\n\n60\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.650\nwhich should be done in a WBS fashion\nif we're in a traditional environment.\n\n61\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.395\nShould be a living document.\n\n62\n00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:45.090\nWe wanna make sure that we're always going\nback and checking it and tracking, like,\n\n63\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.275\nwe said this task is gonna take three\nmonths, how long does it take really?\n\n64\n00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:52.981\nSo, when we're in the agile environment,\n\n65\n00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:58.190\nthere is a tendency as opposed to\nusing a work breakdown structure.\n\n66\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.688\nAnd having the Gantt chart associated\nwith that using a burndown chart.\n\n67\n00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:07.070\nSo a burndown chart, I have the body\nof work that I'm trying to accomplish.\n\n68\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.840\nAnd it's also time-bound\nusually on the x-axis, and\n\n69\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.990\nas time goes on it just\nshows that the work is done.\n\n70\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.340\nDoes that make sense?\n\n71\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n72\n00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Now how communication is handled in\na traditional versus agile environment\n\n73\n00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.120\nis also important if we wanna make\nsure that our project is successful.\n\n74\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.970\nSo, in a traditional project management\nenvironment the project manager\n\n75\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.960\nwatches the process and\nchecks the deliverable being made.\n\n76\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.060\nAnd they do meetings and\nagendas and memos and email,\n\n77\n00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.730\nthat's kind of\nthe traditional way we do it.\n\n78\n00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.700\n&gt;&gt; And they would normally\neven just have an approved\n\n79\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.400\nmethod of communication as well,\nlike approved methods.\n\n80\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and in the agile\nenvironments, in a perfect world, they\n\n81\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.550\nhave daily standup meetings which is what\nyou were talking about that ITProTV does.\n\n82\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.980\nNow, in a true Agile environment,\nthey ask the same questions.\n\n83\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.910\nWhat did you do yesterday?\n\n84\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.530\nWhat will you do today?\n\n85\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.620\nAnd what's in your way, right?\n\n86\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.690\nAnd again, we say standup meeting,\nthe concept behind that standup\n\n87\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.120\nmeeting is it's quick, and\nwe're not gonna get relaxed, and\n\n88\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.800\nwe're not gonna let this\nmeeting go on forever, right?\n\n89\n00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and here at ITProTV, They even\nkind of condense it a little bit more.\n\n90\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.630\nThe main topic that we cover\nis what we will do today, and\n\n91\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.300\nif there's anything really cool or\nsignificant that we did the previous day,\n\n92\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.240\nor maybe something that just had a really\nbig impact on the organization, or\n\n93\n00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.480\nif there are any obstacles.\n\n94\n00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.310\nThose are kind of like too optional,\nbut the middle one is a must for us.\n\n95\n00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.740\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect.\n\n96\n00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.790\nAnd you know what makes this different\nfrom a traditional environment is that\n\n97\n00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.590\na lot of times these meetings are handled\nby a weekly or a bi-weekly basis.\n\n98\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.390\nThere isn't really a, everyday we touch\neach other and see what's going on.\n\n99\n00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.240\nSo Scrum, which is the meeting,\nit's a Agile process that focuses on\n\n100\n00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.470\ndelivering the highest business value\nin the shortest period of time.\n\n101\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.110\nSo if you were thinking\nof Scrum in 100 words,\n\n102\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.720\nthese are kind of the high level points.\n\n103\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.510\nThe business sets a priority,\nour teams are self managed,\n\n104\n00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.790\nevery two weeks to a month\neveryone can see the real work.\n\n105\n00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.470\nRight?\n\n106\n00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.900\nSo this is just a handout slide.\n\n107\n00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.020\nI just wanted you to see kind of\nan example of some stuff that's in your\n\n108\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.190\nstudent package if you were\nstudying to take the exam.\n\n109\n00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n110\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.725\n&gt;&gt; Now Sprints, what happens with\nSprints is that they're a series.\n\n111\n00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:37.260\nAnd usually sprints are two to four weeks.\n\n112\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.880\nMost of the sprints that\nI've been participating in\n\n113\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.240\nare closer to the two week side.\n\n114\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.750\nAnd the idea is that I'm gonna do\nthis body of work in this Sprint.\n\n115\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.570\nAnd during the Sprint,\nwhatever we're agreed to,\n\n116\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.662\neveryone's just gonna stay\nlaser-focused on that.\n\n117\n00:06:55.662 --> 00:07:01.010\nNow, between Sprints we\ncan be more flexible and\n\n118\n00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.890\ncome up with the next body of work.\n\n119\n00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.470\nDo you guys do Sprints here at ITPro.TV?\n\n120\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.800\n&gt;&gt; I think for\nthe host it's a little more scheduled,\n\n121\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.960\nwe go far out with our scheduling,\nor at least we try to.\n\n122\n00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.030\nBut on the development team,\nI'm pretty sure they do.\n\n123\n00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nthere are those daily Scrub meetings where\n\n124\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.690\nyou have those three questions, but\nthen also the projects work in Sprints.\n\n125\n00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.050\nSo for that two or\nfour week period of time,\n\n126\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.470\ntypically people just stay focused on\nthat and there's not a lot of changes.\n\n127\n00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.320\nSo everything's done\nkind of in iterations.\n\n128\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.060\nDo you guys do Sprints, as well?\n\n129\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.845\n&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure\nabout other departments.\n\n130\n00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:45.805\nPerhaps the development team does,\nbut as a host,\n\n131\n00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:50.785\nit's normally pretty scheduled far\nout when we try to adhere to that.\n\n132\n00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:55.059\nAnd so it's not anything that would be\nneeding to be addressed in a short period\n\n133\n00:07:55.059 --> 00:07:55.593\nof time.\n\n134\n00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:59.160\nUnless we have a certain event or\nparty or something coming up,\n\n135\n00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.340\nthen we might kind of work\ntogether as a team in that way.\n\n136\n00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.253\nSo, not in a structured format.\n\n137\n00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:06.637\nOkay, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n138\n00:08:06.637 --> 00:08:11.213\nI have noticed here at ITProTV\nthat they do recognize kind of\n\n139\n00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:13.510\nthe Agile work environment.\n\n140\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.680\nEverything's very open,\nwhere people can talk to one another.\n\n141\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.020\nSo there are a lot of Agile principles\nthat ITProTV does recognize.\n\n142\n00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.570\nSo now we're gonna go back to\nthat Project Life Cycle slide.\n\n143\n00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.340\nWe talked about that in\none of our first sessions.\n\n144\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.860\nWhat we did with the Project Life Cycle\nis in order to study Lean and\n\n145\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.300\nAgile project management,\nwe did a composite.\n\n146\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.760\nSo what this means is that in the PMBOCK,\nPRINCE2, and\n\n147\n00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.570\nthe new ISO standard, they all have their\ntake on the project management life cycle.\n\n148\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.580\nSo we call ours just\nthe Project Life Cycle.\n\n149\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.520\nAnd we took all the key things and\nput it into four phases.\n\n150\n00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.317\nIn some literature on project\nmanagement in general,\n\n151\n00:08:58.317 --> 00:09:01.722\neven if you're looking at bodies\nof knowledge outside those three\n\n152\n00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:06.244\nprimary ones, some are moving towards six\nor eight cycles, some are, I think, four.\n\n153\n00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:11.050\nI think we have the least\namount of cycles possible.\n\n154\n00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.848\nBut we just thought it was easier to\ndigest and the things that are in these\n\n155\n00:09:14.848 --> 00:09:18.560\nfour categories are things that\neveryone agrees needs to be done.\n\n156\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So in some bodies of knowledge,\n\n157\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.920\nyou're gonna see some extra things,\n\n158\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.180\nor you're gonna seem some things that\nare fleshed out a little bit more But\n\n159\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.540\neveryone agrees that these\nthings have to happen.\n\n160\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.720\nWe just broke them into\nthese four categories.\n\n161\n00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.780\nSo the first category is selection.\n\n162\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.550\nAnd we're gonna look at that.\n\n163\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.240\nAnd in selection, what we're looking for\nis we're looking for strategic fit.\n\n164\n00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.670\nWe're looking for scope.\n\n165\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.490\nWe're looking for draft schedules,\nbudget estimates.\n\n166\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.440\nWe're just trying to select what\nis the biggest bang for our buck?\n\n167\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.700\nThere might be a number of\ndifferent things going on.\n\n168\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.180\nAnd we just want to make sure that\nwe're working on the right thing.\n\n169\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.290\nSo when we're looking at Lean and\n\n170\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.640\nAgile tools that are outside\nthe typical project management toolbox,\n\n171\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.310\ncuz we're trying to apply Lean and Agile\ntools to what's already there, right?\n\n172\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.430\nThere's a number of tools that we can\nlook at that are not typically covered\n\n173\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.390\nin project management bodies of knowledge.\n\n174\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.270\nAnd one of those are rapid\nimprovement events.\n\n175\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.190\nSo we're gonna talk\na little bit about that.\n\n176\n00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.119\nStandard work.\n\n177\n00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:23.664\nRoot cause analysis tools,\nsmart goals, and FMEA.\n\n178\n00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:29.870\nSo the first one we're gonna talk about\nis we're gonna talk about RCA tools.\n\n179\n00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.960\nCuz that's easy and\nwe've already sort of covered it.\n\n180\n00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.730\nSo one of the ways that\nwe can get to the root\n\n181\n00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.070\ncause is by doing a fishbone analysis.\n\n182\n00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.270\nWe put the problem in\nthe head of the fish.\n\n183\n00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:47.140\nAnd then of course all the big bones that\nplay into that are the major factors.\n\n184\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.070\nAnd what we're looking for, which is\nkind of a reminder from one of our\n\n185\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.960\nother sessions, is we're looking for\nthose smaller bones.\n\n186\n00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.000\nBecause the theory is the root\ncause is probably going to come\n\n187\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.880\nfrom one of those smaller bones.\n\n188\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.490\nWhen we're in the selection process,\nanother way that we can use the fishbone\n\n189\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:09.480\nto help us in selection is to just kind of\ngo through different ideas for projects.\n\n190\n00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.860\nAnd then look at what\nare the contributing bones?\n\n191\n00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.240\nIn other words, what kind of resources?\n\n192\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.220\nWhat kind of time?\n\n193\n00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.280\nWhat kind of cost would\nbe involved to fix that?\n\n194\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.950\nSo we could have like\na brainstorming session.\n\n195\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.870\nAnd at this point,\nwe're not looking for root cause,\n\n196\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.570\nwe're just looking for ideas for projects.\n\n197\n00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.990\nAnd those big bones are gonna just give us\nall kinds of information on how doable is\n\n198\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.950\nit, right?\n\n199\n00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:39.475\nSo, I wanna also remind everyone\nthat you can combine tools.\n\n200\n00:11:39.475 --> 00:11:43.295\nThat's a very Lean and\nAgile way to manage projects.\n\n201\n00:11:43.295 --> 00:11:48.785\nSo in this case, this particular fish\nbone diagram includes some metrics.\n\n202\n00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:53.715\nThe topic of this one is understand and\nreduce risk in factors of older adults.\n\n203\n00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:57.230\nI'm not really sure where we picked that\none but we're really just showing you\n\n204\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:02.230\nas an example that one way to be Lean and\nAgile is to think about those seven tools.\n\n205\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.240\nWe call them seven tools of\nquality in the Lean world.\n\n206\n00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.830\nBut in the project management world,\n\n207\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.530\nthey're called the seven\nanalytical problem-solving tools.\n\n208\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.400\nSo which is a real mouthful,\nthat's not very Lean.\n\n209\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.380\nBut just kinda keep in mind,\nthere's no reason you can't combine them.\n\n210\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.200\nThat's a real Lean way to do it.\n\n211\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.751\nOn this particular example, in addition\nto showing you the fishbone diagram,\n\n212\n00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:24.558\nthere's all these kinda cool metrics.\n\n213\n00:12:26.636 --> 00:12:30.720\nSo when we're working an Agile selection.\n\n214\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.280\nSo keep in mind right now we're talking\nabout that first phase of the model.\n\n215\n00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.579\nThere's a lot more face\nto face communication.\n\n216\n00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:39.297\nThere's a lot more discussion.\n\n217\n00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:42.390\nThere's less initial documentation.\n\n218\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.413\nThere's more risk because of that.\n\n219\n00:12:46.413 --> 00:12:50.560\nIn theory, Agile would be\n\n220\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.570\npaying more attention to the theory\nof constraints that we looked at.\n\n221\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.960\nAnd they're also, in theory, paying more\nattention to voice of the customer and\n\n222\n00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.620\nvoice of the employee.\n\n223\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.620\nSo if I'm in a traditional project\nmanagement environment, and\n\n224\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.650\nwhat I'm kind of used to is one or\ntwo people sitting in a room,\n\n225\n00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.390\nor even just myself going I think\nthis is a good idea for a project.\n\n226\n00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.430\nA lot of times people in upper management\nare accused of that all the time.\n\n227\n00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.020\nThat they come up with an idea for\n\n228\n00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.730\na project without considering voice of\nthe employee and voice of the customer.\n\n229\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.800\nThey're just thinking this\nwould be a really good idea.\n\n230\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.060\nSo here are some Agile ways\nthat you can integrate\n\n231\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.020\ninto the selection\nprocess of your project.\n\n232\n00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.850\nAnd certainly more face\nto face communication\n\n233\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.250\nplays into the voice of the employee.\n\n234\n00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.840\nAnd that less initial documentation,\nsometimes that\n\n235\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.190\nreally works better in a project because\nyou might not be on the right track.\n\n236\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.370\nSo as we move forward, a reminder,\nwe're still in selection.\n\n237\n00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.468\nWe're talking about the selection\npart of the Project Life Cycle.\n\n238\n00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:56.950\nThe composite, right?\n\n239\n00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.630\nSo if I was looking at the whole thing,\nthis would be the whole thing.\n\n240\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.590\nI'm in the selection part.\n\n241\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.360\nStill in this selection part.\n\n242\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.920\nOkay, so another thing that you might\nwant to think about in selection\n\n243\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.380\nis if you could do a rapid\nimprovement event, a Kaizen event.\n\n244\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.650\nNow, in project management environments,\n\n245\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:21.230\na lot of times that Kaizen event would\ntake the form of a hypothetical PDCA.\n\n246\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.990\nSo a PDCA, remember,\nwas Plan, Do, Check, Act.\n\n247\n00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.800\nSo I'm trying to figure out\nwhat do I wanna work on.\n\n248\n00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.590\nI'm in project selection.\n\n249\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.820\nSo a way I could use a Lean tool, and\n\n250\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.540\nI'm still being Agile cuz I'm doing\nthis face-to-face communication.\n\n251\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.700\nI would bring everyone\nin a room together and\n\n252\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.270\nI would say okay, here's a problem\nthat we're gonna work on, right?\n\n253\n00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.530\nAnd so I would mock plan.\n\n254\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.200\nI wouldn't maybe go\nthrough the whole plan.\n\n255\n00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.690\nI would say what could happen when I\nexecute, what could happen when I check?\n\n256\n00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.575\nIs there anything from this\nhypothetical PDCA that I could learn?\n\n257\n00:14:55.575 --> 00:15:00.025\nI could also approach it\nas a real live project.\n\n258\n00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:03.885\nI could bring people in the room and\nsay look we just gotta plan really fast.\n\n259\n00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:08.415\nAnd then we're gonna have to assign\nsomeone to execute this project and then\n\n260\n00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:12.485\nwe'll assign someone else to come in and\ncheck to see if it's doing well, right?\n\n261\n00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:17.275\nAnd then we will move on to deciding\nif we want to act, abandon, or adapt.\n\n262\n00:15:17.275 --> 00:15:22.750\nSo rapid improvement events sometimes,\nin the selection process, we\n\n263\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.580\nwanna step back and say is this a problem\nthat we could just knock out right away?\n\n264\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.540\nIs this something we could just go\nout to the manufacturing floor or\n\n265\n00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.745\nbring the right players into the room and\njust plan it out quickly?\n\n266\n00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:38.100\nIt's not a typical\nproject management tool.\n\n267\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.110\nNow when we're in selection,\n\n268\n00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.850\nwe want to end up with something\ncalled the Y statement.\n\n269\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.620\nWhen we're on the Lean side,\nthe Y statement is always the activity\n\n270\n00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.830\nthat I wanna make better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n271\n00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.030\nIn project management, that Y statement\ncould be more like a problem statement.\n\n272\n00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.910\nWhat is it that I'm trying to do?\n\n273\n00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.942\nAnd the formula that I'm going to show\nyou works whether you're trying to do\n\n274\n00:16:01.942 --> 00:16:05.798\na process improvement or if you're\njust trying to do a regular project.\n\n275\n00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:10.864\nSo let's say if you were tasked with\nyour boss to do a project, this is what\n\n276\n00:16:10.864 --> 00:16:16.740\nthey want you to do and they want you\nto go write to the project plan, right?\n\n277\n00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:23.130\nSo, before you write the project plan, you\nmight wanna consider the Y=f(x) formula.\n\n278\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.840\nSo they're telling you the project,\nthat would be represented by the big Y,\n\n279\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.770\nthis is the positive outcome.\n\n280\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.490\nKeep in mind if I'm only in a Lean\nenvironment, that positive outcome is\n\n281\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.540\nalways going to be the activity I wanna\nmake better, faster, more cost effective.\n\n282\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.100\nBut in regular project management,\nit's just what they're asking me to do.\n\n283\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.240\nDoesn't really matter,\nit could be from scratch, right?\n\n284\n00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.700\nIt could be something that's\nnever been done before.\n\n285\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.410\nSo the next thing that I want to do is,\nI want to consider the x's.\n\n286\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.330\nAnd that x represents all the inputs\nthat have to go in to make that\n\n287\n00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.970\nproject successful.\n\n288\n00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.930\nSo I wanna sit down before I\neven do the project plan, and\n\n289\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:05.000\nI wanna think, do I have all the inputs\nnecessary, are they available?\n\n290\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.690\nBecause if those inputs are not available,\n\n291\n00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.180\nI'm not gonna be able to achieve\nthis project successfully right?\n\n292\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.376\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the conversation that I'm\n\n293\n00:17:14.376 --> 00:17:16.548\ngonna wanna have with my project manager.\n\n294\n00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:20.255\n&gt;&gt; And you've given us some really great\nideas before, where you take things like\n\n295\n00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:23.649\nyour WBS, or maybe even the project\ncharter, and really outline that.\n\n296\n00:17:23.649 --> 00:17:26.826\nAnd say look,\nthis process currently is not capable,\n\n297\n00:17:26.826 --> 00:17:28.790\nwhat do you want me to modify?\n\n298\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.320\nThen kind of put the ball back in their\ncourt, or your supervisor's court.\n\n299\n00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's a perfect example\nbecause this is something that I can also\n\n300\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.130\nuse for capability.\n\n301\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.200\nIf I go one step further,\nI'm missing these inputs,\n\n302\n00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.340\nso that's the conversation I need to have.\n\n303\n00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.330\nBut I go one step further, maybe those\ninputs aren't functioning properly.\n\n304\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.910\nSo I have them available,\nso maybe I have resources,\n\n305\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.960\nI have human resource available.\n\n306\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.530\nBut they need training, so\n\n307\n00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.100\nmy human resources are not functioning\nwell because they need training.\n\n308\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Or they need more hours,\n\n309\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.810\nor they need more time, right, so\nI'm in that selection process.\n\n310\n00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.930\nAnd a good Lean or\nAgile tool that I could use,\n\n311\n00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.480\nis this Y=f(x) to try to figure out\nwhat it is I should be working on.\n\n312\n00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n313\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.022\n&gt;&gt; Then finally, I'm in selection,\n\n314\n00:18:18.022 --> 00:18:21.035\nI'm trying to figure out what\nthe heck I should be working on.\n\n315\n00:18:21.035 --> 00:18:25.427\nAnother tool that's kind of cool when\nI'm trying to select the project, and\n\n316\n00:18:25.427 --> 00:18:29.548\nthere could be some projects on the table\nthat I run through this as well,\n\n317\n00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:32.170\nis something called FMEA Thinking.\n\n318\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.810\nNow, if you're really\ninterested in FMEA Thinking,\n\n319\n00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.940\nit's covered in depth in our\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt program.\n\n320\n00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.530\nThe idea behind FMEA Thinking is that\nthere's actually a form, that a lot of you\n\n321\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.980\nmay already be familiar with, called the\nFMEA failure mode effect analyses form.\n\n322\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.680\nAnd typically it's used\nto record information.\n\n323\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.566\nThere is a belief in Lean and\nAgile project, just Lean and\n\n324\n00:18:56.566 --> 00:19:01.547\nAgile environments period, that\nsometimes the psychology behind the form\n\n325\n00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:04.950\ncan lead us to some\ngood critical thinking.\n\n326\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:10.200\nSo this is pulled out of the middle of\nthe form and it says, what's the activity?\n\n327\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.490\nWhat's the potential failure,\nwhat's the effect of the failure,\n\n328\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.730\nwhat's the cause of the failure?\n\n329\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.270\nAnd what current processes are in control?\n\n330\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.420\nNow when you're in the Lean and\nSix Sigma environment,\n\n331\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.350\nand you're trying to make process\nimprovements, that last column is key.\n\n332\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.920\nBecause if there's nothing in place to\nkeep the bad things from happening,\n\n333\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.480\nthat's an automatic process improvement.\n\n334\n00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.520\nWhen you're using this same model for\n\n335\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.710\nproject management,\nyou're using it more as a risk model.\n\n336\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.160\nNow certainly you would want to know\nif there's some controls in place, but\n\n337\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.620\nI have the activity, what's the potential\nfailure, which is just the opposite.\n\n338\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.450\nWhat's the effect of the failure?\n\n339\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.600\nI'm going to concentrate\non those causes of failure,\n\n340\n00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.760\nbecause I'm saying these\nare risks to my project.\n\n341\n00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.850\nSo let's say my project\nwas putting gas in my car.\n\n342\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.150\nAnd I didn't put gas, so\n\n343\n00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.570\nthe potential failure is there's\nno gas in the car, right?\n\n344\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.227\nAnd the potential effect of the failure\nis I can't get to work, right?\n\n345\n00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.846\nSo what are the causes of those failures?\n\n346\n00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:15.650\nI might have forgot, right?\n\n347\n00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.500\n&gt;&gt; I don't have enough money to buy gas.\n\n348\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.970\n&gt;&gt; I don't have enough money to buy gas,\nfor sure.\n\n349\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.009\nAnything else?\n\n350\n00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:26.540\n&gt;&gt; I was out in the middle of nowhere,\nand there wasn't a gas station nearby.\n\n351\n00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so if my project is\nto put gas in the car, I mean,\n\n352\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.990\nit's a small project, right?\n\n353\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.420\nBut I don't particularly like\nputting gas in my car, and\n\n354\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.030\nI'm always really happy\nwhen someone else does it.\n\n355\n00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.400\nBut it's one of my projects today,\n\n356\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.270\none of my projects today is\nto go get gas in the car.\n\n357\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.290\nSo one of the things,\n\n358\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:47.100\nif I ran it through an FMEA, I could look\nat those potential causes of failure.\n\n359\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.440\nAnd kind of build that into my thinking,\nokay, I don't wanna forget.\n\n360\n00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.970\nI don't wanna make sure I'm\ntoo far from the gas station,\n\n361\n00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.870\nout in the middle of nowhere, right?\n\n362\n00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.670\nSo that's kind of the thinking,\nand we can just do\n\n363\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.060\nin our Lean Six Sigma Green Belt class,\nwe did the brushing teeth one.\n\n364\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And we said our grandchildren or\n\n365\n00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.845\nour children, we're trying to\nget them to brush their teeth.\n\n366\n00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:09.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Do you wanna just go\n\n367\n00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.450\nwith that one again?\n\n368\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n369\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n370\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.120\nSo, the function is, our children,\nour grandchildren, in my case,\n\n371\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.280\nbrush their teeth.\n\n372\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:17.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n373\n00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.330\nthe potential failure is the opposite,\nthe children or\n\n374\n00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.180\ngrandchildren didn't brush their teeth.\n\n375\n00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.680\nSo what are some of the potential\neffects of that failure?\n\n376\n00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.435\n&gt;&gt; So I think we had said cavities,\nbad breath, gingivitis.\n\n377\n00:21:32.435 --> 00:21:34.655\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those are some pretty bad effects.\n\n378\n00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:36.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so what are the causes?\n\n379\n00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.820\nWhy wouldn't our children, as many times\nas we talk to them, and our grandchildren,\n\n380\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.660\nwhy wouldn't they brush their teeth?\n\n381\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.940\n&gt;&gt; Well, they might be watching TV,\nor not listening to the adult.\n\n382\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.970\nThey just think it's busy work or\n\n383\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.120\nsomething, just taking away\nfrom their normal activities.\n\n384\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; I guess, yeah.\n\n385\n00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.660\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat could be a big cause of failure.\n\n386\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.220\nNow, in this case we're gonna go ahead and\nlook at that current process control,\n\n387\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.220\nbecause Cherokee has\na great process control.\n\n388\n00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.730\nWhich means what am I gonna put in\nplace to keep that from happening?\n\n389\n00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.160\nSo you had a great one that you did.\n\n390\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it can be difficult to\nget my kids to bush their teeth.\n\n391\n00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.710\nSo a little idea I had was well,\nduring the holidays,\n\n392\n00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.730\nwe have some visitors that come and\nsee us.\n\n393\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.515\nThat you guys might even\nknow about Elf on the Shelf,\n\n394\n00:22:21.515 --> 00:22:24.000\nthat is something that\nwe do have at our house.\n\n395\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.936\nSo I figured if I could integrate that,\nit might help with this situation.\n\n396\n00:22:27.936 --> 00:22:33.070\nSo if we take a look at my screen,\nI just kind of made them have troll hair.\n\n397\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.290\nBecause there's also a popular\nmovie out right now called Trolls.\n\n398\n00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.190\nAnd then I had them bring some\ntroll toothpaste and toothbrush and\n\n399\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.440\nsome mouthwash.\n\n400\n00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.408\nJust to make it a little bit more fun,\nand it's not the basic hearing me say,\n\n401\n00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:47.533\ngo brush your teeth!\n\n402\n00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.533\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's a little different there, but\n\n403\n00:22:49.533 --> 00:22:52.210\nI don't know, just to try to\nmake it a little fun I guess.\n\n404\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:57.890\n&gt;&gt; Well I think making the process\ncontrol fun is a huge thing.\n\n405\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.025\nAnd as project managers,\n\n406\n00:22:59.025 --> 00:23:03.110\nif there are things that you want\npeople to do, to keep things in place.\n\n407\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.590\nMaking it a little bit more fun or\nexciting I think is a great thing.\n\n408\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:11.610\nSo if you don't mind looking at my\nscreen again, my FMEA Thinking screen.\n\n409\n00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:16.120\nI just wanna reiterate that this model\ncan be used for process improvement.\n\n410\n00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.410\nIf you have nothing in that current\ncontrol, that's an automatic opportunity.\n\n411\n00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.360\nIf you're looking for\n\n412\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.160\na project to do, that's a place\nwhere you could start looking.\n\n413\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.200\nIn the project management world, a lot of\ntimes what I want you to think about using\n\n414\n00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.530\nthis model is again,\nthose potential causes of failure.\n\n415\n00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.260\nBecause there could be\na whole project there, right?\n\n416\n00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.470\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n417\n00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.830\n&gt;&gt; So, I wanna remind you of that formula,\nbecause we're still in the selection.\n\n418\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.400\nWe're wrapping up the selection\npart of the project life cycle.\n\n419\n00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.153\nAnd I just wanna remind you\nagain of that Y=f(x) formula,\n\n420\n00:23:50.153 --> 00:23:54.802\nbecause I want to mention something\nabout Agile in the selection process.\n\n421\n00:23:54.802 --> 00:23:58.043\nSo Y=,\nwhat is it I'm trying to accomplish?\n\n422\n00:23:58.043 --> 00:24:01.813\nIn a lean environment, remember it's\nspecifically what activity am I trying\n\n423\n00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:04.165\nto make better, faster,\nmost cost effective.\n\n424\n00:24:04.165 --> 00:24:09.070\nBut in lean and agile project management,\nwhat is the outcome?\n\n425\n00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.770\nWhat is it I'm trying to\nget out of this project?\n\n426\n00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.310\nThe x's would be any of\nthe inputs that I would need and\n\n427\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.620\nthen the f would be how do\nthose inputs need to function?\n\n428\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.770\nSo Cherokee,\ndo you mind doing one with me?\n\n429\n00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:25.640\nIf I wanted to have the perfect\ntraining session, what would be my x's?\n\n430\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.910\n&gt;&gt; So for an x, an input for\n\n431\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.710\na perfect training session, well you would\nneed some kind of knowledge to transfer.\n\n432\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.190\nSo, you would need\nsomeone with experience.\n\n433\n00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.530\nYou would need some subjects or students.\n\n434\n00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:43.150\nAnd then you would need, depending on the\nformat that you were giving that training,\n\n435\n00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:48.450\nwhether it be an online live or\nhere we're using the internet.\n\n436\n00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.970\nUnless you were teaching in real life and\n\n437\n00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.710\nthen you would need a space to\ngo ahead and have that training.\n\n438\n00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.970\nAnd you might also wanna have some kind\nof training materials or handouts and\n\n439\n00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:59.585\nsome space for the students to work,\njust a few things, I don't know.\n\n440\n00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:01.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n441\n00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:05.500\nif I were trying to think about,\nlike I'm looking in the selection stage.\n\n442\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.670\nMaybe I have a number of different\nprojects that I can choose.\n\n443\n00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.780\nThis is one of the projects\nthat I could choose to work on.\n\n444\n00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.280\nI've looked at the inputs,\nand I've said, you know what?\n\n445\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.720\nI have all those inputs, so\nthis project could be successful.\n\n446\n00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.670\nBut I wanna take one more step back before\nI actually make it my final project and\n\n447\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:26.100\nlook at how those inputs have to function.\n\n448\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.308\nSo for example, let's just take\none of them, which was handouts.\n\n449\n00:25:29.308 --> 00:25:31.520\nHow would handouts have to be,\n\n450\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.400\nhow would they have to work to\nmake my project successful?\n\n451\n00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.157\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I were teaching\na number of classes that week and\n\n452\n00:25:38.157 --> 00:25:41.100\nI had brought maybe the wrong\nhand outs for that class, and\n\n453\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.835\nthen I'm going over over topics, and\nthey're looking at the handouts,\n\n454\n00:25:43.835 --> 00:25:46.945\nand the students are just\nlooking at it all cross-eyed.\n\n455\n00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:49.085\nAnd they're like, none of this\nstuff matches to what she's saying.\n\n456\n00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:50.405\nSo I guess that would be one way.\n\n457\n00:25:50.405 --> 00:25:51.365\n&gt;&gt; So accuracy.\n\n458\n00:25:51.365 --> 00:25:53.965\nSo, my handouts need to be accurate.\n\n459\n00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:55.155\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; That's one.\n\n460\n00:25:55.155 --> 00:25:57.875\nI need to have enough of those handouts,\nright?\n\n461\n00:25:57.875 --> 00:25:59.475\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; So these are things that I could\n\n462\n00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:00.055\nlook at.\n\n463\n00:26:00.055 --> 00:26:03.930\nI've got, when I'm trying to\nselect a project, I know my why.\n\n464\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.280\nOr let's say I have a high level idea\nof what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\n465\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.010\nSo, my first step in selection is to make\nsure I have all the inputs necessary.\n\n466\n00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.030\nBecause if I don't,\nI need to rethink that project or\n\n467\n00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:18.390\ngo back to whoever gave it to me, right?\n\n468\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.560\nBut then,\nI also before I move on to planning,\n\n469\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.540\nI wanna make sure that\nthe inputs are okay.\n\n470\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.651\nThat the inputs all function properly\nin the case of hand-outs that I have\n\n471\n00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:31.528\nenough, etc.\n\n472\n00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:32.500\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Things like that.\n\n473\n00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nNow the reason why we're talking about\n\n474\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.500\nthis again, because we did briefly mention\nit a little earlier in the session.\n\n475\n00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:44.270\nIs that Agile, you can actually go to\nthe planning stage without a Y statement.\n\n476\n00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.050\nAnd that's probably what makes\neveryone a little crazy,\n\n477\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.030\nthe people that are totally in\ntraditional project management.\n\n478\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.350\nIt's like, how can you go from\nselection to planning when you're not\n\n479\n00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.490\ntotally sure what it is\nyou're gonna work on?\n\n480\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.770\nBut just kind of a word to the wise.\n\n481\n00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.420\nIn Agile environments, a lot of times\nyou have selected a project, but\n\n482\n00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.990\nit's not absolutely necessary, because\nthe concept is if you go to the planning\n\n483\n00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.690\nphase, you may uncover some other things.\n\n484\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:16.790\nSo in the DMAIC model, a lot of times some\nof the things that are being used and\n\n485\n00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:21.130\ndefined are used in planning\nin the Agile model.\n\n486\n00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.920\n&gt;&gt; So, I think that pretty much wraps up\n\n487\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.125\nthe selection part of our project\nlife cycle composite model.\n\n488\n00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:34.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So that's the first phase in\nour project life cycle composite model.\n\n489\n00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.160\nI just want to reiterate that\nbecause it is a new term.\n\n490\n00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.640\nSo I appreciate you for taking\nthe time to explain our first phase.\n\n491\n00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.860\nWe have three more headed your way, so\ndon't go anywhere, get comfortable.\n\n492\n00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.080\nBut we are gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n493\n00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.360\nSo, as your show host remember\nmy name is Cherokee Boothe.\n\n494\n00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n495\n00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.665\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n496\n00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:04.502\n[MUSIC]\n\n497\n00:28:04.502 --> 00:28:07.594\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.811\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.210\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.920\nIn the last episode we were looking at our\nProject Life-Cycle Composite methodology.\n\n7\n00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.100\nAnd we looked at the first phase\nwhich is the selection phase.\n\n8\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.960\nHowever in this episode we're gonna\nbe taking a look at the second phase,\n\n9\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.570\nwhich is the planning phase.\n\n10\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.020\nTo help us through this topic we have Dr.\nTara Vanzant Stern in studios today.\n\n11\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.730\nThank you for joining us today Doctor.\n\n12\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.268\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:43.740\n&gt;&gt; So after we exit\n\n14\n00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.730\nthe selection phase we're gonna be\nentering in the planning, is that correct?\n\n15\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.270\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n16\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.090\n&gt;&gt; And what are some things that we\nshould really be looking for and\n\n17\n00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.030\nexecuting during the planning phase?\n\n18\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well I'd like to take\na look at my slide deck and\n\n19\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600\nI'm gonna pull that up right now.\n\n20\n00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.970\nAnd you see this again, it's the book that\nwe're kind of working from the Lean and\n\n21\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.120\nAgile Project Management book.\n\n22\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.890\nAnd actually I want to remind everyone of\nwhat the project life cycle looks like and\n\n23\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.200\nthat's what you're seeing\non the screen right now.\n\n24\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.230\nWe are going to focus in\nthis session on planning.\n\n25\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.485\nI did have a couple of things I wanted\nto mention about selection just to kind\n\n26\n00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.538\nof help us segue into planning.\n\n27\n00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:21.508\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:26.429\n&gt;&gt; The Project Life Cycle,\nas a reminder, is a composite of all\n\n29\n00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.770\nthe different project management\nlife cycles out there.\n\n30\n00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.690\nSome universities are now\nheading towards a seven and\n\n31\n00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.200\neight phase model and\neven in those three bodies of knowledge,\n\n32\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.388\nyou're going to see the life\ncycle look slightly different.\n\n33\n00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:43.410\nOur life cycle,\n\n34\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.260\nhowever, captures all the key things\nthat need to happen in a project.\n\n35\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.750\nWe just think it's leaner.\n\n36\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000\nAnd since this is lean and\nagile project management,\n\n37\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.490\nwe thought atarting with the model\nthat's lean is gonna be very helpful.\n\n38\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.590\nSo we did cover selection\nin the last section but\n\n39\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590\nI wanted to point out a couple\nof things about selection.\n\n40\n00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.510\nAnd these are just kind of funny things.\n\n41\n00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.540\nSo what you're supposed to do is you're\nsupposed to start with a strategic plan.\n\n42\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.360\nBut what really happens\nis projects are reactive.\n\n43\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.730\nI mean people run in and\nthey throw projects on your desk.\n\n44\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.950\nBut in a perfect world in selection,\n\n45\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.300\nyou wanna start with that strategic plan,\nright.\n\n46\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.947\nYou wanna kinda see how does that fit.\n\n47\n00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:24.410\nYou want to decide what is\nimportant in choosing a project but\n\n48\n00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.490\nhere's the reality, common criteria\ndoes not exist or it's not documented.\n\n49\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.060\nSo our book and our material, and really\nwhich is supported by all the bodies of\n\n50\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.030\nproject management, are gonna say\nthat that's an important thing but\n\n51\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.350\nsometimes that criteria\njust is non-existent.\n\n52\n00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.910\nIn a prefect world you wanna establish and\nfollow a specific process.\n\n53\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.880\nIf your working for a company that's not\nused to putting, doing projects there\n\n54\n00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.700\nmight not be a process, you might\nbe kinda making up as you go along.\n\n55\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.020\nAnd so they could have a process,\nno process, or\n\n56\n00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.300\nthe process that they have is out-dated.\n\n57\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.180\n&gt;&gt; Really old.\n\n58\n00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.399\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly\n&gt;&gt; So in a perfect world, in selection,\n\n59\n00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.789\nthe things that are in black\nwould be what you have.\n\n60\n00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.790\nSo use rigor and evaluating alternatives.\n\n61\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.750\nAnd the reality is a lot of\ntimes alternatives have not\n\n62\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.290\nbeen evaluated, right?\n\n63\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.180\nWe kind of,\nwe're living in this reactive society,\n\n64\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.210\nwhich is point one about\nthe projects are reactive.\n\n65\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.030\nBut sometimes we're just in such a rush,\n\n66\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.480\nwe don't really take a step back and\nlook at that.\n\n67\n00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.560\nAnd also in a perfect world,\nyou use a cross-functional team.\n\n68\n00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.060\nBut in reality sometimes\nthe team is just you.\n\n69\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.340\nSo these are things that are supposed\nto happen in the selection process,\n\n70\n00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.270\nthey're certainly what you're striving for\nbut\n\n71\n00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.520\njust don't be discouraged\nif they don't happen.\n\n72\n00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.730\nNow one of the things that\nwe didn't discuss, and\n\n73\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.210\nthe thing that I think is very interesting\nabout the SWOT analysis, is that it wasn't\n\n74\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.500\na project management tool, it wasn't\na lean tool, it wasn't an agile tool.\n\n75\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.650\nBut lean and agile project management\ntake full advantage of this tool.\n\n76\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.850\nSo I'm in the selection process and\n\n77\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.760\nin this case I'm coming up with an idea\nand I want to run it through the SWOT.\n\n78\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.170\nOr perhaps I have several\nprojects I can work on and\n\n79\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.910\nI wanna work on the one that has\nthe biggest bang for its buck.\n\n80\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.910\nNow if you're very interested\nin SWOT this is covered\n\n81\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.890\na little bit more in depth in our\nLean Six Sigma green belt program.\n\n82\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.540\nBut we're just gonna briefly\ngo over it for right now.\n\n83\n00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.980\nSo let's say I have a really great idea.\n\n84\n00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.340\nStrengths is the same way as saying pros.\n\n85\n00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.590\nWeaknesses are the same\nway as saying cons.\n\n86\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.070\nOpportunities are things\nthat could happen.\n\n87\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.400\nThreats are risks that could happen.\n\n88\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.720\nSo if I'm pretty darn sure that\nsomething's gonna happen I'm\n\n89\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.280\ngonna make it a strength.\n\n90\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.630\nIf I am pretty clear than it's gonna be\na detriment I am gonna make it a weakness.\n\n91\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.000\nCommon weaknesses are gonna be time and\nmoney, right?\n\n92\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.442\nThat's gonna always be something.\n\n93\n00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:59.640\nIf I'm doing a new project that's\nprobably either gonna spend time or\n\n94\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.370\nmoney or both, right?\n\n95\n00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.830\nOpportunities, as I said,\nare things that could happen.\n\n96\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.710\nSo if I'm thinking well that would be a\nreally good thing but I really am unclear.\n\n97\n00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.340\nIt could happen it might not happen.\n\n98\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.020\nOpportunities and\nagain the same with threats or risk.\n\n99\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.590\nNow the thing that's really good\nabout this model is that it\n\n100\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.270\nused to be that strengths and weaknesses\nwere the only things that we looked at and\n\n101\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.800\nthat was called a force field analysis.\n\n102\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.570\nBut lean and agile project management says\nif you don't look at the opportunities and\n\n103\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.000\nthreats then you're kind\nof short changing yourself.\n\n104\n00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.680\nSo let's just do one together.\n\n105\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.000\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what's a good topic?\n\n106\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.276\nStarting an exercise program or going\nback to school or cleaning the closet,\n\n107\n00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:41.196\nwhat's a good idea for a project?\n\n108\n00:05:41.196 --> 00:05:45.776\n&gt;&gt; Let's do the exercise one because I\nactually do have a personal goal coming up\n\n109\n00:05:45.776 --> 00:05:49.170\nlike I think many people do at\nthe beginning of a new year.\n\n110\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.140\nAnd sometimes they want to go ahead and\nmake themselves healthier for that year.\n\n111\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.830\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n112\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.130\nAnd audience,\nI'd like you to kind of play along.\n\n113\n00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.130\nGrab a piece of paper.\n\n114\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.730\nDraw a cross on the paper and\nyou'll have those four segments.\n\n115\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee, in your opinion,\n\n116\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.060\nif you started an exercise program, or\nthis one that you're looking to start in\n\n117\n00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.940\nthe next couple of weeks,\nwhat would be a strength, or a pro?\n\n118\n00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.195\n&gt;&gt; The pro would be that I\ncan fit in to my clothes.\n\n119\n00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:19.355\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that,\n\n120\n00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:21.570\nokay that's a good pro.\n\n121\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.040\n&gt;&gt; That I have a healthier\nlifestyle overall.\n\n122\n00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.163\nSo maybe my energy levels are up.\n\n123\n00:06:26.163 --> 00:06:28.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n124\n00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.410\nLet's have one more.\n\n125\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so at least,\nthere has to be, right?\n\n126\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; I would just feel better about myself\n\n127\n00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.900\noverall, confidence level.\n\n128\n00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n129\n00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.520\nNow on the weakness,\nalmost always the weakness is,\n\n130\n00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.290\nthe first two are easy cuz it's gonna\ntake time for you to do that, right?\n\n131\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.020\nAnd it's gonna probably take a little\nbit of money cuz you gotta buy the cute\n\n132\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.059\nclothes to exercise, right?\n\n133\n00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:48.372\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or think of the food.\n\n134\n00:06:48.372 --> 00:06:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Can you think of another-\n&gt;&gt; Healthy food is so expensive, so yeah.\n\n135\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.120\n&gt;&gt; There you go and then healthy food.\n\n136\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.190\nThat's three, so cost,\nI mean, just overall cost.\n\n137\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.840\nLet's see.\n\n138\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.053\n&gt;&gt; The time.\n&gt;&gt; The time.\n\n139\n00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.212\n&gt;&gt; And I think the biggest\nthing would be the dedication.\n\n140\n00:07:02.212 --> 00:07:05.190\n&gt;&gt; The dedication, yeah, exactly.\n\n141\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.760\nOkay so if everything works out perfectly,\n\n142\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.850\nwhat are some of\nthe opportunities that you see?\n\n143\n00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.590\n&gt;&gt; I'd might be able to really get signed\nup for a race that I've been wanting to do\n\n144\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.504\nbut I just haven't have enough\nconfidence or training for.\n\n145\n00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:21.188\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n146\n00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:24.982\n&gt;&gt; I would be able just to have more\nactive lifestyle because, like I said,\n\n147\n00:07:24.982 --> 00:07:26.190\nthe energy is a plus.\n\n148\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.248\nSo can we kind of overlap\nour quadrants like that\n\n149\n00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:28.870\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n150\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.527\nabsolutely\n&gt;&gt; And also I'll put that I can fit,\n\n151\n00:07:31.527 --> 00:07:35.207\nI don't have to buy new clothes because\nI'll be able to fit into my other clothes.\n\n152\n00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:35.979\n&gt;&gt; Your old clothes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:36.606\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n154\n00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:40.434\nNow what are some of the terrible things\nthat might happen if you start a new\n\n155\n00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:41.500\nexercise program?\n\n156\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.870\nWhat are we always afraid of?\n\n157\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.282\n&gt;&gt; Getting injured, so\n\n158\n00:07:44.282 --> 00:07:48.527\nI'm definitely afraid of that\nbecause it has happened before.\n\n159\n00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:50.239\nNot sticking with it, I guess.\n\n160\n00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:51.248\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n161\n00:07:51.248 --> 00:07:51.748\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah those are probably the biggest\n\n162\n00:07:51.748 --> 00:07:54.138\ntwo.\n&gt;&gt; Not sticking with it and\n\n163\n00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:56.306\ngetting injured.\nI don't know,\n\n164\n00:07:56.306 --> 00:07:57.744\nI can't think of anything else that\nwould really be negative for this.\n\n165\n00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.206\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n166\n00:07:59.206 --> 00:08:01.140\nNow, when you're doing this at home, or\n\n167\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.464\nwhen you're doing it for\nyourself for a project,\n\n168\n00:08:03.464 --> 00:08:05.800\nyou wanna strive to get\nthree to five in each box.\n\n169\n00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.710\nBecause if you start discounting stuff,\nso that's what you wanna kind of do.\n\n170\n00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.920\nNow this model is effective if I'm trying\nto figure out which project to do.\n\n171\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.940\nBut the other thing that I think, and it's\nnot utilized for this a lot, except Lean\n\n172\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.690\nand Agile project management is promoting\nthis, is this also a good model to sell?\n\n173\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:30.100\nSo if I want to sell my spouse,\nor my child, or my parents, or\n\n174\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.630\nmy boss on an idea, I fill out\nthe SWOT and we'll do a demonstration.\n\n175\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:40.230\nWhat happens when we present an idea to\nsomeone is that they're sitting there\n\n176\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.840\nthinking, good things, bad things,\ngood things, bad things, right?\n\n177\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.370\nSo where I wanna present\nis from my opportunity box.\n\n178\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.140\nSo if I'm trying to sell you, I still\nwanna fill out the whole schematic.\n\n179\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.060\nBut when I'm trying to sell you,\nI'm gonna sell from the opportunity box.\n\n180\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.020\nSo when I go and tell you I wanna start\nthis exercise program, if I were Cherokee,\n\n181\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.590\nwhat I might say to the people\ninvolved in my world is\n\n182\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.690\nnow I might be able to\nparticipate in that race.\n\n183\n00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.600\nNow I might not have to buy new clothes.\n\n184\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because I can fit into my old\n\n185\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.750\nones, right?\n\n186\n00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.740\nThe other thing is I wanna be prepared for\nthe push back.\n\n187\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.610\nWell the push back is all gonna\ncome from that risk window.\n\n188\n00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.400\nSo the risk window they're gonna say but\nwhat if you got hurt, right.\n\n189\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.050\nSo, what you wanna do is be\nprepared to answer those questions.\n\n190\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.120\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So one of them is what if I got hurt?\n\n191\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.615\nYou're gonna have a strategy.\n\n192\n00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:28.297\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly.\n\n193\n00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:29.879\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen what was the other one you said?\n\n194\n00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:30.536\nThat it would hurt.\n\n195\n00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:33.090\n&gt;&gt; That I would just lose motivation or\ngive up.\n\n196\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.860\n&gt;&gt; You know what?\n\n197\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.755\nYou've lost motivation in the past.\n\n198\n00:09:35.755 --> 00:09:36.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; How do\n\n199\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.510\nyou know you're gonna stick with it.\n\n200\n00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.000\nSo you want to be ready to\nanswer those questions.\n\n201\n00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.470\nSo once again, I'm still kind of\ntalking about the selection part\n\n202\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.842\nof what we call the project\nlifecycle composite, right?\n\n203\n00:09:48.842 --> 00:09:53.730\nAnd in the selection part, the swat\ncould be used if you're blessed and\n\n204\n00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.420\nhave tons of other projects to work on.\n\n205\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.070\nYou're trying to figure out\nwhich one I wanna work on.\n\n206\n00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.070\nOr if you have an idea\nthat you really wanna use,\n\n207\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.720\njust remember fill out the swat.\n\n208\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.848\nYou're gonna sell some opportunities.\n\n209\n00:10:04.848 --> 00:10:09.107\nAnd you're gonna be ready to answer those\nquestions that were captured in the risk\n\n210\n00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:09.670\nsegment.\n\n211\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.940\nSo we're gonna go back and\nlook at the project lifecycle.\n\n212\n00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.040\nAnd as we said at\nthe beginning of the session,\n\n213\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.250\nwe're gonna concentrate on\nthe planning piece, right?\n\n214\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.840\nAnd if you'll just take a moment and\nlook at that red box.\n\n215\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.420\nKeep in mind that the project life cycle\ncomposite that's part of this program will\n\n216\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.380\nbe part of your student package, so\nyou don't have to memorize this.\n\n217\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.240\nThis is just to, excuse me,\nhelp you go along.\n\n218\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.490\nSo one of the things is when we're looking\nat the project planning in this cycle,\n\n219\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.010\nthis is when the project\ncharter comes into place.\n\n220\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.480\nObjectives, and scoping.\n\n221\n00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.220\nProject charters, what Lean and Agile has\ndone and this is part of your student\n\n222\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.160\npacket, has taken the project charter and\nmade it one page.\n\n223\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.100\nIf you go surf the internet, you'll see\nthat there are some project charters.\n\n224\n00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.000\nAnd in fact, I think in one of\nthe programs you were in, Cherokee,\n\n225\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.405\nwe had an eight page project charter.\n\n226\n00:11:04.405 --> 00:11:05.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well now,\n\n227\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.460\nour project charter's only one page.\n\n228\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.540\nNow, it might morph into\nbeing more than one page.\n\n229\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.310\nBut we've made it a little clearer and\neasier to understand.\n\n230\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.470\nSo that's one thing that lean and agile\ndid to traditional project management,\n\n231\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.770\nit's that this is ridiculous.\n\n232\n00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.490\nA project charter that's eight or\nten pages, that's not lean at all, right?\n\n233\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.680\nAnd that is part of your package.\n\n234\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.580\nYou wanna remember that it's important\nto use some of your flow charting tools.\n\n235\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.315\nAnd the reason in project management,\nunlike process improvement.\n\n236\n00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:38.347\nIn process improvement we're using a flow\nchart because we wanna get a clearer\n\n237\n00:11:38.347 --> 00:11:40.190\nas is picture of where we are today.\n\n238\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.751\nIn project management,\n\n239\n00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:46.520\nflow charts are handy to track the\nprocesses that might touch your project.\n\n240\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.760\nThe processes that\nare working around like, and\n\n241\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.500\nalso where does this project\nfit in the process flow?\n\n242\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.980\nSo you're looking at our process map,\nmore in the sense of,\n\n243\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.950\nwhere do I fit into the company?\n\n244\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:07.760\nWe do our project planning in WBS, because\nwhen we get to the execution stage,\n\n245\n00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.400\nand we looked at that\nin an earlier session.\n\n246\n00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.490\nWhen we get to the execution phase,\n\n247\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.420\nthen all we have to do is\nfollow that step-by-step plan.\n\n248\n00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.470\nBut in the planning part,\n\n249\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.640\nthat's where we're developing\nour work breakdown structure.\n\n250\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.100\nNow, traditional project management has\nalways been in favor of work breakdown\n\n251\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.380\nstructure, the Lean piece of this, now,\nAgile handles it a little bit differently,\n\n252\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.560\nwhich we'll be talking\nabout in just a second.\n\n253\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.370\nOn the Lean side,\nwhat makes it a little bit leaner, and\n\n254\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.770\nthis is almost gonna sound\ncounterintuitive is that Lean suggests\n\n255\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.040\nyou break out every single\npiece of morsel that you can.\n\n256\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.939\nNow, on my project plan,\nit might say 1.1.20.9.\n\n257\n00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:49.956\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What I give to my employer or\n\n258\n00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:52.283\nto anyone that's interested in my project,\n\n259\n00:12:52.283 --> 00:12:56.370\nstill just gonna be the high level,\nstep one, step two, step three.\n\n260\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.120\nAnd even though it seems counterintuitive,\nLean says break it down as\n\n261\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.960\ntiny as you can, because then\nyou're gonna get a more accurate\n\n262\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.099\npicture of what you need as far as time\nand cost and resources are concerned.\n\n263\n00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.910\nAnother thing that we can look at in\nplanning that's a total lean tool,\n\n264\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.370\nis called the Gemba Walk.\n\n265\n00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.300\nNow this just says Gemba, and\n\n266\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.700\nGemba just means you go to the place\nthat the work is happening.\n\n267\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.270\nThe reason why we didn't\nput Gemba Walk in there,\n\n268\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.250\nalthough Gemba Walk is one of the tools\nI wanna just briefly mention,\n\n269\n00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.300\nis that as a project manager,\nI think it's very important and\n\n270\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.570\nvery lean if you aren't in the environment\nyou're doing the project for.\n\n271\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.540\nTo just go hang out there for\na couple of days.\n\n272\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.130\nIt's amazing all the things\nthat you pick up.\n\n273\n00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.960\nNow on typical project management\nthey're not gonna really be\n\n274\n00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.370\ntoo concerned about that.\n\n275\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.370\nBut, if you're a Lean and\n\n276\n00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.730\nAgile project manager,\nyou wanna go hang out in that department.\n\n277\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.150\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're gonna be seeing things\nthat might have been documented and that\n\n278\n00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:54.320\nare actually transpiring on the production\nfloor and you really get that hands-on.\n\n279\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.080\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and then, we're gonna\nwrap up with something called the SIPOC.\n\n280\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.850\nAnd again, we're gonna briefly go through\nthat and if you love the SIPOC and\n\n281\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.750\nyou can see where you would use it\nin planning as a project manager.\n\n282\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.200\nYou can go for more in-depth on\nthe Lean Six Sigma Green belt tapes.\n\n283\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n284\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, so on the project charter,\n\n285\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.800\nyou're trying to lean out\nyour project charter.\n\n286\n00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.451\nNow, if your company already has a projet\ncharter that they want you to use,\n\n287\n00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:25.265\nwell Lean kind of supports\nuse what's available.\n\n288\n00:14:25.265 --> 00:14:29.710\nAgile kind of supports\ncleaning up a little bit.\n\n289\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.783\nWhat I would suggest is if it's your\nfirst time out for a project and\n\n290\n00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:38.750\nthey have a project charter use theirs but\njust focus on these particular areas.\n\n291\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:43.737\nSome companies don't have a formal project\nchartering process, and so a Lean way\n\n292\n00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:48.830\nto write an email, because in that,\nin fact, becomes your project charter.\n\n293\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.590\nAnd remember, you want a project charter,\n\n294\n00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.720\nbecause later, if someone is thinking you\nwere supposed to be doing something else,\n\n295\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.620\nyou can go back and say I did this form,\nand this is what we all agreed on, right?\n\n296\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.160\nSo in your email, if you wanna be lean,\n\n297\n00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.990\nwhat you wanna do is you wanna cover\nthe project goal and objective.\n\n298\n00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.060\nYou wanna say who your sponsor is or\n\n299\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.750\nask who's my sponsor because\nsometimes that might be the question.\n\n300\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.930\nThe sponsor is always whoever\ngave the final permission for\n\n301\n00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:18.010\nyou to move forward and\nhave the budget for you to do that.\n\n302\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.242\nSo sometimes that's your boss's boss.\n\n303\n00:15:20.242 --> 00:15:23.940\nYou wanna include the stakeholders,\nand stakeholders and\n\n304\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.930\nproject management\nare anyone that's impacted.\n\n305\n00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.900\nNow sometimes, when we work on the you'll\nsee there's a lot of people that\n\n306\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.780\nare impacted by your project.\n\n307\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.180\nOn your project charter,\nyou wanna put the high level people.\n\n308\n00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.520\nAnd remember, you're a stakeholder.\n\n309\n00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.470\nEven if Your boss's boss's boss is\nthe one that said you can go ahead.\n\n310\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:48.120\nYour boss is definitely a stakeholder\nbecause your work reflects on them, right?\n\n311\n00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.986\nYou wanna say your timeline and we talked\nabout when you do your WBS, if you've\n\n312\n00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:57.781\ntaken that WBS and broken it down Into\ntiny morsels that's gonna be easier for\n\n313\n00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.273\nyou to judge your time.\n\n314\n00:15:59.273 --> 00:16:02.813\nYou're just gonna wanna remember that some\nthings might have to happen in a certain\n\n315\n00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:04.000\nsequence.\n\n316\n00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.460\nYou wanna talk about your\nresources required, and\n\n317\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:11.430\nagain, just like we said in the opening\nof the session, sometimes it's team you.\n\n318\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.800\nBut you might still need\nadvice from other people.\n\n319\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.480\nYou might need nonhuman resources.\n\n320\n00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.270\nAnd then you want your deliverables.\n\n321\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.710\nAnd we said in an earlier session,\ndeliverables are anything that you're\n\n322\n00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.600\ngoing to give the person\nyou're doing the project for.\n\n323\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.650\nBut this is a way to lean\nout your project charter.\n\n324\n00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:34.385\nSo if you've got a project charter at\nyour office, and it's eight or ten pages.\n\n325\n00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:35.085\nWe're not saying,\n\n326\n00:16:35.085 --> 00:16:37.725\nthere may be a requirement that\nthat's what they want you to use.\n\n327\n00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:39.535\nBut if you focus on these bullets,\n\n328\n00:16:39.535 --> 00:16:42.875\neven when you go to the longer form,\nit's gonna be faster to fill out.\n\n329\n00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:45.395\nBecause these are the most\nimportant things.\n\n330\n00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:49.905\nNow some of the other things that are\nincluded in a full-blown project charter\n\n331\n00:16:49.905 --> 00:16:52.770\nare how the decisions\nare going to be made.\n\n332\n00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.660\nThe assumptions, and\n\n333\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.340\nwe're saying assumptions\nare anything that we're saying.\n\n334\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.940\nI'm gonna do this project, but\nI'm assuming, for example,\n\n335\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.080\nyou give me an office.\n\n336\n00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:03.317\nAnd these are all the things\nthat we're doing and planning.\n\n337\n00:17:03.317 --> 00:17:08.619\nWe wanna get this all up front and settled\nbefore we move into execution, right?\n\n338\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.777\nWe might want to, if there's some\nbusiness process changes and\n\n339\n00:17:13.777 --> 00:17:17.919\neven though it's not on the list,\nif you're doing a project that\n\n340\n00:17:17.919 --> 00:17:22.620\ncould be impacted by an act that's\nbeing passed or there's some coding.\n\n341\n00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.852\nThat would all fall into that.\n\n342\n00:17:24.852 --> 00:17:27.330\nYou wanna make sure that if\nyou're not the project manager,\n\n343\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.570\nthat you say who the project manager is,\nwho the team is, budget, signatures.\n\n344\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.290\nSo that's more in a full\nblown project charter.\n\n345\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:39.030\nSo if you stick to the stuff on\nthe left-hand side, you're covered if\n\n346\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.990\nyou're not doing a formal project charter,\nyou're just basically telling your boss.\n\n347\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.210\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Sending that email or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sending that email, exactly.\n\n348\n00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.000\nSo here's an example of process mapping.\n\n349\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.659\nNow in process improvement, which we cover\nin the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt program,\n\n350\n00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:57.801\nthere's a commitment to knowing what's\nhappening now in order to make some\n\n351\n00:17:57.801 --> 00:18:02.220\nimprovements, in order to make things\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n352\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.126\nAs a project manager It's important,\nas we said earlier in this session,\n\n353\n00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:09.120\njust to figure out,\nwhere do I fit in the puzzle?\n\n354\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.290\nSo one thing that you can do is you can do\na overall process map for your department.\n\n355\n00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.790\nAnd then do something\ncalled a swim lane chart.\n\n356\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.610\nAnd in the swim lane chart,\nthis is very lean, it just says,\n\n357\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.110\nwhat types of things happen\nin different departments.\n\n358\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.440\nNow along the left hand side,\nI mean the right hand side, sorry.\n\n359\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.030\nYou'll see different departments.\n\n360\n00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.590\nBut those could be different\npeople's names in your department.\n\n361\n00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.184\nSo that could be Barry, Bob, Sue, right?\n\n362\n00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:40.095\nThe reason why you might\nbe doing a process map and\n\n363\n00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:45.000\nplanning is you're trying to get a high\nlevel idea of what's going on around you.\n\n364\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.180\nYou wanna know that first\nbefore you start executing.\n\n365\n00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.640\nSo if you have a piece that you need to\nexecute, that needs another department, or\n\n366\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.190\nsomeone in your group is\ngonna be responsible for it.\n\n367\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.662\nThat would be why you would\nbe doing a process map.\n\n368\n00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.840\nIt also helps you create\nyour project scope.\n\n369\n00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.020\nAnd we talked a little\nearlier about project scope.\n\n370\n00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.530\nIt's almost easier to think backwards.\n\n371\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.430\nWhen I'm in the planning process,\nwhat am I not agreeing to?\n\n372\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.840\nYour project scope is going to come,\n\n373\n00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.150\nis gonna almost be natural\nif you stick to that WBS.\n\n374\n00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.650\nBecause if you're looking at your\nwork breakdown structure and\n\n375\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.490\nyou're calculating everything that you're\nsaying you're gonna be responsible for.\n\n376\n00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:28.330\nYou can come up with a scoping statement.\n\n377\n00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:33.670\nNow a lot of times, just to be leaner,\nwe say, that in lean and\n\n378\n00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.180\nagile environments, especially,\nyou'll notice this in agile environments.\n\n379\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.830\nIf there is a way that you can create\na sentence that includes all of that,\n\n380\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.380\nthat's great.\n\n381\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.266\nSo kind of practice that elevator speech.\n\n382\n00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.890\nThis is what I I'm going to do,\nthis is why I'm going to do it,\n\n383\n00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.760\nand this is what I'm not gonna do.\n\n384\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.626\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Okay that's\nwhat I was getting at.\n\n385\n00:19:51.626 --> 00:19:56.369\nIt's all right to kind of clearly define,\nthis is not what will be happening if you\n\n386\n00:19:56.369 --> 00:19:59.807\nalready have an idea that you\nknow that's what they want but\n\n387\n00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:03.170\nreally your number one\npriority is something else.\n\n388\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.650\nAnd you feel as there may be\na tendency for them to try to add on.\n\n389\n00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.590\nBut you can clearly say,\n\n390\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.830\nlook, we're gonna put this in that,\nso we don't see that scope creep, and\n\n391\n00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.690\nwe have to plan it and budget out\nseparately for that particular project.\n\n392\n00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n393\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.705\nSo I'm still in the planning phase and\nnow what I'm gonna talk a little bit about\n\n394\n00:20:21.705 --> 00:20:25.355\nis the difference between traditional\nplanning and agile planning.\n\n395\n00:20:25.355 --> 00:20:29.215\nSo on the traditional project management\nplanning side, and keep in mind,\n\n396\n00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:31.985\nthese days, they can be mixed,\nand they can morph over.\n\n397\n00:20:31.985 --> 00:20:36.505\nBut if I were just a traditional project\nmanager, I'd be looking at scope review.\n\n398\n00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:41.160\nI wanna make sure that my scope's correct,\nI'm gonna be selecting my team members.\n\n399\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.640\nI'm gonna plan my deliverables and\nI'm gonna review it and\n\n400\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.880\nmake sure everybody agrees, hey,\nthese deliverables are the right ones.\n\n401\n00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.720\nI might even run it by my,\nwhoever, I'm doing the project for\n\n402\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.390\nbefore I actually end up with my formal\nplan, anything that I can piece out.\n\n403\n00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.810\nI'm gonna look at my CTQs which we'll\nbe covering a little bit later.\n\n404\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.620\nAnd then I'm also going to come up\nwith my baseline schedule, which,\n\n405\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.610\nremember, we've said this a lot,\nthat's how long I say it's gonna take, and\n\n406\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:10.780\nhow much it's gonna cost, right?\n\n407\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.490\nSo that's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna be\ndoing that if I'm a traditional project\n\n408\n00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.240\nmanager, or if I'm a lean project manager.\n\n409\n00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.960\nThat's kind of the path I'm gonna take.\n\n410\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.890\nNow, if I'm managing it\nin an agile environment,\n\n411\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.920\nmy planning is gonna take\nkind of an extra step.\n\n412\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.630\nSome of those things are still\ngonna take place, right?\n\n413\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.160\nBut one of the things I'm\ngonna concentrate on is roles.\n\n414\n00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.360\nWho's doing what?\n\n415\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.653\nAnd what I think is so beautiful about\nthis is that there's been a number of very\n\n416\n00:21:41.653 --> 00:21:47.160\npopular works done on why\nemployees leave companies.\n\n417\n00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.170\nAnd one of the number one reasons is\nthey don't really understand their\n\n418\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:50.980\nexpectations.\n\n419\n00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.870\nThey don't know what it is\nthey're supposed to do.\n\n420\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:53.831\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I can see that, yeah.\n\n421\n00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:55.883\n&gt;&gt; And it's like,\nI have a job description,\n\n422\n00:21:55.883 --> 00:21:58.630\nI'm not doing anything\nlike my job description.\n\n423\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.760\nNow the nice thing, if you're running\nthis more like a scrum manager instead of\n\n424\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.980\na traditional project manager,\nis you're not really responsible for\n\n425\n00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.760\ntheir role in the company.\n\n426\n00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.530\nSo that kind of takes\na little pressure off.\n\n427\n00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.070\nJust the role in this particular project.\n\n428\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.040\nBut agile feels like it's important\nthat before we go execute,\n\n429\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.680\nthat everyone really understands,\nwhat is their piece?\n\n430\n00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.350\nSo in the planning process,\nyou wanna talk that out.\n\n431\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.768\nAnd sometimes it's not gonna necessarily\nbe the person that you think it's\n\n432\n00:22:26.768 --> 00:22:27.534\ngoing to be.\n\n433\n00:22:27.534 --> 00:22:30.560\nI mean you can toss things out and\nit's you know.\n\n434\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.420\nSo there's also the ScrumMaster.\n\n435\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.490\nNow the other thing in agile environments\nis that you might be the ScrumMaster for\n\n436\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.680\none project but not the other.\n\n437\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.154\nYou might be a team member, you might\nhave simultaneous projects going on.\n\n438\n00:22:42.154 --> 00:22:44.920\nAnd you're in charge of one but\nnot in charge of the other.\n\n439\n00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.970\nIn traditional project\nmanagement environments,\n\n440\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.890\nthere's usually one\nperson who is designated.\n\n441\n00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.060\nYou are the project manager, right?\n\n442\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.492\nBut in these environments, if you\nhave a little bit more expertise, and\n\n443\n00:22:57.492 --> 00:22:58.510\nthe training and\n\n444\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.883\nstuff, there's no reason why you\nmight not be managing that project.\n\n445\n00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:03.930\nAnd then the team.\n\n446\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.230\nWho's gonna be working on this?\n\n447\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.860\nAnd remember, in the agile environments,\nsince things are segmented out,\n\n448\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.190\nit's really important to know who's\nyour team for this particular project.\n\n449\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.740\nThere are different what\nthey call ceremonies.\n\n450\n00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.160\nThe sprint planning, the sprint review.\n\n451\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.800\nThe sprint retrospective,\nthat's kind of hard to say.\n\n452\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.000\nAnd the daily scrum.\n\n453\n00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.213\nSo in the planning phase,\nwhat you're doing in that\n\n454\n00:23:27.213 --> 00:23:30.948\nproject lifecycle is you're\nkind of putting dates to that.\n\n455\n00:23:30.948 --> 00:23:33.960\nNow a daily scrum meeting, you don't\nreally have to put a date to that.\n\n456\n00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.580\nI mean, Monday through Friday,\nwe're gonna have our daily scrum, right?\n\n457\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.630\nSprint, retrospectives and reviews and\nplanning all kind of come together.\n\n458\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.718\nSprint, remember, typically two to four\nweeks but they can be shorter or longer.\n\n459\n00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:49.070\nThat's just kind of a generalization.\n\n460\n00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:52.842\nWe're gonna have at the End of each\none of those sprints, a review?\n\n461\n00:23:52.842 --> 00:23:55.249\nAnd then at the end of the reviews,\nwe're gonna go back and\n\n462\n00:23:55.249 --> 00:23:57.490\nsay, what did we do wrong,\nwhat did we do right?\n\n463\n00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.880\nWhat do we wanna keep and\nmove forward with?\n\n464\n00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.360\nSo when you're in the planning\nphase of the project lifecycle,\n\n465\n00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.097\nat this point, I think the biggest\nthing you're looking at is more,\n\n466\n00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:09.104\nwhen are we going to do that, right?\n\n467\n00:24:09.104 --> 00:24:12.062\nSome of it's gonna be very natural,\nbut getting it on the calendar,\n\n468\n00:24:12.062 --> 00:24:15.587\ngetting everyone's buy in, that these\nare the times we're gonna need, right?\n\n469\n00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:19.727\nSo that is part of the planning process,\nand then looking at things like\n\n470\n00:24:19.727 --> 00:24:24.695\nthe backlog, like Sprint backlog, burndown\ncharts, we might actually, if we were\n\n471\n00:24:24.695 --> 00:24:28.904\ndoing this in a more agile environment,\nagree on the tools, look at what\n\n472\n00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:33.880\nwe've got still on the table that we still\nneed to finish, and those types of things.\n\n473\n00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:39.580\nSo the planning might have to be\na little bit longer in Sprint.\n\n474\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.390\nI mean, I'm sorry in Agile.\n\n475\n00:24:42.761 --> 00:24:45.134\nSo here's the Sprint planning meeting, and\n\n476\n00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:49.006\nthis I'm just gonna go through very\nquickly because this is the example of\n\n477\n00:24:49.006 --> 00:24:51.910\na handout you'll get in\nyour student package.\n\n478\n00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.140\nWhat we're trying to do is to be lean, so\n\n479\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.280\nwe're putting a lot of\ninformation on one page.\n\n480\n00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.820\nAnd the reason why that's lean,\nis because if you're in a meeting and\n\n481\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.240\nyou need to pull it out,\nall the information is right there.\n\n482\n00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.670\nIt doesn't make for a good slide, so\nwhen you're doing presentations, you\n\n483\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.420\ntypically don't want, we're just showing\nyou an example of what you're gonna get.\n\n484\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.117\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n485\n00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:14.808\n&gt;&gt; But you typically don't want all\nof this [CROSSTALK] information on\n\n486\n00:25:14.808 --> 00:25:15.630\nthe slide, right?\n\n487\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.109\nBut we do, the handouts, I think having\nas much information as possible,\n\n488\n00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:24.392\nas long it's still clear, kind of\nis a good idea, and it's very lean.\n\n489\n00:25:26.378 --> 00:25:29.507\nSo this kind of explains a lot of\nwhat I was just talking about,\n\n490\n00:25:29.507 --> 00:25:33.357\nthe different types and keep in mind,\nyou're in the planning phase, and so\n\n491\n00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:37.569\nif you're doing more of an agile project,\nthese types of things are gonna come up,\n\n492\n00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:41.840\nwhere it's a little bit more dictatorial\nin the traditional project management.\n\n493\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.757\nThis is what we're gonna do, here's our\nmeetings In the Agile environment and\n\n494\n00:25:45.757 --> 00:25:48.340\nplanning, everyone kinda\nhas a little bit of a say.\n\n495\n00:25:49.866 --> 00:25:53.737\nSo one of the things that's important,\nand this is in all projects,\n\n496\n00:25:53.737 --> 00:25:57.360\nis that you understand the project\ngoal versus the objectives.\n\n497\n00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.940\nAnd this is, you can take a whole class\non goals, objectives, mission, vision.\n\n498\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.910\nSo I'm not gonna really belabor this, but\n\n499\n00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:11.570\nit's important that the project\ngoals represents your intent.\n\n500\n00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.200\nAnd this is kind of a bit\nof a sticky wicket.\n\n501\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.020\nYou don't wanna leave the planning\nphase unless you've got that down.\n\n502\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.130\nAnd a lot of times,\nwe said this earlier in other sessions,\n\n503\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.779\nsometimes we're on a road that's not\nthe road we're supposed to be on, right?\n\n504\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.870\n&gt;&gt; And just to ask a quick question.\n\n505\n00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.750\nWere we looking at the same duration for\neach one of these phases?\n\n506\n00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.960\nIs that how we were breaking it up?\n\n507\n00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:41.760\nOr is it really confined to any kind\nof time limits there for each phase?\n\n508\n00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.570\n&gt;&gt; That's such a good question, Cherokee.\n\n509\n00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.580\nBecause, the thing is, is that\nthe selection phase could end up taking\n\n510\n00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.770\na while, if you have to run your project\nideas through a steering committee.\n\n511\n00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.940\nSo you may have to end up spending a\nlittle bit more time in project selection.\n\n512\n00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.210\nIf it's just you and your boss,\nselection can go really fast.\n\n513\n00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:05.090\nOr it might be you have so many projects\nto work on, the only thing you're doing is\n\n514\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.110\ntrying to figure out which\none that you wanna work on.\n\n515\n00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.781\nAnd then that SWOT analysis will help you.\n\n516\n00:27:09.781 --> 00:27:14.513\nPlanning, just like anything else,\nthe more time you can spend in planning,\n\n517\n00:27:14.513 --> 00:27:15.812\nthe better, right?\n\n518\n00:27:15.812 --> 00:27:20.242\nBut most of your time is gonna happen\nin the third phase, which is execution,\n\n519\n00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:23.531\nthat's where you're gonna\nspend the most of your time.\n\n520\n00:27:23.531 --> 00:27:28.447\nSo what you wanna do when you're looking\nat the phases, is you wanna figure out,\n\n521\n00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:31.934\nwhen is the project due,\nyou wanna work from backwards.\n\n522\n00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:35.002\nSo If the project's due next month,\non the 15th,\n\n523\n00:27:35.002 --> 00:27:39.603\nthat gives you an idea of how much can I\nreally spend in each one of those phases,\n\n524\n00:27:39.603 --> 00:27:41.935\nif the objective is supposed to be met?\n\n525\n00:27:41.935 --> 00:27:46.079\nBut I think it's the same thing as when\nyou're working with the DMAIC model,\n\n526\n00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:48.755\nin the DMAIC model which\nis a Lean Six Sigma model,\n\n527\n00:27:48.755 --> 00:27:51.660\nyou wanna spend as much\ntime as you can and define.\n\n528\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.710\nBut just keep in mind that in Improve,\nthat's where all the action's\n\n529\n00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.890\ngonna happen, so\nyou don't wanna short change yourself.\n\n530\n00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.690\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you.\n\n531\n00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.200\n&gt;&gt; So I think we're very,\nvery good planners.\n\n532\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.900\nAnd that when we move over into the next\nphase that we're gonna be talking about,\n\n533\n00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.900\nexecution, some crazy\nthings happen sometimes.\n\n534\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.712\nSo we were talking about project\ngoal versus the objective.\n\n535\n00:28:10.712 --> 00:28:14.322\nWe wanna make sure before we leave,\nthat our goals represents our intent.\n\n536\n00:28:14.322 --> 00:28:18.330\nWe wanna make sure that there are things\nthat we can cross off our list\n\n537\n00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.230\nespecially for an agile environment\nbecause remember in the agile environment,\n\n538\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.040\nas opposed to a WBS, sometimes they\nlike to used burned down chart.\n\n539\n00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.020\nSo we want to make sure that the\nactivities that we're planning are things\n\n540\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.650\nthat we can cross of, right,\nso we can burn down our chart.\n\n541\n00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:36.210\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nthe projects have specific tasks.\n\n542\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.850\nSo these are all kinds of things\nthat we're talking about when in\n\n543\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.220\nthe planning phase.\n\n544\n00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.090\nWe wanna make sure if we're doing the WBS,\n\n545\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.740\nwhich is still the preferred way\nto present your project plan,\n\n546\n00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.650\neven in an agile environment, if you have\na way of presenting what you're gonna do,\n\n547\n00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.500\nit's gonna be easier, we just wanna\nmake sure that we involve people.\n\n548\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.660\nAnd we mention the GEMBA Planning.\n\n549\n00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.230\nSometimes it's important to just walk\naround, hang out in departments.\n\n550\n00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.650\nIf there's a process that\nimpacts your project,\n\n551\n00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.260\nthen I would suggest a GEMBA walk.\n\n552\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.040\nAnd that's where you go grab\na couple of people, and\n\n553\n00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.250\nyou just walk the process because,\nto Cherokee's point,\n\n554\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.920\nyou're gonna see some things that\nyou might have missed, right?\n\n555\n00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.730\nAnd then finally, I wanted to show\nyou a model called the SIPOC and\n\n556\n00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.094\nthe SIPOC model is,\nas I mentioned earlier in the session,\n\n557\n00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:26.450\ncovered in depth in\nthe Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n558\n00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:28.000\nWe're just gonna quickly look at it,\n\n559\n00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.660\nit is a template that you\nhave in your student package.\n\n560\n00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.500\nBut I just wanna quickly show you how this\ncould be a very great planning tool, and\n\n561\n00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.530\nthis comes from the Lean and\nSixSigma environment, but\n\n562\n00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.650\nAgile people use it as well.\n\n563\n00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.350\nSo if I were looking at a SIPOC,\nit stands for\n\n564\n00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.760\nsupplier, input, process,\noutput and customer.\n\n565\n00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.000\nAnd just very quickly, Cherokee, if you\nwere thinking about suppliers which is\n\n566\n00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.180\njust another word for vendors,\nwho are some vendors for your supermarket?\n\n567\n00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.160\n&gt;&gt; That would be whomever\nhas the groceries.\n\n568\n00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.120\nSo I guess the farmers?\n\n569\n00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.210\nAnd I know you wanted to really stress\nthat suppliers could also be internal,\n\n570\n00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.200\nso maybe\n&gt;&gt; You're waiting on a signature from\n\n571\n00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.720\nsomeone.\n\n572\n00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so anyone who works within\nthat organization or that grocery store.\n\n573\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.330\nOther suppliers would\nbe the utility company,\n\n574\n00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.270\nto make sure that that building has power.\n\n575\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.500\nWhoever is managing that point of sale\nsystem, your Internet service provider,\n\n576\n00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.510\nso I guess utilities.\n\n577\n00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.\n\n578\n00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.980\nYeah, that's plenty.\n\n579\n00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.710\nAnd if you were doing this in real life,\n\n580\n00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.580\nyou wouldn't stop until you\ngot them all down, right?\n\n581\n00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.640\nInput, who is walking through\nyour supermarket doors?\n\n582\n00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.160\n&gt;&gt; That is going to be our customers or\nour patrons.\n\n583\n00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.520\nAny kind of maintenance people, employees.\n\n584\n00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:50.427\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nAnd\n\n585\n00:30:50.427 --> 00:30:55.409\nthen we get to processes in a supermarket,\nthere's the butcher process,\n\n586\n00:30:55.409 --> 00:30:57.551\nthere's the produce process.\n\n587\n00:30:57.551 --> 00:31:01.503\n&gt;&gt; Making sandwiches in the deli and\nbaking the gorgeous cakes [LAUGH].\n\n588\n00:31:01.503 --> 00:31:03.263\n&gt;&gt; Tons of processes, right?\n\n589\n00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:07.512\n&gt;&gt; And then the output, what goes out\nof your supermarket, what's a big one?\n\n590\n00:31:07.512 --> 00:31:09.853\n&gt;&gt; The groceries.\n&gt;&gt; Groceries, okay and customers again.\n\n591\n00:31:09.853 --> 00:31:10.995\n&gt;&gt; Your customers, yes.\n\n592\n00:31:10.995 --> 00:31:12.246\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay.\n\n593\n00:31:12.246 --> 00:31:13.066\n&gt;&gt; Carts.\n\n594\n00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:16.972\n&gt;&gt; Carts and then when I'm thinking\nabout customers at my supermarket,\n\n595\n00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:21.880\nwhen I'm thinking about customers,\ndefinitely my customers that buy the food.\n\n596\n00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.770\nBut there could be the neighborhood,\nI mean I'm sure a lot of you have seen\n\n597\n00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.880\nthose specials about where\nthey put grocery stores, so\n\n598\n00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.895\nmy neighborhood, my community,\nmaybe the franchise I belong to.\n\n599\n00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:37.940\nSo we define customers in the SIPOC model\nas anyone that you have to keep happy.\n\n600\n00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.110\nNow you can do this pencil and paper.\n\n601\n00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.870\nAnd what you can end up with, and this is\nan example of a template that you will\n\n602\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.400\nreceive in your student pack,\nis something that looks like this.\n\n603\n00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.260\nSo, as you're planning, you can say,\nokay, well here's all the vendors and\n\n604\n00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.710\nsuppliers that play into my project.\n\n605\n00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.560\nHere's the input and the output.\n\n606\n00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.260\nThis is what's gonna go into my project,\nthis is ultimately what I'm hoping will go\n\n607\n00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.960\nout, here's all the processes and\nI'm looking in this case again for\n\n608\n00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.880\nprocesses that might impact my project and\nmy customers.\n\n609\n00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.630\nWho do I need to keep happy?\n\n610\n00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:17.210\nAnd the other,\nI think this one's even a little funner,\n\n611\n00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.920\nif you don't have a lot of\ntime as a project manager,\n\n612\n00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.330\nyou don't have to fill in all of that\nstuff, you can create the template,\n\n613\n00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.170\nor the form, kind of just on your\nwhiteboard and you can segment it out.\n\n614\n00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Do this during a meeting?\n\n615\n00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:30.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n616\n00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.750\nAnd bring your team in and say hey,\n\n617\n00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:37.170\nwho are our suppliers, who is the input,\nwhat are some of the process.\n\n618\n00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.250\nAnd then when you get into process,\nyou can put your process maps there.\n\n619\n00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:46.520\nSo especially, this is especially good if\nyou're in IT or if you are a consultant.\n\n620\n00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.280\nBecause if they want you\nto work on a project,\n\n621\n00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.500\nthis is a fast way to figure out in\nthe planning stage, who's involved.\n\n622\n00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n623\n00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.588\nSo I think that's about it on the planning\nphase of the Project lifecycle\n\n624\n00:32:58.588 --> 00:32:59.660\ncomposite module.\n\n625\n00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did cover quite a bit.\n\n626\n00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.820\nWe were able to kind of recap\nthat selection phase and\n\n627\n00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.000\nwe also looked at our SWOT Analysis.\n\n628\n00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.250\nWe looked at the planning phase and\ntools such as our side poc and\n\n629\n00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.150\nrunning through with a Gemba walk.\n\n630\n00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.410\nBut I think that's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n631\n00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.750\nStay tuned,\nwe're coming back with the next phase.\n\n632\n00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.250\nSo don't go anywhere.\n\n633\n00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.220\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular episode.\n\n634\n00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.660\nAnd I'm your show host, Cherokee Booths.\n\n635\n00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.520\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr. Tara Vanstandt Stern,\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n636\n00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.788\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n637\n00:33:32.788 --> 00:33:38.937\n[MUSIC]\n\n638\n00:33:38.937 --> 00:33:40.980\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:12.027\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:15.830\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.350\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.050\nNow if you've been following along,\n\n7\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.670\nyou'll know that we've been taking a look\nat our project life cycle composite.\n\n8\n00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.190\nIn the last episode, we were really\nfocusing on the planning phase, and\n\n9\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.320\nin this episode we're gonna get started\nlooking at the execution phase.\n\n10\n00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.945\nAnd to help us with that, we have Doctor\nTerra Vanzant Stern in studio today.\n\n11\n00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:38.785\nThank you for joining us today Doctor.\n\n12\n00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:40.110\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920\n&gt;&gt; So Dr. Stern, is there anything that we\nneed to do before we leave the planning\n\n14\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.790\nphase to actually begin\nthe execution of our project?\n\n15\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm so glad that you asked that\nCherokee cuz there were a couple of things\n\n16\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.900\nthat we didn't talk about in selection\nthat I'd like to talk about first before\n\n17\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.050\nwe go into execution.\n\n18\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.420\nAnd if we can go to my slide deck,\nthis is a reminder\n\n19\n00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.600\nof the book that we're working from,\nLean and Agile Project Management and\n\n20\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.910\na reminder that we're working\nwithin the Project Life Cycle.\n\n21\n00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.590\nThis segment, as Cherokee said,\nis gonna focus on execute, but\n\n22\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.080\nI'd like to talk a couple of tools that\nyou might be able to use in selection.\n\n23\n00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.710\nIn selection?\n\n24\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.570\n&gt;&gt; I mean I'm sorry.\n\n25\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.230\nIn planning.\n[LAUGH]\n\n26\n00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.950\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no worries.\n\n27\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.780\nI just wanted to verify.\n\n28\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the planning part.\n\n29\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.470\nOne of the things in planning\nthat might be very important,\n\n30\n00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.250\nis to sequence the tasks.\n\n31\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.545\nNow this wouldn't really matter if I\nwere in a traditional Lean or Agile.\n\n32\n00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:36.880\nI might want to look at what\nhas to happen in order for\n\n33\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.040\nmy project plan to be successful,\nor to meet the time deadline.\n\n34\n00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800\nOr in the case of agile,\n\n35\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.420\nwhat has to happen to meet that\nparticular segment that I'm working on.\n\n36\n00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.380\nAnd the idea is that this PERT chart,\n\n37\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.760\nwhich the template is part of your student\npackage, helps me kind of sequence things.\n\n38\n00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.140\nSo there are some things that have\nto happen before other things.\n\n39\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170\nSome things can happen in tandem.\n\n40\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.630\nWe do PERT charts in\nour head all the time.\n\n41\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.340\nThat's why we start the coffee when\nwe first get up in the morning or\n\n42\n00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880\nwe have it started for us first\nthing when we get up in the morning.\n\n43\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.360\nIt's so it will be ready when\nwe're walking out the door, right?\n\n44\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.750\nSo that's all a PERT chart is.\n\n45\n00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.190\nIt's taking your work breakdown\nstructure or your to do list, and\n\n46\n00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.310\nit's saying you know what things\nhave to happen in this order.\n\n47\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.340\nThe reason why this is important in\nproject planning is because critical path,\n\n48\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.210\nthese are the items that have to happen,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.640\nthey have to happen in that time sequence\nor the project will be late, right?\n\n50\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.249\nSo this allows us to study our\ncritical path in an easier way.\n\n51\n00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.790\nThe other thing that I wanted to address,\n\n52\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.260\nthat we might have even\nlooked at in selection, but\n\n53\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.930\nwe could have looked at in planning,\nis the concept of something called CTQs.\n\n54\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.050\nNow this is a Lean Six Sigma concept\nthat's heavily used in Agile.\n\n55\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.760\nIt's just called different\nthings in Agile.\n\n56\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.070\nSometimes it's called\ncustomer requirements.\n\n57\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.090\nSometimes it's called customer wants or\ndesires.\n\n58\n00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.110\nBut basically what a STQ is, is what needs\nto happen to make the project successful.\n\n59\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.760\nCustomer requirements are CTQs by default,\nright?\n\n60\n00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.300\nAnd so if the customer wants something\nthen we definitely wanna concentrate\n\n61\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.310\non that on our project would\nour customer is internal or\n\n62\n00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.100\nexternal we want to concentrate on that.\n\n63\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.971\nBut CTQ goes one step further and\nmakes our project lean and\n\n64\n00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.802\nmore agile because in the CTQ world\nit's almost like being Steve Covey.\n\n65\n00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:33.828\nWe're saying what does everyone need\nfrom me, as the project manager or\n\n66\n00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:37.100\nthe scrum master,\nto be successful in this project.\n\n67\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.880\nSo it's not just about me, what I want,\nwhat I would like to see happen.\n\n68\n00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.270\nIt's a little bit more about what do all\nthe people that play into my project need?\n\n69\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.200\nNow sometimes you want to think\nwhat is critical to quality.\n\n70\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.550\nSo what is critical quality is kind\nof a buzz word now for better.\n\n71\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.660\nWhat is critical to make things better?\n\n72\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.650\nWhat's critical to make\nthings happen quickly?\n\n73\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.960\nWhat's critical to the price argument?\n\n74\n00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.698\nAnd remember,\nwhen we talk about cost-effectiveness,\n\n75\n00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:11.760\nwe're talking about return on investment.\n\n76\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.240\nAnd we're saying, what did I make,\nsave, or avoid spending?\n\n77\n00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.220\nSo what's critical to that particular\nargument when we're looking at that?\n\n78\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.980\nAnd then finally what's critical\nto quality to our scope?\n\n79\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.720\nSo these are some things that when\nwe're in the planning session\n\n80\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.280\nof the project life cycle composite\nthat we might wanna look at.\n\n81\n00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.170\nIf we can, we might even wanna\nstart looking at that in select.\n\n82\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.450\nBut we wanna have that story down before\nwe move into the next phase of the model\n\n83\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.470\nwhich is execution.\n\n84\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.550\nSo once again, keep in mind you have\nthe full model in your student package.\n\n85\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.300\nWe don't expect you to\nmemorize these things.\n\n86\n00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.970\nThis is just to help you go through the\nmodel, we are now in the Execution phase.\n\n87\n00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.180\nNow this is gonna go very quickly because\nif we did a good job in planning,\n\n88\n00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.190\nthen all we're doing in\nExecution is making it happen.\n\n89\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.074\nHowever, I want to remind\nyou of The Agile Manifesto.\n\n90\n00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.862\nAnd I'm just going to pull these all up.\n\n91\n00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:12.703\nThis again is one of\nthose student handouts so\n\n92\n00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:15.696\nwhen you're working\nan agile environment even\n\n93\n00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:20.430\nthough you're in the execution mode\nyou want to keep these values in mind.\n\n94\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.420\nSo individuals and\ninteraction over process and tools, right?\n\n95\n00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.612\nIn the traditional and\n\n96\n00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:30.810\nlean environments you might be\nlooking more at the process and tools.\n\n97\n00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.710\nIf you’re in the agile environment,\nworking software and what that means\n\n98\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.768\nis that you might be developed in\nyour software as you go along,\n\n99\n00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:41.140\nyou're in the execution stage, right?\n\n100\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.884\nIn traditional and lean project management\nthere's more of a tendency to have\n\n101\n00:05:44.884 --> 00:05:47.892\ncomplete documentation before\nyou start rolling things out so\n\n102\n00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:49.381\nthat's another difference.\n\n103\n00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:53.878\nCustomer collaboration as opposed\nto contract negotiation so\n\n104\n00:05:53.878 --> 00:05:56.336\nif I'm in an agile environment and\n\n105\n00:05:56.336 --> 00:06:02.060\nI'm executing I might be looking at\nmore face-to-face with the customer.\n\n106\n00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.970\nAs I'm actually developing,\nas I'm actually doing that project,\n\n107\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.810\nI might be having more interface\nwith the customer than normal.\n\n108\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.790\nOn the lean and traditional side,\nit's a little bit more about contract\n\n109\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.570\nnegotiations and what did my contract\nsay I was gonna do for that customer?\n\n110\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.310\nAnd then finally,\n\n111\n00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.090\nresponding to change in a flexible\nway as opposed to following a plan.\n\n112\n00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.820\nNow, we're talking about Lean and\nAgile project management and\n\n113\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.730\nthe reason why I'm bringing this up in\nthe execution phase is that if we have\n\n114\n00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.260\nmovement in one way or the other, that\nmight be something that we're considering.\n\n115\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.810\nI don't particularly see these\nthings as being mutually exclusive.\n\n116\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.950\nI think we can have\ncustomer collaboration, for\n\n117\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.800\nexample, and\nstill honor our contract negotiations.\n\n118\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.113\nSo if you find yourself, no pun intended,\n\n119\n00:06:49.113 --> 00:06:53.100\nleaning more towards one than the other\nin execution, to be a good lean and\n\n120\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.306\nagile project manager, I think you need\nto consider both sides of the story.\n\n121\n00:06:59.453 --> 00:07:01.760\nSo, things to remember in execute.\n\n122\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.060\nThese are big things.\n\n123\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.903\nThe first thing is that in selection and\nplanning you may be incredibly busy,\n\n124\n00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:10.286\nyou may be burning that midnight oil,\n\n125\n00:07:10.286 --> 00:07:15.310\nbut there's an increased expectation\non you when you start executing.\n\n126\n00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.370\nSo even as a project manager or\nscrum master you may have in the scrum\n\n127\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.880\nmaster role,\njust at everything you possibly could,\n\n128\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.650\nto satisfy your employer and\nthe people in your environment.\n\n129\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.670\nBut now suddenly,\n\n130\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.180\nAzure executing this project,\nthere's just more expectations on you.\n\n131\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.510\nYou need to keep your energy level up.\n\n132\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.690\nAnd a lean and agile environment,\nwe believe that less is more.\n\n133\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.070\nSo a lot of you have been in environments,\nespecially in IT,\n\n134\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.370\nwhere you think, if I just put in\nthose extra two or three hours.\n\n135\n00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.140\nThere's been several\nstudies done recently,\n\n136\n00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.950\nthat says that diminishing\nreturns is a real thing.\n\n137\n00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.090\nAnd that it's important that if you're\nworking in this execution mode,\n\n138\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.310\nit is important to get out and\nget air, and exercise, and\n\n139\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.990\nbreathe, and meditate, and\ndo all of those things to do a good job.\n\n140\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.590\nThe other thing that you need to remember\nis that there's an increased work\n\n141\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.090\npressure on your team.\n\n142\n00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.020\nThe same people that were with you\nin select and with you in planning,\n\n143\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.660\nnow all of a sudden they're\nhaving to do stuff.\n\n144\n00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.360\nAnd generally speaking, they're doing\nstuff in conjunction with tons of\n\n145\n00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.800\nother personal and\nother business projects.\n\n146\n00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.350\nSo you're in execution,\nthe lean and agile approach\n\n147\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.640\nto project execution is to stay\ncognizant of the people on your team.\n\n148\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.810\nTo respect the people on your team and\nthis is huge because in traditional\n\n149\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.880\nproject management, no one's ever\ngonna say don't respect your team but\n\n150\n00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.320\nthere is a very strong push.\n\n151\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.940\nGet to the next task,\nget to the next task, right?\n\n152\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.440\nAnd lean on agile project management,\nwe're saying you know what, no,\n\n153\n00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.660\nstop, take lunch, breath, meditate,\n\n154\n00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.880\nknow that the people are under\npressure that is just not normal.\n\n155\n00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.370\nSo when we're in execution,\nanother lean and agile thinking\n\n156\n00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.160\nis that there are teaming issues and\nwhen you're building your project plan,\n\n157\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.430\nyou don't wanna build it so tight that\nyou can't get together with your team.\n\n158\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.540\nSo even if you're not gonna\ngo to that daily scrum,\n\n159\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.230\njust kind of keep in mind if you\nwanna execute in a fluid, good way,\n\n160\n00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.360\nthen what you're wanting to do is make\nsure that you have time for your team.\n\n161\n00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.900\nThat there is that face-to-face,\n\n162\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.580\neven if you don't go all the way to\nwhere you're meeting with them everyday.\n\n163\n00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.180\nBe sure that you build that in.\n\n164\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.700\n&gt;&gt; So,\nI have a really interesting point here.\n\n165\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Well, this is\n\n166\n00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.670\ninteresting to me because\nI get to go see a movie.\n\n167\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n168\n00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.460\nthe owner of ITProTV is taking us,\neveryone,\n\n169\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.640\nto the movies next Tuesday including\nour family or whoever we want to bring.\n\n170\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.820\n&gt;&gt; That's really great.\n\n171\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.372\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just having that extra\nteam building fun kind of exercise,\n\n172\n00:09:50.372 --> 00:09:54.782\nit really brings and boosts morale,\nI think it's a great idea.\n\n173\n00:09:54.782 --> 00:09:57.807\n&gt;&gt; I think what's so cool about it\nis that even though, like I said,\n\n174\n00:09:57.807 --> 00:10:01.330\ntraditional project management\nisn't gonna say it's a bad idea.\n\n175\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.800\nIt's just not part of\nits body of knowledge.\n\n176\n00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.640\nWhere as a lean and\n\n177\n00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.010\nagile project manager you're saying our\npeople are just as important as the work.\n\n178\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.740\nAnd I just love that part.\n\n179\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.380\nAnother thing that you want to think about\nin execution is called Level Scheduling.\n\n180\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.050\nAnd Level Scheduling\nalso has this Heijunka.\n\n181\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.575\n&gt;&gt; Don't ask me to pronounce it.\n\n182\n00:10:20.575 --> 00:10:22.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a Japanese word, but\n\n183\n00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.415\nthe deal is, that when you're executing I\nthink the take away that lean and agile\n\n184\n00:10:27.415 --> 00:10:31.415\ngives you is make sure there isn't one\nperson on your team that has all the work.\n\n185\n00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:33.335\n&gt;&gt; And how do you pronounce that?\n\n186\n00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:34.150\n&gt;&gt; Heijunka.\n\n187\n00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.945\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n188\n00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:35.793\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure.\n\n189\n00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:39.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, when we're teaching just Lean,\n\n190\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:44.410\nbecause we also do SST global solutions\nalso just teaching Lean training and\n\n191\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.550\nwe have to all go back and\npractice all those Japanese words.\n\n192\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.760\nBut the concept that I want you to\ntake away with you is that when you\n\n193\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.110\nare executing just make\nsure that it's level.\n\n194\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.680\nThat no one has the bulk of the work or,\nif they have the bulk of the work,\n\n195\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.940\nthat you have work arounds where they\nhave time off to compensate for that.\n\n196\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.230\nAnd that happens a lot.\n\n197\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.400\nI mean, it happens in our\nreligious environments, and\n\n198\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.050\nour homeowner's associations, and our PTA.\n\n199\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.860\nWhere there's that quarter of a people\nthat are doing all the work [LAUGH].\n\n200\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n201\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.700\nyou just, resource leveling is\njust making sure it's there.\n\n202\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.800\n&gt;&gt; And kind of by breaking it down\ninto the teams that we spoke about,\n\n203\n00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.870\nwe kind of are dividing that\nworkload up amongst the teams.\n\n204\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.580\nAnd then the teams, they've pledged\ntheir allegiance to their team, right?\n\n205\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So they're saying,\n\n206\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.430\nif you don't get this test done,\nI'm gonna stay here\n\n207\n00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.210\nuntil it's finished to help you so\nthat we can offset that workload.\n\n208\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n209\n00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.360\nI want you to also remember a concept\ncalled takt time when you're executing.\n\n210\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.260\nNow, in a perfect world you would have\ndone this in planning, but sometimes when\n\n211\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.270\nyou start executing you realize that\nyou haven't thought this through.\n\n212\n00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.570\nSo Takt Time is just the customer demand.\n\n213\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.900\nSo in your case as a project manager,\nthe customer might be your boss, right.\n\n214\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.330\nYour boss expects a certain thing\nto happen at a certain time.\n\n215\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.580\nSo Takt Time is a way of calculating, and\n\n216\n00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.000\nthose formulas are on the student page,\nor in your student package, rather.\n\n217\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.570\nTakt time is a way of calculating how fast\nyou have to work to meet that demand.\n\n218\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.020\nAnd like I said, in the planning stage,\n\n219\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.180\nthat's something to think\nabout if you think about it.\n\n220\n00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:27.020\nBut sometimes you get into execution,\nand you realize, my goodness,\n\n221\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.210\nthis task can't meet the demand.\n\n222\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:33.720\nSo, that you sometimes have to step\nback in execution and do that.\n\n223\n00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.930\nThen I just wanna kind of\nremind you that execution\n\n224\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.997\nin traditional verses Agile environments.\n\n225\n00:12:39.997 --> 00:12:44.460\nExecution in the project life cycle\nif you're following mostly lean, or\n\n226\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.620\nmostly traditional you're\nexecuting everything.\n\n227\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.320\nYou're going cradle to grave.\n\n228\n00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.730\nYou're looking at your WBS,\nthat's what you're doing.\n\n229\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:57.200\nIn the agile environment, sometimes you're\nexecuting in two week chunks, right?\n\n230\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.500\nAnd then you're having\nthose daily meetings,\n\n231\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.020\nthose two week chunks are subject to\nsomething called a burn down chart,\n\n232\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.010\nwhereas the traditional project management\nwhere I'm executing cradle to grave\n\n233\n00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:11.570\nthe whole projects over I'm just\nknocking off those WBSs, right?\n\n234\n00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.870\nEverything that's on there.\n\n235\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.220\nBut in the Agile environment,\nI'm burning that down.\n\n236\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:21.000\nAnd then I kinda keep in mind that in\nthe execution stage, if you're working in\n\n237\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.490\nan Agile environment, your job as a\nproject manager is a little bit different.\n\n238\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.320\nWe mentioned that in the earlier\nsessions in this Lean and\n\n239\n00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.400\nAgile project management program.\n\n240\n00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.320\nBut in the Agile environments the scrum\nmaster's rule is really to kinda\n\n241\n00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.471\nremove obstacles and\nmake sure things are out of the way and\n\n242\n00:13:39.471 --> 00:13:42.762\nthat everyone can do the job\nthat they say they're gonna do.\n\n243\n00:13:42.762 --> 00:13:47.250\nWhereas in the traditional project\nmanagement when you're in the execution\n\n244\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.873\nmode you're going around checking to\nmake sure everyone is doing what they're\n\n245\n00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:53.199\nsupposed to be doing.\n\n246\n00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:57.419\nSo, the other thing to remember,\nand I kind of already said this but\n\n247\n00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.350\nI'll just reiterate it.\n\n248\n00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.869\nThe work breakdown structure is looking\nat point 1.2 and then 1.3 and 1.3.3.\n\n249\n00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:06.930\nI'm gonna do these tasks.\n\n250\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:12.820\nIn the work breakdown structure in the\nplanning phase sometimes you don't realize\n\n251\n00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.610\nthat some of these tasks\nare contingent on other tasks and\n\n252\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.340\nthose are called dependencies.\n\n253\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.770\nSo you want it a lot for the dependencies\nas much as possible in planning but\n\n254\n00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.030\nonce again you might get into\nthe work breakdown structure and\n\n255\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.920\nrealize, my goodness,\nthis should have been done before that.\n\n256\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.140\nAnd that's where that PERT chart,\n\n257\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.370\nthat we looked at when we first\ncame into this session, is handy.\n\n258\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.460\nBut let's say you didn't do that.\n\n259\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.700\nJust kind of keep in mind that sometimes\nyour goal, in a work breakdown structure,\n\n260\n00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.940\nis kinda hierarchical and\nI'm just gonna knock these things off.\n\n261\n00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.470\nWhereas if I'm in execution in\na more of an Agile environment,\n\n262\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.080\nthen I'm looking at iterations.\n\n263\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.271\nI'm looking at those sprints.\n\n264\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.511\nAnd sprints, once again, are two to\nfour week cycles and during that cycle,\n\n265\n00:14:58.511 --> 00:15:01.560\nnothing is supposed to\nchange in that activity.\n\n266\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.010\nEveryone has just agreed this is the body\nof work that I'm going to take on for\n\n267\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.450\nthe next two weeks.\n\n268\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.800\nSo I think that's really pretty much\nwhat I had to tell you about execution.\n\n269\n00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:16.215\nIt goes more smoothly the more\ntime you spend in planning.\n\n270\n00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:19.535\nBut you don't want to get caught,\nwe mentioned this in another session,\n\n271\n00:15:19.535 --> 00:15:21.435\nyou don't want to get caught\nwhere you're planning so\n\n272\n00:15:21.435 --> 00:15:23.785\nlong you don't have time to execute.\n\n273\n00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:25.295\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for that.\n\n274\n00:15:25.295 --> 00:15:28.405\nAnd now we can go ahead and\ntake the information we learned,\n\n275\n00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:31.935\napply it in our daily lives or if you\nguys are just studying for the exam.\n\n276\n00:15:31.935 --> 00:15:37.770\nWe also looked at aspects of how it\nrelates to traditional project management,\n\n277\n00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.990\nto the newer agile thinking.\n\n278\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.010\nSo thank you for that.\n\n279\n00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.620\nAnd I appreciate you guys for\nstaying and watching.\n\n280\n00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.670\nBut we do have another phase to cover,\nwe still have our closeout phase.\n\n281\n00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.215\nSo don't go anywhere just yet.\n\n282\n00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:51.320\nWe have some really great Lean and\n\n283\n00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.360\nAgile project management\ninformation headed your way.\n\n284\n00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.760\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n285\n00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.190\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Tara Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n286\n00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.779\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

Welcome to your Lean and\nAgile Project Management series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.620\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:21.740\nIn this segment we will\nbe looking at the last\n\n7\n00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.190\nphase within our project management life\ncycle, which is the close-out phase.\n\n8\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.769\nAnd to explain that to us today,\n\n9\n00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.590\nwe have Doctor Doctor Terra Vanzant-Stern\nin studios.\n\n10\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.400\nSo thank you for being here today Doctor.\n\n11\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910\nI appreciate being here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.080\n&gt;&gt; So what are we gonna be looking at?\n\n14\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.960\nWhat are some really important key\nconcepts within that closeout phase to,\n\n15\n00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170\nwell, wrap up a project?\n\n16\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.290\n&gt;&gt; Well this is the beautiful thing\nabout the project life cycle.\n\n17\n00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.480\nIf you do everything you're supposed\nto do in those first three phases,\n\n18\n00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.820\nclose out is really simple.\n\n19\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.510\nSo I'd like to bring up my slide deck.\n\n20\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.410\nAnd as a reminder, we're working from\nthe Lean and Project Management deck.\n\n21\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.720\nWe're working from the project life\ncycle and this is a composite model.\n\n22\n00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.093\nOnce again, just as a reminder the PMBOK,\n\n23\n00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:12.830\nthe PRINCE2 and the new ISO standard for\nproject management\n\n24\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.857\nall have different versions of this\nproject management life cycle.\n\n25\n00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:20.155\nAnd at some of the universities now,\nthey've expanded it.\n\n26\n00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:23.445\nWe thought it was more lean and\nagile to kind of condense it, and\n\n27\n00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:27.075\nput it into the four major categories\nof what you're working on.\n\n28\n00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.205\nSo, we're now in the close-out phase, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.830\nnotice the very first thing we\nput on close-out was celebrate.\n\n30\n00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.330\nAnd you want to get your team feedback,\nand recommendations for further actions.\n\n31\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.650\nIf you do the PLC the way\nwe're suggesting it, and\n\n32\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.800\nlean in agile project management,\nclose-out.\n\n33\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.880\nYou're just really doing\na lot of documentation.\n\n34\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.712\nSo as far as in time frame,\nI know I keep asking these questions.\n\n35\n00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:58.370\nBut would be safe to say it's really\ngood to go through a lot of these steps,\n\n36\n00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.160\nwill that information is\nstill fresh in your head and\n\n37\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.040\nyou can Identify anything that your\nteam did exceptionally well, and\n\n38\n00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.680\nthen kind of point out things that maybe\nyou didn't do so well, but while it's\n\n39\n00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.250\nstill fresh so people don't forget about\neverything that you've just accomplished.\n\n40\n00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.410\n&gt;&gt; That's a very good point\nCherokee because my suggestion\n\n41\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.670\nis to start logging this in execute.\n\n42\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.356\nAnd so then when you get to the close-out\nstage, you're really just writing it up.\n\n43\n00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:25.020\nThat's what we want to make\nclose out phase the fun phase.\n\n44\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.100\nWhere you are celebrating and\nyou are looking for\n\n45\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.470\nnew work and\nyou are doing really cool new things.\n\n46\n00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.231\nSo, if you're journaling as\nyou go along and execute,\n\n47\n00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:34.071\nclose out is going to be very simple.\n\n48\n00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.890\nBut some of the things we wanted to\ntalk about because it is a lean and\n\n49\n00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.458\nagile project is to introduce\nthe concept of continuous improvement.\n\n50\n00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:48.390\nSo my project's over and in a traditional\nproject management environment,\n\n51\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.300\nI'm done, I just go and\nget another project.\n\n52\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.656\nOne of the things that we learned from\nprocess improvement is that we might wanna\n\n53\n00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:59.882\nmake sure that that project, that simple\nproject has some sustainability or\n\n54\n00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:03.473\nmaybe that people can build on that for\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n55\n00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:07.592\nSo continuous improvement is sort of\nmore than a concept than anything else.\n\n56\n00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:12.389\nI wanna make sure I do my best practices,\nbut I'm looking for\n\n57\n00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.659\nopportunities, as I close out this\nproject, to make other things\n\n58\n00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.670\nin my environment better,\nfaster, and most cost effective.\n\n59\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.390\nThe other concept in lean and\nagile project management that\n\n60\n00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.570\noften is not there in traditional project\nmanagement is the idea of standard work.\n\n61\n00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.260\nAs I'm going through my executables,\nfrom time to time,\n\n62\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.990\nI might notice a repeatable thing and\nit might be just with that project but\n\n63\n00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.070\nit could be something that\npeople do in other projects.\n\n64\n00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.960\n&gt;&gt; Integrated into even other departments,\nas well?\n\n65\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.020\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n66\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.740\nAnd so I want to take the time\nto actually record my actions.\n\n67\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.470\nThese are the steps that I took, so\nthat if someone wants to do it again,\n\n68\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.830\nit's a repeatable.\n\n69\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.100\nAnd that's called standard work.\n\n70\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.710\nNow sometimes you do that\nrepeatable work process and\n\n71\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.480\nyou find something that's even better,\nso then you're gonna go ahead and\n\n72\n00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.700\nyou're going to rewrite your\nstandard work to include that.\n\n73\n00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.770\nAnd then finally, 5S,\nwhich is a physical organization\n\n74\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.760\nmodel to help us be more organized for\nour next project.\n\n75\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.250\nSometimes people do 5S before they\neven get started on the project,\n\n76\n00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.480\nbecause the environment is such\na mess they can't even think.\n\n77\n00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.790\nBut we're putting it at the end.\n\n78\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.210\nWe're saying this is an example of\nnot only continuous improvement, but\n\n79\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.620\nsometimes you have to be at the end\nof the project before you know how to\n\n80\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.680\norganize your environment.\n\n81\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.540\nSo, on the topic of standard work,\nthere's plenty of forms and templates.\n\n82\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.210\nThese are available on the student\npage at SSD Global Solutions.\n\n83\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.570\nSo if you decide you want to do\nsomething formal, keep in mind really\n\n84\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.900\nall you're doing is recording the steps\nthat you did for a particular activity.\n\n85\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.910\nSo I'm almost thinking that it's\nleaner just to do that than to\n\n86\n00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.540\nuse a former template.\n\n87\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.859\nBut some of you are going to be working in\nenvironments that are a little bit more\n\n88\n00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:04.522\nform and template oriented and they like\nyou having official paperwork filled out.\n\n89\n00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:11.792\nContinuous improvement, again there are\nsome forms and templates that just give\n\n90\n00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:15.740\nyou ideas of how you can continuously\nimprove your environment.\n\n91\n00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.395\nAnd that check sheet is part of\nyour student package as well.\n\n92\n00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:24.615\nAnd now we're getting to the real,\nkind of fun one, and that's our 5s model.\n\n93\n00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:28.915\nOur 5s model we're seeing is an example of\ncontinuous improvement that we can use in\n\n94\n00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:30.435\nthe close-out phase.\n\n95\n00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:33.535\nWe're saying in the close out\nphase we're gonna celebrate.\n\n96\n00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:36.590\nWe're gonna fill out all\nthe paperwork we need to fill out.\n\n97\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.160\nWe're gonna make sure everyone knows\nthat we're done with the project.\n\n98\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.400\nA way that we could do that is\nby looking at our SIPOC which we\n\n99\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.410\ndiscussed in an earlier session.\n\n100\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.550\nAnd say everyone that touched this\nproject, do they know it's over?\n\n101\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.940\nAnd some people are gonna\npart of our celebration,\n\n102\n00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.960\nsome of them are just gonna get an email.\n\n103\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.970\nBut if that's what we're wanting to do,\nwe also wanna go back and look at our\n\n104\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.520\nmajor stakeholders and make sure they know\nwhat an awesome job we did on our project.\n\n105\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.830\nSo, we're looking at 5S,\nthis is a physical organization model, and\n\n106\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.491\nthis model is designed to\nkeep this from happening.\n\n107\n00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:11.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, I've used this picture for\n\n108\n00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.560\nyears because I have two, and I shouldn't\nsay this on television, but two\n\n109\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.960\nof my best friends are attorneys and they\nboth have offices that look like this.\n\n110\n00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.499\nSo even in this paperless society\nthat we're supposed to be in,\n\n111\n00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:24.752\nthis is what happens.\n\n112\n00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:29.530\nSo 5S,\nsometimes is represented as this wheel.\n\n113\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.570\nThere was a movement in the lean and\nagile environments to kind of brand tools.\n\n114\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:41.140\nAnd you'll see some of it,\nthere's a branding for the PDCA model.\n\n115\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.039\nBut they are people who disagree\non what would be the best brand.\n\n116\n00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.017\nBut the idea was gonna be very lean, that\nif you saw so this will in a presentation,\n\n117\n00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:52.120\nyou knew that they are gonna\nbe talking about 5S but\n\n118\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.394\ndidn't quite get off the ground,\nbut good thought.\n\n119\n00:06:55.394 --> 00:07:00.340\nSo in the 5S model there are actually 5Ss.\n\n120\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.400\nThey came from the Japanese word so\nsometimes they aren't quite as intuitive\n\n121\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.950\nin English, some environments have a 6S,\nthat's hard to say 6S.\n\n122\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.835\n&gt;&gt; Sally sells sea shells.\n\n123\n00:07:13.835 --> 00:07:17.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and that 6S is safety so\n\n124\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.990\njust kind of keep in mind\n&gt;&gt; It's still called the 5S model and so\n\n125\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.930\na lot of people go 5S plus one.\n\n126\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.730\nSome people will call it the 6S model,\nbut if you were studying for an exam,\n\n127\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.480\nyou would wanna still call\nthis the 5S model and\n\n128\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.650\nthat would be in any exam that\nyou take that touches 5S.\n\n129\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.560\nSo in the first phase, and\n\n130\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.480\nthis is the least intuitive of the S words\nthat were taken from the Japanese S words.\n\n131\n00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.739\nWe were just trying to keep them all Ss,\nso we could say the 5S.\n\n132\n00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:51.762\nIn sort, what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go through my environment and\n\n133\n00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:55.731\nI'm gonna get rid of every single\nthing I know for sure I don't need.\n\n134\n00:07:55.731 --> 00:08:00.528\nOkay, so I don't need that\n1998 Office supply catalog,\n\n135\n00:08:00.528 --> 00:08:03.028\nI probably can throw that away.\n\n136\n00:08:03.028 --> 00:08:06.720\nNow, in this process of 5S,\nI'm going through my environment.\n\n137\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.900\nI'm getting rid of\neverything I don't need.\n\n138\n00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.778\nI may subscribe to a system\ncalled the red tag system.\n\n139\n00:08:12.778 --> 00:08:17.370\nAnd red tagging just means, I may red\ntag this for a variety of reasons.\n\n140\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.680\nSo I'm going through let's say my\nbuilding, and I'm getting rid of things.\n\n141\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.960\nBut I know that there's some things\nI might want to give to Goodwill or\n\n142\n00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.250\nto ARC or\nto one of the thrift stores, right?\n\n143\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.850\nSo I might red tag it.\n\n144\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.530\nSometimes when a company moves buildings,\nand\n\n145\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.350\nthey move their facility from\none facility to another.\n\n146\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.750\n&gt;&gt; Like we just did at ITproTV.\n\n147\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not cost effective to,\n\n148\n00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:41.938\nsometimes it's not cost effective to\nmove that half a box of folders or\n\n149\n00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.192\nthat old chair that you're\ngoing to get rid off anyway.\n\n150\n00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:48.308\nSo, sometimes companies\nwill red tag things and\n\n151\n00:08:48.308 --> 00:08:52.640\nsay if any employees want this take\nit because we're going to get rid\n\n152\n00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.340\nof it before we move to the next building,\nright?\n\n153\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:01.270\nSometimes you might want to red tag things\nbecause if you're in a warehouse, and\n\n154\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.430\nthere's chemical things that have to\nbe disposed of in a certain way, right?\n\n155\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.360\nBut basically the idea of Sort is I'm\ngoing to go through my environment, and\n\n156\n00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.870\nI'm going to get rid of\neverything I don't need.\n\n157\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.640\nOkay, and I might red tag it but\nI'm just gonna do that.\n\n158\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.890\nThe next step is I'm gonna set an order,\nin some models that's called straighten,\n\n159\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.970\nand that means I'm gonna\ncome up with piles of stuff.\n\n160\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.040\nAnd I get to come up with that system.\n\n161\n00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.980\nDo I want them to be seasonal?\n\n162\n00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.993\nDo I want them to be by color?\n\n163\n00:09:29.993 --> 00:09:34.290\nDo I want them to be by things I use\nmore often as opposed to less often?\n\n164\n00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.070\nI get to come up with\nthat particular idea.\n\n165\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.970\nSo then I move to shine.\n\n166\n00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.460\nIn the shine phase,\nthat's what I'm really doing.\n\n167\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.490\nThere's all kinds of studies that indicate\nthat a clean work environment is a more\n\n168\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.270\nproductive work environment.\n\n169\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.110\nSo, one of the things I'm doing,\nlet's say I was 5Sing my garage.\n\n170\n00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.240\nI'm actually cleaning the walls and the\nfloors, and making everything look pretty,\n\n171\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.750\nor repainting.\n\n172\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.610\nBut the big thing that I'm doing is I\"m\ngoing back through those piles to see if\n\n173\n00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.130\nthere's anything else I can get rid of.\n\n174\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.290\nIn my first pass of going through\nthe stuff I was getting rid of, I might\n\n175\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.320\nnot have noticed now that I have piles of\nthings that there were some redundancies.\n\n176\n00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.410\nDo I really need five pair of black shoes?\n\n177\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.815\nIf I were 5Sing my closet,\nmy answer is yes.\n\n178\n00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:21.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But now that I have them all together,\n\n179\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.504\nmaybe I didn't throw them away that first,\nbecause there wasn't anything wrong, but\n\n180\n00:10:25.504 --> 00:10:28.510\nnow that I have them together\nmaybe I don't need that much.\n\n181\n00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.730\nI'm also looking for rips and\ntears and broken things,\n\n182\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.720\nthat maybe I didn't notice\nthat first time around.\n\n183\n00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.090\nSo my idea is I'm trying to get those\npiles as small as possible, right?\n\n184\n00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.600\nIn my fourth phase, what I'm trying\nto do is I'm trying to come up with\n\n185\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.080\nan idea how to keep things in order\nbecause right now I just have a bunch of\n\n186\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.840\npiles all over the floor, right?\n\n187\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.440\nSo I'm trying to come up with,\n\n188\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.150\nI'm trying standardize that I'm\ntrying to come up with a plan.\n\n189\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.323\nAnd in my fifth phase, in phase 5,\n\n190\n00:11:00.323 --> 00:11:03.449\nI'm trying to figure out\nhow to sustain that plan.\n\n191\n00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:07.873\nI'm sure a lot of you have cleaned out\nyour entire closets and then you just have\n\n192\n00:11:07.873 --> 00:11:12.162\na bunch of stuff laying on your bedroom\nfloor, or you clean out your closet,\n\n193\n00:11:12.162 --> 00:11:15.890\nit looks great, and\nnext week it looks like it's a mess again.\n\n194\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.580\n&gt;&gt; There's this really cute little tip\nthat I saw on Pinterest, of course,\n\n195\n00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:26.380\nthat if you put your hanger a certain\norientation, like hook it forward facing.\n\n196\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.280\nAnd the next time you wear that item,\nreverse it.\n\n197\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.540\nOr maybe they start backwards and\nthen go forwards.\n\n198\n00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.710\nBut the idea is, do this,\nlet's say January 1st.\n\n199\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.530\nWell in six months or\nwhenever you started,\n\n200\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.900\nin six months come back and all\nthe items that haven't been reversed and\n\n201\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.070\nhad changed in their orientation those\nare the items that you need to get rid of.\n\n202\n00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.930\nAnd its an easy way its like I really\nlike this item but do I really wear it?\n\n203\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly that's\nreally a great tip well\n\n204\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.650\nthere are some people that\nare Lean project managers or\n\n205\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.320\nLean Six Sigma practitioners that\nhave whole businesses doing 5S.\n\n206\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.090\nThat's just what they,\nthey go into companies and\n\n207\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Clean them up.\n\n208\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.310\n&gt;&gt; Or into your houses.\n\n209\n00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.890\n&gt;&gt; Organize, yeah.\n\n210\n00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n211\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.070\nSo the schematic that you're\ngoing to be looking at right\n\n212\n00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:15.160\nnow is still depicting the 5S, it's just\nlooking at kind of different models.\n\n213\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.540\nSo the Japanese, after World War II,\nthose are the words that they used.\n\n214\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.910\nAnd you see on the left\nhand side of your screen\n\n215\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.300\nsome of the things that Henry Ford\non the CANDO model had.\n\n216\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.610\nSo, prior to World War II.\n\n217\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.280\nI guess I should have started\non the left hand side.\n\n218\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.940\nBut then in English we say The 5S' and\n\n219\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.630\nhere you'll see that straighten\nwas also set in order, but\n\n220\n00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.780\nsometimes sort is simplify,\nwhich I like that better, all S words.\n\n221\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.980\nAnd then a little bit later in our English\nhistory we started trying to do the 5C's,\n\n222\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.510\nbecause those S words\nweren't all that intuitive.\n\n223\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.800\nBut I think they got down to that\nlast one going improvement and\n\n224\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.290\nthey called it custom and practice,\n\n225\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.776\nthey were probably really reaching\nthere with that C word don't you think?\n\n226\n00:12:59.776 --> 00:13:01.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] I think so.\n\n227\n00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:05.989\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna take you through\na couple of example so\n\n228\n00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:10.930\nthat you see why a lot of\ntimes they're separate phases.\n\n229\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.940\nCertainly I get asked\nthis all the time and\n\n230\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.980\neven the person who created this\n5S system said that this was okay.\n\n231\n00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:24.120\nIf I'm doing 5S on my own, absolutely if I\nwant to I can combine some phases, right.\n\n232\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.470\nBut I want to give you an example\n\n233\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.540\nof why sometimes you might\nwant to keep them separate.\n\n234\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.610\nSo one of our projects at\nSSD Global is that we were helping\n\n235\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.460\norganize the archives of a museum.\n\n236\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.066\nAnd most of you already know this.\n\n237\n00:13:39.066 --> 00:13:42.986\nBut in museums, a lot of times, the\narchives have more things that are being\n\n238\n00:13:42.986 --> 00:13:46.070\ndisplayed up at the top of the museum,\nright.\n\n239\n00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.200\nAnd so there were all these things\nthat people had donated to the museum.\n\n240\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd it was just a mess, right.\n\n241\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.420\nAnd they were adding on\nanother wing to the museum so\n\n242\n00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.970\nit was imperative that they\nget these items organized.\n\n243\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.400\nSo the first thing was to\ndo the cleaning up, or\n\n244\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.480\nwhat we call sort and simplify,\nor what we might call clear out.\n\n245\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.460\nAnd that basically required some people\nwith art expertise to come in and\n\n246\n00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.325\nsay, this art.\n\n247\n00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:11.085\n&gt;&gt; For the jokes.\n\n248\n00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; From the really nice.\n\n249\n00:14:12.675 --> 00:14:13.175\n&gt;&gt; Heart.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:14.241\n[CROSSTALK] Art.\n\n251\n00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:14.987\n[LAUGH]\n\n252\n00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:16.223\n&gt;&gt; Now, some of the stuff that got\n\n253\n00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:19.131\nred-tagged because, keep in mind,\na lot of this art was donated.\n\n254\n00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:20.991\nAnd some people didn't know it wasn't\n\n255\n00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:25.378\na Matisse, or it wasn't a real Picasso.\nA lot of the red tagging in that\n\n256\n00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:28.618\nenvironment ended up at the children's\nmuseum, because it looked good, and\n\n257\n00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.918\nit was something you touch and play with.\nAnd it was just-\n\n258\n00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:31.538\n&gt;&gt; Made it just like\n\n259\n00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.268\nvisually interesting as well, so yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n260\n00:14:34.268 --> 00:14:35.868\nSo, a lot of the read tagging, and\n\n261\n00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:37.828\nsome things were taken out, but\n\n262\n00:14:37.828 --> 00:14:41.308\nsome things were red tagged because\nthe people that donated it needed to be\n\n263\n00:14:41.308 --> 00:14:45.940\nnotified that maybe this item was\ngoing to an alternative place.\n\n264\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n265\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.890\nthat took a certain level of expertise.\n\n266\n00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.850\nSo then the second thing that happened\nwas there had to be an arrangement\n\n267\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:15:01.580\nThe Japanese word [FOREIGN] Straighten or\nset in order or configure.\n\n268\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.040\nThere had to be a way\nto arrange this things.\n\n269\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.220\nSo there were a lot of discussions\nshould it be chronological?\n\n270\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.065\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Should it be by fine art versus modern\n\n271\n00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:14.800\nart versus Cubism within\nthe modern art type thing.\n\n272\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.570\nLots of discussions around that.\n\n273\n00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.860\nWhat was decided is that it would\ngo in centuries and decades.\n\n274\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.270\nSo, centuries, decades underneath that.\n\n275\n00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:29.200\nSo that took a different level of\nexpertise because people would come in and\n\n276\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.250\nI love art,\n\n277\n00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.012\nbut I don't know the difference\nbetween Pre-Columbian and Aztec art.\n\n278\n00:15:33.012 --> 00:15:33.727\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n279\n00:15:33.727 --> 00:15:36.900\nthat took a certain level\nof expertise to come in and\n\n280\n00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.990\norganize those in the right decades,\nwithin the right centuries.\n\n281\n00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.880\nThen the third thing, which was neatness\nin the CANDO model with Henry Ford,\n\n282\n00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.380\nand Seiso If we have any-\n&gt;&gt; Don't look to me.\n\n283\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry,\nI can't help.\n\n284\n00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.501\n&gt;&gt; Sweep or shine in the English.\n\n285\n00:15:54.501 --> 00:15:59.068\nAnd then in the English revised when\nwe were trying to make it easier to\n\n286\n00:15:59.068 --> 00:16:00.022\nunderstand.\n\n287\n00:16:00.022 --> 00:16:01.002\nClean and check right?\n\n288\n00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:01.748\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n289\n00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:05.904\n&gt;&gt; Well as you know art has a certain\nway that it has to be cleaned and\n\n290\n00:16:05.904 --> 00:16:08.850\nthat was the whole different expertise.\n\n291\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.420\nSo the people who came in,\n\n292\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.540\nthe experts that came in and\nsaid, this is art, this is not.\n\n293\n00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.660\nThe people that came in and\nput it in the right chronological order\n\n294\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.910\nwere not the same people that have\nthe expertise in cleaning art.\n\n295\n00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.080\nSo that was looked at as\na whole separate thing, right?\n\n296\n00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.010\nSo then we get to the discipline.\n\n297\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:32.740\nI'm not gonna try the Japanese word, the\nstandardize stabilize conformity piece.\n\n298\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.810\nAnd that's where the technical and\nlegal department became involved.\n\n299\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:44.130\nBecause how are we going to keep\nart from coming in the future?\n\n300\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.170\nHow are we going to put\nout the message to people?\n\n301\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.760\nWhat kind of art we want?\n\n302\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.660\nHow are we gonna handle things\nthat are bequeathed to us?\n\n303\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.400\nHow are we gonna do\nthese different things?\n\n304\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.620\nWhat kind of promotion?\n\n305\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.940\nSo between the legal department and\nthe marketing department.\n\n306\n00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.840\nThere are a lot of collaterals\nthat had to be developed, right?\n\n307\n00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.870\nAnd then finally it got to sustain,\n\n308\n00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.820\nwhich Henry Ford and the can do\nmodel called ongoing improvement.\n\n309\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.967\nThe Japanese called [FOREIGN], I think.\n\n310\n00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:17.440\nSustained self discipline or\ncustom and practice.\n\n311\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.410\nSo that last part of it.\n\n312\n00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.085\nYeah, I know that's a little kind\nof crazy Japanese word there.\n\n313\n00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, when we got to that part,\n\n314\n00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.040\nit was about training, and that's\ntraining the volunteers the docents that\n\n315\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.500\nwere going to be intaking the art,\ndown in the archives.\n\n316\n00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.830\nIt was training them on how they\nwere supposed to handle the art.\n\n317\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:42.140\nAs far as some of the art has to be\nhandled in a more delicate fashion.\n\n318\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.330\nWhat kind of messages they were giving\nout, where the art was supposed to go,\n\n319\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.630\nwhy people were trying to\nfigure out where to put it.\n\n320\n00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.230\nSo that was a whole training,\nand a lot of 5S models use\n\n321\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.040\nC Training as part of\nthe sustainability model.\n\n322\n00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.110\nHowever, the sustain can\nalso be visual signs.\n\n323\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.800\nThe library's been doing 5S for\na long time.\n\n324\n00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.970\nWe're not allowed to put our own books or\nDVD's or anything back on the shelves.\n\n325\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.270\nThere's signs all over the library that\nsays, don't even put your magazine back.\n\n326\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:16.590\nBecause, only a trained librarian\ntechnician could do that, right?\n\n327\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.910\nSo you could have visual\ncontrols that just say,\n\n328\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.260\ntrash goes here as your\nsustainability model.\n\n329\n00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.580\nSo we're going to do\na really quick example.\n\n330\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:25.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Before we move on.\n\n331\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.360\nSo let's say I was trying\nto 5S my hard drive and for\n\n332\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.310\nthis example we'll say that\nwe have Microsoft products.\n\n333\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n334\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.950\n&gt;&gt; So in step one of SOAR, in step one\nI'm just gonna go through my hard drive.\n\n335\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.940\nI wanna 5S my hard drive.\n\n336\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.490\nI'm just gonna go through my hard drive.\n\n337\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.625\n&gt;&gt; How did you know?\n\n338\n00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:46.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And I'm just gonna get\nrid of all the files I know for\n\n339\n00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.000\nsure that I don't need.\n\n340\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.180\n&gt;&gt; Just lingering.\n\n341\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:50.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, stuff I.\n\n342\n00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.580\nAnd I'm probably gonna notice.\n\n343\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.570\n&gt;&gt; We can probably do this\nwith my desktop right now.\n\n344\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n345\n00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.390\nOkay, that would be sort.\n\n346\n00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:02.300\nNow, in straighten,\nI am gonna put things in categories and so\n\n347\n00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.520\nwhat thing in Microsoft do we have that\nallow us to put our files in categories?\n\n348\n00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.290\n&gt;&gt; Folders.\n\n349\n00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.120\n&gt;&gt; Folders.\n\n350\n00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.440\nAnd just to make this example very simple,\nI'm going to make my folders family,\n\n351\n00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.170\nfriends, business.\n\n352\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n353\n00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.800\n&gt;&gt; So now I've put all of my files.\n\n354\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.820\nI've transferred them into family,\nfriends, and business.\n\n355\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.690\nAnd now I get to shine.\n\n356\n00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.450\nSo, the deal is,\nI'm gonna go through each folder.\n\n357\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.180\nNow that I've put them in these folders,\ndo you think I'm gonna come across\n\n358\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.700\na duplicate or\nseveral versions of contracts.\n\n359\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.610\n&gt;&gt; At least if we were looking at\nmy computer, we would [LAUGH].\n\n360\n00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Several versions of classes,\nseveral versions of classes.\n\n361\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.480\n&gt;&gt; Photos, especially\n&gt;&gt; Photos, exactly.\n\n362\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.010\nSo, I'm gonna clean that up.\n\n363\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.320\nNow I need to come up with a strategy\n\n364\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.850\non how I'm gonna keep my\nhard drive organized.\n\n365\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.760\nAnd I'm just gonna say the way I'm\ngonna keep my hard drive organized is\n\n366\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.730\nI know I'm not gonna be disciplined\nenough to write a document and\n\n367\n00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.760\nput it in one of those folders.\n\n368\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.900\nI already know that.\n\n369\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.400\nSo what I'm gonna do is every\nFriday I'm gonna stop and\n\n370\n00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.390\nwhatever I did that week I'm gonna\nput in to those three folders.\n\n371\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.230\nSo I get to sustain,\nhow could I sustain that in Microsoft?\n\n372\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.110\nHow could I make myself\ndo that on Fridays?\n\n373\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.190\n&gt;&gt; Give yourself a reminder or\na scheduled task.\n\n374\n00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so Outlook would maybe pop\nup and say hey, don't forget today.\n\n375\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.490\nSo it could be actually that simple.\n\n376\n00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:23.930\nSo I wanna talk a little bit about the\nnext steps that happens in the LAPM and\n\n377\n00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.910\nthe ITProTV students will be\nreceiving several handouts.\n\n378\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.010\nYou have to go to our\nwebsite at www.ssdglobal.\n\n379\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.980\nSometimes through this program,\nI mentioned, there's a handout on this and\n\n380\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.350\nwe just wanted to give you an example.\n\n381\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.610\nSo those are available to everyone.\n\n382\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.050\nIf you decide that you want to take\na test there's only the Level 1\n\n383\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:51.040\nTest available right now because\nthis is a brand new program.\n\n384\n00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.110\nWe're the only service provider right now,\nthat's gonna change in the next several\n\n385\n00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.950\nmonths, because different universities and\npeople are buying this program.\n\n386\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.970\nSo there are gonna be other\noptions as you move forward.\n\n387\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.820\nThe one nice thing about\ntaking it through us\n\n388\n00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.780\nis that we do offer a discounted\nrate to the ITProTV students, and\n\n389\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.690\nif you take it within the next few months,\nthere's no CEU requirements.\n\n390\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:18.300\nWe're working on that right now, so\nif you get certified as an LAPM Level 1,\n\n391\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.810\nit's just a forever certification and,\nyou had a term that you.\n\n392\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.390\n&gt;&gt; Grandfathered in.\n\n393\n00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.286\n&gt;&gt; Grandfathered, exactly.\n\n394\n00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:28.642\nThere are some prerequisites!\n\n395\n00:21:28.642 --> 00:21:31.298\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are some prerequisites to sit for\n\n396\n00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:36.250\nour exam however, Those are on ITProTv\nstudent page, when you go over there.\n\n397\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.290\nBut basically there is\nan educational requirement that's\n\n398\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.490\nsatisfied by watching these videos.\n\n399\n00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.370\nThere is a reading assignment\nthat's fairly lengthy.\n\n400\n00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.843\nIts about 30,\n40 pages that has some question and\n\n401\n00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:49.741\nanswers\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Okay.\n\n402\n00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:54.570\n&gt;&gt; That you have to submit And\nthen you do have before it.\n\n403\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.170\nThis is before you sit for the test.\n\n404\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.580\nYou have to have the education\nrequirements that are satisfied by\n\n405\n00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.650\nthis program.\n\n406\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.770\nYou have to do this assignment.\n\n407\n00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.963\nAnd then you have to submit\na project using the PLC,\n\n408\n00:22:05.963 --> 00:22:08.840\nthe Project Life Cycle Composite Model.\n\n409\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.550\nHowever, we do provide the template for\nthat.\n\n410\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.620\nAnd people are always asking me, well,\nhow long does the project have to be?\n\n411\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.730\nIt just has to be long enough that you\ncan show us what you did in select,\n\n412\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.140\nwhat you did in plan,\nwhat you did in execute and\n\n413\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.050\nhow you satisfied those\nclose out deliverables.\n\n414\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.850\nAnd again like I said,\nthere's templates that go along with that.\n\n415\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:31.130\nAnd there's not really a project charter\nthat you have to submit in this case.\n\n416\n00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.040\nWe just want to know that you know\nhow to take a project to the leaner\n\n417\n00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.140\nat more Agile model before you sit for\nthe exam.\n\n418\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n419\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.220\nWell thank you Dr. Stern for introducing\nus to this great new program and\n\n420\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.600\ncertification that you have available.\n\n421\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.990\nAnd also for teaching us the tools and\n\n422\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.840\nthe processes that we need to become\nmore effective in our daily lives.\n\n423\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.840\nBut I think that's go ahead and\nwrap us up for this particular series.\n\n424\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.758\nSo I'm going to sign off as\nyour show host Cherokee Boost.\n\n425\n00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:02.180\n&gt;&gt;
