Belt\n\n3\n00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.911\ncertification, and more importantly,\nwe're gonna look at how it\n\n4\n00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:20.058\napplies to IT professionals in the IT\nworld, because a lot of you guys have\n\n5\n00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:24.956\nprobably heard of six sigma or\nheard of lean or heard of Lean Six sigma,\n\n6\n00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:29.640\nbut heard of it in production floor or\nfactory type environments.\n\n7\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.702\nAnd applying it in IT is actually a very\nbeneficial thing that a lot of people just\n\n8\n00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:35.030\neither haven't thought of or\nhaven't heard of.\n\n9\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.922\nSo we're gonna take a look at that and\nkind of set you up for\n\n10\n00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:41.500\nwhat our video series is about to be\nthat covers well, Lean Six Sigma.\n\n11\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.210\nDr. Stern, if you could help me,\n\n12\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.641\nlet's start off with kind of\nan overview for people who don't know.\n\n13\n00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.560\nWhat is Lean Six Sigma?\n\n14\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.287\n>> Lean Six Sigma takes two methodologies,\nlean thinking and Six Sigma, and\n\n15\n00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.850\nit blends them together to help\nenhance our critical thinking skills.\n\n16\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.505\nAnd it is comprised of a methodology and\na tool set that can actually partner with\n\n17\n00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.020\njust about anything you\ncan think of in IT.\n\n18\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.651\n>> Now, one of the things I\nlike about Lean Six Sigma is\n\n19\n00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:14.720\nit takes a lot of stuff that\nreally would be difficult.\n\n20\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.410\nSix Sigma really focuses in\non statistics quite a bit.\n\n21\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.112\nA lot of math and\nLean Six Sigma makes it a lot more simple,\n\n22\n00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:23.590\na lot more easy and approachable.\n\n23\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.449\nSo I think it's a great way to implement\nprocess improvement in your environment,\n\n24\n00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:33.564\nand kind of tears down a lot of\nthe barriers of entry for it.\n\n25\n00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.910\nNow if somebody is going to be working\ntowards this, who would that somebody be.\n\n26\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.135\nWhat kind of person, what kind of IT\nworker would be interested in pursuing\n\n27\n00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:42.956\nthe Lean Six Sigma yellow belt?\n\n28\n00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:47.656\n>> Well that's kind of an interesting\nquestion because the yellow\n\n29\n00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:52.660\nbelt actually benefits everyone,\nnot just the IT professional.\n\n30\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.460\nBut the way it works with IT is that\nno matter what level of IT you're at,\n\n31\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.580\nthe tools that help you reason through\nproblem solving just make it easier.\n\n32\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.000\nAnd they partner, like I said, very well,\nwith already existing IT methodologies.\n\n33\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.960\nFor example, it works well with Agile.\n\n34\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.380\nIt works well with ITIL, or ITIL,\nwhich is what we say a lot here.\n\n35\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.923\nIt works even with CMN,\nthe capability maturity and so\n\n36\n00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:25.851\neven just getting familiar with\nthe basic terms and the terminology and\n\n37\n00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.320\nthe methodology is the benefit\nto the IT profession.\n\n38\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.155\n>> All right now,\n\n39\n00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:35.332\nour series that we're about to film here\nwe're gonna cover a lot of different\n\n40\n00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:39.440\nconcepts that serves as an introduction\nfor people to get their feet wet.\n\n41\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.904\nDo we need to have a lot of\nexperience before we jump into this?\n\n42\n00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.640\nOr you said it, it helps everybody.\n\n43\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.360\n>> It does help everyone and\n\n44\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.196\nI think one of the things that\n>> people are excited about is that once\n\n45\n00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:51.601\nthey get involved in the program there's\na lot about Lean Six Sigma that everyone\n\n46\n00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.530\nalready knows.\n\n47\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.100\nThey just didn't realize\nthere was a term for it.\n\n48\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.900\nOr they didn't realize that wasn't\nsomething you just did in your head.\n\n49\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.842\nAnd when you're trying to explain\nhow you think through things,\n\n50\n00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:05.152\nhaving these models are just\nreally very helpful.\n\n51\n00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:09.184\nSo to answer that question Don, you can\nstart from zero and in just a couple of\n\n52\n00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:12.780\ndays, you can go out and use\nLean Six Sigma tools to your advantage.\n\n53\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.081\n>> You know we had a funny conversation\nbefore filming this where, Dr.\n\n54\n00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:22.490\nSternon asked me how much\nI knew about Six Sigma.\n\n55\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.620\nAnd I said,\nI've worked in a lot of environments.\n\n56\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.863\nI'm a pmp certified project manager, so\n\n57\n00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:28.290\nI worked in a project\nmanagement environment.\n\n58\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.254\nI said I haven't really used\na lot of tools and production.\n\n59\n00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:35.120\nI've read the books, but\nI haven't actually implemented any.\n\n60\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.270\nAnd she said actually you have.\n\n61\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.080\nA lot of this stuff snaps right together\nwith the systems we already have in place.\n\n62\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.730\nAnd it's pretty neat to see that.\n\n63\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.210\nYou'll see that as we watch this series.\n\n64\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.600\nYou'll notice this kind\nof snapping together.\n\n65\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.264\nAnd one of the things that Lean Six sigma\nis built around is the idea of process\n\n66\n00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:55.587\nimprovement and the disconnect that I had,\nthe reason that I didn't\n\n67\n00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:59.387\nsee that connection was I was always\nthinking of it in terms of manufacturing.\n\n68\n00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:03.546\nIf I make 100 vehicles, like a car,\nhow many defects do we have and\n\n69\n00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.570\nhow can we reduce those defects?\n\n70\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.771\nBut if you apply it to IT, it can be\nsomething like help desk support tickets.\n\n71\n00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.170\nWhat's your average close time for\na help desk support ticket?\n\n72\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.560\nSix hours, all right.\n\n73\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.040\nWell, what if we could get\nthat down to five hours.\n\n74\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.330\nThat's process improvement,\nif we can make that better.\n\n75\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.450\nHow long does it take to deploy\na new server in the environment?\n\n76\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.330\nThree days.\n\n77\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.900\nCould we get that down to two days?\n\n78\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.210\nThat's process improvement.\n\n79\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.842\nSo its not necessarily manufacturing,\nwe can use these technologies in IT, and\n\n80\n00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:35.857\nI know you're a proponent of this,\nwe can use it not just in our work but\n\n81\n00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:37.240\nin our personal lives.\n\n82\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.371\nIt's really diverse.\n\n83\n00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:39.070\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n84\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.180\nMany of the Lean Six sigma tools can be\nused as meeting management tools as well.\n\n85\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.546\nI think the key thing for IT\nprofessionals to remember is that process\n\n86\n00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:52.987\nimprovement is designed to look at\nan activity you already in place and\n\n87\n00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:57.450\nhow can we make that activity better,\nfaster or more cost effective.\n\n88\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.064\nLean Six Sigma partners with all\nthose other methodologies and\n\n89\n00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:05.769\nyou can use it in software development or\ndata entry or just about anywhere anytime\n\n90\n00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:09.992\nthat you have an activity that has\nmore than one step that's a process.\n\n91\n00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:14.495\n>> All right, now throughout our\nseries we're going to be talking about\n\n92\n00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.700\na number of different tools\nthat are available and\n\n93\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.300\nmethods that you can apply\nto take existing processes.\n\n94\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.400\n>> And improve them to make them better.\n\n95\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.500\nOr even processes that don't quite\nexist yet and start to design.\n\n96\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.630\nI know, I hate to use that term, design,\nbecause we do start to blend into some\n\n97\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.840\nof the other methodologies\nthat are out there, but\n\n98\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.840\nyou'll find that Lean Six Sigma\nis pretty diverse with that, too.\n\n99\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.350\nNow, if we've watch the series, we've\nlearned the content, you'll have valuable\n\n100\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.090\ninformation that's ready to be applied\nin the workplace right then, but\n\n101\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.520\nI know a lot of you guys are interested\nin getting certifications.\n\n102\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.648\nYou wanna show that you are Lean Six\nsigma yellow belt certified.\n\n103\n00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:54.100\nSo, Dr. Stern if I want to get certified,\nwhat's the process for that?\n\n104\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.040\n>> Well we've made a very simple\nprocess at the end of the program.\n\n105\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.340\nYou can just go to my website,\nwhich is ssdglobal.\n\n106\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.284\nWe own kind of the most of the endings, so\n\n107\n00:06:04.284 --> 00:06:09.840\nif you just key in ssdglobal into\nthe browser, you'll come to the website.\n\n108\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.740\nAnd you apply for the test.\n\n109\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.854\nNow one of the things that the test is one\nof things that's going to be asked is,\n\n110\n00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:18.660\nif you already have some formal training.\n\n111\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.210\nThis would constitute\nas the formal training.\n\n112\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.180\nSo that qualifies you to sit for the exam.\n\n113\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.230\nIt's a, just like most quality exams,\nit is open book.\n\n114\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.662\nIt's online, it is timed and\nyou do have to study but\n\n115\n00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:35.796\nwe provide you a study guide and\nif you listen to all the videos,\n\n116\n00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:40.560\nthe study guide just sort of reiterates\nwhat you've all ready learned.\n\n117\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.338\n>> Yeah.\nYou might be wondering about that out\n\n118\n00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:43.180\nthere in TV land.\n\n119\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.430\nWe said it's an open book exam,\nbut here you are watching a video.\n\n120\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.610\nIt's open video too, [LAUGH] but\nyou won't have time for that.\n\n121\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.840\nSo the study guide is really handy for\nthat.\n\n122\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.770\nYou pay a nominal fee for the exam,\nif you do want to get certified.\n\n123\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.849\nYou don't have to get certified,\nthe information is very valuable and\n\n124\n00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.040\nuseable the way that it is.\n\n125\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.300\nBut if you want something to put on\nyour resume, it's a nice thing to do.\n\n126\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.108\nYou do get a certificate that\nshows that you completed it and\n\n127\n00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:06.860\nnow you're yellow belt certified.\n\n128\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.975\nAnd that's important,\n\n129\n00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:11.010\nespecially if you want to move beyond\nthat to green belt and higher.\n\n130\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.400\nThis is that first stepping stone.\n\n131\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.760\nIt's really nice,\nbecause it's a low barrier to entry.\n\n132\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.690\nYou can take the exam in\nthe comfort of you own home.\n\n133\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.801\nIt's an online exam, it's open book so\nit's not a ton of pressure but\n\n134\n00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.450\nyou do need to study and be prepared.\n\n135\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.580\nAnd then you can jump in and\nknock that one out.\n\n136\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.420\nIt's a great one.\n\n137\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.270\nI just like that you don't have to have\na lot of experience to go into this.\n\n138\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.400\nIt's very valuable.\n\n139\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.833\n>> And I think one of the benefits\nthat my company gives is that you can\n\n140\n00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:39.230\ntake the exam once you've\npaid that nominal fee.\n\n141\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.220\nIf for some reason you don't score 75\npercent or higher, you can take the exam.\n\n142\n00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.920\nThe only thing is that we ask you to wait\na week in between and go back and study.\n\n143\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.787\nNow when you get that exam the second\ntime, it's going to be covering the same\n\n144\n00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:55.300\ncontent, but\nit is a different set of questions.\n\n145\n00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.036\nSo I know a couple of people\nthink wow I'll just take it and\n\n146\n00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.865\nI'll just take it again next week cuz\nI will have memorized the question.\n\n147\n00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:05.250\nThere's definitely going to be different\nquestions over the same content.\n\n148\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.310\nBut we allow you to do that\nuntil you pass the exam.\n\n149\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.106\nAnother thing that I think is interesting\nabout the yellow belt certification is\n\n150\n00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:16.560\nthat I work with a couple of\ncompanies that require you to be\n\n151\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.436\nyellow belt certified for\nthem to consider you for a promotion and\n\n152\n00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:23.490\nsometimes even to be interviewed for\nthe company.\n\n153\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.710\nIt gives you an edge.\n\n154\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.960\nSo, being yellow belt certified tells\nthe employer, hey I'm at least based.\n\n155\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.380\nI'm at least aware of the basic\ninformation in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n156\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.219\nBecause what this course does is\nit covers of course training and\n\n157\n00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.290\ncertification in how that works.\n\n158\n00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.140\nBut it also covers\nthe Lean Six Sigma terminology.\n\n159\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.610\nIt covers all the tools.\n\n160\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.820\nIt covers the core Methodology,\nPDCA, and the model.\n\n161\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.038\nIt talks about how it\nimpacts the IT professionals,\n\n162\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:59.086\nthat we draw those connections between\nthat and say things like the CNN and\n\n163\n00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:03.130\nITEL so that you can have intelligent\nconversations about that.\n\n164\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.110\nSince we're all working\nfrom the same models,\n\n165\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.432\nwhat it also affords the yellow belt\nprofessional is to be able to feel\n\n166\n00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:15.590\nconfident that they are talking to a green\nbelt, black belt or master white belt.\n\n167\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.263\n>> Yeah, now I'm gonna steal one of your\nphrases here and that, basically when we\n\n168\n00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:24.588\napply Lean Six Sigma methodology to\nour environment, to our processes,\n\n169\n00:09:24.588 --> 00:09:28.940\nit's a great way to make things better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n170\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.400\nAnd so it's definitely something\nthat benefits you and your company.\n\n171\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.850\nIt really is a great resource.\n\n172\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.242\nSo, if that sounds exciting to you and\nit interesting and\n\n173\n00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.940\nyou want to jump in,\nI encourage you to do it.\n\n174\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.960\nStay tuned, we've got episodes for\nLean Six sigma coming up next.\n\n175\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.355\nIf that doesn't sound like the right fit\nfor you, well, no hard feelings there\n\n176\n00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.091\nwe've got plenty of content\navailable in the content library so\n\n177\n00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:51.490\nbe sure to check out the other\nshows that are available.\n\n178\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.401\nLots of stuff there in project management,\nand\n\n179\n00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:59.090\nother IT concepts that are just\nas important for most workers.\n\n180\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.192\nBut Lean Six Sigma,\nespecially the Yellow Belt Level,\n\n181\n00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:02.450\nreally does apply to everybody.\n\n182\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.730\nSo I hope to see you guys in\nour episodes coming up next.\n\n183\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.639\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
