Belt\n\n3\n00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:14.911\ncertification, and more importantly,\nwe're gonna look at how it\n\n4\n00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:20.058\napplies to IT professionals in the IT\nworld, because a lot of you guys have\n\n5\n00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:24.956\nprobably heard of six sigma or\nheard of lean or heard of Lean Six sigma,\n\n6\n00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:29.640\nbut heard of it in production floor or\nfactory type environments.\n\n7\n00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.702\nAnd applying it in IT is actually a very\nbeneficial thing that a lot of people just\n\n8\n00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:35.030\neither haven't thought of or\nhaven't heard of.\n\n9\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.922\nSo we're gonna take a look at that and\nkind of set you up for\n\n10\n00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:41.500\nwhat our video series is about to be\nthat covers well, Lean Six Sigma.\n\n11\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.210\nDr. Stern, if you could help me,\n\n12\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.641\nlet's start off with kind of\nan overview for people who don't know.\n\n13\n00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.560\nWhat is Lean Six Sigma?\n\n14\n00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.287\n>> Lean Six Sigma takes two methodologies,\nlean thinking and Six Sigma, and\n\n15\n00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.850\nit blends them together to help\nenhance our critical thinking skills.\n\n16\n00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.505\nAnd it is comprised of a methodology and\na tool set that can actually partner with\n\n17\n00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:05.020\njust about anything you\ncan think of in IT.\n\n18\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.651\n>> Now, one of the things I\nlike about Lean Six Sigma is\n\n19\n00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:14.720\nit takes a lot of stuff that\nreally would be difficult.\n\n20\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.410\nSix Sigma really focuses in\non statistics quite a bit.\n\n21\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.112\nA lot of math and\nLean Six Sigma makes it a lot more simple,\n\n22\n00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:23.590\na lot more easy and approachable.\n\n23\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.449\nSo I think it's a great way to implement\nprocess improvement in your environment,\n\n24\n00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:33.564\nand kind of tears down a lot of\nthe barriers of entry for it.\n\n25\n00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.910\nNow if somebody is going to be working\ntowards this, who would that somebody be.\n\n26\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.135\nWhat kind of person, what kind of IT\nworker would be interested in pursuing\n\n27\n00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:42.956\nthe Lean Six Sigma yellow belt?\n\n28\n00:01:42.956 --> 00:01:47.656\n>> Well that's kind of an interesting\nquestion because the yellow\n\n29\n00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:52.660\nbelt actually benefits everyone,\nnot just the IT professional.\n\n30\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.460\nBut the way it works with IT is that\nno matter what level of IT you're at,\n\n31\n00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.580\nthe tools that help you reason through\nproblem solving just make it easier.\n\n32\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.000\nAnd they partner, like I said, very well,\nwith already existing IT methodologies.\n\n33\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.960\nFor example, it works well with Agile.\n\n34\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.380\nIt works well with ITIL, or ITIL,\nwhich is what we say a lot here.\n\n35\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.923\nIt works even with CMN,\nthe capability maturity and so\n\n36\n00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:25.851\neven just getting familiar with\nthe basic terms and the terminology and\n\n37\n00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.320\nthe methodology is the benefit\nto the IT profession.\n\n38\n00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.155\n>> All right now,\n\n39\n00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:35.332\nour series that we're about to film here\nwe're gonna cover a lot of different\n\n40\n00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:39.440\nconcepts that serves as an introduction\nfor people to get their feet wet.\n\n41\n00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.904\nDo we need to have a lot of\nexperience before we jump into this?\n\n42\n00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:43.640\nOr you said it, it helps everybody.\n\n43\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.360\n>> It does help everyone and\n\n44\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.196\nI think one of the things that\n>> people are excited about is that once\n\n45\n00:02:47.196 --> 00:02:51.601\nthey get involved in the program there's\na lot about Lean Six Sigma that everyone\n\n46\n00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:52.530\nalready knows.\n\n47\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.100\nThey just didn't realize\nthere was a term for it.\n\n48\n00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.900\nOr they didn't realize that wasn't\nsomething you just did in your head.\n\n49\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.842\nAnd when you're trying to explain\nhow you think through things,\n\n50\n00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:05.152\nhaving these models are just\nreally very helpful.\n\n51\n00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:09.184\nSo to answer that question Don, you can\nstart from zero and in just a couple of\n\n52\n00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:12.780\ndays, you can go out and use\nLean Six Sigma tools to your advantage.\n\n53\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.081\n>> You know we had a funny conversation\nbefore filming this where, Dr.\n\n54\n00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:22.490\nSternon asked me how much\nI knew about Six Sigma.\n\n55\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.620\nAnd I said,\nI've worked in a lot of environments.\n\n56\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.863\nI'm a pmp certified project manager, so\n\n57\n00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:28.290\nI worked in a project\nmanagement environment.\n\n58\n00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.254\nI said I haven't really used\na lot of tools and production.\n\n59\n00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:35.120\nI've read the books, but\nI haven't actually implemented any.\n\n60\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.270\nAnd she said actually you have.\n\n61\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.080\nA lot of this stuff snaps right together\nwith the systems we already have in place.\n\n62\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.730\nAnd it's pretty neat to see that.\n\n63\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.210\nYou'll see that as we watch this series.\n\n64\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.600\nYou'll notice this kind\nof snapping together.\n\n65\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.264\nAnd one of the things that Lean Six sigma\nis built around is the idea of process\n\n66\n00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:55.587\nimprovement and the disconnect that I had,\nthe reason that I didn't\n\n67\n00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:59.387\nsee that connection was I was always\nthinking of it in terms of manufacturing.\n\n68\n00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:03.546\nIf I make 100 vehicles, like a car,\nhow many defects do we have and\n\n69\n00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:05.570\nhow can we reduce those defects?\n\n70\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.771\nBut if you apply it to IT, it can be\nsomething like help desk support tickets.\n\n71\n00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.170\nWhat's your average close time for\na help desk support ticket?\n\n72\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.560\nSix hours, all right.\n\n73\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.040\nWell, what if we could get\nthat down to five hours.\n\n74\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.330\nThat's process improvement,\nif we can make that better.\n\n75\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.450\nHow long does it take to deploy\na new server in the environment?\n\n76\n00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.330\nThree days.\n\n77\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.900\nCould we get that down to two days?\n\n78\n00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.210\nThat's process improvement.\n\n79\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.842\nSo its not necessarily manufacturing,\nwe can use these technologies in IT, and\n\n80\n00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:35.857\nI know you're a proponent of this,\nwe can use it not just in our work but\n\n81\n00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:37.240\nin our personal lives.\n\n82\n00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.371\nIt's really diverse.\n\n83\n00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:39.070\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n84\n00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.180\nMany of the Lean Six sigma tools can be\nused as meeting management tools as well.\n\n85\n00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.546\nI think the key thing for IT\nprofessionals to remember is that process\n\n86\n00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:52.987\nimprovement is designed to look at\nan activity you already in place and\n\n87\n00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:57.450\nhow can we make that activity better,\nfaster or more cost effective.\n\n88\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.064\nLean Six Sigma partners with all\nthose other methodologies and\n\n89\n00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:05.769\nyou can use it in software development or\ndata entry or just about anywhere anytime\n\n90\n00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:09.992\nthat you have an activity that has\nmore than one step that's a process.\n\n91\n00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:14.495\n>> All right, now throughout our\nseries we're going to be talking about\n\n92\n00:05:14.495 --> 00:05:17.700\na number of different tools\nthat are available and\n\n93\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.300\nmethods that you can apply\nto take existing processes.\n\n94\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.400\n>> And improve them to make them better.\n\n95\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.500\nOr even processes that don't quite\nexist yet and start to design.\n\n96\n00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.630\nI know, I hate to use that term, design,\nbecause we do start to blend into some\n\n97\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.840\nof the other methodologies\nthat are out there, but\n\n98\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.840\nyou'll find that Lean Six Sigma\nis pretty diverse with that, too.\n\n99\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.350\nNow, if we've watch the series, we've\nlearned the content, you'll have valuable\n\n100\n00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.090\ninformation that's ready to be applied\nin the workplace right then, but\n\n101\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.520\nI know a lot of you guys are interested\nin getting certifications.\n\n102\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.648\nYou wanna show that you are Lean Six\nsigma yellow belt certified.\n\n103\n00:05:50.648 --> 00:05:54.100\nSo, Dr. Stern if I want to get certified,\nwhat's the process for that?\n\n104\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.040\n>> Well we've made a very simple\nprocess at the end of the program.\n\n105\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.340\nYou can just go to my website,\nwhich is ssdglobal.\n\n106\n00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.284\nWe own kind of the most of the endings, so\n\n107\n00:06:04.284 --> 00:06:09.840\nif you just key in ssdglobal into\nthe browser, you'll come to the website.\n\n108\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.740\nAnd you apply for the test.\n\n109\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.854\nNow one of the things that the test is one\nof things that's going to be asked is,\n\n110\n00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:18.660\nif you already have some formal training.\n\n111\n00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.210\nThis would constitute\nas the formal training.\n\n112\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.180\nSo that qualifies you to sit for the exam.\n\n113\n00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.230\nIt's a, just like most quality exams,\nit is open book.\n\n114\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.662\nIt's online, it is timed and\nyou do have to study but\n\n115\n00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:35.796\nwe provide you a study guide and\nif you listen to all the videos,\n\n116\n00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:40.560\nthe study guide just sort of reiterates\nwhat you've all ready learned.\n\n117\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.338\n>> Yeah.\nYou might be wondering about that out\n\n118\n00:06:42.338 --> 00:06:43.180\nthere in TV land.\n\n119\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.430\nWe said it's an open book exam,\nbut here you are watching a video.\n\n120\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.610\nIt's open video too, [LAUGH] but\nyou won't have time for that.\n\n121\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.840\nSo the study guide is really handy for\nthat.\n\n122\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.770\nYou pay a nominal fee for the exam,\nif you do want to get certified.\n\n123\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.849\nYou don't have to get certified,\nthe information is very valuable and\n\n124\n00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:59.040\nuseable the way that it is.\n\n125\n00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.300\nBut if you want something to put on\nyour resume, it's a nice thing to do.\n\n126\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.108\nYou do get a certificate that\nshows that you completed it and\n\n127\n00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:06.860\nnow you're yellow belt certified.\n\n128\n00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.975\nAnd that's important,\n\n129\n00:07:07.975 --> 00:07:11.010\nespecially if you want to move beyond\nthat to green belt and higher.\n\n130\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.400\nThis is that first stepping stone.\n\n131\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.760\nIt's really nice,\nbecause it's a low barrier to entry.\n\n132\n00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.690\nYou can take the exam in\nthe comfort of you own home.\n\n133\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.801\nIt's an online exam, it's open book so\nit's not a ton of pressure but\n\n134\n00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.450\nyou do need to study and be prepared.\n\n135\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.580\nAnd then you can jump in and\nknock that one out.\n\n136\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.420\nIt's a great one.\n\n137\n00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.270\nI just like that you don't have to have\na lot of experience to go into this.\n\n138\n00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.400\nIt's very valuable.\n\n139\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.833\n>> And I think one of the benefits\nthat my company gives is that you can\n\n140\n00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:39.230\ntake the exam once you've\npaid that nominal fee.\n\n141\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.220\nIf for some reason you don't score 75\npercent or higher, you can take the exam.\n\n142\n00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.920\nThe only thing is that we ask you to wait\na week in between and go back and study.\n\n143\n00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.787\nNow when you get that exam the second\ntime, it's going to be covering the same\n\n144\n00:07:52.787 --> 00:07:55.300\ncontent, but\nit is a different set of questions.\n\n145\n00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.036\nSo I know a couple of people\nthink wow I'll just take it and\n\n146\n00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.865\nI'll just take it again next week cuz\nI will have memorized the question.\n\n147\n00:08:01.865 --> 00:08:05.250\nThere's definitely going to be different\nquestions over the same content.\n\n148\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.310\nBut we allow you to do that\nuntil you pass the exam.\n\n149\n00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.106\nAnother thing that I think is interesting\nabout the yellow belt certification is\n\n150\n00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:16.560\nthat I work with a couple of\ncompanies that require you to be\n\n151\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.436\nyellow belt certified for\nthem to consider you for a promotion and\n\n152\n00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:23.490\nsometimes even to be interviewed for\nthe company.\n\n153\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.710\nIt gives you an edge.\n\n154\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.960\nSo, being yellow belt certified tells\nthe employer, hey I'm at least based.\n\n155\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.380\nI'm at least aware of the basic\ninformation in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n156\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.219\nBecause what this course does is\nit covers of course training and\n\n157\n00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.290\ncertification in how that works.\n\n158\n00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:42.140\nBut it also covers\nthe Lean Six Sigma terminology.\n\n159\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.610\nIt covers all the tools.\n\n160\n00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.820\nIt covers the core Methodology,\nPDCA, and the model.\n\n161\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.038\nIt talks about how it\nimpacts the IT professionals,\n\n162\n00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:59.086\nthat we draw those connections between\nthat and say things like the CNN and\n\n163\n00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:03.130\nITEL so that you can have intelligent\nconversations about that.\n\n164\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.110\nSince we're all working\nfrom the same models,\n\n165\n00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.432\nwhat it also affords the yellow belt\nprofessional is to be able to feel\n\n166\n00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:15.590\nconfident that they are talking to a green\nbelt, black belt or master white belt.\n\n167\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.263\n>> Yeah, now I'm gonna steal one of your\nphrases here and that, basically when we\n\n168\n00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:24.588\napply Lean Six Sigma methodology to\nour environment, to our processes,\n\n169\n00:09:24.588 --> 00:09:28.940\nit's a great way to make things better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n170\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.400\nAnd so it's definitely something\nthat benefits you and your company.\n\n171\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.850\nIt really is a great resource.\n\n172\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.242\nSo, if that sounds exciting to you and\nit interesting and\n\n173\n00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.940\nyou want to jump in,\nI encourage you to do it.\n\n174\n00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.960\nStay tuned, we've got episodes for\nLean Six sigma coming up next.\n\n175\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.355\nIf that doesn't sound like the right fit\nfor you, well, no hard feelings there\n\n176\n00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.091\nwe've got plenty of content\navailable in the content library so\n\n177\n00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:51.490\nbe sure to check out the other\nshows that are available.\n\n178\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.401\nLots of stuff there in project management,\nand\n\n179\n00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:59.090\nother IT concepts that are just\nas important for most workers.\n\n180\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.192\nBut Lean Six Sigma,\nespecially the Yellow Belt Level,\n\n181\n00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:02.450\nreally does apply to everybody.\n\n182\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.730\nSo I hope to see you guys in\nour episodes coming up next.\n\n183\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.639\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.330\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.520\nI'm your host Don Pezet back with\nanother episode of, well, ITproTV.\n\n5\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.503\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe launching a new topic for us,\n\n6\n00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:26.525\nit's Lean Six Sigma.\n\n7\n00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:29.735\nNow if you've never heard of it,\nyou're in the right place,\n\n8\n00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.330\nbecause this episode is gonna introduce\nus to what Lean Six Sigma is.\n\n9\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.520\nAnd kinda get us ready to jump in and\n\n10\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.910\nreally learn how to implement\nthat in our environment.\n\n11\n00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.660\nAnd I've got the best help\nI could possibly hope for.\n\n12\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.692\nOn the show today, I've got Dr.\nStern with me.\n\n13\n00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.977\nShe is a leading authority\non Lean Six Sigma, and\n\n14\n00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:47.277\nshe's gonna help us walk\nthrough that process.\n\n15\n00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:50.946\nBut before we get ahead of ourselves, Dr.\nStern, why don't you tell us a little bit\n\n16\n00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.651\nabout yourself and\nkinda introduce yourself to our viewers?\n\n17\n00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.812\n>> Okay, thank you, Don.\n\n18\n00:00:54.812 --> 00:01:00.558\nI actually have a bio slide that I'd like\nto show you as I'm speaking about myself.\n\n19\n00:01:00.558 --> 00:01:03.572\nAnd I'm also gonna tell you\na little bit about the course and\n\n20\n00:01:03.572 --> 00:01:06.595\nthe difference between Lean and\nSix Sigma at the same time.\n\n21\n00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:08.916\nSo, I'm Dr. Terra Vanzant-Stern.\n\n22\n00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:12.057\nProbably the most important\ncredential I have for\n\n23\n00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:16.480\nthis class is that I'm the chair of\nthe ASQ Lean Enterprise division.\n\n24\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.184\nThat's the Lean side of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n25\n00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:23.433\nWe have 6,000 members, and\nwe work at setting standards for\n\n26\n00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.452\nthe industry on the Lean side.\n\n27\n00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.935\nI'm also chairing the Lean and\nSix Sigma conference,\n\n28\n00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.451\nwhich is an annual conference in Phoenix.\n\n29\n00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.307\nAnd I've written a number\nof books on Lean Six Sigma.\n\n30\n00:01:36.307 --> 00:01:40.493\nAfter this, I'm gonna show you the cover\nof my latest book, because most of this\n\n31\n00:01:40.493 --> 00:01:44.201\ncourse is based on that particular book,\nand I do a lot of white papers.\n\n32\n00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:48.787\nI have a new book coming out called\nLean and Agile Project Management.\n\n33\n00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:52.875\nBut the book that we're gonna be\nworking from in this course is called\n\n34\n00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:57.104\nLean Six Sigma International [LAUGH]\nStandards and Global Guidelines,\n\n35\n00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:58.387\na really long title.\n\n36\n00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:03.532\nAnd then I'm a PMP, and I have several\nHR credentials, as you can see, and\n\n37\n00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:08.924\na number of quality engineering type\ncertificates that I don't have on here,\n\n38\n00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:11.889\nbecause it was too much\nto fit on one slide.\n\n39\n00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.068\nSo, I'm gonna show you the cover\nof the book that we're using.\n\n40\n00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:20.862\nThis book is in its second edition,\nso that's kinda cool.\n\n41\n00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:24.414\n>> So, it's probably safe to say that\nyou know maybe just a little bit about\n\n42\n00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:25.239\nLean Six Sigma.\n\n43\n00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.086\nRight?\n\n44\n00:02:26.086 --> 00:02:26.644\n>> Yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:29.836\n>> [LAUGH] And you do this, I mean you've\nobviously written extensively on it.\n\n46\n00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:32.251\nYou know the topic, but\nyou've done this in practice too,\n\n47\n00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.538\nwhere you've actually\nimplemented these solutions.\n\n48\n00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:37.417\nYou're not just the book\nknowledge type person.\n\n49\n00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:38.021\nRight?\n\n50\n00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:38.775\n>> Right.\n\n51\n00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:43.198\nLean Six Sigma's all about making things\nbetter, faster or more cost effective.\n\n52\n00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:47.512\nAnd we have just dozens of successful\ncompanies that have taken this\n\n53\n00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:50.396\nmethodology and\ndone those types of things.\n\n54\n00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:54.378\nMy company, SSD Global, started in 1996.\n\n55\n00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:58.756\nAnd we still do some of this, but we\nstarted primarily as a global merger and\n\n56\n00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.159\nacquisition company.\n\n57\n00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.589\nAnd then in the 2000s, when we had the\neconomic crisis, a lot of the same people\n\n58\n00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.137\nthat were wanting to buy things\ninternationally started saying,\n\n59\n00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:08.982\nyou know what?\n\n60\n00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:10.259\nWe have to tighten our belt.\n\n61\n00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.923\nAnd that's where Lean Six Sigma comes in,\n\n62\n00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:16.783\nbecause Lean Six Sigma takes\ntwo incredible methodologies.\n\n63\n00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:20.520\nLean, reducing waste, and\nSix Sigma, reducing mistakes.\n\n64\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.982\nBlends it together so that you can\nmake existing processes better,\n\n65\n00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:25.815\nfaster, and more cost effective.\n\n66\n00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:30.871\nSo, our company actually teaches Lean\nby itself, Six Sigma by itself, but\n\n67\n00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:36.251\nby far, our biggest seller is Lean Six\nSigma, and it's certainly the way to go.\n\n68\n00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.890\n>> And I know most companies absolutely\ndon't have a shortage of ways for\n\n69\n00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.512\nmistakes.\n\n70\n00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.658\n[LAUGH] So, if we can reduce those,\nit makes a big difference.\n\n71\n00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:44.899\n>> Absolutely.\n\n72\n00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.388\nAnd in this course,\nwhat we're gonna do is,\n\n73\n00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:51.134\nwe're gonna talk about the training and\ncertification dynamics.\n\n74\n00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:55.187\nBecause it does get a little confusing,\nsince Lean is its own methodology,\n\n75\n00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:57.229\nand Six Sigma is its own methodology.\n\n76\n00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:02.152\nAnd Lean Six Sigma is actually a third\nmethodology that not only blends\n\n77\n00:04:02.152 --> 00:04:05.413\nthose two but\nsort of robs the best of the best.\n\n78\n00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:08.704\nSo, we're gonna talk about that and\nwhy it's so important,\n\n79\n00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:12.390\nwhat companies are using it, and\nwhy people are so excited about it.\n\n80\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.235\nWe're also gonna talk about how it\ninterfaces with other process improvement\n\n81\n00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:17.115\nmethodologies.\n\n82\n00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:21.443\nBecause most process\nimprovement methodologies take\n\n83\n00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:26.436\nan existing process and\nthey want you to just use their system.\n\n84\n00:04:26.436 --> 00:04:30.546\nAnd Lean Six Sigma works in a partnership.\n\n85\n00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:32.496\nIt's also a grass roots effort.\n\n86\n00:04:32.496 --> 00:04:37.098\nSo for example if you chose a process\nimprovement program such as ISO,\n\n87\n00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:39.833\nthe CEO would have to make that decision.\n\n88\n00:04:39.833 --> 00:04:44.220\nLean Six Sigma's one of the few process\nimprovement methodologies that you can\n\n89\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.310\njust Lean Six Sigma yourself and\nthen your department.\n\n90\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.859\nSo, we're also gonna spend some\ntime talking about how it impacts\n\n91\n00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:56.504\ndifferent types of professionals,\ncertainly IT professionals.\n\n92\n00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.990\nWe're gonna discuss\nsome basic terminology.\n\n93\n00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.847\nWe're gonna in it, I'm gonna show you how\nyou can identify a Lean Six Sigma project\n\n94\n00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:07.011\nand use maybe Lean Six Sigma thinking.\n\n95\n00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:10.595\nAnd then we're gonna wrap up by\ntalking about how to get buy-in,\n\n96\n00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:14.374\nbecause a lot of times, you have\na really good idea for a project, and\n\n97\n00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:17.263\nit doesn't even have to be\na Lean Six Sigma project.\n\n98\n00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:22.487\nBut we're going to use a Lean Six Sigma\nmethodology called the DMAIC\n\n99\n00:05:22.487 --> 00:05:27.084\nmodel to get buy-in from people\non things that we wanna do.\n\n100\n00:05:27.084 --> 00:05:30.300\n>> And yeah, that's one of the really neat\nconcepts here that I had a hard time with.\n\n101\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.830\nI had heard of Lean Six Sigma\nnumerous times.\n\n102\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.162\nAlways thought of it in terms of factory\nfloors, production environments.\n\n103\n00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:37.868\nNever thought about it in terms of IT.\n\n104\n00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:42.037\nBut these are concepts that can really\nbe applied to practically any type of\n\n105\n00:05:42.037 --> 00:05:42.709\nbusiness.\n\n106\n00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:43.360\nRight?\n\n107\n00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.106\n>> Absolutely, it's just a retail,\nhospitals, the military is using it.\n\n108\n00:05:49.106 --> 00:05:53.541\nIt partners with,\nthe idea behind Lean Six Sigma is just you\n\n109\n00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:56.745\nincrease your critical thinking skills.\n\n110\n00:05:56.745 --> 00:05:59.008\nAnd sometimes what happens is we have so\n\n111\n00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:02.584\nmuch on our plate that we don't\nknow which direction to go in.\n\n112\n00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:06.299\nSo Lean Six Sigma partners with\nwhatever we've got going on.\n\n113\n00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:10.301\nAnd by use of templates and\nby use of critical thinking techniques and\n\n114\n00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:11.685\nthose types of things.\n\n115\n00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.124\nIt just makes things better faster and\nmore cost effective.\n\n116\n00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.364\nAnd you're gonna hear me say that a lot.\n\n117\n00:06:16.364 --> 00:06:17.699\n>> Better, faster, cost effective.\n\n118\n00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.058\nAll good things to have.\n\n119\n00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:24.119\nAll right, so I think we've got a good\nidea of what Lean Six Sigma is.\n\n120\n00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.984\nWe know what we're gonna be covering\nin t his show, let's get to it.\n\n121\n00:06:27.984 --> 00:06:29.271\nLet's get to it,\nwhat do you wanna talk about first?\n\n122\n00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.281\n>> Well I'd like to talk about\nthe training and certification and\n\n123\n00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:34.913\nhow that works,\nbecause it is a little bit confusing.\n\n124\n00:06:34.913 --> 00:06:40.381\nIn the quality world, and you're gonna\nnotice that process improvement for\n\n125\n00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:43.167\na long time was referred to as quality.\n\n126\n00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:47.195\nAnd there's been even\nprocess re-engineering.\n\n127\n00:06:47.195 --> 00:06:49.993\nNow the buzzword seems to\nbe process improvement.\n\n128\n00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:55.450\nBut, quality, making things better and\ncertainly faster and more cost effective.\n\n129\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.807\nMost exam in the quality world, and that\nwould be your Quality Engineering Exams,\n\n130\n00:07:00.807 --> 00:07:03.869\nyour Quality Auditor Exams,\ncertainly Lean,\n\n131\n00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:08.091\nI mean certainly Six Sigma and\nthose types of exams are open book.\n\n132\n00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:11.865\nAnd the downside of that is that\nthey're still manual processes.\n\n133\n00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:13.622\nNow, over the next couple of years,\n\n134\n00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:16.126\nI'm sure those tests\nare going to be computerized.\n\n135\n00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:20.187\nBut now, when you decide if you\nwanna be in Lean or in Six Sigma,\n\n136\n00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:23.649\nyou have to have to find where\nthe test is being given.\n\n137\n00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:27.351\nAnd the good news, however,\nis it's open book.\n\n138\n00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:30.238\nASQ, American Society for Quality, and\n\n139\n00:07:30.238 --> 00:07:36.104\nthat's the association that I'm on their\nboard for the Lean Enterprise division.\n\n140\n00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:41.561\nThey kind of monitor the body\nof knowledge for Six Sigma.\n\n141\n00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:45.337\nThey don't own it, but\nthey monitor it, and so therefore,\n\n142\n00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:49.199\nthey are the leading people that\ngive just the Six Sigma test.\n\n143\n00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.332\nAnd then SME, the Society for\n\n144\n00:07:51.332 --> 00:07:55.782\nMechanical Engineering monitors\nthe body of Lean thinking.\n\n145\n00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:57.244\nAnd, again, they don't own it.\n\n146\n00:07:57.244 --> 00:08:01.129\nBut they're sort of the most respected\npeople as far as managing that body of\n\n147\n00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.806\nknowledge.\n\n148\n00:08:01.806 --> 00:08:07.601\nNow, there are other service providers,\nsuch as myself, which SSD Global.\n\n149\n00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:10.038\nAnd there's universities and\n\n150\n00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:14.727\nother independent vendors that\ngive a Lean Six Sigma test.\n\n151\n00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.258\nAnd I'm not sure about the other vendors.\n\n152\n00:08:17.258 --> 00:08:19.386\nMy particular certification test,\n\n153\n00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:24.061\nwhich you'll be able to take on my website\nis open book, which is the good thing.\n\n154\n00:08:24.061 --> 00:08:28.461\nBut it's computerized, so you can take\nit from the privacy of your own home.\n\n155\n00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.928\nAnd I guess I can show you my\nwebsite really quickly, so\n\n156\n00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:32.280\nthey know how to access that.\n\n157\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.139\n>> Yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:34.265\n>> If you're okay with that?\n\n159\n00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:37.302\n>> Absolutely and one of the great things\nto remember here is that when you watch\n\n160\n00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.303\nthe show, we're getting you ready for\nthe exam.\n\n161\n00:08:39.303 --> 00:08:42.911\nSo you'll have a chance to see all\nthe various topics that you need to be\n\n162\n00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:43.780\nfamiliar with.\n\n163\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.484\nAnd then when you're ready,\nyou can just jump right over it.\n\n164\n00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:47.971\nIt's part of the SSD Global website.\n\n165\n00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:48.631\nRight?\n\n166\n00:08:48.631 --> 00:08:51.194\nThat you can jump over there and,\nyou pay a nominal fee and\n\n167\n00:08:51.194 --> 00:08:53.611\nthen you're able to take the exam and\nget certified.\n\n168\n00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:58.007\nIt really removes the barriers of entry\nfor getting that first certification and\n\n169\n00:08:58.007 --> 00:08:59.567\nmoving into Lean Six Sigma.\n\n170\n00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:00.508\n>> Exactly.\n\n171\n00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:03.671\nAnd so I'm gonna show you my\nwebsite just very quickly, so\n\n172\n00:09:03.671 --> 00:09:06.265\nyou have an idea of where\nyou may want to go next.\n\n173\n00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:10.049\nI wanna stress that in this course\nyou may not elect to get certified.\n\n174\n00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:15.028\nHowever, some companies are now requiring\na Lean Six Sigma yellow belt certification\n\n175\n00:09:15.028 --> 00:09:16.539\nto interview for the job.\n\n176\n00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:20.448\nWhat the Lean Six Sigma yellow belt\ncertification does give you is\n\n177\n00:09:20.448 --> 00:09:25.282\nyou can say to the industry, I have a\nknowledge of that particular methodology,\n\n178\n00:09:25.282 --> 00:09:27.550\nwhich is very, very popular.\n\n179\n00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.579\nBut it gives you an idea\nif you wanna go further.\n\n180\n00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:34.821\nThere's a, which we'll be discussing\na little bit later in class,\n\n181\n00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:37.242\nfollows a martial arts nomenclature.\n\n182\n00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:40.603\nSo, once after you're a yellow belt,\nyou might decide to be a green belt, or\n\n183\n00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:42.280\na black belt, or a master black belt.\n\n184\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.054\nBut it's a very large time\ncommitment to do that.\n\n185\n00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:49.455\nAnd so this course lets you know if this\nis something that's a good fit for you.\n\n186\n00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:54.238\nSo we're at my website right now,\nwhich is ssdglobal.info.\n\n187\n00:09:54.238 --> 00:09:58.230\nAnd I just would like to point out\nquickly that over on the Service and\n\n188\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.097\nTraining area, you'll see\nsomething called the Student Page.\n\n189\n00:10:02.097 --> 00:10:06.212\nAnd there's all kind of free resources and\ninformation about Lean and\n\n190\n00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:10.270\nLean Six Sigma, and Six Sigma that\nyou might wanna be interested in.\n\n191\n00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.780\nAnd on the cover page,\n\n192\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:17.119\nyou'll see that there's a link that will\nexplain to you about taking the test.\n\n193\n00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:19.833\nWhen you do take the test,\nthere is a small nominal fee, but\n\n194\n00:10:19.833 --> 00:10:21.914\nit comes with a study guide and\na cheat sheet.\n\n195\n00:10:21.914 --> 00:10:27.174\nAnd again, I wanna stress that even if\nyou don't take the test, there's gonna\n\n196\n00:10:27.174 --> 00:10:32.455\nbe things in this class that you're gonna\nbe able to walk away and use tomorrow.\n\n197\n00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:36.160\n>> Yeah, and that's really the cool part,\nand I know you mentioned it earlier in\n\n198\n00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.490\nthe show, that you don't have to\nLean Six Sigma your whole business.\n\n199\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.674\nIt just could be an individual person.\n\n200\n00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:45.410\nIt could be a department that does it, and\nthe company slowly adopts the methodology.\n\n201\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.010\nThat makes it really easy to implement it,\nand Lean is, I'm sorry,\n\n202\n00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.133\nLean Six Sigma is really all about that.\n\n203\n00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:51.714\nRight?\n\n204\n00:10:51.714 --> 00:10:55.587\nRemoving those barriers, making it\neasier to implement and employ, so\n\n205\n00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:57.054\nit's a great technology.\n\n206\n00:10:57.054 --> 00:11:00.661\n>> Yeah, and Don, what I'd like to do\nright now is just kinda talk a little bit\n\n207\n00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.734\nabout the history and how it partners with\nother process improvement methodologies\n\n208\n00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:06.074\nand things like that, if.\n\n209\n00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:06.968\n>> Sure.\n\n210\n00:11:06.968 --> 00:11:07.885\nNo, that's a great place.\n\n211\n00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:10.834\n>> Okay, well, first,\nI wanted to say welcome to the future.\n\n212\n00:11:10.834 --> 00:11:16.369\nSo, I'm back to my slide deck, and why\nI say that is because Lean Six Sigma is\n\n213\n00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:22.269\na lot about assessing your current state\nand then looking at where you want to be.\n\n214\n00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:27.145\nNow, as simple as that sounds,\nwe live in a very reactive society.\n\n215\n00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:30.627\nSo someone runs in, and they present\na problem to us, and we just go out.\n\n216\n00:11:30.627 --> 00:11:33.264\nWe just try to fix that problem.\n\n217\n00:11:33.264 --> 00:11:38.223\nLean Six Sigma wants you to take a step\nback and look at your current state and\n\n218\n00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:42.805\nassess your current state and\nthen design a good plan for the future.\n\n219\n00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:46.404\nAnd, again, it's very simple,\nLean Six Sigma is designed to be simple.\n\n220\n00:11:46.404 --> 00:11:48.798\nIt's just things that\nwe may have forgotten.\n\n221\n00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:52.466\nA lot of times, people say, I don't\nknow anything about Lean Six Sigma, and\n\n222\n00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:55.811\nI would challenge you by saying that\nyou work with Lean Six Sigma a lot.\n\n223\n00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:59.549\nYou just might not know\nit by the terms that.\n\n224\n00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:01.523\nHave been being used.\n\n225\n00:12:01.523 --> 00:12:07.510\nI wanna talk a second about\nthe basics of Process Improvement.\n\n226\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.527\nThere's a model called Better,\nFaster, More Cost-Effective.\n\n227\n00:12:11.527 --> 00:12:15.308\nAnd for those of you who are project\nmanagers, when you look at this model,\n\n228\n00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:18.910\nyou have probably been told you can\nmake something better and faster and\n\n229\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.848\nit's not gonna be cost-effective.\n\n230\n00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:25.387\nOr you can choose cost-effective and\nfaster and it's not gonna be better.\n\n231\n00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:28.678\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\nwe're using those same three words, but\n\n232\n00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:32.040\nwe're looking through\nan entirely different lens.\n\n233\n00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.381\nWe're saying that we're going\nto take an existing process,\n\n234\n00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:38.208\nthat means an activity that\nis already happening and\n\n235\n00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:41.690\nwe're going to make it better,\nfaster or more cost effective.\n\n236\n00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.589\nNow, I'm going to go a little more into\ndetail about this particular model.\n\n237\n00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:48.671\nBut I just wanna set\nthe record straight right now.\n\n238\n00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:53.030\nBecause I know a lot of you watching\nhave a project management background and\n\n239\n00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.978\nI don't want you to get those words\nconfused with the way we use them in\n\n240\n00:12:56.978 --> 00:12:58.294\nproject management.\n\n241\n00:12:58.294 --> 00:13:00.418\n>> Yeah, and we've gonna see that\nas kind of a recurring theme.\n\n242\n00:13:00.418 --> 00:13:01.138\n>> Absolutely.\n\n243\n00:13:01.138 --> 00:13:01.730\n>> As we go through here.\n\n244\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.560\nProject Management handles things\na little bit differently than how we do\n\n245\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.590\nour ongoing operations and Lean Six Sigma\nkinda covers both in a way, right?\n\n246\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.655\nOngoing operations and project operations.\n\n247\n00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:12.713\n>> Absolutely.\n\n248\n00:13:12.713 --> 00:13:18.280\nAnd a lot of people use Lean Six Sigma\nas a management system overall too,\n\n249\n00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.870\nso it's kinda multi-purpose.\n\n250\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.771\nWhat you need to be successful\nin Lean Six Sigma is that\n\n251\n00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:26.681\nyou really need the tools\nto know your current state.\n\n252\n00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:30.606\nA lot of people drop the ball when they're\nlooking at what's going on right now.\n\n253\n00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:34.647\nAnd you'd be surprised at how many people\ntry to improve a process that they know\n\n254\n00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.504\nnothing about.\n\n255\n00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:42.122\nSo Lean Six Sigma has a lot of tools\nof help you figure out where I am now.\n\n256\n00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:46.139\nYou also need to have an idea of what\nit is you're trying to accomplish.\n\n257\n00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:49.126\nAnd again, it seems like common sense, but\n\n258\n00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:53.886\na lot of times I think our bosses walk\nin and they ask us to to do things and\n\n259\n00:13:53.886 --> 00:13:57.957\nwe really don't know what\nthey're trying to accomplish.\n\n260\n00:13:57.957 --> 00:14:02.348\nOne of my favorite books of all time is\ncalled Why Smart Executives Fail, and\n\n261\n00:14:02.348 --> 00:14:06.616\none of the chapters is titled\nBrilliantly Fulfilling the Wrong Mission.\n\n262\n00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:12.804\nSo Lean Six Sigma wants you to understand\nwhat it is you're trying to accomplish.\n\n263\n00:14:12.804 --> 00:14:15.461\nAnd there's actually tools that\nwill help you with that as well.\n\n264\n00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:17.297\nYou need a plan, right?\n\n265\n00:14:17.297 --> 00:14:19.776\nAnd again, I just said this, but\n\n266\n00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:25.370\nwe live in such a reactive society that\noften we just forget about the plan.\n\n267\n00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.242\nSo there's a lot of planning\ntools in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n268\n00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.343\nAnd then you need tools\nto make the plan work.\n\n269\n00:14:30.343 --> 00:14:34.579\nI'm sure a lot of you have been in\nsituation where you've done a lot of\n\n270\n00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:37.428\nplanning and\nthen it gets to that execution and\n\n271\n00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:41.905\nyou just can't quite make that step,\nso a lot of tools about doing that.\n\n272\n00:14:41.905 --> 00:14:45.463\nAnd then you need a motivation\nstrategy to get it going,\n\n273\n00:14:45.463 --> 00:14:49.626\nbecause we can come up with\nthe perfect plan, but if we don't have\n\n274\n00:14:49.626 --> 00:14:54.590\ncontrols in place to move the plan along,\nthen it's still not gonna work.\n\n275\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.229\n>> Yeah, so it's important that we\nidentify all the pieces that we need.\n\n276\n00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:02.607\nThe plan, the execution and that we\nactually make sure that it all does occur.\n\n277\n00:15:02.607 --> 00:15:06.469\nBecause there's plenty of places that\neither jump right to execution without\n\n278\n00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:09.989\nproper planning or do great planning and\nmisdeliver on the execution.\n\n279\n00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:12.033\nSo it really is an all encompassing thing.\n\n280\n00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:14.134\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n281\n00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:18.709\nI think what I'd like to do next is kinda\ntalk a little bit about the Lean Six Sigma\n\n282\n00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:21.935\nconnection with other\nprocess improvement programs.\n\n283\n00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:26.716\nNow some of these processing improvement\nprograms are specifically for\n\n284\n00:15:26.716 --> 00:15:30.724\nIT, but over the years,\nthey've become more mainstream.\n\n285\n00:15:30.724 --> 00:15:36.745\nThese are terms that you've\nprobably heard before,\n\n286\n00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:42.112\nLean, AGILE, Six Sigma, ISO, CMMI, ITIL.\n\n287\n00:15:42.112 --> 00:15:44.387\nI know some people say I-T-I-L.\n\n288\n00:15:44.387 --> 00:15:45.431\nSome people say ITIL.\n\n289\n00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:46.269\nWhat do you say, Don?\n\n290\n00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:47.244\n>> I say ITIL.\n\n291\n00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:50.366\nIt's a symptom of being\na technology that came from the UK.\n\n292\n00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.990\nAnd then came over here to the US and\n\n293\n00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.301\nso we pronounce things however we want,\nright?\n\n294\n00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:57.203\n[LAUGH] So\nit can be pronounce different way.\n\n295\n00:15:57.203 --> 00:15:59.363\n>> And then Lean Six Sigma.\n\n296\n00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:06.827\nSo I'm gonna talk just briefly about\neach one of these particular areas.\n\n297\n00:16:06.827 --> 00:16:10.952\nSo first I wanna talk, well, I'm actually\ngonna talk about, sorry about that.\n\n298\n00:16:10.952 --> 00:16:13.865\nI'm gonna actually talk about\nthe ones other than Lean and\n\n299\n00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:18.093\nSix Sigma because we're gonna be spending\na lot of time on those particular things.\n\n300\n00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:24.013\nSo I'm gonna start with Lean Six Sigma and\nAGILE.\n\n301\n00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:27.854\nNow Agile rather, and how do you say that?\n\n302\n00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:29.573\n>> I say Agile.\n\n303\n00:16:29.573 --> 00:16:34.023\n>> Agile has morphed into a PM\nmethodology as you know it really,\n\n304\n00:16:34.023 --> 00:16:38.474\nthe basis, the roots of that\nwere in software development and\n\n305\n00:16:38.474 --> 00:16:43.028\nnow it's become more kindof a way\nthat we can manage projects.\n\n306\n00:16:43.028 --> 00:16:46.961\nAnd it uses a lot of the same critical\nthinking tools that are commonly used in\n\n307\n00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:47.821\nLean Six Sigma,\n\n308\n00:16:47.821 --> 00:16:51.887\nit's just that sometimes they call\nthe tools something slightly different.\n\n309\n00:16:51.887 --> 00:16:56.312\nI'm sure a lot of you are familiar even\nif you don't know a lot about Agile,\n\n310\n00:16:56.312 --> 00:17:00.570\nyou know some about Scroun and\nit's a method that's used in Agile.\n\n311\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.196\nAnd it promotes flexibility\nat the human factors.\n\n312\n00:17:03.196 --> 00:17:05.971\nAnd that's one of the cool\nthings about Lean Six Sigma.\n\n313\n00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:10.551\nOne of the synergies is that\nLean Six Sigma is very concerned\n\n314\n00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:12.572\nabout the people factor.\n\n315\n00:17:12.572 --> 00:17:17.532\nAnd then a lot of time in the Agile world\nthey're using a model that is quite\n\n316\n00:17:17.532 --> 00:17:19.456\nsimilar to the DMAIC model.\n\n317\n00:17:19.456 --> 00:17:24.065\nThe DMAIC model,\nwhich we'll be talking about\n\n318\n00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:28.917\na lot has a kind of a cousin\ncalled the DMADV model.\n\n319\n00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:33.395\nAnd it's sort of a funny thing,\nbecause DMAIC is said DMAIC, but\n\n320\n00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:37.393\nall the other models,\nyou typically say out the letters.\n\n321\n00:17:37.393 --> 00:17:42.174\nSo, it's very, very similar, it's Define,\nMeasure, Analyze, Design, and Verify.\n\n322\n00:17:42.174 --> 00:17:47.181\nAnd even though that's not\nalways noted in Agile,\n\n323\n00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:52.193\nit's a model that closely\nmaps the Lean Six Sigma.\n\n324\n00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:54.247\n>> Yeah, that one, I don't know\nthat there's a way to say that and\n\n325\n00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:55.247\nhave it sound like [CROSSTALK].\n\n326\n00:17:55.247 --> 00:17:56.593\n>> Yeah.\n\n327\n00:17:56.593 --> 00:17:57.115\n[LAUGH].\n\n328\n00:17:57.115 --> 00:17:58.149\n>> It doesn't roll off the tongue.\n\n329\n00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:00.529\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n330\n00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:03.535\nAnd then, Lean Six Sigma and ISO.\n\n331\n00:18:03.535 --> 00:18:07.575\nISO is a book of best practices,\nis the best way to explain it.\n\n332\n00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:12.846\nI know a lot of the people in\nthe audience have familiarity with ISO.\n\n333\n00:18:12.846 --> 00:18:14.750\nThat was hard to say,\nstumbled over that one.\n\n334\n00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.689\nAre familiar with ISO.\n\n335\n00:18:16.689 --> 00:18:21.912\nIn the States we're pretty much familiar\nwith the 9000 and the 14000 series.\n\n336\n00:18:21.912 --> 00:18:26.707\nBut kinda in a nut shell,\nit's a book of best practices.\n\n337\n00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:31.639\nAnd ISO's idea, to make things better,\nfaster, and more cost effective, is to\n\n338\n00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:36.820\npresent these best practices and then\nhave companies map to that best practice.\n\n339\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.384\nSo there's a certification effort where\nLean Six Sigma generally comes in\n\n340\n00:18:41.384 --> 00:18:43.564\nis in the recertification effort.\n\n341\n00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:49.533\nIf you get certified in ISO 9000 or\n14000, and you're doing pretty well,\n\n342\n00:18:49.533 --> 00:18:55.266\nyou don't usually have to look at the\nrecertification process for three years.\n\n343\n00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:59.956\nBut when the three year mark comes up, the\nway you document that you really have done\n\n344\n00:18:59.956 --> 00:19:04.379\nprocess improvement kinda falls a little\nbit more in the Lean Six Sigma world.\n\n345\n00:19:04.379 --> 00:19:09.109\nAnd the ISO rules on documentation are\njust loose enough that you really kinda\n\n346\n00:19:09.109 --> 00:19:10.427\nneed a methodology.\n\n347\n00:19:10.427 --> 00:19:16.185\nSo a lot of times, Lean Six Sigma partners\nwith ISO in that recertification effort.\n\n348\n00:19:16.185 --> 00:19:19.460\nThe other ISO connection\nis incredibly interesting.\n\n349\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.447\nWhen I say new ISO certification,\ncuz some of these things have been out for\n\n350\n00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:26.203\nlike 20 and 40 years.\n\n351\n00:19:26.203 --> 00:19:31.790\nISO 12500 is the project\nmanagement guideline for ISO.\n\n352\n00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.348\nFormally what happened is most of us,\nat least here in the States have relied\n\n353\n00:19:36.348 --> 00:19:39.853\non the PMBoK,\nthe Project Management Body of Knowledge.\n\n354\n00:19:39.853 --> 00:19:44.703\nAnd then a lot of universities\nsuch as Villanova develop\n\n355\n00:19:44.703 --> 00:19:48.118\ntheir own sorta project methodology.\n\n356\n00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:52.408\nAnd then of course, you can get\nan undergrad, a BA, in Project Management,\n\n357\n00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:54.655\neven as Masters in Project Management.\n\n358\n00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:59.400\nSo there's a lot of different bodies\nof knowledge, but who's been on top for\n\n359\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.888\nthe longest period of time is the PMBoK.\n\n360\n00:20:01.888 --> 00:20:07.124\nHowever, with ISO 12500\nentering the picture\n\n361\n00:20:07.124 --> 00:20:11.174\nthe dynamics have changed a little bit.\n\n362\n00:20:11.174 --> 00:20:15.866\nWhat's kinda nice about\nLean Six Sigma is that Lean Six Sigma\n\n363\n00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:19.455\nis heavily rooted in project management,\nbut\n\n364\n00:20:19.455 --> 00:20:25.453\nit picks the pieces that are the same\nbetween the ISO guideline and the PMBoK.\n\n365\n00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:27.404\nSo they have mostly synergies,\n\n366\n00:20:27.404 --> 00:20:30.955\nthere's really just a very\nfew things that they deviate.\n\n367\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:35.257\nBut Lean Six Sigma focuses on the pieces\nof project management that's similar in\n\n368\n00:20:35.257 --> 00:20:36.930\nboth bodies of knowledge.\n\n369\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.175\n>> One of the really cool parts about\nthat is how complete Lean Six Sigma is.\n\n370\n00:20:40.175 --> 00:20:44.973\nBecause I have a background in project\nmanagement, the PMBoK it's a collection of\n\n371\n00:20:44.973 --> 00:20:49.164\ntools that you can use but not\nnecessarily a methodology for using them.\n\n372\n00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:53.161\nYou have to pick and choose the components\nyou want to build your own On environment,\n\n373\n00:20:53.161 --> 00:20:55.749\nand with that,\nyou are kind of left to your own means for\n\n374\n00:20:55.749 --> 00:20:59.013\na lot of stuff and it can make it\nchallenging to implement sometimes,\n\n375\n00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:01.285\nwhere you can even\nimplement it incorrectly.\n\n376\n00:21:01.285 --> 00:21:03.875\nBut when you take something\nlike Lean Six Sigma,\n\n377\n00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:07.585\nit really strung that together\nin a way that it's ready to go.\n\n378\n00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:09.695\nYou've got all the components you need,\n\n379\n00:21:09.695 --> 00:21:11.975\nand an actual method of\ninstruction you can use to deploy.\n\n380\n00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:13.321\n>> Yeah, that's absolutely the truth.\n\n381\n00:21:13.321 --> 00:21:14.090\n>> All right, so\n\n382\n00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:18.396\nwe've got kind of an idea of some of the\ndifferent standards that are out there.\n\n383\n00:21:18.396 --> 00:21:20.188\nWere there any other standards\nthat you wanna, oh you do.\n\n384\n00:21:20.188 --> 00:21:23.969\n>> Well I did want to\nbriefly mention CMMI, and\n\n385\n00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:28.475\nthat stands for for\nthe capability maturity model.\n\n386\n00:21:28.475 --> 00:21:31.388\nAnd it's kind of interesting because,\n\n387\n00:21:31.388 --> 00:21:36.708\nit was originally a software development\nprocess improvement program.\n\n388\n00:21:36.708 --> 00:21:41.745\nCarnegie Melon is the owner of that,\nbut our tax dollars pay for\n\n389\n00:21:41.745 --> 00:21:47.863\nit so it's used a lot by the defense\nindustry, different people like that.\n\n390\n00:21:47.863 --> 00:21:49.590\nTheir spin on how to make things better,\nfaster, or\n\n391\n00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.180\nmore cost effective is\nto have five levels.\n\n392\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.060\nAnd it's pretty intricate what's supposed\nto happen in each one of these levels.\n\n393\n00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:59.260\nHowever, between level two and\nlevel three,\n\n394\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.560\na lot of times Lean Six Sigma\npeople are brought into the mix.\n\n395\n00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.615\nTo get involved when the CMM effort\nis often very expensive, and\n\n396\n00:22:08.615 --> 00:22:14.057\nto really actually call yourself a CMM Or\nCMMI company, either one.\n\n397\n00:22:14.057 --> 00:22:16.215\nThey're used kind of interchangeably.\n\n398\n00:22:16.215 --> 00:22:16.937\nYou have to have achieved a level three.\n\n399\n00:22:16.937 --> 00:22:22.808\nYou can say you're working on it, but\nif you're not a level three company,\n\n400\n00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:28.520\nthen you can't really claim it as\nbeing part of your company, a culture.\n\n401\n00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.736\nThere's a lot of things that\nhappen between level two and\n\n402\n00:22:31.736 --> 00:22:35.557\nlevel three that require Lean Six Sigma\nexpertise to get you there.\n\n403\n00:22:35.557 --> 00:22:38.830\nAnd once again, what I think\nis really valuable about that,\n\n404\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:43.255\nis that Lean Six Sigma, even though it,\ntoo, is a process improvement program,\n\n405\n00:22:43.255 --> 00:22:46.223\ndoesn't come in and\nsay we're not doing CMM any more.\n\n406\n00:22:46.223 --> 00:22:49.305\nI mean, there might have been\na big financial effort in that.\n\n407\n00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:54.597\nIt says, let's make your CMM program\nbetter, faster, more cost [INAUDIBLE].\n\n408\n00:22:54.597 --> 00:22:59.227\nAnd then that brings us to\nour conversation earlier.\n\n409\n00:22:59.227 --> 00:22:59.972\nITIL.\n\n410\n00:22:59.972 --> 00:23:02.302\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, and the comment I was making.\n\n411\n00:23:02.302 --> 00:23:07.013\nThis was before the show,\nwas how I've worked in ITIL environments.\n\n412\n00:23:07.013 --> 00:23:11.017\nI've worked in or PMI type environment for\nproject management.\n\n413\n00:23:11.017 --> 00:23:13.734\nBut, I've never worked in\na true Six Sigma environment,\n\n414\n00:23:13.734 --> 00:23:16.618\ncuz I always thought of that as\nfactory floors in production,\n\n415\n00:23:16.618 --> 00:23:19.350\nand you've made the comment\nthat I actually have used it.\n\n416\n00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.769\nI just didn't call it that, right?\n\n417\n00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:21.804\n>> Exactly.\n>> Cuz it's pretty diverse.\n\n418\n00:23:21.804 --> 00:23:23.311\n>> Exactly.\n\n419\n00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:28.781\nAnd one of the things about Lean Six Sigma\nthat is really great is that they're\n\n420\n00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:34.688\nworking on simplifying that terminology\nand making things easier to understand.\n\n421\n00:23:34.688 --> 00:23:39.079\nSo, a lot of you are familiar with ITIL,\nand\n\n422\n00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:44.562\nas Don was mentioning earlier,\nthat's a UK product.\n\n423\n00:23:44.562 --> 00:23:52.061\nThey have recently partnered\nwith a Dutch entity.\n\n424\n00:23:52.061 --> 00:23:54.730\nActually, that's examine institute.\n\n425\n00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.022\nI don't know the rest of if.\n\n426\n00:23:57.022 --> 00:24:01.220\nIt's kind of similar to ISO\nin the way that it's booked.\n\n427\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.126\nOf best practices and the idea,\nthe way to make things better, faster and\n\n428\n00:24:06.126 --> 00:24:10.969\nmore cost effective is that you would\ntry to map to those best practices.\n\n429\n00:24:10.969 --> 00:24:16.395\nIt is an independent theme, however, where\nas ISO usually, the company, or always.\n\n430\n00:24:16.395 --> 00:24:19.585\nthe company is going to be ISO certified.\n\n431\n00:24:19.585 --> 00:24:23.755\nWhere ITIL you can get\nan individual certification so.\n\n432\n00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:27.115\nAnd of course ITIL focuses\njust on the IT portion.\n\n433\n00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:32.081\nBut one of the volumes is completely\ndedicated to continuous improvement, and\n\n434\n00:24:32.081 --> 00:24:37.430\ncontinuous improvement is just another one\nof those words for process improvement.\n\n435\n00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:45.281\n>> I know I've seen ISO 20,000\nthrown about, and it's very similar\n\n436\n00:24:45.281 --> 00:24:50.205\nto what ITIL does in some respects,\nand different in other respects.\n\n437\n00:24:50.205 --> 00:24:52.985\nThere is a lot of blend and\noverlap on that.\n\n438\n00:24:52.985 --> 00:24:55.118\nWe've certainly got our options out there,\nbut\n\n439\n00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:57.675\nthe thing to remember is that\nwe can blend these together.\n\n440\n00:24:57.675 --> 00:25:02.515\nYou don't have to stop being\nITIL to do LSS, do we?\n\n441\n00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:03.383\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n442\n00:25:03.383 --> 00:25:06.272\nThey work in partnership,\nand again, what is so\n\n443\n00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:09.097\ncool about that is it's\njust a way of thinking.\n\n444\n00:25:09.097 --> 00:25:11.190\nSo, you don't have to\nchange your methodology.\n\n445\n00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.765\nYou don't have to change\nthe way you're doing things.\n\n446\n00:25:13.765 --> 00:25:19.638\nIt's just a way to enhance what\nyou're doing now and make it better.\n\n447\n00:25:19.638 --> 00:25:24.061\nThe synergy is that you'll see a lot\nof what are called the quality tools.\n\n448\n00:25:24.061 --> 00:25:29.939\nThey pop up in all of these\nprocess improvement methodologies.\n\n449\n00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:34.392\nSo I wanna recap on the different\nprocess improvement programs and\n\n450\n00:25:34.392 --> 00:25:36.945\njust kind of quickly talk about this.\n\n451\n00:25:39.285 --> 00:25:43.101\nLean Six Sigma is about making things\nbetter, faster, and more cost effective.\n\n452\n00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:47.978\nThe ISO spin on this is basically,\nwe're gonna give you the best practices or\n\n453\n00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:53.018\nstandards, and what we're gonna try to\ndo is get you to map to those standards.\n\n454\n00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:57.834\nThe AGILE approach, especially when it\nkind of morphed into project management,\n\n455\n00:25:57.834 --> 00:26:00.603\nis that we're gonna\ncreate more flexibility.\n\n456\n00:26:00.603 --> 00:26:04.887\nThe way we're gonna make things better,\nfaster, more cost effective,\n\n457\n00:26:04.887 --> 00:26:08.147\nis give the company and\nindividuals more flexibility.\n\n458\n00:26:08.147 --> 00:26:12.482\nThe CMMI routine is kind of like, okay,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\n\n459\n00:26:12.482 --> 00:26:16.973\nestablish five levels to make things\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n460\n00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:20.896\nIn level one, we're gonna just make sure,\nbasically, everyone's on the same page.\n\n461\n00:26:20.896 --> 00:26:26.058\nAnd in level two, we're going to make\nsure that those processes are repeatable.\n\n462\n00:26:26.058 --> 00:26:31.209\nNow, I mentioned earlier, where Lean Six\nSigma comes in is between Level Two and\n\n463\n00:26:31.209 --> 00:26:35.151\nLevel Three, I'm gonna take\nthese repeatable processes and\n\n464\n00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:37.305\nkind of roll it out to the masses.\n\n465\n00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:38.756\nSo if I'm a large corporation,\n\n466\n00:26:38.756 --> 00:26:41.785\nI'm gonna make sure all of my\nsatellite offices are using that.\n\n467\n00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:44.805\nWell that's quite a jump between two and\nthree.\n\n468\n00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:49.753\nAnd Lean Six Sigma professionals have\nthe expertise to make that a little bit\n\n469\n00:26:49.753 --> 00:26:51.772\neasier to achieve that level.\n\n470\n00:26:51.772 --> 00:26:55.597\nSo again,\nCMM's approach to making things better,\n\n471\n00:26:55.597 --> 00:26:59.592\nfaster, more cost effective is,\nlet's create a map.\n\n472\n00:26:59.592 --> 00:27:03.427\nLet's create a waterfall map, and these\nare the things we're gonna do in step one,\n\n473\n00:27:03.427 --> 00:27:05.815\nand these are the things\nwe're gonna do in step two.\n\n474\n00:27:05.815 --> 00:27:09.670\nITIL works similar.\n\n475\n00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.010\nIt's geared more towards IT, but it's a\nlot like ISO, so there idea to make things\n\n476\n00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.350\nbetter, faster, more cost effective is,\nhere's best practices related to IT.\n\n477\n00:27:37.056 --> 00:27:39.893\nSigma says we're going to reduce mistakes.\n\n478\n00:27:39.893 --> 00:27:40.967\nThat's our plan.\n\n479\n00:27:40.967 --> 00:27:42.640\nWe're going to look at\nhow to reduce mistakes.\n\n480\n00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.769\nAnd on the manufacturing floor, and\n\n481\n00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:48.143\nwe're going to be talking about\nthat in our next segment.\n\n482\n00:27:48.143 --> 00:27:50.644\nOn the manufacturing floor,\nmistakes are called defects.\n\n483\n00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:54.766\nIn the service industry they're typically\ncalled just like I said, mistakes.\n\n484\n00:27:54.766 --> 00:27:58.973\nNow, Lean Six Sigma says,\nwhy not do all of the above?\n\n485\n00:27:58.973 --> 00:28:03.053\nSo, absolutely,\nLean Six Sigma blends Lean and Six Sigma.\n\n486\n00:28:03.053 --> 00:28:07.502\nIt's still mostly Six Sigma, and that's\nbecause most Fortune 100 companies, and\n\n487\n00:28:07.502 --> 00:28:10.805\nremember, those companies fall on and\noff the list all the time,\n\n488\n00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:12.305\nuse some form of Six Sigma.\n\n489\n00:28:12.305 --> 00:28:17.728\nSo, we already know it works, so,\nwhen you hear the term Lean Six Sigma,\n\n490\n00:28:17.728 --> 00:28:22.728\nit's still rooted in Six Sigma,\nbut it has a heavy lean influence.\n\n491\n00:28:22.728 --> 00:28:27.373\nBut what's happened over the last 12\nyears that it's been in existence,\n\n492\n00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.925\nis that it says why not\ndo all of the above?\n\n493\n00:28:29.925 --> 00:28:34.556\nWhy not take the best of the best and\njust kind of roll it into one big ball and\n\n494\n00:28:34.556 --> 00:28:36.517\nlet's call it Lean Six Sigma.\n\n495\n00:28:36.517 --> 00:28:39.220\n>> And at the end of the day we're left\nwith a framework that is great for\n\n496\n00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.226\na lot of organizations.\n\n497\n00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.728\n>> Absolutely.\n\n498\n00:28:41.728 --> 00:28:44.943\n>> All right, well Dr. Sue I think\nthat's a pretty good run down on what\n\n499\n00:28:44.943 --> 00:28:48.548\nLean Six Sigma is and some of the things\nthat we'll be covering in this show but\n\n500\n00:28:48.548 --> 00:28:50.719\nwe're a little short on\ntime in this segment.\n\n501\n00:28:50.719 --> 00:28:54.271\nSo, do you have any parting\nthoughts before we wrap up?\n\n502\n00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:58.969\n>> Well I would definitely like to say\nthat what you want to start doing is\n\n503\n00:28:58.969 --> 00:29:03.991\nlooking at activities in your everyday\nlife and start thinking about what\n\n504\n00:29:03.991 --> 00:29:09.435\nare those activities that I could make\nbetter, faster or more cost effective.\n\n505\n00:29:09.435 --> 00:29:13.728\nIdentifying the activity that you want\nto do is probably key to everything.\n\n506\n00:29:13.728 --> 00:29:15.336\nIt's downhill after that,\n\n507\n00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:18.690\nbecause I'm gonna show you how\nto accomplish those goals.\n\n508\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.851\n>> Awesome.\nWell, I know I'm looking forward to it.\n\n509\n00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:24.083\nI'm sure the viewers out there are looking\nforward to it, too, but for now,\n\n510\n00:29:24.083 --> 00:29:26.143\nthis is a good spot for\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n511\n00:29:26.143 --> 00:29:26.767\nStay tuned.\n\n512\n00:29:26.767 --> 00:29:32.180\nWe've got more Lean Six Six Sigma coming\nup down the line, but signing off for\n\n513\n00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.017\nIT Pro I'm Don Prezel, with Dr.\nStern and we'll see you next time.\n\n514\n00:29:37.017 --> 00:29:44.010\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.067\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:21.706\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwtih another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:25.036\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at a bit of the history,\n\n6\n00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:28.315\na bit of the background that goes along\nwith Lean and Six Sigma combined,\n\n7\n00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:31.037\nlike peanut butter and\nchocolate into some amazing thing.\n\n8\n00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.187\nAnd to help me, as always, I've got Dr.\n\n9\n00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:36.075\nStern who's gonna help walk\nus through this process and\n\n10\n00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:40.192\nget a chance to see what all is involved\nin the background of Lean Six Sigma before\n\n11\n00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:43.525\nwe go jumping head first into\ndeploying it in our organization.\n\n12\n00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:45.371\nSo, Dr. Stern, where do we start?\n\n13\n00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.880\n>> Well, in the 1800s, I'm just kidding.\n\n14\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.730\nI actually have a slide presentation\nthat should painlessly take you through\n\n15\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.869\nthe basics of the history.\n\n16\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.240\nAnd so we're gonna start with the first\nslide, which is just about the roles and\n\n17\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.290\nresponsibilities and\nthe different belt levels.\n\n18\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.520\nI've been in this industry for\na long time and\n\n19\n00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.830\nstill I will go to a conference, and when\nthey see that I'm a master black belt,\n\n20\n00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.300\nthey'll say you must be\nin really great shape.\n\n21\n00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.030\nSo even in the industry sometimes\nthese terms are a little confusing.\n\n22\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.210\nOne of the things that I wanna\npoint out before we we move too far\n\n23\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.990\nin to the history is that these different\nbelt structures are really used for\n\n24\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.098\nrecruiting purposes.\n\n25\n00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:33.520\nThere are companies that just recruit for\nLean Six Sigma personnel and\n\n26\n00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.790\ntheir agency, or\nthere's entities such as Deloit,\n\n27\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.340\nPrice Waterhouse Coopers, etc that\nhave whole Lean Sic Sigma departments.\n\n28\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.080\nSo more than anything else,\nthese belts, designations,\n\n29\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.300\nare so that the recruiter knows what level\nof Lean Six Sigma experience you have.\n\n30\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.460\nAnd if you use them or not,\nthat's kind of all over the board.\n\n31\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.660\nFor example, I do some work\nwith DuPont in Puerto Rico and\n\n32\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.510\nthey actually put the belts on the door.\n\n33\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.810\nEvery time they achieve the belt,\na lot of the people at that plant do that.\n\n34\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.120\nAnd yet here,\n\n35\n00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.340\nDuPont here in the States, sometimes\nit not even on their business card.\n\n36\n00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.500\nWalmart Hires a number of Black Belts and\nMaster Black Belts.\n\n37\n00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.290\nBut when they go to work for Walmart\nCorporate in Bentonville, Arkansas,\n\n38\n00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.700\nthey might have titles like\nProcess Improvement Engineer.\n\n39\n00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.560\nSo the titles are kind of more just so\n\n40\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.560\nthat you know where that person is at,\nin the whole scheme of things.\n\n41\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.126\nAnother thing is that these structures\nare sort of in a perfect world.\n\n42\n00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:38.320\nBecause if you're the the only\nperson there at the company,\n\n43\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.900\nyou're the Yellow Belt,\nGreen Belt, and Black Belt.\n\n44\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.970\nYou're doing everything.\n\n45\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680\nBut in a perfect world, this is the way\nthat they would kind of flesh out.\n\n46\n00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.850\nIt uses a martial arts nomenclature.\n\n47\n00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.060\nAnd the first one,\n\n48\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.630\nWhite Belt, doesn't really have\na lot of industry standards around.\n\n49\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.720\nIt was created kind of late in the game.\n\n50\n00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.522\nIt's generally used as market leader or\n\n51\n00:03:00.522 --> 00:03:03.960\nif a company's not really sure if they\nwanna make the Lean Six Sigma decision, so\n\n52\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.850\nsometimes it's in a lunch and\nlearn format.\n\n53\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.152\nA lot of hospitals have\nstarted calling white\n\n54\n00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:16.739\nbelt training part of\ntheir hospital program.\n\n55\n00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.872\nBecause if you are working in\na hospital and you touch a patient,\n\n56\n00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:22.019\nthere's certain rules that you have to be,\n\n57\n00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.497\nthere's certain orientation practices\nthat you have to go through.\n\n58\n00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:28.200\nAnd so they blended white belt in there.\n\n59\n00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.160\nAnd so sometimes you might see\na hospital orientation for two or\n\n60\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.870\nthree days saying that it's a white belt,\nbut it's mostly about the hospital.\n\n61\n00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.220\nAnd the white belt piece\nis just a couple of hours.\n\n62\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.357\nNow, yellow, green and black have\n\n63\n00:03:41.357 --> 00:03:45.500\nthe most industry standards and\nwhat I mean by that is that\n\n64\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.130\neveryone that's in the business sort\nof agrees on the competency model.\n\n65\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.240\nSo if you say you're a yellow belt or\na green Belt or a black belt,\n\n66\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.590\nthere's certain expectations\nthat they have of you.\n\n67\n00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.650\nAnd I'm gonna go over\nthose in just a moment.\n\n68\n00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.210\nMaster Black Belt is another one that,\nit has a lot of industry standards.\n\n69\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.540\nBut not as much as the Yellow,\nGreen, and Black Belt.\n\n70\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.290\nIn the Master Black Belt category,\n\n71\n00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.360\na lot of times those\nare university-type programs.\n\n72\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.970\nSo I already mentioned that\nWhite Belt is an orientation.\n\n73\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.420\nAnd not a lot of standards around it.\n\n74\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.050\nYellow belt, however,\nhas distinct standards and\n\n75\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.450\nin a yellow belt program, what you're\nlearning is just what you're learning\n\n76\n00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.060\nin the courses in the series of\ncourses that we're doing right now.\n\n77\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.600\nYou're learning the basic terminology,\n\n78\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.440\nyou're learning how to identify a Lean Six\nSigma project and those types of things.\n\n79\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.590\nNow the best way to explain the difference\nbetween a green and a A Black Belt.\n\n80\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.300\nAnd it's a simplistic explanation.\n\n81\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.590\nBut it's the best way\nthat I can explain it.\n\n82\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.490\nIt's that if you take\nthe Green Belt program,\n\n83\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.630\nyou are directly marrying that\nto whatever it is you do.\n\n84\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.490\nSo you're a Green Belt.\n\n85\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.700\nBut you're an HR professional.\n\n86\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.460\nYou're a Green Belt.\n\n87\n00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.590\nBut you're an IT professional.\n\n88\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.740\nYou're a Green Belt.\n\n89\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.480\nBut you work in ops.\n\n90\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.870\nSo you take the things that you\nlearn in the Lean Six Sigma program,\n\n91\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.230\nto make your specific job Job better,\nfaster or more cost effective.\n\n92\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.030\nSo you're working with\nan existing process.\n\n93\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.340\nYou need something that\nyou're doing right now,\n\n94\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.310\nan activity you're doing right now,\nin your job right now.\n\n95\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.680\nAnd as a green belt,\nyou're pretty much saying,\n\n96\n00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.820\nin my areas of subject matter expertise,\nI am able to make those processes better,\n\n97\n00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.130\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n98\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.900\nA black belt is essentially saying,\nI can do that in any.\n\n99\n00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.310\nDepartment in the company.\n\n100\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.340\nSo I can identify process and\nimprovement opportunities.\n\n101\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.520\nDoesn't matter if it's finance,\nmarketing, HR, the manufacturing floor.\n\n102\n00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.990\nNow, in order to be a good successful\nblack belt, this requires that you have\n\n103\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.980\na little bit of understanding about\nhow all of those departments work.\n\n104\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.410\nSo typically, good candidates for\n\n105\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.930\nthe Lean Six Sigma black belt program\nare Are people who have an MBA because,\n\n106\n00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.700\nas you know,\nin a Masters of Business Administration,\n\n107\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.790\nyou learn a little bit about\nall those different areas.\n\n108\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.320\nPeople who are IT professionals,\nbecause these days\n\n109\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.940\nyou can't do an enterprise-wide process\nimprovement without involving IT.\n\n110\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.660\nSo by default, what's happened with IT is\nthey've had to learn a little bit about\n\n111\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.000\nmarketing, a little bit about human\nresources, a little bit about finance.\n\n112\n00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.580\nSo those are good candidates.\n\n113\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.630\nAnd finally the third good candidate is\nif you've ever owned your own business.\n\n114\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.340\nI know there's probably a lot of you out\nthere that have owned your own business.\n\n115\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.020\nAnd when you do that, you're marketing.\n\n116\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.570\nAnd you're customer service.\n\n117\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.260\nAnd you're payroll.\n\n118\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.360\nAnd so people that have kind\nof a well-rounded idea,\n\n119\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.350\ntypically do well in\nthe Black Belt program.\n\n120\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.220\nSo again,\nGreen Belts pretty much apply their\n\n121\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.880\nGreen Belt expertise to the job\nthat they're already doing.\n\n122\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.800\nWhere as a Black Belt, that could\nactually be their job at a company.\n\n123\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.710\nIs just to go around the company and\ndo process improvement.\n\n124\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.920\n>> So when we're talking about white belt\nand yellow belt, just really general.\n\n125\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.310\n>> Right.\n>> And then when we get into green belt,\n\n126\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.340\nwe start getting into specializations.\n\n127\n00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.990\nBut once we get past that into black belt,\nit starts becoming general again, right?\n\n128\n00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.220\nKind of covering all the different areas.\n\n129\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.900\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n130\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.130\nGood observation.\n\n131\n00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.720\nI think another thing that's very\ninteresting about the Yellow belt program\n\n132\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.030\nthat we're participating in as I speak,\nis that a lot of times this program is\n\n133\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:23.250\nlabeled Lean Six Sigma leadership,\nChampion Training.\n\n134\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.720\nIt has a lot of different names.\n\n135\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.050\nThe course is the same, but\n\n136\n00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.190\nsometimes what happens is a CEO who\ninherits a Lean Six Sigma company, or\n\n137\n00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.370\ndepartment manager that inherits\na Lean Six Sigma department,\n\n138\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.410\nhas to quickly understand what the heck\nis going on in their department.\n\n139\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.520\nAnd so they'll take this course just\nto get kind of the basic overview.\n\n140\n00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.417\nThey're not planning to really\ndo the work that green belts and\n\n141\n00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:49.401\nblack belts are doing, but\nthey need to certainly understand.\n\n142\n00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:53.047\n>> Yeah, and skipping over white belt,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n143\n00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:54.875\n>> Right, it's great.\n\n144\n00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.720\n>> Not to take away from\nthe importance of it, right?\n\n145\n00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.580\nBut it is just kinda the introduction.\n\n146\n00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.550\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so if you go\n\n147\n00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.670\nstraight into yellow like we're doing,\nthat's fine.\n\n148\n00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.850\nBut then If you wanted to go into green or\nblack,\n\n149\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.810\nyou really don't wanna be skipping\nbelts at that point right?\n\n150\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.940\n>> Most of the time I\nwould say that's true.\n\n151\n00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.040\nNow people who have a PMP\nsometimes will go straight\n\n152\n00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.280\nthe the black belt that and\nthat's, project.\n\n153\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.150\nWhat does that acronym stand for?\n\n154\n00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.680\n>> Project management professional.\n\n155\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.393\n>> Right.\nBecause so\n\n156\n00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:24.228\nmuch of Lean Six Sigma is rooted in basic\nproject management depending on what types\n\n157\n00:08:24.228 --> 00:08:25.705\nof projects a PMP has worked on,\n\n158\n00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:29.240\na lot of times they'll make a good\ncandidate to go straight to black belt.\n\n159\n00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.890\n>> And then master black belt, right now,\n\n160\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.940\nis that really just trainers or is there\nan actual business case for that one?\n\n161\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.445\n>> Well, there's a lot of confusion\nabout a master black belt and\n\n162\n00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:43.820\nat my company, at SSD Global,\n\n163\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.730\nI often get requests for master black\nbelts that actually a green belt could do.\n\n164\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.755\nSo there's a lot of\nconfusion in the market.\n\n165\n00:08:49.755 --> 00:08:55.640\nBut Technically, the core program,\nthe most you're gonna\n\n166\n00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.760\nlearn about Lean Six Sigma is\ncontained in the black belt course.\n\n167\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.190\nAnd the master black belt course,\nto your point, is more for\n\n168\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.280\npeople that want to train or, in many\ncases, large companies believe that\n\n169\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.570\nit's advantageous to build\nan internal Lean Six Sigma program.\n\n170\n00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.640\nSo a lot of the people that are in my\n\n171\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:19.680\nmaster black belt program the company has\nrequested to build an internal program.\n\n172\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.120\nAnd so they do that as well.\n\n173\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.090\nAnd the other thing is that a Master\nBlack Belt, a lot of times you don't\n\n174\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.790\nsee those unless you're in a company\nthat's making a billion in revenue.\n\n175\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.600\nA billion and under revenue, typically\na Black Belt can probably facilitate.\n\n176\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.086\n>> That's a lot of money.\n\n177\n00:09:38.086 --> 00:09:40.780\n>> [LAUGH] A lot of room for\nerror there, so.\n\n178\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.100\n>> Yeah.\nDefinitely important.\n\n179\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.210\nAll right.\nSo we've got the belt structures and\n\n180\n00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.540\nthose have been around awhile.\n\n181\n00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.840\n>> Right.\n>> You said white belt was newer,\n\n182\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.720\nboth the other belts all kinda\ncame around about the same time.\n\n183\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.370\nWhat else do we need to understand\nabout the history of Lean Six Sigma?\n\n184\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.650\n>> Well, there's some additional\nroles that are very, very important.\n\n185\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.390\nAnd in these additional roles,\n\n186\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.960\nit doesn't really matter what\nbelt structure that you're using.\n\n187\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.310\nSo the additional roles\nwould be process owner.\n\n188\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.930\nAnd I think one of the challenging things.\n\n189\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:11.000\nThings when you're starting in Lean Six\nSigma, is those hidden process owners.\n\n190\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.560\nAnd what I mean by that is that\nsomeone may have developed\n\n191\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.600\nthe activities in that department.\n\n192\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.050\nAnd been promoted to another department.\n\n193\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.780\nBut they still kinda feel\nownership of that process.\n\n194\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.180\nSo it's not just the process owners.\n\n195\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.750\nIt's the hidden process owners.\n\n196\n00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.313\nAnd that's the person\nwho's really responsible.\n\n197\n00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:32.793\nAnd as long as I've been in In this\nindustry, when I wear my consultant hat,\n\n198\n00:10:32.793 --> 00:10:34.124\nI mostly do training.\n\n199\n00:10:34.124 --> 00:10:38.057\nBut when I wear my consultant hat, very\nrarely do I go into a department where\n\n200\n00:10:38.057 --> 00:10:42.418\nthere's someone who owns the process and\nthey're jumping out of the box going yay,\n\n201\n00:10:42.418 --> 00:10:45.575\nyay, she's here to improve me,\nbecause it's difficult.\n\n202\n00:10:45.575 --> 00:10:48.814\nAnd sometimes that's one of the most\ndifficult relationships that you have\n\n203\n00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:49.325\nto manage.\n\n204\n00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:53.306\nThe person who is actually responsible\nwe call the process owner.\n\n205\n00:10:53.306 --> 00:10:56.810\nNow the champion role is Is kind of fun.\n\n206\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.810\nOne of the defense firms that I work for\n\n207\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.250\nmade a decision that they were going\nto assign champions to projects.\n\n208\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.280\nTypically, a champion is kind of your rah,\nrah, sis boom bah person\n\n209\n00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.630\nwho's going to go out there and\nspread the word about how great you are.\n\n210\n00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.820\nSometimes your champion might\njust be like a well-loved person\n\n211\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.440\nat the company that people trust.\n\n212\n00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.030\nBut they're really\nsupposed to help you and\n\n213\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.980\nbe there to assist you and\nkind of move your project forward.\n\n214\n00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.300\nSo sometimes when people, such as\nthe defense firm that I mentioned, make\n\n215\n00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.510\nthe decision to assign champions, they may\nnot be totally bought into the project.\n\n216\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:38.650\nRight, so can you do a Lean Six Sigma\nproject without a champion?\n\n217\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.620\nAbsolutely.\n\n218\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.555\nIt's just.\n\n219\n00:11:40.555 --> 00:11:42.955\nJust, it's one of those preferred roles.\n\n220\n00:11:42.955 --> 00:11:47.615\nNow, on the other hand, you cannot do a\nLean Six Sigma project without a sponsor.\n\n221\n00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:51.619\nA sponsor, a lot of times that's\nanother confused role, but\n\n222\n00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:56.323\nif you just keep in mind, the sponsor's\nthe person who signs the check.\n\n223\n00:11:56.323 --> 00:11:58.212\nSo your sponsor might be your boss.\n\n224\n00:11:58.212 --> 00:12:00.333\nBut your sponsor could be your bosses.\n\n225\n00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.275\nBosses, boss.\n\n226\n00:12:01.275 --> 00:12:05.271\nAnd it's important to keep in mind\nwho your sponsor is because in\n\n227\n00:12:05.271 --> 00:12:09.120\nthe big picture,\nthat's who you're gonna be answering to.\n\n228\n00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.660\n>> Now, I come from a project\nmanagement background.\n\n229\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.690\nAnd in the PM world, just being a project\nmanager doesn't actually mean you have\n\n230\n00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.520\nany authority whatsoever, right?\n\n231\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.409\nAnd so, you are completely beholded to\ngetting a sponsor with authority to\n\n232\n00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:24.253\nsign off on your chart, or so\nthat you basically borrow their authority.\n\n233\n00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:27.516\nIs it the same way in [CROSSTALK]\n>> Absolutely, and\n\n234\n00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:33.460\nin today's society that I think\nthe hardest thing about this sponsors.\n\n235\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.050\nHe might not even or\nshe might not even live in the same city,\n\n236\n00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:41.005\nmight be at corporate office in\na whole different state, so.\n\n237\n00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:44.949\n>> But in a way you're acting under their\nauthority, so whatever power they have,\n\n238\n00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:46.516\nthey're basically-\n>> Exactly.\n\n239\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.971\n>> Investing in you, so that you can\ngo off and do these great things.\n\n240\n00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:53.726\n>> Sure and when you're working\nwith Lean Six Sigma Projects and\n\n241\n00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:58.305\nwe'll be talking about this\nin another episode, I think.\n\n242\n00:12:58.305 --> 00:13:01.748\nYou're still doing a project charter and\nyou're still asking for\n\n243\n00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:04.280\npermission to move forward and\ndo your project.\n\n244\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.970\nSo having a sponsor is key to that,\n\n245\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.506\nbecause they're the ones that\nmake the go-no-go decision.\n\n246\n00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:14.821\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right so,\n\n247\n00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:16.545\ncouple of different roles\nkinda thrown in there.\n\n248\n00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.840\nYou've got your belt holders,\nwho are your actual practitioners.\n\n249\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.055\nYou've got your other people\nyour sponsors, your champions,\n\n250\n00:13:22.055 --> 00:13:24.685\nthose people who are obviously\nimportant factors.\n\n251\n00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:26.885\nWhat else do we need to\nbe aware of in there?\n\n252\n00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:31.690\n>> Well, I think in a perfect world,\n\n253\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.730\nyou'd have a team.\n\n254\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.490\nAnd we have those, they're about,\nI don't know, I wanna say 10 or\n\n255\n00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.830\n20 years ago was the first time I\nheard the term cross-functional team.\n\n256\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.659\nLean Six Sigma has a tiny bit of a\ndifferent spin on cross-functional teams.\n\n257\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.090\nLet's talk about\ncross-functional teams first.\n\n258\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:56.780\nSo, a cross-functional team is where\nyou have someone from every department.\n\n259\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.095\nAnd the idea is so that you can\nget kind of a 360 view on them.\n\n260\n00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:01.555\nWould that be fair to say, Don?\n\n261\n00:14:01.555 --> 00:14:02.890\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n262\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.350\nno one person generally has that great big\nvision of every detail that's going on.\n\n263\n00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.580\nSo you gotta get people together\nfrom different areas, so\n\n264\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.660\nyou understand the impacts across them.\n\n265\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.990\nAnd it's a great way to do that.\n\n266\n00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.280\n>> It is, and what happened\nwhere it ran into some snags,\n\n267\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.890\nis that a lot of people started\nthinking that is the deliverable.\n\n268\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:26.250\nAnd keep in mind the deliverable\nis anything you promise to\n\n269\n00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.980\ngive the person you're reporting to.\n\n270\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.550\nSo it became the deliverable to\nget someone from finance, and\n\n271\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.530\nsomeone from ops, and\nsomeone from marketing.\n\n272\n00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.370\nAnd sometimes these groups\nwould just be paralyzed.\n\n273\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:37.775\nAnd so Lean Six Sigma says,\n\n274\n00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:40.190\ncross-functional teams\nare really important.\n\n275\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.240\nBut what it wants you to do,\nwhat the science wants you to do is\n\n276\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.240\ntake a step back and say, this\nparticular project has a certain degree.\n\n277\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.810\nA certain financial aspect.\n\n278\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.060\nI do not have expertise in that.\n\n279\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.090\nThat's the person that I wanna get.\n\n280\n00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:58.710\nAnd maybe I'm not gonna get them to show\nup on a meeting every Monday at 9:00.\n\n281\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.000\nI might have to actually go to them.\n\n282\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.130\nI might have to handle that relationship.\n\n283\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.370\nEven though it's still\na cross-functional team,\n\n284\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.740\nI might have to handle that\nas they're my advisor.\n\n285\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.820\nI'll do as much work as I can, but\nI need you to look over my work and\n\n286\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.890\njust let me know if it's working or not.\n\n287\n00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.910\nSo the whole, there's a couple of\nthings with cross-functional teams that\n\n288\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.530\nLean takes a whole different view about.\n\n289\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.265\nAnd one of them is that you don't\nreally need someone from ops,\n\n290\n00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:28.600\nif you don't have an operation\npiece in your project.\n\n291\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.820\nAnd the other one is that, in a perfect\nworld everyone would be coming in and\n\n292\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.250\nsitting in your meeting.\n\n293\n00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.120\nBut in the real world, you're gonna\nhave to go out and it might be e-mail.\n\n294\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.630\nAnd you might have to set up those\nrelationships in a way that it's\n\n295\n00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.210\nminimal work on their part.\n\n296\n00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.190\nAnd sometimes they even on some\nof my cross-functional teams.\n\n297\n00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.250\nI've even gone out and said,\nif the project's successful,\n\n298\n00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.700\nI'm gonna give you total credit.\n\n299\n00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.070\nAnd if it's a failure,\nI'm not even gonna mention your name, so.\n\n300\n00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.130\n>> So they get all the benefits\nwith none of the risk?\n\n301\n00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.862\n>> Exactly.\n>> That's not fair.\n\n302\n00:15:58.862 --> 00:15:59.599\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's not fair,\n\n303\n00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:01.180\nbut it's the way it is sometimes.\n\n304\n00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.670\n>> Absolutely.\n\n305\n00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.020\n>> So I'd like to talk a little bit\nabout what process improvement is.\n\n306\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:13.200\nFirst thing, I wanna say is that it\nstarted with Total Quality Management.\n\n307\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.400\nWhen you look at the history of TQM,\n\n308\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.790\nthere's a lot of different opinions\nabout when it actually started.\n\n309\n00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:26.420\nBut you've probably heard some\nnames such as Edwards Deming.\n\n310\n00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.170\nAnd it really is Edwards with an S,\nEdwards Deming, and Joseph Juran.\n\n311\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.310\nThey both had a different\nspin on quality management,\n\n312\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.720\nbut they had a lot of synergies.\n\n313\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.460\nAnd Edwards Deming kind of\ntook the lecture circuit.\n\n314\n00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.770\nWhereas Joseph Juran, another\npioneer in total quality management,\n\n315\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.940\ntook more of the book route.\n\n316\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:52.510\nAnd even today, if you're taking a quality\nengineering class, he's footnoted.\n\n317\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.680\nDeming died in the 1990's at 90 and\n\n318\n00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.950\nJoseph Juran only died a few\nyears back at the age of 102.\n\n319\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:59.620\nSo we have a lot of information\nabout those two people.\n\n320\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.800\n>> You remember,\na lot of the concepts we talked about here\n\n321\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.270\ncame out of the Industrial Revolution-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n322\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.712\n>> And so, it's interesting\ncuz it's kindalike new and yet\n\n323\n00:17:10.712 --> 00:17:12.350\nold at the same time.\n\n324\n00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.070\nSo it's all under 100 years old,\nbut that's when it started and\n\n325\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.062\nthings haven't changed all\nthat much in that time.\n\n326\n00:17:19.062 --> 00:17:24.350\n>> Yeah, and in the industrial revolution,\ndecisions were made in an autocratic way.\n\n327\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.230\nAnd so the person who was running the\nplant, sometimes even ran the whole town.\n\n328\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.390\nAnd everyone just did what\nthat person said, right?\n\n329\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.275\nSo when TQM, and then there was the short\nperiod of time that a lot of you might\n\n330\n00:17:34.275 --> 00:17:38.600\nremember from your university days,\nwhere they kind of experimented on people.\n\n331\n00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:46.060\nSo they played with the whites, and\nthey have people walking around,\n\n332\n00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.090\nand very famous sewing machine\nfactory kinds of experiments.\n\n333\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.160\nAnd what they were trying to do is to see,\nhow will people be more productive?\n\n334\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.140\nHow will people be better,\nfaster and more cost effective?\n\n335\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.580\nAnd then we moved into this\nwhole tiki lin era, and\n\n336\n00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.090\nit's kind of funny because at\nfirst it wasn't really embraced.\n\n337\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.940\nThat first people were like,\n\n338\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.610\nthey don't pay me the big bucks to come\ninto these meetings and give my opinion.\n\n339\n00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.690\nSo it's kinda funny,\nwhen we talk about change management.\n\n340\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:15.255\nBecause when this concept first came out,\nsome people felt a little put-on.\n\n341\n00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:19.597\nOr they felt like,\nthis is too much of a burden for me.\n\n342\n00:18:19.597 --> 00:18:21.962\nJust tell me what to do and I'll do it.\n\n343\n00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:22.508\n>> Yeah, and\n\n344\n00:18:22.508 --> 00:18:26.587\nreally it's about having people take\nownership of the processes they work on.\n\n345\n00:18:26.587 --> 00:18:29.046\nAnd it goes back to what you said\nin some of our earlier episodes.\n\n346\n00:18:29.046 --> 00:18:32.539\nWe're trying to make these things better,\nfaster, more cost efficient, right.\n\n347\n00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:37.330\nSo you gotta have people who\nare willing to participate in that.\n\n348\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.163\nThat's part of what\na champion helps to do,\n\n349\n00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:39.865\nright-\n>> Exactly.\n\n350\n00:18:39.865 --> 00:18:42.530\n>> Is to rally people to that cause and\nget them moving forward.\n\n351\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.560\n>> Right, and it's so valuable.\n\n352\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.820\nLike I said, you can do a Lean Six Sigma\nproject without a champion.\n\n353\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.390\nIt's so much easier.\n\n354\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.470\nI mean, just even for\nyour own mental health.\n\n355\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.780\nIf you have someone that you can go to.\n\n356\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.060\nAnd if you're still trying to put\na positive spin on things than\n\n357\n00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.650\nhaving that sounding board, it's huge.\n\n358\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.040\n>> I look at it as,\nit's not essential to have.\n\n359\n00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.070\nBut it improves your odds of success,\nright?\n\n360\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.270\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n361\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.800\n>> It's a boon.\n\n362\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.660\n>> Yeah, absolutely, so\nwhen we talk about process improvement.\n\n363\n00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.860\nWhat we're trying to do is,\nwe're trying to make something better.\n\n364\n00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.930\nAnd that's just an easy word for quality.\n\n365\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.440\nSo instead of using quality,\nwe use the word better.\n\n366\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:20.160\nAnd we're trying to make things more\nefficient but we use the word faster.\n\n367\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.900\nBecause I'm sure a lot of you would agree,\n\n368\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.990\nthat I could make\nan existing process faster.\n\n369\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.180\nAnd it would just be a disaster, right?\n\n370\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.990\nSo, we say faster because it's faster.\n\n371\n00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.550\nBut we're really talking about\nmaking a process more efficient.\n\n372\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.640\nAnd then the third one,\nmore cost-effective.\n\n373\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.940\nI wanna spend a little bit of\ntime explaining those terms, so\n\n374\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.500\nthat we're all on the same page.\n\n375\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.600\nWhen we say better, we're gonna increase\nthe quality that always costs something.\n\n376\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.660\nAnd that was the famous\nsaying of Joseph Juran.\n\n377\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.130\nQuality always costs something, right.\n\n378\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.400\nSo when I go in to my boss to present\na process improvement argument,\n\n379\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.280\nwhere I'm gonna make things better.\n\n380\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.940\nI'm gonna have to have a little\nbit more material with me\n\n381\n00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.845\nbecause the other two options,\nI'm probably gonna save or make money.\n\n382\n00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:13.565\nBut on this option,\nI'm asking you to spend money.\n\n383\n00:20:13.565 --> 00:20:17.215\nSo, it's always a little trickier.\n\n384\n00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:20.065\nFaster, which we're gonna say\nis really more efficient, but\n\n385\n00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:23.251\nthe thing about faster is there's\nonly one way to make things faster.\n\n386\n00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:25.392\nAnd that's to map the existing process.\n\n387\n00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:28.651\nAnd that just means write down all\nthe steps in the existing process.\n\n388\n00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:31.475\nAnd figure out which steps\nyou can eliminate or combine.\n\n389\n00:20:31.475 --> 00:20:35.968\nNow, the theory is simple and what's\nfun about that is that you can leave\n\n390\n00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:40.031\nthe office right away saying, oh,\nI know what I need to be doing.\n\n391\n00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.945\nI need to be looking at these\ndifferent activity steps and\n\n392\n00:20:42.945 --> 00:20:45.321\ntrying to figure out\nwhich ones to eliminate.\n\n393\n00:20:45.321 --> 00:20:49.394\nIn reality, it gets a little dicey because\nyou still have to have conversations.\n\n394\n00:20:49.394 --> 00:20:53.556\nYou can't just be pulling things off\na process map without understanding.\n\n395\n00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:56.688\nThey could be like a compliance issue or\nsomething like that.\n\n396\n00:20:56.688 --> 00:21:01.305\nBut the hard part of it is getting\nused to listening for that word faster\n\n397\n00:21:01.305 --> 00:21:05.859\nbecause a lot of times, people\naren't going to say the word faster.\n\n398\n00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:09.663\nI need to make this process faster,\nthey might say,\n\n399\n00:21:09.663 --> 00:21:14.339\nI need to improve cycle time,\nor we're missing our deadlines.\n\n400\n00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:19.253\nBut the moment that you hear that\nthey're trying to speed up that process,\n\n401\n00:21:19.253 --> 00:21:23.153\nthat's when you know it's time to stop,\nmap the process,\n\n402\n00:21:23.153 --> 00:21:25.738\nstart looking at what you can combine.\n\n403\n00:21:25.738 --> 00:21:30.254\nThis is a great argument as well when\nyou're trying to convince your boss that\n\n404\n00:21:30.254 --> 00:21:31.788\nthis is a good thing to do.\n\n405\n00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:35.996\nBecause whatever boxes you are able\nto take off that process map,\n\n406\n00:21:35.996 --> 00:21:37.765\nyou can cost those box out.\n\n407\n00:21:37.765 --> 00:21:40.411\nLabor, facility, equipment.\n\n408\n00:21:40.411 --> 00:21:44.508\nSo you automatically have a way that\nyou can say you've saved some money.\n\n409\n00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:49.213\nNow cost effectiveness is kind of an\ninteresting one because cost effectiveness\n\n410\n00:21:49.213 --> 00:21:50.951\nactually has three buckets.\n\n411\n00:21:50.951 --> 00:21:53.982\nThe first bucket is profit and\nprofit is always king.\n\n412\n00:21:53.982 --> 00:21:57.385\nIf I walk into your office and I say,\nI've got a process improvement and\n\n413\n00:21:57.385 --> 00:22:01.318\nit's gonna make you money, you're gonna\nat least stop and listen to me, right?\n\n414\n00:22:01.318 --> 00:22:02.530\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n415\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.776\nthis might not be the first time\nyou've come to me either, right?\n\n416\n00:22:05.776 --> 00:22:07.541\nSo you might have made one\nset of improvements and\n\n417\n00:22:07.541 --> 00:22:10.126\nthen you make a second set of\nimprovements, so it's getting better and\n\n418\n00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:11.677\nbetter each time-\n>> Exactly.\n\n419\n00:22:11.677 --> 00:22:14.393\n>> Until sooner or later, we hit that\nthreshold, right, where the cost of\n\n420\n00:22:14.393 --> 00:22:17.169\nthe improvement exceeds the benefit\nof the improvement you're making.\n\n421\n00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.981\nBut if you tell me you can save\nme some money, I'm gonna listen.\n\n422\n00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:20.701\nI'm all ears.\n\n423\n00:22:20.701 --> 00:22:22.514\n>> Which brings us to the second point.\n\n424\n00:22:22.514 --> 00:22:27.493\nSo making money and then saving money,\nwhile saving money in our world,\n\n425\n00:22:27.493 --> 00:22:32.570\nif I go to the store and I buy apples,\nand let's say they're $2 a pound.\n\n426\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.870\nThey're really good apples.\n\n427\n00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.869\nAnd they're $2 a pound.\n\n428\n00:22:34.869 --> 00:22:39.155\nAnd I go to another store and\nthey're $1.50 and I decide to make my\n\n429\n00:22:39.155 --> 00:22:44.041\npurchasing decision there, I drive\nhome saying, I saved $0.50 a pound.\n\n430\n00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:46.058\nIn the process improvement role,\n\n431\n00:22:46.058 --> 00:22:49.835\nwe look at savings through\na slightly different lens.\n\n432\n00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:54.465\nIn order for it to constitute\na true process improvement savings,\n\n433\n00:22:54.465 --> 00:22:56.385\nwe have to already have the money.\n\n434\n00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:57.846\nIt can be in our budget,\n\n435\n00:22:57.846 --> 00:23:02.244\nor my boss could have actually handed\nme $20 and I give him 10 back.\n\n436\n00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:07.007\nSo unless I've already been allocated the\nmoney or have the money in my hand, and\n\n437\n00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:11.255\nI give you money back,\nthen it doesn't count as cost savings.\n\n438\n00:23:11.255 --> 00:23:14.853\nWhereas, I think we look\nat savings differently.\n\n439\n00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:18.215\n>> Yeah, when I hear savings,\nI immediately think of money.\n\n440\n00:23:18.215 --> 00:23:23.069\nI don't necessarily think of\nsavings in terms of saving time or\n\n441\n00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:25.091\nsaving other resources.\n\n442\n00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:29.986\n>> And then finally the cost avoidance,\nor cost effectiveness.\n\n443\n00:23:29.986 --> 00:23:34.706\nAnd when I'm looking at, okay, so\nI could make money, I could save money, or\n\n444\n00:23:34.706 --> 00:23:36.790\nI could avoid you spending money.\n\n445\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.122\nAnd there's a couple different ways\nI could look at that cost avoidance\n\n446\n00:23:41.122 --> 00:23:42.281\nargument as well.\n\n447\n00:23:42.281 --> 00:23:45.348\nOne way is, if I'm looking at compliance.\n\n448\n00:23:45.348 --> 00:23:49.254\nAnd people such as OSHA and\nEPA actually have schedules that say,\n\n449\n00:23:49.254 --> 00:23:54.167\nif you make this violation, we're gonna\ncharge you x amount of dollars, right?\n\n450\n00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:58.961\nSo if I make a process improvement\nthat keeps me from being fined,\n\n451\n00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:03.941\nthen I can go ahead and say,\nI've avoided you spending that money.\n\n452\n00:24:03.941 --> 00:24:05.742\nThe other one's a little trickier.\n\n453\n00:24:05.742 --> 00:24:08.841\nAnd that's when sometimes you\nhave to spend money upfront,\n\n454\n00:24:08.841 --> 00:24:11.221\nbecause it's gonna save\nmoney down the line.\n\n455\n00:24:11.221 --> 00:24:14.124\nNow remember what we were saying,\nthat profit?\n\n456\n00:24:14.124 --> 00:24:17.130\nI go tell you I'm gonna make you money,\nyou're at least gonna listen to me.\n\n457\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.885\nAnd savings?\n\n458\n00:24:17.885 --> 00:24:20.260\nThat's pretty easy,\nbecause I'm giving you money back.\n\n459\n00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.570\nAnd you're going oh, wow,\nI got money back, right?\n\n460\n00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.548\nBut then when we get down to cost\navoidance, you need to spend a little more\n\n461\n00:24:26.548 --> 00:24:30.860\nthis quarter than you thought, but\ndown the line, it's gonna save you money?\n\n462\n00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.099\nSometimes that gets to be kinda tricky.\n\n463\n00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:35.496\nAnd you're gonna have to show\na spreadsheet that says,\n\n464\n00:24:35.496 --> 00:24:37.129\nwe're spending this money upfront.\n\n465\n00:24:37.129 --> 00:24:41.173\nA lot of times I think we run into\nthat with software where we're doing\n\n466\n00:24:41.173 --> 00:24:44.380\nan Enterprise rollout of like say,\nOracle or SAP, and\n\n467\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.496\nthere's some things that if we're\nnot a student doing that rollout,\n\n468\n00:24:48.496 --> 00:24:53.267\nthere's things that we don't know,\nmodules that we might not have purchased.\n\n469\n00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:57.294\nBut if we do it the next time and\nwe buy in a bundle, in the big picture,\n\n470\n00:24:57.294 --> 00:24:58.898\nit's gonna save us money.\n\n471\n00:24:58.898 --> 00:25:00.373\n>> And you see that like with a make or\n\n472\n00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:03.379\nbuy analysis, right, that there's\na lot of things where you say,\n\n473\n00:25:03.379 --> 00:25:07.123\nwell, I could outsource this, or I could\npurchase it pre-made, or we could try and\n\n474\n00:25:07.123 --> 00:25:09.953\nmake it ourselves, and\nit might seem like a good idea at first.\n\n475\n00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:13.110\nI know I've started this kind of project\nbefore where all of a sudden you realize,\n\n476\n00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.312\nhalfway through, boy, I should have just\npaid somebody else to do this [LAUGH], but\n\n477\n00:25:16.312 --> 00:25:17.212\nnow you're in a hole.\n\n478\n00:25:17.212 --> 00:25:21.846\n>> Right, and that brings a good point\nabout Lean Six Sigma cuz Lean Six Sigma\n\n479\n00:25:21.846 --> 00:25:26.181\npromotes the idea that you need to\ndo the things that you're best at,\n\n480\n00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:30.923\ndo the things where you have your\ncompetencies and outsource other stuff.\n\n481\n00:25:30.923 --> 00:25:32.478\nLet somebody else do that.\n\n482\n00:25:32.478 --> 00:25:36.948\nNow in order to do this, in order to\nmake an existing process better, faster,\n\n483\n00:25:36.948 --> 00:25:39.816\nmore cost effective,\nyou have to develop a plan.\n\n484\n00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:43.251\nYou have to know your competition and\nyour customers.\n\n485\n00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:45.191\nYou have to have the right tools.\n\n486\n00:25:45.191 --> 00:25:46.676\nYou have to manage the plan.\n\n487\n00:25:46.676 --> 00:25:50.952\nAnd what I think is\ninteresting about this is that,\n\n488\n00:25:50.952 --> 00:25:54.234\neven though TQM gets the credit for it,\n\n489\n00:25:54.234 --> 00:25:58.915\nGeneral Sun from Art of War\nhad this down centuries ago.\n\n490\n00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:02.205\n>> It's funny you mention that because in\nthe project management episodes that I've\n\n491\n00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:03.521\ndone with one of our other hosts,\n\n492\n00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:05.544\nwe always end up mentioning\nthe Art of War somehow.\n\n493\n00:26:05.544 --> 00:26:06.298\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n494\n00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.904\n>> And it's almost like managing\n\n495\n00:26:07.904 --> 00:26:10.628\na project, process improvement,\nit's warfare.\n\n496\n00:26:10.628 --> 00:26:11.568\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n497\n00:26:11.568 --> 00:26:13.120\nIt is.\n>> It's you versus them.\n\n498\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.639\n>> Yeah, and I think it's interesting\nbecause a lot of times when you're\n\n499\n00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:19.470\nlistening to politicians,\nthey come up with Art of War.\n\n500\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.511\nAnd what is the other one, Rules for\nRadicals, they're saying that we.\n\n501\n00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:26.788\nBut it kinda seeps over into everything.\n\n502\n00:26:26.788 --> 00:26:31.912\nIn TQM, Total Quality Management,\nsomething that is really important\n\n503\n00:26:31.912 --> 00:26:36.365\nis the philosophies and\nvalues about people being important.\n\n504\n00:26:36.365 --> 00:26:39.452\nAnd that we need to listen to\nthe voice of the customer and\n\n505\n00:26:39.452 --> 00:26:42.486\nthe voice of the process and\nthe voice of the employee.\n\n506\n00:26:42.486 --> 00:26:45.690\nAll of that's the same as\nit was in the 40s and 50s.\n\n507\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.673\nIt's just that now with Lean Six Sigma,\nwe have tools that can help us do that,\n\n508\n00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:54.084\nagain, better, faster,\nand more cost effective.\n\n509\n00:26:54.084 --> 00:26:56.256\nAfter the Industrial Revolution and\n\n510\n00:26:56.256 --> 00:27:00.877\nafter that kind of weird period of time\nwhere they were experimenting on this,\n\n511\n00:27:00.877 --> 00:27:04.938\nwhen they came up with the original,\nwhen Deming and Joseph Juran and\n\n512\n00:27:04.938 --> 00:27:09.595\nseveral others came up with this idea,\nthe tools were very people centric.\n\n513\n00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:12.173\nWe're gonna do things like\ntotal quality circles,\n\n514\n00:27:12.173 --> 00:27:14.993\nwhere we get everyone in a room\ntogether and talk to them.\n\n515\n00:27:14.993 --> 00:27:18.005\nBut what's happened over\nthe years is that man time\n\n516\n00:27:18.005 --> 00:27:21.575\nhas become more expensive\nthan machine time.\n\n517\n00:27:21.575 --> 00:27:26.183\nBack in the day, machines were really\nexpensive, and men weren't that expensive,\n\n518\n00:27:26.183 --> 00:27:29.712\nor man labor or women labor just\nwasn't that expensive, right?\n\n519\n00:27:29.712 --> 00:27:33.565\nAnd so they could afford to do\na lot of people based things.\n\n520\n00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:38.470\nSo if you're a student of TQM,\nit's important that you remember\n\n521\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:43.106\nthat the philosophies,\nthe values, people are important,\n\n522\n00:27:43.106 --> 00:27:47.051\nthe people who work with\nthe process are important.\n\n523\n00:27:47.051 --> 00:27:51.667\nOur collective intelligence is\nbetter than our single ideas,\n\n524\n00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:54.287\nthen I think you're in good shape.\n\n525\n00:27:54.287 --> 00:27:58.879\n>> All right, so we got a chance to\nsee some of the belt levels we have,\n\n526\n00:27:58.879 --> 00:28:04.706\nthe different history that's kinda like\na back story of total quality management,\n\n527\n00:28:04.706 --> 00:28:08.419\nTQM, and so\nI've kind of done a good picture of that.\n\n528\n00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:12.255\nNow, going forward, we still need to\nlearn a lot more about Lean Six Sigma and\n\n529\n00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:13.450\nhow we implement that.\n\n530\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.392\nBut from a historical perspective,\nthat's a pretty good rundown.\n\n531\n00:28:16.392 --> 00:28:18.947\nDo you have anything else you wanted to\nthrow in before we wrap up the episode?\n\n532\n00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:23.485\n>> No, I just wanna say that in our next\nepisode, we'll be talking about waste and\n\n533\n00:28:23.485 --> 00:28:26.620\ndefects and how that impacts\nIT as well as other areas.\n\n534\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.343\n>> Excellent.\n\n535\n00:28:27.343 --> 00:28:31.013\nAnd definitely a topic we need to\nunderstand because Lean Six Sigma does\n\n536\n00:28:31.013 --> 00:28:33.776\ndraw such a defined line\nbetween those two concepts.\n\n537\n00:28:33.776 --> 00:28:35.512\nSo, all right, well, at that point,\n\n538\n00:28:35.512 --> 00:28:37.905\nthis is a pretty good spot\nto wrap this episode up.\n\n539\n00:28:37.905 --> 00:28:39.761\nSo I hope you guys have enjoyed it so far.\n\n540\n00:28:39.761 --> 00:28:42.240\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more Lean Six Sigma coming down\n\n541\n00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:42.777\nthe line.\n\n542\n00:28:42.777 --> 00:28:46.480\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n543\n00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.595\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern.\n\n544\n00:28:47.595 --> 00:28:49.673\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n545\n00:28:49.673 --> 00:28:56.950\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.658\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:19.891\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:26.775\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at waste and defects.\n\n6\n00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.915\nWe're gonna be talking\nabout what those are and\n\n7\n00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:32.609\nreally what the difference is between\nthe two because in a non-LSS environment,\n\n8\n00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.712\nthen we might think of\nthose as the same thing.\n\n9\n00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.473\nSo, we're gonna take a deep dive into\nthat, and get a chance to look at it, and\n\n10\n00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:40.367\nhere to help me with that is Dr. Stern.\n\n11\n00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.505\nGreat to have you back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:43.037\n>> Thank you.\nIt's great to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:46.451\n>> And so, where do we get\nstarted with waste and defects?\n\n14\n00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:51.014\n>> Well, I think it's important,\nwhen you're looking at Lean Six Sigma,\n\n15\n00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:55.813\nto understand the key differences between\nthe science of Six Sigma and Lean.\n\n16\n00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.816\nBecause Six Sigma concentrates on defects,\nand\n\n17\n00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:03.886\nin the service world those are called\nmistakes, and Lean concentrates on waste.\n\n18\n00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:09.220\nAnd both want to eliminate, that would\nbe the top thing they'd wanna do,\n\n19\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.360\nbut if they can't eliminate it then they\ndefinitely wanna work at reducing it.\n\n20\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.285\nSo when Lean and Six Sigma are combined,\nwhen both of them are together,\n\n21\n00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:25.129\nthey take on sort of a whole different\nprofile, and they basically take\n\n22\n00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:30.000\nthe best of both sciences, but\nit does end up being a little different.\n\n23\n00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.155\nBut I think if we take a look at\nSix Sigma and then take a look at Lean,\n\n24\n00:01:34.155 --> 00:01:37.137\nit makes more sense how\nthey combine together.\n\n25\n00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:39.691\n>> All right, so\nwhich one do we wanna start with?\n\n26\n00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.710\n>> Let's start with Six Sigma.\n\n27\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.263\nAnd I have a slideshow just to\nkinda keep myself on track.\n\n28\n00:01:45.263 --> 00:01:50.147\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so the core thing about\n\n29\n00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:54.562\nSix Sigma that you wanna remember\nis that it identifies mistakes and\n\n30\n00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:58.124\nmistakes are defects in\nthe manufacturing world, and\n\n31\n00:01:58.124 --> 00:02:01.842\nthen the reason why we're\nidentifying those mistakes or\n\n32\n00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:05.811\ndefects is that we want to reduce or\neliminate them, right?\n\n33\n00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:10.570\nAnd that sounds pretty simple, except\nthat one of the big differences between\n\n34\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.042\nwaste and mistakes is that\nmistakes are pretty obvious.\n\n35\n00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:17.854\nIf you go somewhere, and there's a big\nhole in the wall, you're gonna say, hey,\n\n36\n00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:18.790\nthat's a mistake.\n\n37\n00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.700\nOr you go somewhere and your order is\nlate, your fast-food order isn't on time,\n\n38\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.919\nthat's a mistake.\n\n39\n00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.727\nIn the waste arena,\nsometimes it gets subjective.\n\n40\n00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:33.332\nThat's why there's not as many\ntools to identify mistakes as there\n\n41\n00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:35.570\nare to identify waste.\n\n42\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.050\nOne of the main major methods,\nthat was kind of repetitive.\n\n43\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.306\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of the big things in Six Sigma is\n\n44\n00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:45.010\nto reduce variation.\n\n45\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.284\nAnother way to say that is to standardize.\n\n46\n00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:52.815\nSo there is a thought in the Six Sigma\nworld that if I take a process and\n\n47\n00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:56.086\nI standardize it,\nit's not all over the place.\n\n48\n00:02:56.086 --> 00:02:59.057\nI could have an automatic\nprocess improvement.\n\n49\n00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:02.934\nBut even if I don't have\nan automatic process improvement,\n\n50\n00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:07.038\nI've leveled the playing field,\nso the next attempt to roll out\n\n51\n00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:11.538\nthe improvement isn't going to be\nlike up and down all over the board.\n\n52\n00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:14.137\nI'm at least gonna get\neveryone at a level place.\n\n53\n00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:15.067\nDoes that make sense?\n\n54\n00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:18.871\n>> Absolutely, and just to put this\ninto a kind of a timely reference,\n\n55\n00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:22.610\nwe went to lunch today at a Mexican\nrestaurant that's nearby that I\n\n56\n00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.972\nlike them not because it's\nthe greatest food in the world.\n\n57\n00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:29.154\nThere's been a reference out there,\nbut they're very consistent.\n\n58\n00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:32.334\nThat every time I go, the food is at\nthe same level of quality and I really\n\n59\n00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:36.044\nappreciate that because sometimes you go\nto a restaurant and they have great food,\n\n60\n00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:39.012\nand you go back a week later and\nhave a very different experience and\n\n61\n00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:41.344\nvery poor food, and\nit kinda ruins the whole thing.\n\n62\n00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:46.050\nSo having that standardized experience\neach time helps to, like in this case,\n\n63\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.452\nbuild up an established customer base.\n\n64\n00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:53.373\n>> And to echo what Don is saying, I do\na lot of traveling all over United States,\n\n65\n00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:55.116\nEurope and Australia, and\n\n66\n00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:59.461\nI can tell when the housekeepers\nhave a checklist to clean the room.\n\n67\n00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.529\nYou can tell.\n\n68\n00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.968\nI mean that, sometimes I go to hotels and\nthe cleanliness of the room is all over\n\n69\n00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:08.012\nthe board, but\nyou can tell the ones that have a list.\n\n70\n00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:11.239\nSo, sometimes you have this\nautomatic process improvement.\n\n71\n00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.362\nSo, in order to do that,\n\n72\n00:04:13.362 --> 00:04:18.945\nwhat happens is that Six Sigma\ndepends on a number of statistics.\n\n73\n00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:23.810\nAnd most of the statistics that are used\nin Six Sigma, have to do with variation.\n\n74\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.315\nI have to identify the variation\nto do a variation study.\n\n75\n00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:29.917\nAnd then I have to analyze the variation.\n\n76\n00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:34.616\nBecause if I´m gonna reduce it, I have\nto at least understand where it´s at.\n\n77\n00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:38.840\nThere´s lots of different ways when\nyou´re thinking about Six Sigma,\n\n78\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.483\nsome of the terms, variation, obviously.\n\n79\n00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:45.681\nBut there's a lot of ways that I can look\nat variation, and one of them is Sigma.\n\n80\n00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:50.224\nAnd Sigma has six levels, and we're gonna\ntalk a little bit about Sigma later.\n\n81\n00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:54.196\nBut if there's six levels and\nyou're at a three Sigma and\n\n82\n00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:57.192\ngo to four Sigma, then you've improved.\n\n83\n00:04:57.192 --> 00:05:02.904\nNow the reason why I mention that is,\nif you're familiar with RPNs,\n\n84\n00:05:02.904 --> 00:05:07.534\nRisk, wow, Risk,\n[INAUDIBLE] Risk Priority Numbers,\n\n85\n00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:12.668\nwhat happens is,\nthat number you're trying to make go down.\n\n86\n00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:17.531\nSo, like an RPN would look at things\nlike severity, detection, occurrence,\n\n87\n00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.209\nand you would get a number.\n\n88\n00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:23.512\nAnd the idea behind the RPN is,\nI'm trying to make that number go down or\n\n89\n00:05:23.512 --> 00:05:25.976\nI'm trying to make Sigma go up, right?\n\n90\n00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:30.865\nSo, another term that you hear\nin Six Sigma a lot is DMAIC, and\n\n91\n00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:36.615\nwe're gonna be working through\nthe DMAIC model in different episodes.\n\n92\n00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.626\nDMAIC stands for Define, Measure,\nAnalyze, Improve, and Control.\n\n93\n00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:44.439\nAnd it said, just like I said DMAIC,\nthe probably the worst mistake that\n\n94\n00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.499\nLean Six Sigma people make off the bat,\nright off the bat,\n\n95\n00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.153\nis they'll call it like the DMAIC or\nthey'll have some other words.\n\n96\n00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:54.080\nSo just kinda think that DMAIC, and\n\n97\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.479\nanother term you hear a lot\nin Six Sigma is root cause.\n\n98\n00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.398\nSo Six Sigma concentrates\non reducing variation,\n\n99\n00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:05.047\nor in other words standardizing.\n\n100\n00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:08.645\nTo do that it depends on\na number of statistics.\n\n101\n00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:12.228\nNow, a lot of times in a Six Sigma class,\n\n102\n00:06:12.228 --> 00:06:16.561\nyou're basically taking a statistics 101.\n\n103\n00:06:16.561 --> 00:06:19.310\nAnd Lean,\nthey're a little bit more forgiving, and\n\n104\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.010\nthey let you use templates and\nExcel spreadsheets.\n\n105\n00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.430\nEven in Six Sigma, they're working\nthings out on a worksheet, but there's\n\n106\n00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.136\na kind of a, I don't know, attention paid\nto how this statistic actually works.\n\n107\n00:06:31.136 --> 00:06:35.362\nSo, a Six Sigma program,\na lot of times when you hear pushback,\n\n108\n00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.429\nis because it's so statistically oriented.\n\n109\n00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:42.021\nIn Lean Six Sigma projects,\nwhich we'll also talk about later,\n\n110\n00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:45.296\nthose projects aren't quite\nas big as Six Sigma projects.\n\n111\n00:06:45.296 --> 00:06:50.176\nSix Sigma, the paradigm right\nnow is if it doesn't save, make,\n\n112\n00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:53.551\nor avoid spending about $250,000,\n\n113\n00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:57.834\nthen it's probably not worthy\nof a Six Sigma attention.\n\n114\n00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.068\nSo, there's a lot of companies that,\nat the end of the year after they paid all\n\n115\n00:07:01.068 --> 00:07:03.530\ntheir bills,\nthey'd be happy to make $250,000.\n\n116\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.591\nSo one of the things that Lean brings\nto the Lean Six Sigma party is\n\n117\n00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:13.557\nit says we could use a lot of\nthe basic Six Sigma principles, and\n\n118\n00:07:13.557 --> 00:07:19.110\njust scale it down a bit so that we\ncan work with it on smaller projects.\n\n119\n00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.317\n>> I know I've read\nsimilar things out there.\n\n120\n00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:24.358\nI read an article a while back\ntalking about Motorola, and\n\n121\n00:07:24.358 --> 00:07:27.163\nhow they don't actually strive for\na true Six Sigma.\n\n122\n00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:31.971\nThere's more like a four and a half or\nsomething, cuz that's really where\n\n123\n00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:36.490\nyou start to hit that cost to benefit\nbreak for a lot of smaller things.\n\n124\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.149\n>> Yeah, and that's a good point because\nin the manufacturing environment,\n\n125\n00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.317\na lot of times they use a different\ncalculation which is called Cpk.\n\n126\n00:07:45.317 --> 00:07:49.262\nAnd as you know, whenever you see\nthe small K on something like that,\n\n127\n00:07:49.262 --> 00:07:51.584\nthat means it's a schedule or an index.\n\n128\n00:07:51.584 --> 00:07:56.905\nAnd Cpk only has two numbers, 1 to 2, and\na lot of times in manufacturing they'll\n\n129\n00:07:56.905 --> 00:08:01.921\nsay, we're gonna shoot for a 1.33 Cpk,\nwhich is equivalent to four sigma\n\n130\n00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:07.108\nbecause sometimes we could make parts\nbetter than what they're gonna fit into.\n\n131\n00:08:07.108 --> 00:08:09.035\nSo, absolutely.\n\n132\n00:08:09.035 --> 00:08:12.288\nSo, in the Lean environment what we're\n\n133\n00:08:12.288 --> 00:08:17.177\nconcentrating on is identifying waste and\nreducing waste.\n\n134\n00:08:17.177 --> 00:08:19.104\nWe've said that several different times.\n\n135\n00:08:19.104 --> 00:08:23.660\nBut Lean has a little bit\nmore attention to people.\n\n136\n00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.761\nNow, it's not that the Six Sigma body of\nknowledge which is basically managed by\n\n137\n00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:32.046\nthe American Society of Quality, it's not\nthat it doesn't mention anything about\n\n138\n00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:35.083\npeople, there's just not that\nconcentration on people.\n\n139\n00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:38.798\nIt's just not strongly addressed\nin their body of knowledge.\n\n140\n00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:42.631\nWhereas, Lean has kind of the belief\nthat you can do everything right.\n\n141\n00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:47.277\nBut if you don't have the right people on\nboard or you don't have the right buy-in,\n\n142\n00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:51.087\nor you don't have the right motivation\nyour project can still fail.\n\n143\n00:08:51.087 --> 00:08:54.122\nThe Project Management Institute\noften does surveys and\n\n144\n00:08:54.122 --> 00:08:56.334\nthey found over the years consistently,\n\n145\n00:08:56.334 --> 00:09:00.204\nthat of the projects that fail,\nmost of them fail because of the people.\n\n146\n00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:03.522\nAnd what's staggering about that\nis that it's not the budget,\n\n147\n00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:07.955\nit's not the intellectual capital, it's\npeople issues of the projects that fail.\n\n148\n00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:13.843\nSo Lean says, paying attention to\npeople is really, really important.\n\n149\n00:09:13.843 --> 00:09:19.175\nThe other thing that Lean talks a lot\nabout is value to the customer.\n\n150\n00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:22.849\nIt used to be, and I'm sure you may have\nremembered hearing this at one point in\n\n151\n00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:25.085\nyour life,\nthat the customer is always right.\n\n152\n00:09:25.085 --> 00:09:26.873\nWe're supposed to serve the customer.\n\n153\n00:09:26.873 --> 00:09:31.143\nOver the years a lot of\nthat has kind of gone away.\n\n154\n00:09:31.143 --> 00:09:35.649\nFor example, I live in a mountain\ntown that used to be kind of small.\n\n155\n00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:37.297\nIt's grown over the years.\n\n156\n00:09:37.297 --> 00:09:41.932\nBut we had a bank that was really\nserved the mountain clientele.\n\n157\n00:09:41.932 --> 00:09:46.572\nIt had donuts, and it had this great\nplace where you could weigh, and\n\n158\n00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:51.694\nthe restroom was always open to you,\nand there was always these magazines,\n\n159\n00:09:51.694 --> 00:09:54.433\nand they did all kinds of special stuff.\n\n160\n00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:56.964\nAnd then over the years\na lot of that went away.\n\n161\n00:09:56.964 --> 00:10:00.801\nIt's a very sterile environment,\nthey don't have donuts on Friday anymore,\n\n162\n00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:04.236\nyou have to go get a key for the restroom,\nthere's no way to use a phone,\n\n163\n00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:05.226\nthat type of thing.\n\n164\n00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:08.917\nAnd so they took away a lot of\nthe customer value and as a result,\n\n165\n00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:12.957\nwe now have eight banks in my community\nthat can really support two and\n\n166\n00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:17.504\nmight have just stuck with one if they\ncontinued on with that customer value.\n\n167\n00:10:17.504 --> 00:10:21.291\nSo Lean has a big focus on spending\ntime with the customer and\n\n168\n00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:24.624\nreally, Lean believes that\nthe only way you know for\n\n169\n00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:28.439\nsure that you're successful\nis if the customer's happy.\n\n170\n00:10:28.439 --> 00:10:33.197\nSo Six Sigma, a lot of times, and\none of the things that people talk about\n\n171\n00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:37.955\nSix Sigma is a lot of times Six Sigma\nbases its decisions on the numbers and\n\n172\n00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:40.072\nthe statistics and the graphs.\n\n173\n00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:44.897\nLean says hey that's pretty important,\nbut the people side is also important.\n\n174\n00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:49.109\nAnd then the other thing that lean\ndoes is it identifies something called\n\n175\n00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:53.458\nthe value stream, and when you hear\nthe word value stream, what that means\n\n176\n00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:57.626\nis it looks at a product or a service,\nand it basically cradle to grave.\n\n177\n00:10:57.626 --> 00:11:00.203\nWhat are all the different things\nthat happen in this stream?\n\n178\n00:11:00.203 --> 00:11:02.501\nWhat are all the people that are touched?\n\n179\n00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:05.874\nWhat are all the steps,\nin between steps, and\n\n180\n00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:11.682\nsometimes value streams will even be\nsubject to something called a gemba walk.\n\n181\n00:11:11.682 --> 00:11:15.639\nI think I mentioned that in another\nepisode, a lot of times in Lean,\n\n182\n00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:17.800\nthey kind of use the Japanese words.\n\n183\n00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.445\nA gemba walk is where we walk the value\nstream or any process, actually,\n\n184\n00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:25.351\nit doesn't even have to\nbe the value stream.\n\n185\n00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.401\nAnd it's advised that you take\na couple of people with you so\n\n186\n00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:34.840\nthat it's not just your opinion, because\nsometimes you can be kind of biased.\n\n187\n00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.689\nAnd the idea is that in Lean sometimes\nthey even call it staple yourself\n\n188\n00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:40.683\nto the floor.\n\n189\n00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:43.237\n>> [LAUGH] A little graphic there.\n\n190\n00:11:43.237 --> 00:11:46.745\n>> Yeah, so then you see all\nthe steps that the form went through.\n\n191\n00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:52.037\nNow echoing what I just said about\nthe Japanese terms, in Six Sigma you hear\n\n192\n00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:57.679\nwords at least that you've heard of\nbefore, such as root cause and variation.\n\n193\n00:11:57.679 --> 00:12:01.553\nThose are words that even if you\ndon't work Work with every day,\n\n194\n00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:04.995\nyou can kinda guess what they mean,\nbut on the lean side,\n\n195\n00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:09.747\nyou're likely to hear terms like Jidoka,\nHeijunka, Poka-yoke, Kaizen.\n\n196\n00:12:09.747 --> 00:12:14.390\nAnd I'm not going to go through\nall the lean terms right now.\n\n197\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.100\nBut I just wanna give you kinda the high\nlevel idea of what they mean so\n\n198\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.254\nthat they're not so scary.\n\n199\n00:12:20.414 --> 00:12:24.220\nThere are some popular\nterms that aren't Japanese,\n\n200\n00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.190\nstandard work and value stream mapping.\n\n201\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.174\nSo I do wanna throw\nthat out there as well,\n\n202\n00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:32.602\nthat even though there's a lot of\nterms in Just Lean that are Japanese.\n\n203\n00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:36.317\nThere's also non-Japanese terms as well.\n\n204\n00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:41.221\nI know a lot of you are already saying,\nif I take the exam which is available on\n\n205\n00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:46.451\nthe SSD global website, if I take the exam\nam I gonna have to remember all of that?\n\n206\n00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:52.411\nAnd remember it's open book, and just\nlike any other exam you have to study for\n\n207\n00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:58.657\nit, but nobody expects you to remember or\nknow how to spell these Japanese words.\n\n208\n00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:02.731\nSo the first word we're\ngonna talk about is jidoka.\n\n209\n00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:07.175\nAnd one of the things I may\nhave forgotten to point out,\n\n210\n00:13:07.175 --> 00:13:12.102\nis that a lot of the terms are named\nafter the people who either\n\n211\n00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:16.852\npopularized the term, or\nthey created the actual graph.\n\n212\n00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:20.430\nIn this case, these are,\nthe ones that we're looking at,\n\n213\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.299\nare actually Japanese words.\n\n214\n00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:27.637\nSo jidoka is just where we're\nidentifying defects in the process,\n\n215\n00:13:27.637 --> 00:13:29.705\nand we're halting work.\n\n216\n00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:35.721\nNow that sounds kind of simplistic, but\none of the main laws of lean six sigma or\n\n217\n00:13:35.721 --> 00:13:40.916\nI mean rather lean cuz we're kind of\non the lean side is that if you see\n\n218\n00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:47.330\nsomething wrong, you want to stop and fix\nit right then before are moving forward.\n\n219\n00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.896\nYou're trying to keep things off WIP,\n\n220\n00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:55.050\nwhich some people call work in progress,\nsome people call it work in process.\n\n221\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.940\nAnd IT sometimes they even call it TIPs,\nthings in progress or things in process.\n\n222\n00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.476\nSo the idea, one of the key kind\nof philosophies in Lean is stop,\n\n223\n00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.156\nfix it before you go on.\n\n224\n00:14:11.656 --> 00:14:15.184\nMy slide is being a little\npersnickety here.\n\n225\n00:14:15.184 --> 00:14:16.902\nHeijunka.\n\n226\n00:14:16.902 --> 00:14:19.070\nNow that's load leveling, and\n\n227\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:24.612\nwhat that means is that if the production\ndoesn't match what the customer wants,\n\n228\n00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:30.450\nand we have to look at fluctuation, and\nthis is just another example of waste.\n\n229\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.610\nIf I'm not producing on a timely manner,\nand of course,\n\n230\n00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:40.160\nthis is kind of industry-specific\nbecause a lot of things\n\n231\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.590\nhave to be made right away and other\nthings can have kind of a shelf life.\n\n232\n00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.790\nBut just kind of thinking about that,\nthat's what this one's about.\n\n233\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.339\nSo you can see they're really\npretty simplistic thoughts.\n\n234\n00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:57.864\nAnd poka-yoke,\nactually it's called poka-joke.\n\n235\n00:14:57.864 --> 00:14:59.442\nI've heard it said a lot\nof different ways.\n\n236\n00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:02.806\nAnd this slide's a really good\nexample of not mistake proofing but\n\n237\n00:15:02.806 --> 00:15:06.828\n[LAUGH] I'm not exactly sure what's going\non with these slides but we're almost\n\n238\n00:15:06.828 --> 00:15:10.849\nthrough them and like I said I just wanted\nto give you an idea of some of these words\n\n239\n00:15:10.849 --> 00:15:14.663\nthat they're not scary and they're\nnot really difficult to understand.\n\n240\n00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:18.867\nIt's just because we're using the Japanese\nterms sometimes they're harder to recall.\n\n241\n00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:23.800\nPoka-yoke is error proofing and as you see\non your bullets there's different ways\n\n242\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.970\nthat we can error proof and I'll just\ngive you a second to look at that.\n\n243\n00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.005\nThis is one of those things that is a\ncollateral on your student files, and it's\n\n244\n00:15:32.005 --> 00:15:36.119\ngonna give you step by step instructions\non how you go about mistake-proofing.\n\n245\n00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:41.125\nA lot of times in Lean Six Sigma,\nyou will hear the term mistake-proofing\n\n246\n00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:45.645\nas opposed to Poka-yoke, and\nthat goes back to what I was saying,\n\n247\n00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:49.629\nis that Lean Six Sigma's\ntrying to simplify everything.\n\n248\n00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:52.870\nNow, Kaizen is a really interesting one.\n\n249\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.950\nAnd you'll notice that events is bolded\nbecause Kaizen really just means\n\n250\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.990\ncontinually making everything better,\ninvolving everyone.\n\n251\n00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.845\nThat's the purpose of the word.\n\n252\n00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:07.451\nBut as of late you might have\nheard the term Kaizen events.\n\n253\n00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:12.990\nAnd Kaizen event in the Six Sigma world is\nreferred to as a rapid improvement event.\n\n254\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.762\nAnd what that means is that I have\nto pick something immediately.\n\n255\n00:16:16.762 --> 00:16:22.004\nLike, there's a problem on the warehouse\nfloor that stopped production, there's\n\n256\n00:16:22.004 --> 00:16:26.900\na form that wasn't filled out so I can't\nget my medical device on to the market.\n\n257\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.222\nI need to do something.\n\n258\n00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:30.696\nI need a quick fix, basically.\n\n259\n00:16:30.696 --> 00:16:33.250\nAnd I need it in as real time as possible.\n\n260\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.869\nSo the way Kaizen events and\nrapid improvement events work, and\n\n261\n00:16:36.869 --> 00:16:40.823\nsometimes you'll hear people refer\nto them as we're doing a Kaizen,\n\n262\n00:16:40.823 --> 00:16:45.111\nwhich just means a Kaizen event,\nis that we're working through a model that\n\n263\n00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:49.493\nwe would normally have a long time to\nwork through, in a short period of time.\n\n264\n00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:53.859\nSo we're doing the same steps of models\nthat we'll be talking about later.\n\n265\n00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:58.324\nPlan, do, check, act, PDCA, or\nthe DMAIC, define, measure, analyze,\n\n266\n00:16:58.324 --> 00:16:59.622\nimprove and control.\n\n267\n00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:02.945\nWe're taking those models that\ntypically we would have a lot of time\n\n268\n00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:04.343\nto work through each phase,\n\n269\n00:17:04.343 --> 00:17:07.740\nand we're trying to work through\nthe basics as quickly as possible.\n\n270\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.003\nTypically, a Kaizen event\ntakes about five days.\n\n271\n00:17:11.003 --> 00:17:14.052\nIf it's something on\nthe manufacturing floor,\n\n272\n00:17:14.052 --> 00:17:16.960\nsometimes that thing can\nbe fixed right away.\n\n273\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.531\nIf it's something in IT or in the service\nside, usually what happens at\n\n274\n00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:25.718\nthe end of the Kaizen event,\nyou get a really good project plan and\n\n275\n00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:30.774\nyou have all the buy in and you can hand\nthat project plan to someone to execute.\n\n276\n00:17:30.774 --> 00:17:34.501\nSo the idea of a Kaizen event on\nthe service or IT side is we're going to\n\n277\n00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:39.070\nbring all the players together, we're\ngoing to quickly work through the project,\n\n278\n00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.513\nwe're going to come up\nwith a project plan and\n\n279\n00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:44.886\nwe're going to give that project\nmanager all the authority.\n\n280\n00:17:44.886 --> 00:17:47.892\nThere's nothing there that they need\nto come back and ask department heads,\n\n281\n00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:48.778\ncan I have this money?\n\n282\n00:17:48.778 --> 00:17:49.765\nCan I have this resource?\n\n283\n00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:51.344\nSo that's what I'm working on.\n\n284\n00:17:51.344 --> 00:17:54.257\nBut, oddly enough, that's not enough.\n\n285\n00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:57.092\nWe now have something called\nmini-Kaizan events and\n\n286\n00:17:57.092 --> 00:18:00.748\nmini-Kaizan events happen in about\na two and a half day time period.\n\n287\n00:18:00.748 --> 00:18:02.931\nAnd there's no firm or fast law on this.\n\n288\n00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:06.781\nBut keep in mind, a typical Kaisan\nevent's about five days, and\n\n289\n00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:11.410\na mini-Kaisan event can be anywhere from\na day and a half to two and a half days.\n\n290\n00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.599\nBut same theory.\nWe're taking the model.\n\n291\n00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:15.049\nWe're working through\nthe logic of the model.\n\n292\n00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:16.894\nBut we're just doing it very quickly.\n\n293\n00:18:16.894 --> 00:18:20.834\n>> Now, those were some Japanese terms,\nbut they're not all Japanese terms, right,\n\n294\n00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:23.971\nthere's plenty of regular English\nterms involved in the process?\n\n295\n00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:24.646\n>> There is.\n\n296\n00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:28.988\nFor example, Standard Work and\nValue Stream Mapping.\n\n297\n00:18:28.988 --> 00:18:30.565\nWe just talked about value streams.\n\n298\n00:18:30.565 --> 00:18:35.268\nBut Value Stream Mapping is when\nI actually articulate on paper\n\n299\n00:18:35.268 --> 00:18:36.784\nthat value stream.\n\n300\n00:18:36.784 --> 00:18:40.476\nAs a reminder, I'm looking at a product or\nservice cradle to grave.\n\n301\n00:18:40.476 --> 00:18:45.409\nStandard Work is, sometimes you hear\nStandard Work in other disciplines.\n\n302\n00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:48.357\nLike an engineering field.\n\n303\n00:18:48.357 --> 00:18:51.759\nAnd standard work is essentially,\nthis is the way that we're doing it.\n\n304\n00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:53.796\nIt's kind of like a best practice, but\n\n305\n00:18:53.796 --> 00:18:56.465\nit's really just documenting\nwhat you've done.\n\n306\n00:18:56.465 --> 00:18:58.884\nSo if the person behind you\nhas to do the same thing,\n\n307\n00:18:58.884 --> 00:19:00.472\nthey can go to the standard work.\n\n308\n00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:05.100\nNow as I make improvements to the standard\nwork, then that becomes the standard,\n\n309\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.320\nif that makes sense.\n\n310\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.886\n>> So these got to be standard?\n\n311\n00:19:08.886 --> 00:19:10.210\n>> That's right.\n\n312\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.704\nAnd you might be asking yourself, do I\nneed to remember all of this for an exam?\n\n313\n00:19:15.704 --> 00:19:20.726\nJust kinda keep in mind that it is open\nbook, and there's a study guide and\n\n314\n00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:25.910\na cheat sheet and all of that, so this\ndefection was really more just to kinda\n\n315\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.780\nmake you aware that, on the lean side,\nyou see a lot of Japanese words.\n\n316\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.556\nMany of those Japanese words are,\nfor example,\n\n317\n00:19:33.556 --> 00:19:37.970\nwhen you see something like a [INAUDIBLE]\nchart where you see diagram.\n\n318\n00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.791\nThose were named, or circle.\n\n319\n00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:45.492\nThese things were named after the person\nwho either created or popularized them,\n\n320\n00:19:45.492 --> 00:19:48.568\nbut there's also some just\nregular Japanese words.\n\n321\n00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:51.761\nBut if you look at their definitions,\nit's not that crazy.\n\n322\n00:19:54.477 --> 00:19:56.578\n>> All right, well that's\na pretty good rundown on terms.\n\n323\n00:19:56.578 --> 00:20:00.947\nNow, I know we've talked about defects and\nwe've talked about waste, and\n\n324\n00:20:00.947 --> 00:20:03.211\nyou mentioned mistakes in there also.\n\n325\n00:20:03.211 --> 00:20:04.802\nDo we wanna spend some time on mistakes?\n\n326\n00:20:04.802 --> 00:20:06.609\n>> Yeah, so mistakes, and again,\n\n327\n00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:10.620\nremember defects are manufacturing,\nmistakes are in the service side.\n\n328\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.438\nNow defects are pretty easy to identify,\nand I think I opened this session with\n\n329\n00:20:15.438 --> 00:20:19.236\nsaying if you see a hole in\nthe wall you know that's a mistake.\n\n330\n00:20:19.236 --> 00:20:22.345\nWell we would actually probably\ncall that more of a defect, right?\n\n331\n00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:27.049\nMistakes and\ntimes require a lot more research and\n\n332\n00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:31.085\na lot of conversation, a lot of dialogue.\n\n333\n00:20:31.085 --> 00:20:35.705\nBecause sometimes mistakes aren't,\nwe don't even.\n\n334\n00:20:35.705 --> 00:20:38.212\nEven though there's a mistake there, so.\n\n335\n00:20:38.212 --> 00:20:41.872\n>> It just goes unseen and it makes it\nout there, and maybe somebody spots that\n\n336\n00:20:41.872 --> 00:20:44.907\neventually, or we do a little research and\nfind it on our own?\n\n337\n00:20:44.907 --> 00:20:45.673\n>> Exactly.\n\n338\n00:20:45.673 --> 00:20:52.565\nNow waste is a whole nother animal,\nbecause waste is very subjective.\n\n339\n00:20:52.565 --> 00:20:54.031\nWhat I see as waste you might not.\n\n340\n00:20:54.031 --> 00:20:58.365\nSo for example, if I were at a big box\nstore and I'm standing in line and\n\n341\n00:20:58.365 --> 00:21:02.203\nI'm waiting to make a purchase,\nI'm gonna call that waste.\n\n342\n00:21:02.203 --> 00:21:04.473\nThat's definitely waste,\nthat's wasting my time.\n\n343\n00:21:04.473 --> 00:21:07.497\nBut the big box store's already\ndone research that says,\n\n344\n00:21:07.497 --> 00:21:09.409\nas long as you're standing in line,\n\n345\n00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:12.926\nthere's an average amount of time\nthat you would stand in line, and\n\n346\n00:21:12.926 --> 00:21:17.021\npossibly buy all those myriad of products\nthat are there before you check out.\n\n347\n00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.574\nSo it's not really waste for them.\n\n348\n00:21:19.574 --> 00:21:23.336\nI know a lot of you have probably seen\nthat, where you go to big box store,\n\n349\n00:21:23.336 --> 00:21:27.917\nand half of the cash registers are empty,\nand you're thinking, what's up with that?\n\n350\n00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:32.367\nA big box store's gonna see waste in\na different way that we see waste, and so,\n\n351\n00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:36.840\nthere's more tools to identify waste,\nthen there are to identify mistakes.\n\n352\n00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.905\nNow, in both the Six Sigma and\nthe Lean world,\n\n353\n00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:43.599\nthey are very concerned about\nCritical to Quality, but\n\n354\n00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:48.565\nI just want to continue with our\nconversation about defects and mistakes.\n\n355\n00:21:48.565 --> 00:21:51.283\nThis is one of those\ntests you can look at.\n\n356\n00:21:51.283 --> 00:21:56.975\nSince there's lots of tools available\nto help you identify waste.\n\n357\n00:21:56.975 --> 00:22:00.505\nBut not that many to help\nidentify defects and mistakes.\n\n358\n00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:02.425\nI wanna address Critical to Quality.\n\n359\n00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:04.330\nNow there was a movement for a while, and\n\n360\n00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.365\nyou'll see those bullet points, Critical\nto Success, Critical to Satisfaction,\n\n361\n00:22:08.365 --> 00:22:12.360\ncertainly critical to making something\nbetter, faster, more cost-effective.\n\n362\n00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.261\nAbout ten years ago there was sort of a\nbit of a movement in textbooks to call it\n\n363\n00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:21.934\nCritical to Price, Critical to Speed,\nCritical to Satisfaction, but\n\n364\n00:22:21.934 --> 00:22:25.687\nit got just kind of crazy, so\nnow what's happened is CTQ,\n\n365\n00:22:25.687 --> 00:22:30.549\nCritical to Quality, has become\nan umbrella term for all of those things.\n\n366\n00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:36.665\nAnd so by default customer\nrequirements are Critical to Quality.\n\n367\n00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:40.975\nSo, what the customer wants or\nwhat their expectations,\n\n368\n00:22:40.975 --> 00:22:43.655\nyou might wanna give\nthem little extra things.\n\n369\n00:22:43.655 --> 00:22:46.138\nThat's another kind of\nLean Six Sigma principle.\n\n370\n00:22:46.138 --> 00:22:50.232\nBut what the customer wants,\nby default, is a CTQ, but\n\n371\n00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:52.759\nwhen you're looking at solving,\n\n372\n00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:57.640\nwhen you're looking at fixing mistakes or\nrectifying defects and\n\n373\n00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.695\neven the Lean world, looking at ways,\nyou want to kind of consider,\n\n374\n00:23:02.695 --> 00:23:07.955\nwhat do I need to do to make it good for\nthe person who's working with me.\n\n375\n00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:10.095\nSo, what's critical to their satisfaction.\n\n376\n00:23:10.095 --> 00:23:14.234\nSo, let's say I'm a facility's\ndirector of a large college, and\n\n377\n00:23:14.234 --> 00:23:18.589\neven though I have a staff and they do\nall kinds of different things one of\n\n378\n00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:22.095\nthe things I can get zinged\non is at the campuses, right?\n\n379\n00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:27.615\nSo, that's certainly critical\nto quality to my job, right?\n\n380\n00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:31.331\nThe feeling is almost\na little Steve I wanna go and\n\n381\n00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:35.992\nmake sure that the people who clean\nmy campus get what they need from me.\n\n382\n00:23:35.992 --> 00:23:38.408\nI need to be aware of their CTQs.\n\n383\n00:23:38.408 --> 00:23:44.107\nAnd so Lean Six Sigma and\noften says that's where we drop the ball.\n\n384\n00:23:44.107 --> 00:23:47.101\nWe kinda know what our CTQs are,\nbut we don't know what yours are.\n\n385\n00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:51.448\nSo, for example, if I could get zinged\nbecause the campus isn't clean,\n\n386\n00:23:51.448 --> 00:23:54.614\neven though I don't do that,\nI hire a firm to do that.\n\n387\n00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:59.412\nSome of their CTQs might be a list of\nexpectations, like we were saying,\n\n388\n00:23:59.412 --> 00:24:00.995\nfor maids at the hotel.\n\n389\n00:24:00.995 --> 00:24:04.505\nIt could be something something\nlike access to the campus.\n\n390\n00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:07.654\nI mean, if I can't get into\nthe campus to clean it,\n\n391\n00:24:07.654 --> 00:24:10.985\nthen there could be some\nsecurity issues there.\n\n392\n00:24:10.985 --> 00:24:15.309\nThe reason Critical to Quality is so\nimportant is that,\n\n393\n00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:20.653\nit gives us a way to even identify\nthings that we should be working on.\n\n394\n00:24:20.653 --> 00:24:26.334\nIf we think Critical to Quality,\nif we actually think in those terms,\n\n395\n00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:32.612\nthen often, what it will do for us is\nhelp us identify a process improvement.\n\n396\n00:24:32.612 --> 00:24:35.093\n>> Now, that whole Critical\nto Quality movement, I mean,\n\n397\n00:24:35.093 --> 00:24:37.018\nthere's a lot that goes into that, right?\n\n398\n00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:40.800\nBecause there's, you named a few examples,\nbut to try and figure out all\n\n399\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.009\nthe different things that are critical to\nthe quality of your product or service,\n\n400\n00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:47.094\nthat's a major undertaking isn't it?\n\n401\n00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:49.315\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n402\n00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:52.045\nAnd I think what you have to\ndo is you have to kinda think,\n\n403\n00:24:52.045 --> 00:24:55.495\nyou have to think from\nthe view of the other person.\n\n404\n00:24:55.495 --> 00:25:00.355\nSo if I were looking at housekeeping\nat a hotel we already came up with\n\n405\n00:25:00.355 --> 00:25:02.115\nCritical to Quality, they need a list but\n\n406\n00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:06.255\nthey also need equipment,\nright, and they need schedules.\n\n407\n00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:09.489\nI don't know, there's just\nlots of things I'm gonna need.\n\n408\n00:25:09.489 --> 00:25:14.275\nIf I were a rental car agency the idea\nbehind this Critical to Quality is,\n\n409\n00:25:14.275 --> 00:25:17.580\nI wanna think of the rental\ncar agency as a person.\n\n410\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.927\nAnd I know as the person renting the car,\nI want a car that's clean,\n\n411\n00:25:21.927 --> 00:25:26.597\nI want a car that's gassed up,\nI want a car that's ready and available.\n\n412\n00:25:26.597 --> 00:25:32.873\nBut if I were the rental car agency,\nwhat would my CTQ's be?\n\n413\n00:25:32.873 --> 00:25:35.591\nWhat do I need from being\na rental car agency?\n\n414\n00:25:35.591 --> 00:25:37.031\nDo you have any ideas, Don?\n\n415\n00:25:37.031 --> 00:25:39.592\nLike if you were an entity,\na rental car agency,\n\n416\n00:25:39.592 --> 00:25:41.719\nwhat are some of the things you'd want?\n\n417\n00:25:41.719 --> 00:25:45.217\n>> So, you're gonna need to have a certain\namount of vehicles on hand so that when\n\n418\n00:25:45.217 --> 00:25:48.941\nthe demand is there for a vehicle that\nyou're able to fulfill that demand, right?\n\n419\n00:25:48.941 --> 00:25:49.685\n>> Exactly.\n\n420\n00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:53.329\n>> And then not just number of\nvehicles but variations of vehicles.\n\n421\n00:25:53.329 --> 00:25:54.615\n>> Exactly.\n\n422\n00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:57.305\n>> Some people might need\ntwo seats versus five seats,\n\n423\n00:25:57.305 --> 00:26:02.305\nwe need an easy way to call in and book,\nan easy way to pay or be invoiced,\n\n424\n00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:04.735\nthere's all these different\npieces that aren't just the car.\n\n425\n00:26:04.735 --> 00:26:06.971\nIt's easy to think like,\nyou gotta have just a car.\n\n426\n00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:08.504\nBut how do I book that?\n\n427\n00:26:08.504 --> 00:26:09.920\nCan I have a corporate account?\n\n428\n00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.870\nDo I have to pay for it individually?\n\n429\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.658\nIs there an easy insurance plan?\n\n430\n00:26:13.658 --> 00:26:19.628\nAll of that's gonna affect the customer's\nexperience as they interact with that,\n\n431\n00:26:19.628 --> 00:26:20.225\nright?\n\n432\n00:26:20.225 --> 00:26:24.344\n>> Exactly, and what Lean Six Sigma\npromotes is that if I want to be\n\n433\n00:26:24.344 --> 00:26:27.454\na successful Lean Six Sigma professional,\nand\n\n434\n00:26:27.454 --> 00:26:32.352\nlet's say I'm the manager of the car\nrental place, I want to start looking\n\n435\n00:26:32.352 --> 00:26:37.359\nat things through that lens instead of\nwhat I need in order to be successful.\n\n436\n00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:40.354\nAnd there's just a couple of other\nthings that you might wanna think about.\n\n437\n00:26:40.354 --> 00:26:44.364\nIf you were a supermarket, certainly,\nI wanna walk into the supermarket and\n\n438\n00:26:44.364 --> 00:26:47.771\nget my food right away, and\nI hate it when they change the aisles.\n\n439\n00:26:47.771 --> 00:26:48.933\nI used to teach change management.\n\n440\n00:26:48.933 --> 00:26:50.853\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But when they change things on me,\n\n441\n00:26:50.853 --> 00:26:52.068\nit's just crazy, right?\n\n442\n00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:55.692\nBut if I were a Supermarket,\nI might want a lighted parking lot.\n\n443\n00:26:55.692 --> 00:26:58.668\nPeople might not stop by my\nsupermarket if it´s too dark or\n\n444\n00:26:58.668 --> 00:27:00.318\nif there´s not enough spaces.\n\n445\n00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:03.615\nAnd the same thing would be for\nan hospital emergency group.\n\n446\n00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:06.482\nThese are just things that\nkind of get you thinking.\n\n447\n00:27:06.482 --> 00:27:10.443\nIf you were a hospital emergency room,\nor you were a supermarket,\n\n448\n00:27:10.443 --> 00:27:13.005\nwhat are your Critical to Quality things?\n\n449\n00:27:13.005 --> 00:27:16.354\nAnd then if you're the professional\nmanaging a project there,\n\n450\n00:27:16.354 --> 00:27:20.385\nor even managing the entire institute,\nthat get you some clues about what you\n\n451\n00:27:20.385 --> 00:27:24.125\ncan do to make process improvement,\nmake sure your job goes smoothly.\n\n452\n00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:27.101\n>> Now, a lot of that originates with\nwhat they call, let me just see if I can,\n\n453\n00:27:27.101 --> 00:27:28.519\nI'm digging back into the little,\n\n454\n00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.573\nthe few terms that I have in\nthe back of my head here.\n\n455\n00:27:30.573 --> 00:27:31.733\nThe voice of the customer, right?\n\n456\n00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:32.361\nThe VOC?\n\n457\n00:27:32.361 --> 00:27:33.916\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n458\n00:27:33.916 --> 00:27:35.170\nAnd that's a good place to look.\n\n459\n00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:39.516\nThe voice of the customer's an absolutely\nexcellent place to look for your CTQ's.\n\n460\n00:27:39.516 --> 00:27:41.932\n>> Yeah, and\nwe can identify a lot of them on our own.\n\n461\n00:27:41.932 --> 00:27:44.774\nIf you you just sit there and\ndo your own research, but we have a saying\n\n462\n00:27:44.774 --> 00:27:47.724\nhere at the studio where sometimes\nwe look at things through blinders.\n\n463\n00:27:47.724 --> 00:27:50.396\nWe look at them the way that we see them.\n\n464\n00:27:50.396 --> 00:27:54.265\nYour customers might have\na very different view.\n\n465\n00:27:54.265 --> 00:27:57.142\nSo if you're not listening to your\ncustomer, you're gonna lose that customer,\n\n466\n00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:59.475\nand that's a big deal regardless\nof whether you're in a service or\n\n467\n00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:00.408\nproduct based industry.\n\n468\n00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:02.312\n>> Exactly.\n\n469\n00:28:02.312 --> 00:28:06.395\n>> All right,\nwell that's a pretty good run down on.\n\n470\n00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:07.060\nWell, we talked about waste.\n\n471\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.223\nWe talked about talk about defects,\nright, and\n\n472\n00:28:09.223 --> 00:28:12.295\neach of the different kind of variations\nof that and how they fall in.\n\n473\n00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:16.372\nI know we wanted to spend some time\non the different types of waste.\n\n474\n00:28:16.372 --> 00:28:16.895\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n475\n00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:20.290\nwe kind of ran out of time on this episode\nso we'll have to push that off to the next\n\n476\n00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.638\none, but be aware that in Lean that they\nget very detailed about the difference\n\n477\n00:28:23.638 --> 00:28:26.703\ntypes of waste that are out there, so\nwe wanna make sure we cover those.\n\n478\n00:28:26.703 --> 00:28:29.275\nStay tuned,\ncuz we'll do that in the next episode, but\n\n479\n00:28:29.275 --> 00:28:32.365\nbefore we wrap this one up do you\nhave anything else you want to add?\n\n480\n00:28:32.365 --> 00:28:37.335\n>> Just that in Lean Six Sigma, one of\nthe things that is promoted heavily is\n\n481\n00:28:37.335 --> 00:28:40.565\nthat you can no longer walk away and say,\nwell, I did what I was supposed to do.\n\n482\n00:28:40.565 --> 00:28:44.206\nLean Six Sigma says you have\nto look at everything 360, and\n\n483\n00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:47.916\nif there are people that play\ninto the success of your project,\n\n484\n00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:51.012\nyou need to understand their\nCTQs to be successful.\n\n485\n00:28:51.012 --> 00:28:53.319\n>> All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, this is a good spot for\n\n486\n00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:54.240\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n487\n00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.122\nStay tuned though, we've got more\nLean Six Sigma coming down the line.\n\n488\n00:28:58.122 --> 00:29:01.442\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n489\n00:29:01.442 --> 00:29:02.674\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern.\n\n490\n00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:07.735\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n491\n00:29:07.735 --> 00:29:10.549\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.114\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.793\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:24.704\nAnd, this is actually\nthe sequel to our last episode,\n\n6\n00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.121\nwhere we talked a bit about waste and\ndefect.\n\n7\n00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:31.272\nAnd this time we want to take a look\nat some of the very specific different\n\n8\n00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:33.077\ntypes of waste that are there.\n\n9\n00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:36.095\nAnd, here to help us,\nwe've go Doctor Stetn back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.718\nThanks for being with us, and\nwhere should we get started?\n\n11\n00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:42.566\n>> Well, I'd like to go ahead and\nstart with my Tim Woods slide,\n\n12\n00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.195\ncuz what we're gonna talk about\nis how to identify waste.\n\n13\n00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:49.213\nAnd I have some things that\nI'd like to say about that.\n\n14\n00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:53.820\nFirst, identifying waste,\nyou would never want to identify waste and\n\n15\n00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.757\nthen go right to your boss and\nsay, I've identified waste.\n\n16\n00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:00.880\nThis is just a place to get started.\n\n17\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.553\nYou might identify a waste\nthat's sensitive or political,\n\n18\n00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:07.484\nyou don't really know.\n\n19\n00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.072\nIt's just a place to get\nstarted about where to look,\n\n20\n00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.718\nso it truly is an identification tool.\n\n21\n00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.637\nWe had said in an earlier\nepisode that mistakes and\n\n22\n00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:21.081\ndefects are a little bit easier to reason\nout because a lot of times you can get\n\n23\n00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.458\neveryone to agree that it's a mistake.\n\n24\n00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:27.099\nSo the table is on fire,\neveryone's like, that's wrong and\n\n25\n00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:28.786\nthey wanna put the fire out.\n\n26\n00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:30.516\nBut waste is very subjective.\n\n27\n00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:33.458\nAnd what we had mentioned\nbefore was that at\n\n28\n00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:38.458\nsupermarkets sometimes we're waiting\nin line and we see that as waste.\n\n29\n00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:41.904\nBut the supermarket thinks maybe\nwe'll buy a few items, right?\n\n30\n00:01:41.904 --> 00:01:46.977\nSo it gets very challenging to identify\nwaste because waste is subjective.\n\n31\n00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:51.300\nAnd if you see the terms on your screen\nright now, transportation and inventory,\n\n32\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.499\nmotion, waiting, over production,\nover processing, defects and skills,\n\n33\n00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.980\nyou'll see that the first letters\nof those words spell Tim Woods.\n\n34\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.838\nNow, another thing that's really cool\nabout Lean Six Sigma is there's lots\n\n35\n00:02:04.838 --> 00:02:06.193\nof things like this.\n\n36\n00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:09.403\nThere's lots of structured brain\nstorming type exercises and\n\n37\n00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.592\nlots of things that actually spell words.\n\n38\n00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:14.328\nAnd the value of that is\nthat if we're in a meeting,\n\n39\n00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:16.119\nwe can remember it very quickly.\n\n40\n00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.555\nNow we're going to use Tim Woods\nto help us identify waste.\n\n41\n00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:23.162\nBut I would like to point out that\nTim Woods can also be used as\n\n42\n00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:24.910\na orientation tool.\n\n43\n00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.958\nI'm sure no one's been in\nthis situation before, but\n\n44\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.342\nsometimes you go to a new job and your\njust kind of parachuted into a situation.\n\n45\n00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:35.930\nAnd you don't really know where\nto start and you have to kinda,\n\n46\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.903\nself-oriented, is that right?\n\n47\n00:02:37.903 --> 00:02:38.728\nIs that the word?\n\n48\n00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.016\n>> Yeah, you learn on the job,\n\n49\n00:02:40.016 --> 00:02:41.096\nbasically, yeah\n>> And so\n\n50\n00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.291\nif you kind of think about\nthese categories, and\n\n51\n00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.716\nyou look through these categories and\nfind out as much information as you can\n\n52\n00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:50.220\nabout each one of these buckets,\nit's a fast way to notice what´s going on.\n\n53\n00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.230\nIt´s great for consulting, for those of\nyou who are in the consulting business,\n\n54\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.151\nespecially if you go to an industry\nyou know nothing about.\n\n55\n00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.852\nIf you go through these items, a lot of\ntimes you´ll be able to understand what´s\n\n56\n00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:03.362\ngoing on at that company.\n\n57\n00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:05.915\nSometimes, even better\nthan the other people.\n\n58\n00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:10.611\nIt´s also a mini problem-solving model,\nbecause if someone brings a problem to me,\n\n59\n00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:14.600\nI can go through this structured\nbrainstorming exercise and say, well,\n\n60\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.750\nhow does transportation contribute?\n\n61\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.596\nHow does inventory contribute?\n\n62\n00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:22.230\nBut again, we're going to use\nthe model to apply towards waste.\n\n63\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.917\nI just want everyone to remember that\nyou can use this model in a lot of\n\n64\n00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:26.896\ndifferent ways.\n\n65\n00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:30.901\nSo I wanna point out a few things before\nwe start doing some exercises and\n\n66\n00:03:30.901 --> 00:03:33.520\nkinda playing around\naround with the models.\n\n67\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.809\nTransportation in this case,\nmeans motorized.\n\n68\n00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.973\nNow, in some models when you\nsee the word transportation,\n\n69\n00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:41.627\nit could mean something else.\n\n70\n00:03:41.627 --> 00:03:46.000\nIn this particular model, transportation\nis just anything that´s motorized.\n\n71\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.930\nBut, motion,\nwhich is two words down, motion.\n\n72\n00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.580\nThat would be any physical movements.\n\n73\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.136\nSo, the difference between transportation\nand motion, is transportation is\n\n74\n00:03:56.136 --> 00:04:00.290\nmotorized and motion is like walking and\nbending and picking up things.\n\n75\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.587\nOne of the really wonderful things about\nstructured brainstorming exercises is you\n\n76\n00:04:04.587 --> 00:04:05.744\ncan't do them wrong.\n\n77\n00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:09.329\nThey're just a way to gather\nyour thoughts around,\n\n78\n00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.106\nso that you can quickly make decisions.\n\n79\n00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:17.053\nA lot of things in Lean Six Sigma assumes\nthat you've got more than one thing going\n\n80\n00:04:17.053 --> 00:04:18.084\non in your life.\n\n81\n00:04:18.084 --> 00:04:22.305\nAnd so, if someone throws something at\nyou, you can pull one of these models and\n\n82\n00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:26.222\ndo some structured brain storming and\nat least come up with some answers.\n\n83\n00:04:26.222 --> 00:04:29.380\nSo inventory,\nthat's anything to do with inventory.\n\n84\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.910\nWaiting is kind of intuitive,\nthat's obvious.\n\n85\n00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.506\nNow the difference is over production and\nover processing.\n\n86\n00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.938\nProduction means I made too much, and\n\n87\n00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:42.208\nprocessing means I've\ntouched it too many times.\n\n88\n00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:46.308\nSo I think we've all been in situations\nwhere there were too many hamburgers,\n\n89\n00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:47.061\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n90\n00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:51.647\nAnd so I don't want that hamburger\nbecause it's been sitting out too long.\n\n91\n00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:54.130\nI know you've been keeping it warm for\nme, but\n\n92\n00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.647\nthey might have produced too many\nhamburgers for the lunch hour.\n\n93\n00:04:57.647 --> 00:05:01.920\nOver processing could be something\nas simple as too many signatures.\n\n94\n00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.204\nFor example, if you're in\nthe medical device industry and\n\n95\n00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:08.685\nyou're trying to make a modification\nto your medical device,\n\n96\n00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:12.519\nthe FDA requires a certain amount\nof signatures on it, change form.\n\n97\n00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:16.618\nBut sometimes over the years, people's\nsignatures don't fall off, and you might\n\n98\n00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:20.788\nhave as many as 30 or 40 signatures on a\nchange order that really only needed four.\n\n99\n00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:23.608\nSo that document's been over processed.\n\n100\n00:05:23.608 --> 00:05:27.431\nI travel around the country a lot,\nand I often rent cars.\n\n101\n00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.924\nOne of the rental car places that I went\nto had a big customer service campaign,\n\n102\n00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:36.413\nand they wanted to take me out the car and\nshow me the trunk and show me the tires,\n\n103\n00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:37.795\nhow to put gas in my car.\n\n104\n00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:40.800\nAnd then when I left they were\nasking me how my experience was.\n\n105\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.554\nI was over processed, right?\n\n106\n00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:45.324\nSo, the difference\nbetween over production,\n\n107\n00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:50.170\nwe made too many, over processing,\nI've touched it too many times.\n\n108\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.656\nNow, defects is an interesting one\nbecause we said what we're trying to do,\n\n109\n00:05:54.656 --> 00:05:56.807\nis we're trying to identify waste.\n\n110\n00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.430\nAnd here's the word defects,\nit's like a sixth sigma thing, right?\n\n111\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.110\nAnd I'm trying to identify waste.\n\n112\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.815\nBut in this case, the lens I'm looking\nat is, if I had to do that over again,\n\n113\n00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:13.003\nso for example, if I made that mistake,\nwhat am I wasting in rework?\n\n114\n00:06:13.003 --> 00:06:15.009\nAnd so I'm looking at it from that lens.\n\n115\n00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.491\nAnd if you get there and\nyou identify a mistake or a defect,\n\n116\n00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.633\nit's not like that's a bad thing.\n\n117\n00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:23.503\nIt's just in this particular exercise,\n\n118\n00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:27.932\nI'm trying to look at what is wasted time,\nrework and defects.\n\n119\n00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:29.900\nAnd then finally, skills.\n\n120\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.914\nAnd skills can be anything\nthat you think about skills.\n\n121\n00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:38.339\nCross-training, someone's doing a job\nthat's maybe not up to their competency or\n\n122\n00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.220\ntheir payscale, that type of thing.\n\n123\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.340\nNow the words are meant to be general,\nbecause back to what I said earlier,\n\n124\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.070\nstructured brainstorming,\nyou can't really do it wrong, so\n\n125\n00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.558\nif you put something in\nthe wrong category, that's okay.\n\n126\n00:06:50.558 --> 00:06:54.063\nIt's just a way to quickly\ngather your thoughts.\n\n127\n00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:56.582\nSo I'd like to try to do\na couple of exercises.\n\n128\n00:06:56.582 --> 00:07:01.484\nMy next slide gives you a little bit more\ninformation about the different types\n\n129\n00:07:01.484 --> 00:07:02.160\nof waste.\n\n130\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.808\nSo if you get stuck and you're trying to\nthink about a particular area of waste,\n\n131\n00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:11.447\nand you can't think, well,\nwhat are some ideas?\n\n132\n00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:16.490\nThis slide helps and it is included\nas one of your collaterals on\n\n133\n00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.640\nyour lesson plan, both as a schematic and\nactually a template.\n\n134\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.771\nA lot of Lean Six Sigma tools were\nmeant to be paper and pencil tools,\n\n135\n00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:31.635\nbut they've sort of evolved into\nthese presentation tools, so\n\n136\n00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.898\nyou have templates for that on your files.\n\n137\n00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:42.020\nSo let's say for example, let's say\nI was the manager of a paint store.\n\n138\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.705\nAnd I was just a great manager and\nnow they've hired me for fast food.\n\n139\n00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:47.142\nAnd they didn't hire me for\n\n140\n00:07:47.142 --> 00:07:51.462\nmy knowledge of fast food cuz I've never\nworked in a fast food restaurant before.\n\n141\n00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:54.690\nThey hired me because I\nwas good problem solver.\n\n142\n00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.067\nI was a great Lean Six practitioner and\nnow they want me to come over and\n\n143\n00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:05.649\nmake the fast food restaurant better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n144\n00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:09.482\nSo the method I I'm gonna use first,\nbecause this is my low-lying fruit.\n\n145\n00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:13.267\nThis is the easiest place for me to start,\nif they don't know their problems.\n\n146\n00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:18.179\nI'm going to use a waste identification\nmodel, cuz if I can identify waste and\n\n147\n00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:21.381\nthen after that hopefully reduce or\neliminate it,\n\n148\n00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:25.560\nI will have a quick process improvement\nthat I can show right away.\n\n149\n00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.190\nAnd I can take this model and\napply to a simple project, but\n\n150\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.387\nI'm applying it to my whole\nfast food restaurant.\n\n151\n00:08:32.387 --> 00:08:38.783\nSo, at my fast food restaurant,\nI'm thinking about transportation.\n\n152\n00:08:38.783 --> 00:08:41.805\nSo when I'm thinking about transportation,\n\n153\n00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:46.143\nwhat are some things that could possibly,\nI don't know for sure,\n\n154\n00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:51.343\ncuz I'm just trying to get my thoughts\ntogether, could possibly be wasteful?\n\n155\n00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:52.527\nDon, do you have any ideas?\n\n156\n00:08:52.527 --> 00:08:55.591\n>> I can think of one right off the top of\nmy head, and I'm trying to think of global\n\n157\n00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.622\nscale here, cuz I'm sure there's\nsomething much smaller that would work.\n\n158\n00:08:58.622 --> 00:09:01.805\nBut Toyota just went through\nthis not too long ago,\n\n159\n00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:04.926\nwhere they would manufacture\ncars over in Japan.\n\n160\n00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:07.237\nAnd then they'd stick them\non giant freight liners.\n\n161\n00:09:07.237 --> 00:09:08.016\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n162\n00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:11.623\nthey would travel across the Pacific ocean\nto the United States to be sold over here.\n\n163\n00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:13.566\nSo when you bought a car\nhere in the United States,\n\n164\n00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:15.758\nit had actually been on a two\nmonth boat ride to get here.\n\n165\n00:09:15.758 --> 00:09:18.879\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so they said, wouldn't it be better\n\n166\n00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:22.870\nif we just manufactured those cars in\nthe United States, and then that way, when\n\n167\n00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.765\nsomebody wants to buy a car, it actually\ncame from the factory that was there.\n\n168\n00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:29.464\nAnd kind of eliminated that\ntwo month boat ride and\n\n169\n00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:32.556\nthat was evaluated as basically\na type of waste for them.\n\n170\n00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:35.458\nThey were wasting two months from\nmanufacturing a vehicle to selling it.\n\n171\n00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:38.518\nAnd I know what you're probably\nthinking is, it's not really waste,\n\n172\n00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:41.785\nthey made a car, they sold a car, who\ncares if it was on a boat for two months?\n\n173\n00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:47.735\nBut for two months, they had money tied up\nin that vehicle that is stuck in transit,\n\n174\n00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:50.119\nthey can't do anything with it.\n\n175\n00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:52.679\nAnd then once it gets here\nashore then they can sell it and\n\n176\n00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:53.939\nthey get their money back.\n\n177\n00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:57.224\nBy manufacturing it here in the US,\nthey can sell it that much faster,\n\n178\n00:09:57.224 --> 00:10:00.396\nwhich meant they didn't have to\nleave money sitting in inventory,\n\n179\n00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:01.915\nthat they could get it back out.\n\n180\n00:10:01.915 --> 00:10:02.518\n>> That's perfect.\n\n181\n00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:07.703\nAnd the same thing happens if you were\nworking in a fast food restaurant,\n\n182\n00:10:07.703 --> 00:10:10.934\na lot of those containers\nare made overseas.\n\n183\n00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:14.040\nThe styrofoam,\nI don't we use styrofoam anymore, but\n\n184\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.355\nthere's a lot of things like that,\nthat are transported.\n\n185\n00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:22.138\nWe could probably find a local\nsupplier and use them here, right?\n\n186\n00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:24.883\nAnd some other transportation things,\n\n187\n00:10:24.883 --> 00:10:30.380\nif you are thinking about a fast food\nrestaurant, maybe a drive-thru, right?\n\n188\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.179\nI mean that's transportation?\n\n189\n00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:36.556\n>> It is, yeah,\nversus people coming inside the building.\n\n190\n00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:41.653\nAnd in that standpoint I kind of look at\nit and think, well, who's waste is that?\n\n191\n00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:43.417\nIs it waste for the restaurant?\n\n192\n00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:47.097\nDo they necessarily care whether you come\ninside or come through the drive through?\n\n193\n00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:49.593\nOr is it waste for the customer?\n\n194\n00:10:49.593 --> 00:10:52.298\nIt's kind of a tough one to measure.\n\n195\n00:10:52.298 --> 00:10:54.596\nIn a way you can see\nwhere they both waste.\n\n196\n00:10:54.596 --> 00:11:01.992\nYeah, anytime you have that, not just\nmoving piece but actual transportation.\n\n197\n00:11:01.992 --> 00:11:04.870\nI'm trying to think of other examples\nthat are on a smaller scale.\n\n198\n00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:10.168\n>> Yeah, well let's go ahead and just move\nto inventory, because the idea is that\n\n199\n00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:15.249\nthese categories aren't going to apply\nto every project or to every place.\n\n200\n00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:19.231\nIt's just kind of a rundown list, and\nyou don't really have to do them in order.\n\n201\n00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:23.260\nTim Woods is just a way so that you\ndon't forget the different categories.\n\n202\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.247\nAnd I think we can probably think of a lot\nof things inventory-wise in fast food,\n\n203\n00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:34.632\nlike storage, and anything that's\nrelated to inventory in fast food.\n\n204\n00:11:34.632 --> 00:11:37.790\n>> Yeah,\nanytime you sell a product, right?\n\n205\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.646\nInventory equals liability.\n\n206\n00:11:40.646 --> 00:11:42.035\n>> Exactly.\n\n207\n00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.665\n>> Especially if it's like fast food,\nwhere you've got a consumable or\n\n208\n00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:46.335\na perishable, right?\n\n209\n00:11:46.335 --> 00:11:50.343\nWhere, if you sell apples,\nhow long is that apple good for?\n\n210\n00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:51.167\n>> Exactly.\n\n211\n00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:51.862\n>> It's gonna go bad.\n\n212\n00:11:51.862 --> 00:11:55.240\nI actually don't know how long,\nlets just say it's two weeks, right?\n\n213\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.098\n>> Mm-hm.\nThey probably pump it full of chemicals\n\n214\n00:11:57.098 --> 00:11:59.304\nnow, it'll last for a year,\nbut lets say it's two weeks.\n\n215\n00:11:59.304 --> 00:12:01.083\nWhen you have that apple,\nyou have two weeks to sell it.\n\n216\n00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:02.044\n>> Exactly.\n\n217\n00:12:02.044 --> 00:12:05.891\n>> And if it doesn't sell at the end of\ntwo weeks, you just made your own waste.\n\n218\n00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.729\nSo you want to make sure you don't\nhave anymore inventory than you\n\n219\n00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:09.668\nabsolutely have to.\n\n220\n00:12:09.668 --> 00:12:11.967\nBut, what's the flip side of that coin?\n\n221\n00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:15.579\nIf I don't have enough inventory,\nand customers start coming in and\n\n222\n00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:17.390\nthey want apples and I'm all out.\n\n223\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.071\nI just kinda hurt my customer experience.\n\n224\n00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:19.605\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n225\n00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:20.881\nYeah, exactly.\n\n226\n00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:23.404\nAnd so I already,\nif I started a new job or\n\n227\n00:12:23.404 --> 00:12:26.161\neven if I were in\nthe interviewing process.\n\n228\n00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:30.285\nAnd my boss at this point would say\nthere are just things that are wrong,\n\n229\n00:12:30.285 --> 00:12:32.500\nI don't even know how you can help me.\n\n230\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.101\nI already have a couple ideas.\n\n231\n00:12:35.101 --> 00:12:37.376\nSo I can field those ideas too.\n\n232\n00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:38.583\nSo if they say where\nare you going to start?\n\n233\n00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:39.674\nWhat's you first step?\n\n234\n00:12:39.674 --> 00:12:43.250\nAlready just doing the T and\nthe I at my fast food restaurant.\n\n235\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.237\nI can say, I can look at things that\nwe're making outside this country and\n\n236\n00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:51.567\nthe transportation costs to get them here\nand maybe I can supply a local vendor.\n\n237\n00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:55.559\nAnd I want to look at our inventory,\nour inventory cost and\n\n238\n00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:58.310\nour turnover and that type of thing.\n\n239\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.905\nSo another great thing about these\nstructured brainstorming things is\n\n240\n00:13:02.905 --> 00:13:07.417\nthat you literally, in just a few minutes,\ncan go back to your desk and\n\n241\n00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:11.566\ncome up with some kinda plan that\nseems very seamless, I think.\n\n242\n00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:18.643\nSo motion in fast food there's some things\nabout motion that could be wasteful.\n\n243\n00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:21.452\nWe don't know for sure because\nit's just an identification model.\n\n244\n00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:24.029\nBut what are some things in fast\nfood that might be wasteful?\n\n245\n00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:27.750\n>> There is a quirky little fast food\nrestaurant on the other side of town,\n\n246\n00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.356\nit's the oldest restaurant in Gainesville,\nand\n\n247\n00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:33.690\nit's really bizarre because\nthere's two buildings.\n\n248\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.602\nThere's one building that has\nthe drive thru that you pull up to and\n\n249\n00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:39.363\nthe people and even the cooks\nare right there in that building.\n\n250\n00:13:39.363 --> 00:13:43.470\nAnd then there's a second building, which\nis where they have all of their buns and\n\n251\n00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.611\ncoolers and all that.\n\n252\n00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:46.929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when they're making a hamburger or\n\n253\n00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:49.808\na sandwich, when they run out\nof bread in the main building,\n\n254\n00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:53.549\nsomebody's gotta run over to the other\nbuilding to get more and bring it back.\n\n255\n00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:58.473\nAnd it's not far away,\nit's maybe 20 yards, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:58.473 --> 00:14:03.980\nSo not very far, or maybe 30 meters for\nour metric users out there.\n\n257\n00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.633\nSo it's not too terribly far away.\n\n258\n00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.386\nBut somebody's actually got to physically\nexit the building and go there and\n\n259\n00:14:09.386 --> 00:14:09.973\ncome back.\n\n260\n00:14:09.973 --> 00:14:11.667\nWhat if that was just one building?\n\n261\n00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.630\n>> Exactly.\n>> What if it was right there,\n\n262\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.130\nminimize the motions.\n\n263\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.452\n>> Exactly,\nit's something that you could look in to.\n\n264\n00:14:15.452 --> 00:14:20.381\nAnd what's so great about Don's\nexample is that there's something that\n\n265\n00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:23.251\ncould fit in the motion and the inventory.\n\n266\n00:14:23.251 --> 00:14:27.939\nAnd in structured brainstorming, if you\nsee something that's fitting in more than\n\n267\n00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:31.646\none category, it prioritizes what\nit is you should be looking at.\n\n268\n00:14:31.646 --> 00:14:35.848\nSo another goal of structured\nbrainstorming is when you see things just\n\n269\n00:14:35.848 --> 00:14:38.159\npop up, each one of those categories,\n\n270\n00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:42.095\nyou don't even have to think about\nwhat am I going to look at first.\n\n271\n00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:43.628\n>> Motion is one of my favorites.\n\n272\n00:14:43.628 --> 00:14:46.660\nThose of you that have watched a lot\nof ITProTV, if you watch it live,\n\n273\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.217\nyou might have seen me in the morning say\nsomething like, All right guys, we're\n\n274\n00:14:50.217 --> 00:14:53.913\nready to shoot, but I need to get my notes\noff of the printer and I'll be right back.\n\n275\n00:14:53.913 --> 00:14:56.691\nThen I disappear for 15 minutes,\nand then I come back, and\n\n276\n00:14:56.691 --> 00:14:59.864\nthey're like why'd it take him 15\nminutes notes off of a printer.\n\n277\n00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:03.581\nAnd that's how it was up until a few weeks\nago cuz our printer was on the other\n\n278\n00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:04.711\nside of the building.\n\n279\n00:15:04.711 --> 00:15:06.106\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'd get side tracked on\n\n280\n00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:06.859\nthe way there.\n\n281\n00:15:06.859 --> 00:15:11.945\nSo we bought another printer which cost,\nI don't know, $200 or $300 for a printer.\n\n282\n00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.309\nThat's an expense, it doesn't sound good,\n\n283\n00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.681\nbut it's right outside\nthe studio doors now.\n\n284\n00:15:16.681 --> 00:15:20.073\nSo when I say, I'm gonna get my notes,\nI just step right over there and grab it,\n\n285\n00:15:20.073 --> 00:15:21.249\nand I'm right back again.\n\n286\n00:15:21.249 --> 00:15:24.694\nIt made our whole process more\nefficient in the morning, and so\n\n287\n00:15:24.694 --> 00:15:28.084\nwaste in terms of money versus\nwaste in terms of time, right?\n\n288\n00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:31.061\nI waste less time going to\nget stuff off the printer.\n\n289\n00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:32.803\n>> Absolutely.\n\n290\n00:15:32.803 --> 00:15:37.077\nAnd it's, yeah, it's really kinda\ninteresting how fast that can happen,\n\n291\n00:15:37.077 --> 00:15:41.285\nwhen you know the problem, and you can\ngrab some of that low-lying fruit and\n\n292\n00:15:41.285 --> 00:15:42.820\nfix something right away.\n\n293\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.652\nCertainly, you can take Lean Six Sigma and\nwork through some very extensive\n\n294\n00:15:47.652 --> 00:15:52.200\nmodels to make a large project better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n295\n00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.840\nBut you can build credibility as a Lean\nSix Sigma professional by thinking little\n\n296\n00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.136\nthings such as the printer.\n\n297\n00:15:57.136 --> 00:15:59.133\nIt's an instant fix then.\n\n298\n00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:01.989\nIt didn't take a project and\nit didn't take a lot of meetings, right?\n\n299\n00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:04.078\n>> Right, but maybe one or two.\n\n300\n00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:07.444\nYou gotta pick the printer and\nall that, so there's a bit of work.\n\n301\n00:16:07.444 --> 00:16:09.185\nProbably more than there should have been.\n\n302\n00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:09.999\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so waiting.\n\n303\n00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:13.482\nWe're probably all familiar\nwith that in fast food.\n\n304\n00:16:13.482 --> 00:16:17.360\nI have some examples about waiting\nthat I might want to study.\n\n305\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.613\n>> This is one that kinda\nfrustrates me because,\n\n306\n00:16:19.613 --> 00:16:21.761\nwe'll see if this has\never happened to you.\n\n307\n00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:25.302\nHave you ever pulled up to the drive-thru\nwindow, and you pay them and\n\n308\n00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:29.143\nthey give you your drink and then they\nsay, could you please pull forward and\n\n309\n00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:31.207\nwe'll bring your food out to you right?\n\n310\n00:16:31.207 --> 00:16:33.689\nThat's the indicator that\nyour foods not ready,\n\n311\n00:16:33.689 --> 00:16:37.661\nit's gonna take longer than it should,\nand they're having you pull forward.\n\n312\n00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:39.486\nNot usually cuz they care\nabout the people behind you,\n\n313\n00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:42.154\ncuz sometimes they'll have you pull\nforward when there's nobody behind you.\n\n314\n00:16:42.154 --> 00:16:45.347\nBut because they've got a sensor on\nthat drive-through that's measuring how\n\n315\n00:16:45.347 --> 00:16:47.297\nlong each person stays in there so\nthey know, and\n\n316\n00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:49.840\nby having you pull forward it gets\nyou out of that sensor range.\n\n317\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.062\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when they do that,\n\n318\n00:16:52.062 --> 00:16:55.088\nit's kinda like self-defeating\ntheir own measurement.\n\n319\n00:16:55.088 --> 00:16:58.642\nBut that's the customer waits,\nwhich hurts, but\n\n320\n00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.794\nthere's times the employee's wait, too.\n\n321\n00:17:01.794 --> 00:17:05.477\nIf you have to cook a hamburger it\ntakes a certain amount of time.\n\n322\n00:17:05.477 --> 00:17:08.704\nAnd what are you doing\nwhile that hamburger cooks?\n\n323\n00:17:08.704 --> 00:17:10.563\nStanding there watching it right?\n\n324\n00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:14.468\nSo if there's a way that you can\nspeed up that cooking process,\n\n325\n00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:18.092\nthen that's going to improve\nyour employee efficiency.\n\n326\n00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:19.508\n>> Exactly.\n\n327\n00:17:19.508 --> 00:17:23.477\nYeah, you think lots of\ndifferent industries waiting and\n\n328\n00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:28.264\nthese days there's another fast\nfood place right across the street.\n\n329\n00:17:28.264 --> 00:17:31.537\nIf the lines too long,\nyou're just going to go.\n\n330\n00:17:31.537 --> 00:17:32.907\n>> Your just going to go somewhere else.\n\n331\n00:17:32.907 --> 00:17:36.637\n>> I have an IT background and the joke\nI always make on the show is I spent at\n\n332\n00:17:36.637 --> 00:17:40.451\nleast half my career watching a status\nbar crawling across the screen.\n\n333\n00:17:40.451 --> 00:17:44.027\nYour software install is 40% done,\n50% done.\n\n334\n00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:47.137\nThat's waiting and\nwhat can I do while it's installing?\n\n335\n00:17:47.137 --> 00:17:48.902\nOften times nothing.\n\n336\n00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.852\nPlaying a game on your cellphone or\nsomething and you're just wasting time.\n\n337\n00:17:51.852 --> 00:17:56.359\nAnd if there was a way to that we can make\nthat more efficient like pre-deploying\n\n338\n00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:01.002\nthe software or staging software to roll\nout, that can minimize that wait time and\n\n339\n00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:02.498\nmake you more efficient.\n\n340\n00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:06.340\n>> Okay, and so we're gonna talk about\nover production, over processing.\n\n341\n00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.830\nThere's a reminder, production made too\nmany processing touched it too much.\n\n342\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.385\nSo can you think of, Don, any like, we did\nmention one, like maybe I have too many\n\n343\n00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:18.502\nhamburgers out, cuz I thought I was\ngonna have a lunch rush and I didn't.\n\n344\n00:18:18.502 --> 00:18:21.940\nBut can you think of any\nother over-production issues?\n\n345\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.829\n>> You could have, well,\nthere's some types of environments\n\n346\n00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:29.961\nwhere they've gotta train up\nemployees to provide a position.\n\n347\n00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:33.522\nSo a lot of companies have what's called\na pipeline, and fast food is like this.\n\n348\n00:18:33.522 --> 00:18:35.089\nFast food has a lot of turnover, so\n\n349\n00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:38.132\nthey know their employees don't\ntypically stay there very long.\n\n350\n00:18:38.132 --> 00:18:41.266\nSo they're always training the next\nemployees to be ready to take their place.\n\n351\n00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:45.980\nWell, what if you have a group of\nemployees that happens to stick around?\n\n352\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.460\nRight?\nIt's a good group of employees.\n\n353\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.540\nAnd you've got replacements on the way,\nand others are staying there, and\n\n354\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.480\nnow you've produced too many employees,\nand\n\n355\n00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.690\nyou've got an all new type\nof problem to deal with.\n\n356\n00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.799\nSo, I think the idea of getting ready for\n\n357\n00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.230\na lunch rush is a great\nexample of what you see.\n\n358\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.716\nGetting ready for a holiday season?\n\n359\n00:19:02.716 --> 00:19:05.975\nExpecting an overly strong holiday\nseason when it doesn't happen,\n\n360\n00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:08.180\nthose are great examples\nof overproduction.\n\n361\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.045\n>> I live in a mountain community and\nwhen Valentine's Day,\n\n362\n00:19:13.045 --> 00:19:18.817\nour supermarket bought a ton of lobsters,\nand they just kinda died.\n\n363\n00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:21.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was very sad.\n\n364\n00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.958\nSo over-processing, and remember,\n\n365\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.850\nover-processing is that\nI touched it too much.\n\n366\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.580\n>> The first thing that\npopped into my mind when you\n\n367\n00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.640\nmentioned over-processing was scrambled\neggs Have you ever made scrambled eggs?\n\n368\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.358\nAnd the idea is that as you cook them and\nyou're supposed to break the eggs a little\n\n369\n00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:39.211\nbit and kinda flip them around\na little bit and scramble them.\n\n370\n00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:42.276\nIf you mess around with them too\nmuch what do you end up with?\n\n371\n00:19:42.276 --> 00:19:43.878\nMush it's not good.\n\n372\n00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:46.710\n>> Exactly.\n\n373\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:53.517\nOver processing could definitely apply to\njust the way we're doing food prep, right?\n\n374\n00:19:53.517 --> 00:19:57.103\nAlso, sometimes those two\nwindows at a fast food place,\n\n375\n00:19:57.103 --> 00:19:59.277\nwhich also does transportation.\n\n376\n00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:03.200\nSometimes that's overprocessing.\n\n377\n00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.316\nWhat about defects?\n\n378\n00:20:04.316 --> 00:20:07.131\nWhen we're thinking about\ndefects at fast food,\n\n379\n00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:10.040\nwhat is some of the things\nthat come to mind?\n\n380\n00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.812\n>> Well, the number one one,\nthey get your order wrong.\n\n381\n00:20:11.812 --> 00:20:13.416\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you ordered these items,\n\n382\n00:20:13.416 --> 00:20:17.176\nyou open up that bag, and that's not what\nyou just got, you're missing components.\n\n383\n00:20:17.176 --> 00:20:17.895\n>> Right.\n\n384\n00:20:17.895 --> 00:20:21.981\nAnd in the health laws,\nat least in Colorado where I'm from.\n\n385\n00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:25.000\nThe health laws say that I\nhave to throw that away.\n\n386\n00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.019\nI can't even serve it to another customer,\nand\n\n387\n00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:28.971\nI'm sure some employees take it home-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n388\n00:20:28.971 --> 00:20:30.597\n>> But you're not really supposed to.\n\n389\n00:20:30.597 --> 00:20:32.476\nSo I've got waste on two.\n\n390\n00:20:32.476 --> 00:20:35.704\nI have to remake it and\nI'm throwing away product, right?\n\n391\n00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:37.808\n>> Absolutely\n>> And so skills,\n\n392\n00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:43.631\nwhen I'm looking at skills for my fast\nfood restaurant and areas of waste.\n\n393\n00:20:43.631 --> 00:20:48.358\nOne that comes to my mind is that when\nyou have the manager who's being paid\n\n394\n00:20:48.358 --> 00:20:51.944\nmore then let's say the person\nmaking the hamburgers or\n\n395\n00:20:51.944 --> 00:20:55.239\nthe cashier you have\nthe manager checking you out.\n\n396\n00:20:55.239 --> 00:20:58.845\nYou see that a lot at big box stores\nin the pharmacy where the pharmacist is\n\n397\n00:20:58.845 --> 00:21:01.329\nchecking you out instead\nof the pharmacy clerk and\n\n398\n00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:04.730\nthat's probably pretty\nwasteful of their skills.\n\n399\n00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.301\n>> Yeah, you know what?\n\n400\n00:21:05.301 --> 00:21:08.232\nWe've always had a saying\nits an IT saying, but\n\n401\n00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:10.586\nI just have I don't know why it works.\n\n402\n00:21:10.586 --> 00:21:13.488\nWe always say let the brain\nsurgeons do brain surgery, right?\n\n403\n00:21:13.488 --> 00:21:15.060\n>> Yeah.\n\n404\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.804\n>> If I got a cut on my leg, I bet\na brain surgeon could patch me up, but\n\n405\n00:21:18.804 --> 00:21:22.889\nthey could be doing things that are so\nmuch more difficult than that, so\n\n406\n00:21:22.889 --> 00:21:25.157\nyou're kinda wasting that resource.\n\n407\n00:21:25.157 --> 00:21:26.783\nBut the opposite is true also.\n\n408\n00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:29.384\nYou don't want somebody who's unskilled,\nso you mentioned a cashier.\n\n409\n00:21:29.384 --> 00:21:30.544\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n410\n00:21:30.544 --> 00:21:34.328\n>> If you're gonna be a cashier you need\nto be able to do some basic math to give\n\n411\n00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:36.097\nout the proper amount of change and\n\n412\n00:21:36.097 --> 00:21:38.740\nnot end up short-changed\nat the end of your shift.\n\n413\n00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.568\nSo that's an equally important one.\n\n414\n00:21:39.568 --> 00:21:43.211\nSo you gotta make sure that people\nare kinda balanced for the right job,\n\n415\n00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:44.580\nthat people are-\n>> Exactly.\n\n416\n00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.890\n>> Fit for purpose, that's a warranty\nterm, but you get the idea.\n\n417\n00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:48.843\n>> Exactly.\n\n418\n00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:52.652\nWell, Lean Six Sigma has a number of\nexercises that are similar to this,\n\n419\n00:21:52.652 --> 00:21:55.035\nthey are called Structured Brainstorming.\n\n420\n00:21:55.035 --> 00:21:59.321\nAnd I just want to take a step back and\nsay that in regular brainstorming,\n\n421\n00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:01.231\nwe have an empty piece of paper.\n\n422\n00:22:01.231 --> 00:22:04.589\nAnd if we get too many ideas\non the empty piece of paper,\n\n423\n00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:08.171\nthe next step is to do something\ncalled Infinity diagram.\n\n424\n00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:12.248\nIn an infinity diagram, we try to take\nall those ideas on a piece of paper and\n\n425\n00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:14.030\nput them into categories.\n\n426\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.830\nSo structured brainstorming\nsort of starts backwards.\n\n427\n00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.860\nIt says hey lets start with the word.\n\n428\n00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.650\nAnd some people, when they're working with\nstructured brainstorming, at least some\n\n429\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.650\nof my students from time to time say,\nwell it's not enough information,\n\n430\n00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.470\nit's just a word, but it's supposed to\nkey those critical thinking skills.\n\n431\n00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.960\nLots of structured brainstorming\ntype exercises and\n\n432\n00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.061\nLean Six Sigma for two reasons.\n\n433\n00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:37.223\nOne to get your brain going,\nlike I just said, but\n\n434\n00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:40.120\ntwo just to kind of help you remember\nwhen you get into a situation.\n\n435\n00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.073\nThese are good meeting management tools\nbecause sometimes the meeting goes off\n\n436\n00:22:44.073 --> 00:22:47.849\ntarget, and you can pull one of these\ntools and start talking to people, and\n\n437\n00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:51.861\nif they've already addressed, they might\nnot be calling it these words, but if\n\n438\n00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:56.168\nthey've already addressed transportation\nand over-production issues, you might\n\n439\n00:22:56.168 --> 00:23:00.259\naddress an in between Inventory issue,\nbecause you've written down Tim Woods.\n\n440\n00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:03.966\nAnd finally the other thing I'd like to\nsay about structure brainstorming and\n\n441\n00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:05.313\nthe tools in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n442\n00:23:05.313 --> 00:23:08.586\nis that you can take these tools and\napply them to your personal life.\n\n443\n00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:13.743\nSo say for example Tim Woods, if I were\ntrying to identify waste in my own home,\n\n444\n00:23:13.743 --> 00:23:18.295\nand I want to make my home better,\nfaster, and more cost effective.\n\n445\n00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:22.489\nI just want to quickly go through here and\nthink about, if I apply Tim Woods to my\n\n446\n00:23:22.489 --> 00:23:26.257\nhome, what are some of the transportation\nissues around your house?\n\n447\n00:23:26.257 --> 00:23:27.842\nDo you have just anything?\n\n448\n00:23:27.842 --> 00:23:32.057\n>> Well, so for my family just\nlike a lot of families out there,\n\n449\n00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:37.595\nI've got two kids and my wife and I have\nto structure taking the kids to school and\n\n450\n00:23:37.595 --> 00:23:42.075\ngoing to work and balancing that\nout in as few trips as possible.\n\n451\n00:23:42.075 --> 00:23:46.142\nBecause, I could take the kids to school,\ncome home, then go to work, and\n\n452\n00:23:46.142 --> 00:23:50.665\nnow you're talking multiple trips or you\ncould say, all right, well, going to my\n\n453\n00:23:50.665 --> 00:23:54.670\noffice takes me closer to the school\nthan my wife, and so it makes sense for\n\n454\n00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.080\nme to drop the kids off since it's kind\nof on my way, to make it more efficient.\n\n455\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.410\n>> Exactly, and it's just taking\nthe time to consider that type of stuff.\n\n456\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.314\nI think I mentioned in another episode,\nwe live in a very reactive society,\n\n457\n00:24:06.314 --> 00:24:08.333\nand we don't take a step back to think.\n\n458\n00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:12.177\nSo I'm gonna take Tim Woods and, yeah,\nI'm gonna apply it to my project or\n\n459\n00:24:12.177 --> 00:24:14.621\nto my business or\nto someone else's business,\n\n460\n00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:18.859\nbut I could also apply it to my home and\nwhen I'm looking at things like inventory.\n\n461\n00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:22.596\nAnd keep in mind, the whole idea is\nthat I wanna make things better, faster,\n\n462\n00:24:22.596 --> 00:24:24.090\nmore cost effective.\n\n463\n00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.913\nI'm using waste identification for\nthe purposes of hopefully reducing or\n\n464\n00:24:27.913 --> 00:24:31.625\neliminating to get things to be better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n465\n00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:35.281\nWhat are some inventory things around your\nhouse that could be, we're not saying for\n\n466\n00:24:35.281 --> 00:24:38.100\nsure, we're just saying, hey,\nthese are things to consider.\n\n467\n00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.080\nThese are things to have family\ndiscussions about, for example.\n\n468\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.615\nSo what are some inventory things that\nyou can think about at your home?\n\n469\n00:24:44.615 --> 00:24:49.172\n>> So, I know it varies by region, but\nmost places these days have the big,\n\n470\n00:24:49.172 --> 00:24:53.436\nmembership based warehouse places\nlike the Costco or Sam's Club or\n\n471\n00:24:53.436 --> 00:24:56.381\nwhatever, what do you\nguys have in Colorado?\n\n472\n00:24:56.381 --> 00:24:56.898\n>> Yeah, same thing.\n\n473\n00:24:56.898 --> 00:24:57.740\n>> Okay, same thing.\n\n474\n00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.058\nSo you can go there, and\nboy they will have a deal on ketchup.\n\n475\n00:25:02.058 --> 00:25:07.638\nI can get just eight gallons of ketchup\nfor the price of four gallons of ketchup.\n\n476\n00:25:07.638 --> 00:25:08.296\n>> Exactly.\n\n477\n00:25:08.296 --> 00:25:09.976\n>> And you look at that,\nand that's a deal.\n\n478\n00:25:09.976 --> 00:25:11.455\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's 50% off, but\n\n479\n00:25:11.455 --> 00:25:14.402\nat the same time I don't even\nneed one gallon of ketchup.\n\n480\n00:25:14.402 --> 00:25:15.992\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Better yet eight.\n\n481\n00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:20.725\nSo a lot of times we'll end up purchasing\nmore stuff than we need just cuz we think\n\n482\n00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:25.388\nwe're getting a good deal, and at the end\nof the day you end up having way more of\n\n483\n00:25:25.388 --> 00:25:29.275\nthis item in inventory than you\never needed in the first place, so\n\n484\n00:25:29.275 --> 00:25:31.001\nthat's kind of an example.\n\n485\n00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:34.739\n>> There's a lot of times that we're\ntricked, well I shouldn't say tricked,\n\n486\n00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:38.533\na lot of times that we're mislead by this\nproduct and get the second product off\n\n487\n00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:42.560\nhalf-priced, and we know that the first\nproduct's maybe a little overpriced and\n\n488\n00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.905\nwe don't need two of that.\n\n489\n00:25:43.905 --> 00:25:44.425\nJust like you said.\n\n490\n00:25:44.425 --> 00:25:46.234\n>> Absolutely.\n\n491\n00:25:46.234 --> 00:25:47.540\nAnd it happens all too often.\n\n492\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.148\nWe buy too much of something and\nwe buy things that we don't need.\n\n493\n00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:54.174\nThen we have them in inventory, and\nif they've got an expiration date,\n\n494\n00:25:54.174 --> 00:25:57.144\nI know once a year we clean\nout the medicine cabinet and\n\n495\n00:25:57.144 --> 00:25:59.910\nthrow out all sorts of\nstuff that's expired.\n\n496\n00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.004\nAnd it's sad because medicine is so\nexpensive.\n\n497\n00:26:02.004 --> 00:26:04.057\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> But that happens.\n\n498\n00:26:04.057 --> 00:26:08.737\n>> And so when you think about motion,\nI was just thinking one of the things,\n\n499\n00:26:08.737 --> 00:26:10.170\nfavors, that I did for\n\n500\n00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:14.421\nmyself is that I have a gymnasium\ndownstairs in my mountain house.\n\n501\n00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:17.903\nAnd it's really cold there in the winter,\nand I have to to really kind of way\n\n502\n00:26:17.903 --> 00:26:20.518\ntalk myself in to going down\nthere to use the treadmill.\n\n503\n00:26:20.518 --> 00:26:23.882\nSo I moved it up in to my office and\nmade a standing desk and so\n\n504\n00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:27.044\nI think that motion was really,\njust thinking about,\n\n505\n00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:31.513\nI'm wasting time because first I'm\ndreading it, and then I'm having to put\n\n506\n00:26:31.513 --> 00:26:35.877\non all those heavy clothes, and\nthen I'm having to go down there, right?\n\n507\n00:26:35.877 --> 00:26:41.237\nSo, one way that I eliminated some\nwaste and I think I'm more productive.\n\n508\n00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:43.605\nDo you have any motion things\nthat happens in your house?\n\n509\n00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:45.756\n>> Yeah, I'm having a hard\ntime thinking of that one.\n\n510\n00:26:45.756 --> 00:26:47.669\nI know-\n>> I guess that's a weird one.\n\n511\n00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:49.207\nIts like where things are placed.\n\n512\n00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:54.087\nAnd then two, motion is kind of\nthe because one of the things I try\n\n513\n00:26:54.087 --> 00:26:56.968\nto do is I try to get\nfive miles in every day.\n\n514\n00:26:56.968 --> 00:27:00.580\nSo sometimes on purpose\nI'm walking around, right?\n\n515\n00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.969\nBut motion a lot of times when\nwe're thinking about our houses,\n\n516\n00:27:03.969 --> 00:27:05.548\nare where things are placed.\n\n517\n00:27:05.548 --> 00:27:08.567\nSo when you think about motion,\nkind of think of it even bigger.\n\n518\n00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:12.743\nAre the things in the garage I use most\nof the time easy for me to get to or\n\n519\n00:27:12.743 --> 00:27:16.142\nhave I put them behind things\nthat I have to move around?\n\n520\n00:27:16.142 --> 00:27:18.795\nSo, motion kind of can encompass that.\n\n521\n00:27:18.795 --> 00:27:21.163\nDo I have to go in to the other\nroom to answer the phone?\n\n522\n00:27:21.163 --> 00:27:21.865\nThat type of thing.\n\n523\n00:27:21.865 --> 00:27:23.217\nOkay, so waiting.\n\n524\n00:27:23.217 --> 00:27:27.126\nWhat are some things at home\nthat you're waiting for?\n\n525\n00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:29.373\n>> I know, in our home,\nwe have two bathrooms,\n\n526\n00:27:29.373 --> 00:27:32.271\nand you'd think that'd be enough but\nit just isn't, and\n\n527\n00:27:32.271 --> 00:27:36.143\nso sometimes the bathrooms are full and\nyou gotta wait to get into a bathroom.\n\n528\n00:27:36.143 --> 00:27:37.635\nIf we just had one more.\n\n529\n00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:38.223\nI don't think you ever have\n\n530\n00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:38.761\nenough bathrooms-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n531\n00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:39.774\n>> Unless you have one for\n\n532\n00:27:39.774 --> 00:27:40.951\neach person in the house.\n\n533\n00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:43.557\nI know that's one example for us waiting.\n\n534\n00:27:43.557 --> 00:27:46.667\nOr if I'm taking the kids to school,\nI might be ready to go, but\n\n535\n00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:50.192\nthe kids are still getting ready for\nschool, or vice versa, they might\n\n536\n00:27:50.192 --> 00:27:54.111\nbe ready to go and I'm still getting\nready, so we end up waiting on each other.\n\n537\n00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:58.389\n>> We do a lot of waiting in the mountains\nfor contractors to fix qindows, and\n\n538\n00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:59.012\ndo cable.\n\n539\n00:27:59.012 --> 00:28:01.299\nI mean, sometimes you have\nto take the whole day off.\n\n540\n00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:05.061\n>> Isn't that awesome when they say we'll\nbe at your house sometime between noon\n\n541\n00:28:05.061 --> 00:28:05.577\nand 4 PM.\n\n542\n00:28:05.577 --> 00:28:06.520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n543\n00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.921\nIt makes me crazy.\n\n544\n00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:09.088\nOkay so overproduction,\n\n545\n00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:12.008\nwhat's something at your house\nthat maybe you produce too much.\n\n546\n00:28:12.008 --> 00:28:18.020\nI know food, I'm originally from Texas and\nso I have a party and\n\n547\n00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:24.043\nI just overproduce because I want\neveryone to feel good about.\n\n548\n00:28:24.043 --> 00:28:26.602\nAnd then I travel, so\nthe food's in the refrigerator,\n\n549\n00:28:26.602 --> 00:28:28.135\nthat's pretty wasteful [LAUGH].\n\n550\n00:28:28.135 --> 00:28:30.091\n>> That's a great example.\n\n551\n00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:32.512\nThis one's kind of a tough one, isn't it?\n\n552\n00:28:32.512 --> 00:28:36.361\nYou could say like at the holiday season,\nyou over decorate the house, put way\n\n553\n00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:40.227\ntoo much up for the amount of people that\nare gonna see it, [CROSSTALK] example.\n\n554\n00:28:40.227 --> 00:28:43.716\n>> Exactly, and then over-processing.\n\n555\n00:28:43.716 --> 00:28:47.780\nI mean think about things that\nwe spend to much time doing.\n\n556\n00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.274\nNow over processing can also be,\nrepresent redundancy,\n\n557\n00:28:51.274 --> 00:28:55.351\nlike if you're constantly going\nback in to turn off the coffee pot.\n\n558\n00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:58.995\nThen maybe you should get a coffee\npot that turns itself off, right.\n\n559\n00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:03.890\nSo you kinda want to think about\nprocessing sort of in those terms.\n\n560\n00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.180\nAnd a lot of things, you know, it's not\nmeant to be quick, I mean we're doing it\n\n561\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.615\nquickly here, but when you're at home,\nI mean, these are things to think about.\n\n562\n00:29:12.615 --> 00:29:14.676\nThings to talk about with your family and\nthings,\n\n563\n00:29:14.676 --> 00:29:18.358\nif you're really trying to make your home\nbetter, faster, and more cost-effective,\n\n564\n00:29:18.358 --> 00:29:19.597\nthis is a place you can start.\n\n565\n00:29:19.597 --> 00:29:23.335\nEliminating or reducing waste is\nthe quickest place that you can look.\n\n566\n00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:27.541\nSo defects, and this would be mistakes,\nI mean, there's a lot of,\n\n567\n00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:29.654\nmy home in the mountains is older.\n\n568\n00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:32.214\nI have a home on the beach\nthat's kind of modern.\n\n569\n00:29:32.214 --> 00:29:35.500\nThey don't have too many mistakes\nthere except beach weather.\n\n570\n00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.100\nBut my older home,\nthe home that I I actually live in.\n\n571\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.246\nOh my goodness.\n\n572\n00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:43.641\n>> Yeah, just as your home gets older\nyou start to have things like equipment\n\n573\n00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:45.684\nfailures, appliance failures and stuff.\n\n574\n00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:49.959\nBut this could apply to processes\nthat don't work, also, right?\n\n575\n00:29:49.959 --> 00:29:54.384\nSo, for example, my son's school, we know\nthat Tuesday is library day and so in\n\n576\n00:29:54.384 --> 00:29:58.676\nthe morning, he's got to take his library\nbook from the last week in with him or\n\n577\n00:29:58.676 --> 00:29:59.996\nhe can't get a new one.\n\n578\n00:29:59.996 --> 00:30:03.919\nAnd as we get him ready for school,\nwe might forget to put his library book in\n\n579\n00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:07.841\nhis backpack, and so we need a better\nprocess to make sure that that library\n\n580\n00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:10.358\nbook makes it into his\nbackpack before he goes.\n\n581\n00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:14.579\nSo when that doesn't happen, it's kind\nof like a defect in our process, not so\n\n582\n00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:17.918\nmuch a defect in us [LAUGH],\nI guess it sort of is, a defect in us,\n\n583\n00:30:17.918 --> 00:30:22.320\nwe forgot to put the backpack in there,\nbut that's another example.\n\n584\n00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.320\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n585\n00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.263\nAnd when we think about skills and\nyou and I were talking about\n\n586\n00:30:26.263 --> 00:30:29.204\nskills a little earlier about how\nthere are things I can do and\n\n587\n00:30:29.204 --> 00:30:31.762\nthere are things I should\nprobably just outsource.\n\n588\n00:30:31.762 --> 00:30:33.068\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n589\n00:30:33.068 --> 00:30:34.235\n>> Absolutely.\n\n590\n00:30:34.235 --> 00:30:38.632\nSometimes it's tough because you say,\nI can do this, but\n\n591\n00:30:38.632 --> 00:30:41.253\ndo I have the time, is it worth it?\n\n592\n00:30:41.253 --> 00:30:43.116\nDo I really want to mess with that?\n\n593\n00:30:43.116 --> 00:30:45.325\nSometimes other people are better\nat things than you, and\n\n594\n00:30:45.325 --> 00:30:46.460\nyou just have to accept that.\n\n595\n00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.582\n>> Exactly.\n\n596\n00:30:47.582 --> 00:30:51.176\nSo we aren't going to be able to\nhave the time to take every single\n\n597\n00:30:51.176 --> 00:30:54.182\nLean Six Sigma Tool and\napply it to our personal life.\n\n598\n00:30:54.182 --> 00:30:58.277\nBut this is just an example, so as you\nmove through some of the other episodes,\n\n599\n00:30:58.277 --> 00:31:01.316\nI would like to challenge you\nto think about those tools and\n\n600\n00:31:01.316 --> 00:31:04.379\nhow you can use them to improve\nyour personal life as well.\n\n601\n00:31:04.379 --> 00:31:08.846\n>> All right well, I think that's a pretty\nall encompassing run down of Tim Woods and\n\n602\n00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:11.631\nthe different areas that\nwe might identify waste,\n\n603\n00:31:11.631 --> 00:31:14.695\na pretty critical concept\nas far as Lean's concerned.\n\n604\n00:31:14.695 --> 00:31:15.983\nBut I think that's a good spot for\n\n605\n00:31:15.983 --> 00:31:16.682\nus to wrap it up-\n>> Okay.\n\n606\n00:31:16.682 --> 00:31:19.101\n>> Do you have anything else you want to\nwanted to throw in before we wrap up?\n\n607\n00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:22.419\n>> I just wanted to remind everyone that\nthe name of the game is we're trying to\n\n608\n00:31:22.419 --> 00:31:24.904\nmake things better, faster,\nmore cost-effective.\n\n609\n00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:29.835\nTim Woods is one method to identify waste\nand we know that if we reduce or eliminate\n\n610\n00:31:29.835 --> 00:31:35.438\nwaste, we might automatically make things\nbetter, faster, and more cost-effective.\n\n611\n00:31:35.438 --> 00:31:39.841\nAnd Tim Woods can also be used for\nother purposes, too.\n\n612\n00:31:39.841 --> 00:31:43.694\nLike we were saying, like you're trying to\nget yourself orientated to to a new job,\n\n613\n00:31:43.694 --> 00:31:46.152\nor you're trying to do so\nmany problem solving, so.\n\n614\n00:31:46.152 --> 00:31:47.849\n>> All right, so somewhere out there,\n\n615\n00:31:47.849 --> 00:31:50.532\nmaybe one of our is a gentleman\nnamed Tim Woods watching and\n\n616\n00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:54.063\nprobably hates this episode because\nnow we've associated him with waste.\n\n617\n00:31:54.063 --> 00:31:57.933\nBut, hopefully you're not that person,\nand that means you enjoyed the show,\n\n618\n00:31:57.933 --> 00:32:01.974\nwe hope you did, because we're going to be\nback with more Lean Six Sigma coming up,\n\n619\n00:32:01.974 --> 00:32:04.486\nbut for now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet\n\n620\n00:32:04.486 --> 00:32:05.792\n>> And I'm Dr. Stearn.\n\n621\n00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:07.054\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n622\n00:32:07.054 --> 00:32:07.617\n>> Thank you.\n\n623\n00:32:07.617 --> 00:32:14.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.463\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:18.130\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.030\nAnd in this episode we're gonna jump the\ndivide between kind of processed manager\n\n6\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.740\nor processed improvement and\njumping over into\n\n7\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.830\nthe world of, project Management,\nwhich is really closely related to this,\n\n8\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.726\nand to help us understand why\nI've got with me Dr. Stern again.\n\n9\n00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:39.990\nDr. Stern, thanks for being on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.060\n>> Thank you.\n\n11\n00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.080\n>> And helps us understand here,\nbecause I know for me,\n\n12\n00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.270\nI have a project management background.\n\n13\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.160\nAnd I'll tell you there is a ton of\noverlap between the stuff we see\n\n14\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.310\nin Six Sigma and Lean and\nwell, Lean Six Sigma, and\n\n15\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.730\nwhat we see in the project\nmanagement world.\n\n16\n00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.610\nSo how does all that work together?\n\n17\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.300\n>> Okay, well first,\nI would like to point out,\n\n18\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.320\nthat any project management tool by\ndefault is also a Lean Six Sigma tool.\n\n19\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.080\nAnd the reason is because\nevery process improvement\n\n20\n00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.930\nat some point, goes back to being\na project that needs to be managed.\n\n21\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.233\nSo, no matter what process\nimprovement methodology you use,\n\n22\n00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:20.265\nif you use Lean Six Sigma or\nuse a combination.\n\n23\n00:01:20.265 --> 00:01:22.064\nWhen you get the problem solved, and\n\n24\n00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:25.429\nwe're gonna talk about that in a second,\nbut when you get the problem\n\n25\n00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.047\nsolved you go back to being a project\nmanager to get the project executed.\n\n26\n00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:34.915\nSo, probably where I'm gonna start is I\nwanna talk about the project lifecycle.\n\n27\n00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:36.720\nAnd I have a slide on that.\n\n28\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.190\nAnd it's a bit of a busy slide that\nthis is in your sample files, so\n\n29\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.280\nlater when you have some time if you\nwanna print it out and look at it.\n\n30\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.320\nNow, I wanna explain something that\nI brought up in an earlier episode.\n\n31\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.310\nFor the most part of the last I would say,\ngosh,\n\n32\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.280\n30, 40 years, the PEMBAC has been sort\nof the bible of project management.\n\n33\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.260\nAnd in their project management\nlife cycle varies a little bit.\n\n34\n00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.240\nAnd then the new project life cycle,\nthat introduced by ISO,\n\n35\n00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.260\n12 500 has some nuances.\n\n36\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.146\nAnd then I think I also mentioned in an\nearlier episode that some universities and\n\n37\n00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:20.750\neven four-year degree programs sort\nof have a little bit of a different\n\n38\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.660\nspin on the project life cycle.\n\n39\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.045\nThey're very, very similar, but\nin some cycles there's five steps.\n\n40\n00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:28.185\nIn some cycles, there's six.\n\n41\n00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:31.315\nWhat you're looking at right now\non the screen and again you have\n\n42\n00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:35.335\na copy of this in your sample files, what\nyou're looking at is kind of a composite.\n\n43\n00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:39.325\nThese are the things that if you took\neveryone's idea about what the project\n\n44\n00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.645\nlife cycle would be, and\n\n45\n00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:44.515\nyou had slammed them into one model,\nthis would be the model.\n\n46\n00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.815\nDoes that make sense, Don?\n\n47\n00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.330\n>> It does.\nYeah and we've We've seen this, and\n\n48\n00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.870\nany of you guys who have taken\nPMP training, CAPM training,\n\n49\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.220\nany of the PMI stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.640\nEven inside of ITIL,\nwe see it, or Prince 2,\n\n51\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.230\nyou've got it there, this idea of\nmoving through a set of phases.\n\n52\n00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.400\nAnd I know your slide show is four phases.\n\n53\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.020\nSome people break it down into five.\n\n54\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.070\nI've even seen six phases,\nbut at the end of the day,\n\n55\n00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.280\nthey really do boil down\nto the same concepts.\n\n56\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.740\nAnd it's just how we make sure something\neffectively starts and finishes.\n\n57\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.980\n>> Exactly.\nAnd so when you're looking at this,\n\n58\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.950\nyou see that there's a start up phase and\nin some models that's called initiation,\n\n59\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.100\nand then there's a planning and executing\nstage, and then there's a close out phase.\n\n60\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.220\nSome of the things that you might\nsee in other models are control.\n\n61\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.960\nSome models pay a little bit more\nattention to risk management, but\n\n62\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.110\nessentially when Lean Six Sigma\nlooks at it's time for\n\n63\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.810\nthis process improvement to be a project.\n\n64\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.180\nThese are the basics,\nthere's gotta be some kind of startup and\n\n65\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.610\nthat would be, where you're going out and\nyou're explaining what you're doing.\n\n66\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.650\nYou're figuring out your scope.\n\n67\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.530\nA lot of times this is where\nyour project charter comes in,\n\n68\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.440\nand you do have a sample project\ncharter or a project charter template,\n\n69\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.420\nrather in your sample files and\nwe'll be looking.\n\n70\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.090\nNets and other project charter stuff\na little bit later in the class.\n\n71\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.680\nPlanning is where you really\nget the team together and\n\n72\n00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.440\nyou figure out who's gonna be doing what.\n\n73\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.500\nExecuting is getting a schedule together,\nand then closeout is\n\n74\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.840\nobviously really important so\npeople know that the project is over.\n\n75\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.630\nNow, I do this for a living, and\nI shared in an earlier episode\n\n76\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.520\nI mostly teach I mostly teach, and\nI teach other instructors how to teach,\n\n77\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.980\nbut sometimes I have\na consulting hat that I wear.\n\n78\n00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.240\nAnd not too long ago I was working for\n\n79\n00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.310\na company where we were\nmeeting every Monday morning.\n\n80\n00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.755\nAnd because I travel a lot, sometimes\nI would have to call into the meeting.\n\n81\n00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:40.581\nWell, the week before I went to California\nwe had this big dinner, and we gave\n\n82\n00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:45.569\nprizes, and we patted everyone on their\nback and we said what a great job we did.\n\n83\n00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.745\nAnd I felt like we had\nclosed out the project.\n\n84\n00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:52.190\nAnd the next Monday,\nwhen I was in California, I get this panic\n\n85\n00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.296\ncall that the team was meeting at\nthe company, and I hadn't called in yet.\n\n86\n00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.580\nAnd so obviously, they didn't\nrealize the project was closed out.\n\n87\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.559\nSo, closing out is really,\nreally important.\n\n88\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.130\nOne of the things that I wanna\ntalk a little bit about,\n\n89\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.840\nis the traditional\nproject management role.\n\n90\n00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.086\nWhoops, sorry about that.\n\n91\n00:05:13.086 --> 00:05:15.590\nThe traditional project management role.\n\n92\n00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.724\nLean Six Sigma, right now, still has\na tendency to think of the project manager\n\n93\n00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:23.503\nin these terms, and this is what we\nnormally think of a project manager.\n\n94\n00:05:23.503 --> 00:05:27.772\nFor those of you who are involved in\nAgile, there's a little bit of a different\n\n95\n00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:31.880\nspin on project managers, and\nScrum masters and their role.\n\n96\n00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.850\nIn the Agile community, it's a little\nbit more like, servant leadership, and\n\n97\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.830\nI'm not so much the deputy, I'm not so\n\n98\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.680\nmuch in charge of the project as I'm there\nto help you remove some of the obstacles.\n\n99\n00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.300\nRight now, although that's changing,\nwhen Lean Six Sigma looks at a project,\n\n100\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.140\nit's still kind of traditional\nproject management.\n\n101\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.640\nNow, the deal between a project and\n\n102\n00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.930\na process improvement\nproject is simply this.\n\n103\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.544\nA project, I have a problem,\nand I know the solution.\n\n104\n00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:05.935\nAnd kinda keep in mind,\n\n105\n00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:09.910\nwe're using a problem statement\nthe same way you might use it in IT.\n\n106\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.742\nSometimes the problem statement\nreally is a problem, but\n\n107\n00:06:12.742 --> 00:06:15.631\nsometimes a problem statement\nis just a statement of work,\n\n108\n00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:17.961\nwhat it is that you're planning to do,\nright?\n\n109\n00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.585\nSo, if I have a problem statement and\nthen I know the solution,\n\n110\n00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:26.875\nit's a project, or\nI'm pretty sure I know the solution.\n\n111\n00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:27.757\n>> So throughout this series,\n\n112\n00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.786\nwe've really been talking about\nprocess improvement, right?\n\n113\n00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:34.294\nIt's Six Sigma, and we've talked\nabout process improvement projects.\n\n114\n00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.589\nI know we've used that term, and\n\n115\n00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.873\nin my mind I'm thinking about\nregular projects, right?\n\n116\n00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:39.742\nI've got a project management background,\n\n117\n00:06:39.742 --> 00:06:43.295\nI've dealt with regular projects that\ndon't necessarily do process improvement.\n\n118\n00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:47.375\nSo what's the difference between a process\nimprovement project, its just hard to\n\n119\n00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:50.832\nsay that, and a regular project,\nother than how hard they are to say?\n\n120\n00:06:50.832 --> 00:06:55.740\n>> Well, that's a really good question\nDon, and it gets a little bit confusing,\n\n121\n00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.622\nand I think when Lean Six Sigma\npractitioners first start out,\n\n122\n00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:03.285\nbeing able to identify\nthe difference between a project and\n\n123\n00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:05.798\na process improvement project is huge.\n\n124\n00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:10.561\nThe deal is that projects always start\nwith some sort of problem statement, and\n\n125\n00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:13.492\nwe use problem statement\nthe same way IT uses it.\n\n126\n00:07:13.492 --> 00:07:17.119\nSometimes the problem statement is\na true problem that needs a solution.\n\n127\n00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:19.965\nSometimes a problem statement is\nmore like a statement of work.\n\n128\n00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:21.795\nThis is what I'm setting out to do.\n\n129\n00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:27.223\nNow, when you get ready to do something,\nlike you're going to build a deck,\n\n130\n00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:31.329\nor remodel your kitchen, or\nrevamp the computer system.\n\n131\n00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:36.250\nWhen you get ready to do those things, if\nyou already have an idea of how to do it,\n\n132\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.753\nand this could come from a lot of things.\n\n133\n00:07:38.753 --> 00:07:40.204\nMaybe you did it before,\n\n134\n00:07:40.204 --> 00:07:43.667\nmaybe the company has a certain\nway that that has to be done.\n\n135\n00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:47.177\nBut pretty much you know your plan,\nthen that's a project, and\n\n136\n00:07:47.177 --> 00:07:49.587\nyou wanna go into project management mode.\n\n137\n00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:53.443\nAnd when I say that, your first thing is\nyou're basically gonna do a to do list,\n\n138\n00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:54.835\nwhich is your project plan.\n\n139\n00:07:54.835 --> 00:07:58.447\nAnd there's some rules about your to do\nlist that we'll talk about later, but\n\n140\n00:07:58.447 --> 00:08:00.042\nyou just wanna move into the plan.\n\n141\n00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:05.744\nFigure out your resources, both financial\nand human, and just kinda get started.\n\n142\n00:08:05.744 --> 00:08:10.750\nA process improvement project opportunity,\nis when you know the problem, but\n\n143\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.998\nyou don't know the answer, and that's\nwhere process improvement tools come in.\n\n144\n00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:19.076\nNow that's not to say that if\nI'm working on a project, and\n\n145\n00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:22.462\nI want to make my project better,\nfaster, more cost effective,\n\n146\n00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:25.623\nthat I can't use some process\nimprovement tools to do that.\n\n147\n00:08:25.623 --> 00:08:29.328\nIt means that I don't need those process\nimprovement tools to come up with\n\n148\n00:08:29.328 --> 00:08:29.994\na solution.\n\n149\n00:08:29.994 --> 00:08:35.176\nSo process improvement programs\nare built to kind of think about,\n\n150\n00:08:35.176 --> 00:08:39.162\ntest out, solutions,\ndo some what if scenarios.\n\n151\n00:08:39.162 --> 00:08:42.852\nBut then, at the end of the day,\nyour process improvement, at some point,\n\n152\n00:08:42.852 --> 00:08:46.791\nbecomes a project, and that's why you\nput your project management hat back on.\n\n153\n00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:49.387\n>> So I'm thinking in terms\nof the official definition\n\n154\n00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:50.690\nof a project from the PMI.\n\n155\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.280\nWhere they say that a project is something\n\n156\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.590\nthat has a well-defined start and\nend, right?\n\n157\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.430\nYou know when When a project starts,\nyou know when a project ends.\n\n158\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.146\nWhen it's a process improvement project,\n\n159\n00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:03.961\nyou might not necessarily know that,\nright?\n\n160\n00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.462\nYou don't know the solution, and\n\n161\n00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.956\nit might take a while to figure\nout the solution, right?\n\n162\n00:09:07.956 --> 00:09:10.869\n>> Exactly, and\nthat brings up one other key difference.\n\n163\n00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:16.601\nEven though your process improvement\nbecomes a project at some point,\n\n164\n00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:19.091\ntypical projects have an end.\n\n165\n00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:22.227\nProcess improvement projects,\nthe very last phase of that,\n\n166\n00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:24.832\nis how do I keep this\nprocess improvement in place.\n\n167\n00:09:24.832 --> 00:09:27.998\nAnd then ultimately,\nhow can I continue to improve it.\n\n168\n00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:33.832\nSo, when we do projects, just like\nyou said, we start, we finish, right?\n\n169\n00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:37.062\nIn process improvement,\nonce we figure out the solution,\n\n170\n00:09:37.062 --> 00:09:38.750\nwe just go along the same path.\n\n171\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.234\nWe follow that project life cycle,\nand the only difference at that time,\n\n172\n00:09:42.234 --> 00:09:44.832\nbecause we have all those\ncloseout activities still.\n\n173\n00:09:44.832 --> 00:09:49.081\nWe still have to let people know\nwe've got this improvement in place.\n\n174\n00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:52.527\nThe nuances that we update our documents,\n\n175\n00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:58.379\nwe try to figure out any risk of\nthe process improvement not continuing.\n\n176\n00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:02.491\nAnd we try to build in literature, so\nthat if someone else takes that over,\n\n177\n00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.792\nthey know how to keep that process going.\n\n178\n00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:07.084\nAnd again, I wanna repeat that.\n\n179\n00:10:07.084 --> 00:10:11.785\nIf we also can figure out a way to make\nthe process even better, better, better,\n\n180\n00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.667\nthat's just icing on the cake.\n\n181\n00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:16.535\n>> So let me give you an example that\nI know I used in the P and P show, for\n\n182\n00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:19.575\nthose of you guys who watched that,\nyou'll probably remember this.\n\n183\n00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:23.027\nI used an example in there when I was\ntalking about quality management,\n\n184\n00:10:23.027 --> 00:10:24.875\nabout a factory that made blue jeans.\n\n185\n00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:28.812\nAnd for every 1,000 pair of\nblue jeans they had 75 defects,\n\n186\n00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:32.490\n75 pairs of jeans that weren't\nsuitable for sale, right?\n\n187\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.822\nSo from there,\nwe go into our process improvement of,\n\n188\n00:10:36.822 --> 00:10:39.376\nhow can we get that number down.\n\n189\n00:10:39.376 --> 00:10:42.714\nInstead of having 75, could we get that\ndown to 25 that were not suitable?\n\n190\n00:10:42.714 --> 00:10:44.578\nBecause odds are you're not\ngonna get to 100%, right, so\n\n191\n00:10:44.578 --> 00:10:47.491\nthere's gonna be always some-\n>> Exactly, and that counts.\n\n192\n00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:49.906\n>> So, when you start to identify that,\n\n193\n00:10:49.906 --> 00:10:54.509\nis that the start of our process\nimprovement project or is it a matter of,\n\n194\n00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:59.111\nall right, we try to identify the cause,\nwe come up with a solution, and\n\n195\n00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:03.284\nthen it's implementing the solution\nthat becomes the project.\n\n196\n00:11:03.284 --> 00:11:05.914\nWhich part is that where\nthe project really kicks off?\n\n197\n00:11:05.914 --> 00:11:08.285\n>> Well,\nit depends on which model you're using.\n\n198\n00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:11.450\nAnd in our next episode,\nwe're gonna address the different models.\n\n199\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.514\nBut for example, in one of the models,\nthe plan, do, check,\n\n200\n00:11:15.514 --> 00:11:17.916\nact model, the project stats in do.\n\n201\n00:11:17.916 --> 00:11:19.367\nIt starts in the second step.\n\n202\n00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:23.777\nIn the DMAIC model, the define, measure,\nanalyze, improve and control model,\n\n203\n00:11:23.777 --> 00:11:27.998\nthe project doesn't actually start until\nthe bottom part of that fourth step,\n\n204\n00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:28.580\nimprove.\n\n205\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.372\nAnd so there's all these things you do,\nbefore you get to the project.\n\n206\n00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:37.480\nIn some models, it happens pretty\nquickly and others it's a little later.\n\n207\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.798\nThe moment you,\nI think the defining factor,\n\n208\n00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:43.790\nis the moment that you sit down and start\ndoing a project plan, it's a project.\n\n209\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.268\n>> That's what kinda defines a-\n>> So all the other things,\n\n210\n00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:51.203\nall the reasoning, and inquiries, and\ndocumentation, and variation studies,\n\n211\n00:11:51.203 --> 00:11:55.379\nthat's all part of the trying to\nreason out the process improvement.\n\n212\n00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:58.943\n>> And then, as with anything,\nafter you do that project,\n\n213\n00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:03.176\nimplement the solution, maybe we\ndo get it down to only 25 pairs of\n\n214\n00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:06.913\nblue jeans that are now damaged\nbeyond the ability to sale.\n\n215\n00:12:06.913 --> 00:12:09.393\nAnd so\nthen we kinda kick off the process again,\n\n216\n00:12:09.393 --> 00:12:12.750\nas part of our continual process\nimprovement, right, or CPI.\n\n217\n00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.585\n>> And again, it sort of depends\non which model you're in.\n\n218\n00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:21.210\nBut in DMAIC model, there's a phase\nthat's completely dedicated to control,\n\n219\n00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.452\nand how to keep that into place.\n\n220\n00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:29.206\nIn the PDCA model, a lot of it depends on,\ntechnically the plan, do, check,\n\n221\n00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:34.459\nact model has been changed the act to act,\nadopt, or abandon, right?\n\n222\n00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:41.244\nSo at that point, if I decide to adopt it,\nI'm writing my control plan at that time.\n\n223\n00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:44.224\nIf I'm acting I'm writing it,\nbut certainly if I abandon it,\n\n224\n00:12:44.224 --> 00:12:46.712\nI don't have to do anything,\nI'm just kinda done.\n\n225\n00:12:46.712 --> 00:12:49.070\n>> Yeah, and\nI guess that's important to remember too.\n\n226\n00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.594\nJust like with the project,\nwe always say like,\n\n227\n00:12:51.594 --> 00:12:54.869\na project needs to either succeed or\nfail, and failure is bad.\n\n228\n00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:57.939\nBut sometimes it's okay for\na project to fail, if you find that like,\n\n229\n00:12:57.939 --> 00:13:01.268\nin the planning phase you find the costs\nare just gonna be out of line with what\n\n230\n00:13:01.268 --> 00:13:02.590\nthe initial estimates were.\n\n231\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.371\nOr in this case,\nmaybe the cost correcting the cause might\n\n232\n00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:10.992\nexceed the benefit, and so, you abandon.\n\n233\n00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:12.457\n>> Exactly.\nExactly.\n\n234\n00:13:12.457 --> 00:13:15.227\n>> All right.\n>> So, just to kind of summarize that\n\n235\n00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:20.284\npoint, if I know the problem, and\nI know the solution, it's a project.\n\n236\n00:13:20.284 --> 00:13:25.269\nIf I know the problem, and I don't know\nthe solution, it's a process improvement,\n\n237\n00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:29.771\nbut I could also not know the The problem,\nand that's where tools that we've\n\n238\n00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:33.530\ndiscussed in the last episode\ncome in handy, such as Tim Woods.\n\n239\n00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:40.380\nI actually could go in a department and\nbe told, we don't know what's wrong.\n\n240\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.750\nSo part of the process improvement is just\nidentifying what it is I'm supposed to\n\n241\n00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.230\nbe working on, Again, if I know\nthe problem and I know the solution,\n\n242\n00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.480\nhands down, it's a project and\nyou know what?\n\n243\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.040\nI need to start working on that project.\n\n244\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.060\nWhen I do consulting roles,\n\n245\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.900\nI'm often pulled in to do something\nthat should be a project.\n\n246\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.400\nFor example, not too long ago,\n\n247\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.420\nsomeone wanted to make\nthe employee performance form.\n\n248\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.000\nThey actually wanted to make\nthat a process improvement.\n\n249\n00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.740\nNow, if they wanted to revamp the whole\nsystem, absolutely, a process improvement.\n\n250\n00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.008\nThey wanted to improve the form.\n\n251\n00:14:17.008 --> 00:14:19.520\nThere's dozens of templates out there,\nthat's one meeting,\n\n252\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.190\nwe look at the templates, it's over.\n\n253\n00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.940\nA lot of times, one of the challenges for\n\n254\n00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.770\nLean Six Sigma people is going into the\nroom and determining, you know what guys?\n\n255\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.420\nThis is a project, and we just need to\nget on the ball, we need to start moving,\n\n256\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.950\nwe need to make a plan.\n\n257\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.760\nBut that still counts, and you can\nstill use process improvement tools,\n\n258\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.100\nyou just don't need them to\ntry to reason out the problem.\n\n259\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.100\nSometimes you go into a department and\nthat's where, again,\n\n260\n00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.555\nyou could use something like Tim Woods.\n\n261\n00:14:45.555 --> 00:14:47.080\nPeople just have their\nhands up in the air and\n\n262\n00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.080\nthey're like, we don't know what's wrong.\n\n263\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.950\nThere's a number of other tools that can\nhelp you identify the problems, as well.\n\n264\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.870\nBut even if you know the problem but\nyou don't know the solution,\n\n265\n00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.222\nthen process improvements\nis what you want.\n\n266\n00:14:59.222 --> 00:15:01.120\n>> Excellent.\n\n267\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.879\nWell, I know you mentioned [INAUDIBLE].\n\n268\n00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:05.730\nYou mentioned [INAUDIBLE],\nwe mentioned several times in the show.\n\n269\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.246\nWe wanna spend more time on those but\nI know there's not enough time in this\n\n270\n00:15:09.246 --> 00:15:11.810\nepisode to really even break\nthe ice on some of those.\n\n271\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.235\n>> But I think going ahead and\nmaybe introduce the models so for our next\n\n272\n00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:21.840\nepisode we could start maybe talking about\nthem, if you're comfortable with that.\n\n273\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.060\n>> Absolutely, let's do that.\n\n274\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.530\n>> Okay, so just briefly,\nthe three models, and\n\n275\n00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.475\nI have a slide on this, but\nit's a very lean slide.\n\n276\n00:15:28.475 --> 00:15:29.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the primary models at\n\n277\n00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.610\nLean Six Sigma are PDCA,\n>> The DMAIC and DFSS.\n\n278\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.550\nNow the PDCA model we've already\ntalked about a little bit, and\n\n279\n00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.360\nin our next episode we'll get\nto talk about it in depth.\n\n280\n00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.700\nBut that stands for Plan, Do, Check,\n\n281\n00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.170\nAct, and sometimes the more\nexpanded model calls it Plan, Do,\n\n282\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.090\nCheck, and then the Act part is Act,\nAdopt, or Abandon.\n\n283\n00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.320\nSo that's kind of the more expanded model.\n\n284\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.300\nAnd also sometimes you\nsee this model PDSA, and\n\n285\n00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.070\nin that case, the S stands for study.\n\n286\n00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.900\nSo, if I am doing a research paper,\nI going to plan it.\n\n287\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.040\nI am going to do it, which is execute.\n\n288\n00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.498\nI am going to study my results, and\nthen based on my results, I will act or\n\n289\n00:16:14.498 --> 00:16:17.363\nabandon or adopt a plan for\nfurther research.\n\n290\n00:16:17.363 --> 00:16:22.604\nIn a project management environment,\nYPDCA is embraced by project managers\n\n291\n00:16:22.604 --> 00:16:27.937\nis that it very easily fits into something\ncalled a work breakdown structure.\n\n292\n00:16:27.937 --> 00:16:33.910\nAnd we just say that WBS for short.\n\n293\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.580\nAnd we'll have an opportunity in another\nepisode to see a work breakdown structure,\n\n294\n00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.870\nbut in a nutshell that's where I\njust label my major tasks, one,\n\n295\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.770\ntwo, three, four, and then if I have task\nunder one I would label that 1.1 and 1.2,\n\n296\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.020\nand if I have a task under 1.2 of\ncourse that would be 1.2.1 and 1.2.2.\n\n297\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.590\nWhen we can apply a work\nbreakdown structure to a model,\n\n298\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.520\nit just makes that model easier to digest\nand easier to decide what resources and\n\n299\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.620\nhow much it's gonna cost and\nthat type of thing.\n\n300\n00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.780\nSo Plan, Do, Check,\nAct is a rather intuitive model,\n\n301\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.860\nI'm gonna plan it,\nI'm gonna execute it, I'm gonna check or\n\n302\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:12.960\nstudy, and then based on those results\nI'm going to act, abandon, or adopt.\n\n303\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.048\nNow the DMAIC model is the flagship\nmodel and that stands for\n\n304\n00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:20.321\nDefine Measures Analyze Improve and\nControl,\n\n305\n00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:23.687\nand the deal with the DMAIC\nmodel is simply this.\n\n306\n00:17:23.687 --> 00:17:29.877\nIn a typical a lot of times when a problem\nis introduce, we brainstorm the solution,\n\n307\n00:17:29.877 --> 00:17:35.850\nand we come up with the, and this is\na kinda of structure problem solving.\n\n308\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.280\nWe come up with the list of things that\nwe think can solve the problem and\n\n309\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.230\nin structure brainstorming what\nwe do is spread that list.\n\n310\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.470\nWe pick one and then supposedly we\nimplement it, and then we go back and\n\n311\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:48.420\nwe kind of tweak it up.\n\n312\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.150\nBut in structure problem solving,\na lot of times we drop the ball even and\n\n313\n00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.480\nthat particular situation\nwe forget to go back or\n\n314\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:01.000\nwe might even send out surveys and stuff,\nbut we don't really tweak it up, right?\n\n315\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.570\nThe big difference in the demaic model,\nis that I define, I measure, I analyze and\n\n316\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:11.520\nafter I do those three steps, then I come\nup with my brainstorm list of solutions.\n\n317\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.400\nSo define just means I make sure\nI'm working on the right thing,\n\n318\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.630\nmeasure which isn't as intuitive\nas some of the other models,\n\n319\n00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.220\nit just means I'm going to get a clear\nas a picture of where I'm at today.\n\n320\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.590\nA analyze means I'm going to go back and\nsay, hey why is that picture that way?\n\n321\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.880\nAnd then after I do that That, I come up\nwith my brain storm list of solutions.\n\n322\n00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.610\nNow what that buys me is I'm not going to\nhave someone in the back of the room say,\n\n323\n00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.460\nwe tried that last year and\nit didn't work, because I defined,\n\n324\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.710\nI measured, I analyzed.\n\n325\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:40.750\nI'm gonna know that.\n\n326\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.040\nI'm not gonna have someone say, that's not\npolitically going to fly with our company.\n\n327\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.660\nIt's not green enough.\n\n328\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.480\nWe don't have the intellectual capital,\nwhich is kind of a mean thing to say.\n\n329\n00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.290\nBut I'm not gonna have any of those\nthings come back at me because because\n\n330\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.290\nI spent the time to define,\nmeasure and analyze.\n\n331\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:01.170\nAnd when I come out of analyze I shoot for\nthree to five solutions,\n\n332\n00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:06.150\nso when I get to improve where I became a\nproject manager again I have some choices.\n\n333\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.770\nRight?\nAnd then I mentioned earlier, the DMAIC\n\n334\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.280\nmodel has a whole phase at the very end\nwhich is different than typical project\n\n335\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.620\nmanagement, and that's the control piece\nand in control I'm documenting what I did\n\n336\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:22.670\nbut I'm telling you how\nto keep it that way.\n\n337\n00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.670\nAnd finally, there's a model that we don't\nreally actually- we briefly discuss in\n\n338\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.160\nthis class but I just want to put it out\nthere, called the design for six sigma and\n\n339\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.370\nnow you're seeing the term a lot of\ntimes like say in the Wall Street where\n\n340\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.090\nthey'll say design for lean six sigma so\nthat acronym is DFLSS.\n\n341\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.300\nIt's the same set of models and the major\ndifference is in the demaic model,\n\n342\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.900\nI am working with an existing process.\n\n343\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.720\nAnd Lean Six Sigma is typically working\nwith a process that's already in place and\n\n344\n00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.030\ntrying to make it, what?\n\n345\n00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.030\nBetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n346\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.570\nIn the design for Six Sigma models,\nand there's many of them,\n\n347\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.280\nI'm taking something from nothing and\ncreating it.\n\n348\n00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.430\nAnd so one thing that makes it different\nis I have to have a design phase.\n\n349\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.670\nI have to have some kind of\nphase where I actually build it.\n\n350\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:15.390\nThe DMAIC model typically doesn't really\nallow for building, because I'm taking\n\n351\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.090\nan existing process and making it better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n352\n00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.910\nSo, Design for Six Sigma is when I'm\nbuilding something from scratch.\n\n353\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.400\nThere's over 100 Design for\nSix Sigma models, but\n\n354\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.960\nthe good news is that the DMADV model,\nwhich we discussed earlier,\n\n355\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.930\nin another episode is probably\nthe most popular, and so\n\n356\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.080\nthe first three letters of that, define,\nmeasure and analyze, are exactly the same\n\n357\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.690\nas they are in DMAIC and then there's\na design phase, and a verifying phase.\n\n358\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.460\nSo if you were a Lean Six Sigma\npractitioner, and\n\n359\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.300\nyou went to a company and they said we\ndon't use the DMAIC, we use the DFSS.\n\n360\n00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.730\nYour first question is,\nwhat model do you use?\n\n361\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.130\nBecause they could have a model\nthat was just indigenous\n\n362\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.460\nto their company that they just made up,\nright?\n\n363\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.170\nBut, most likely, they're going to use the\nDMADV model, and you could absolutely help\n\n364\n00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.300\nthem manage that project because,\nyou know the first three phases.\n\n365\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.390\n>> Alright, so when we go to implement\na process improvement in general,\n\n366\n00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.480\nwe kind of have our choice over which\nof these models we're gonna follow,\n\n367\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.620\nwhich one works the best for us.\n\n368\n00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.110\nWe're gonna spend a bit of time,\n\n369\n00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.070\ntalking about In the following episodes\nwe're gonna spend a lot of time on DMAIC,\n\n370\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.410\nbecause that one is the-\n>> Flag ship.\n\n371\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.250\n>> Prevalent model.\n\n372\n00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.130\nAnd then we talked a bit DFSS.\n\n373\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.860\nSo those are some of the good\nones that are out there.\n\n374\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.550\nCan you think of anything else you wanna\nthrow in before we wrap this one up?\n\n375\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.870\n>> I really can't think of\nanything at this time, Don.\n\n376\n00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.610\nThank you for asking.\n\n377\n00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.700\n>> All right, well, like I said we\nare gonna spend time talking about each\n\n378\n00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.710\nmodel in depth.\n\n379\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.654\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n380\n00:21:45.654 --> 00:21:49.664\nWe're gonna do Plan, Do, Check,\nAct first before moving into the others.\n\n381\n00:21:49.664 --> 00:21:52.824\nWe'll definitely get a chance to see\nthat in our upcoming episodes, but for\n\n382\n00:21:52.824 --> 00:21:54.514\nnow, we're gonna wrap this one up.\n\n383\n00:21:54.514 --> 00:21:57.924\nThank you guys for watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pizett.\n\n384\n00:21:57.924 --> 00:21:59.304\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern.\n\n385\n00:22:00.774 --> 00:22:05.230\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n386\n00:22:05.230 -->

00:00:17.727\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:22.533\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:27.387\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look, at the PDCA, the plan, do, check,\n\n6\n00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:30.198\nact, what I've always\ncalled the Deming cycle.\n\n7\n00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:32.356\nWe've talked a little about\nit in the last episode.\n\n8\n00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:36.616\nIt's pretty important, not just in terms\nof process improvement in Six Sigma, but\n\n9\n00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:38.777\nin terms of all sorts of different things.\n\n10\n00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:42.199\nAnd we're gonna look at it from\nthe Lean Six Sigma angle, which is pretty\n\n11\n00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.863\nimportant, and to help us with that,\nwe've got Dr. Stern back on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:45.863 --> 00:00:46.628\nThanks for being back with us.\n\n13\n00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:47.441\n>> Thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:49.833\n>> And well, where do you want to start?\n\n15\n00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:54.608\nWell I think I'd like to start talking\nfirst about the Plan, Do, Check,\n\n16\n00:00:54.608 --> 00:00:55.389\nAct model.\n\n17\n00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:01.009\nI wanna remind our viewers that when\nwe decide that we have a project.\n\n18\n00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.795\nWe just move forward and\nwe do the project.\n\n19\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.714\nWhen we don't know the answer to\nthe problem then it becomes a process\n\n20\n00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.345\nimprovement opportunity.\n\n21\n00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:13.889\nThe nice thing about the PDCA model is\nthat it can be used in both situations,\n\n22\n00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.230\nand it's very popular\nwith project management.\n\n23\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.900\nIt's actually covered as\npart of the PMP exam.\n\n24\n00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.943\nSo there's a lot of good reasons\nto learn about the PBCA.\n\n25\n00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:29.151\nTechnically you would want to reach for\nthe flagship model, which is DMAIC.\n\n26\n00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.243\nWhich we'll be discussing in\nthe next episode, define, measure,\n\n27\n00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:33.748\nanalyze, improve and control.\n\n28\n00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:38.398\nBut there's a lot of times that the PBCA\nmodel is going to be more handy, or\n\n29\n00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.929\nmore suitable for\nthe problem that you're working on.\n\n30\n00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.089\n>> If nothing else, it's easier to\nremember, cuz it's got one less letter.\n\n31\n00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:45.853\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly, exactly, and\n\n32\n00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:47.409\nthe words are really intuitive.\n\n33\n00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.658\nPlan, Do, which means execute,\nand Check, or study.\n\n34\n00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:58.158\nSo that would be C, and then\nthe A stands for Adopt, Abandon, or Act.\n\n35\n00:01:58.158 --> 00:01:58.972\nSo.\n\n36\n00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:02.175\nAll right, so\nI have a slide on this, the PDCA.\n\n37\n00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:06.990\nAnd you'll see the wheel, and sometimes\nthis is referred to by a number of\n\n38\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.187\nother names which we'll\nbe talking about next.\n\n39\n00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:14.483\nThe Plan-Do-Check-Act is a four-step\nmodel for carrying out change.\n\n40\n00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:17.107\nAnd it's meant to be continuous.\n\n41\n00:02:17.107 --> 00:02:21.157\nSo when I get to that last phase,\nunless I'm acting,\n\n42\n00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.492\nthen I just go back\naround the circle again.\n\n43\n00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:28.348\nWhat's important about this is that\na lot of process improvement models\n\n44\n00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.240\nare waterfall.\n\n45\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.637\nAnd what that means is you have to do\nstep one, before you do step two, and\n\n46\n00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:34.727\nwhen you get to the very end, you're done.\n\n47\n00:02:34.727 --> 00:02:36.407\nBut in the circular models,\n\n48\n00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:40.615\nyou can keep going around the circle\nuntil you're problem's solved.\n\n49\n00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:43.888\nI can give you a little\nbit of PDCA history.\n\n50\n00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:48.025\nWalter Shewhart wrote a book in\n1939 called Statistical Method From\n\n51\n00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:50.072\nthe Viewpoint of Quality Control.\n\n52\n00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:51.394\nThat's a mouthful.\n\n53\n00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:55.138\nAnd we had talked a little bit\nearlier about Edwards Deming and\n\n54\n00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:57.880\nalso Joseph Juran, who isn't on my slides.\n\n55\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.711\nThey were students of Walter,\nor Walter Shewhart, sorry.\n\n56\n00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:05.067\nThey were students of his that\nkind of took different directions.\n\n57\n00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.678\nEdwards Deming went on\nthe lecture circuit, and\n\n58\n00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:09.912\nJoseph Juran started writing material.\n\n59\n00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:13.360\nNow, closer to the end of their lives,\nthey were both doing both.\n\n60\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.538\nBut that's kind of where they started out,\nand they were really,\n\n61\n00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:18.944\nreally excited about\nthe Plan Do Check Act model.\n\n62\n00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:23.514\nSo, what happened is that\nsometimes the PDCA model, or\n\n63\n00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:29.072\nPDSA model, is called the Shewhart cycle,\nor the Shewhart wheel.\n\n64\n00:03:29.072 --> 00:03:32.131\nAnd sometimes it's called the Deming\nwheel or the Deming Cycle.\n\n65\n00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.803\nIt all means the same thing.\n\n66\n00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:38.876\nAnd one of the things I think is\nreally interesting piece of trivia,\n\n67\n00:03:38.876 --> 00:03:44.578\nis that during World War II, this was\na classified model that the army used.\n\n68\n00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:48.945\nSo what you're looking at right now\nis Continuous Improvement Cycle.\n\n69\n00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:53.881\nAnd there's just a little bit of\nverbiage on each thing because it's\n\n70\n00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:55.850\nmeant to be a simple model.\n\n71\n00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.295\nSometimes you don't have\ntime to do the DEMAIC.\n\n72\n00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:01.803\nEven though that is the preferred\nmodel in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n73\n00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:05.332\nSo that's one reason why you\nmight reach for the PDCA.\n\n74\n00:04:05.332 --> 00:04:09.256\nSometimes your boss says\nI need it on Monday.\n\n75\n00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:12.425\nSo you don't really even have\na choice about that, right?\n\n76\n00:04:12.425 --> 00:04:17.370\nSometimes, the problem is so simple,\nor so easy, that you use a PDCA.\n\n77\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.360\nAnd then in large companies,\nsuch as Northrop Grumman, Raytheon,\n\n78\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.580\nLockheed Martin,\n\n79\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.990\nthat have whole departments of\nSix Sigma and/or Lean Six Sigma people.\n\n80\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.710\nThey require that you run it through\na hypothetical PDCA before you\n\n81\n00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.270\nbring it to them for\nthem to apply the DMAIC model.\n\n82\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.594\nSo, there's a lot of reasons why you\nmight choose the PDCA over the DMAIC.\n\n83\n00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:44.021\nNow, in the Plan phase of the DMAIC model,\n\n84\n00:04:44.021 --> 00:04:47.202\nI'm discovering the current\ncondition of my problem.\n\n85\n00:04:47.202 --> 00:04:50.767\nAnd so, I'm really doing all the kinds\nof things that you would do when you're\n\n86\n00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:51.750\nplanning a project.\n\n87\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.710\nSo Don, what are some of the generic\nthings you do when you're planning\n\n88\n00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.371\na project?\n\n89\n00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:00.388\n>> Well, the first thing I always do is,\nI verify my scope, right?\n\n90\n00:05:00.388 --> 00:05:03.522\nSo we've got our triple constraints\nthat we always deal with.\n\n91\n00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:09.419\nThe budget, time, and we'd say quality or\nsometimes requirements, right?\n\n92\n00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.670\nSo I need to make sure that\nI'm building around that.\n\n93\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.785\nSo that's usually where I start.\n\n94\n00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:14.783\n>> Okay, good.\n\n95\n00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:18.208\nAnd so that's the same thing that\nthe Plan, Do, Check, Act model does.\n\n96\n00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:22.126\nNow when you look at this model,\nagain it's gonna seem very simplistic,\n\n97\n00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:24.602\nlike of course this is\nthe way things are done.\n\n98\n00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:28.895\nBut we live in a very reactive society,\nI've mentioned that in an earlier episode.\n\n99\n00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:33.614\nSo a lot of times, things come to us, and\nwe just go out and we try to solve them.\n\n100\n00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:35.178\nOne of the advantages of the PDCA model,\n\n101\n00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:37.711\nis that we can apply something\ncalled work breakdown structure.\n\n102\n00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:44.080\nAnd work breakdown structure,\nwhich is abbreviated W-B-S, is an outline.\n\n103\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.890\nWhere we say number one,\nwe're gonna do this.\n\n104\n00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.307\nNumber two, we're gonna do that.\n\n105\n00:05:47.307 --> 00:05:49.388\nNumber three,\nwe're gonna do this other thing.\n\n106\n00:05:49.388 --> 00:05:54.644\nAnd then if there are items under\nnumber one, they'd become 1.1, 1.2,\n\n107\n00:05:54.644 --> 00:06:00.695\nand 1.3, and if there's an item under\n1.3 that becomes 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.\n\n108\n00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:07.316\nWell the PDCA model plan would be one and\nthen do or execute would be two.\n\n109\n00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:11.690\nNow, there's a lot of things that\nI might do under execute that I\n\n110\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.208\ndetermined by my planning process.\n\n111\n00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.374\nI'm sure a lot of you, and\n\n112\n00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.869\nI think we mentioned this in\nan earlier episode as well.\n\n113\n00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.907\nA lot of you have probably been in\nsituations where there's a lot of planning\n\n114\n00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:23.115\nbut nothing happens.\n\n115\n00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:26.085\nThis model kind of forces you\nto go to that next level,\n\n116\n00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.259\nbecause number two is to do\nthings that are in execution.\n\n117\n00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.684\nAnd when you're thinking about execution,\nyou wanna think about this is\n\n118\n00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.846\nwhere I'm gonna build,\neven though I'm planning out my project.\n\n119\n00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:40.404\nMy project plan kinda happens\nalmost between plan and do.\n\n120\n00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:42.345\nWhen I'm in Do and I'm executing,\n\n121\n00:06:42.345 --> 00:06:46.486\nthe types of things that I need to think\nabout is I need to think about my cost,\n\n122\n00:06:46.486 --> 00:06:49.488\nmy timeline,\nwhat resources are gonna be doing what.\n\n123\n00:06:49.488 --> 00:06:53.750\nAnd I need to start building\nin some kind of plan to make\n\n124\n00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.509\nsure that I keep everyone on task.\n\n125\n00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.974\nNow when I get to, on my work breakdown\nstructure, which would be Check, and\n\n126\n00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:03.531\nI'm going back and looking at the results.\n\n127\n00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:06.224\nIf I did it correctly when I was in plan,\n\n128\n00:07:06.224 --> 00:07:09.663\nI would have set up some success metrics,\nright?\n\n129\n00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:13.523\nSo that when I get to check, or study,\nI know what it is I'm looking for.\n\n130\n00:07:13.523 --> 00:07:17.661\nSo plan, in the plan do check act,\ntakes longer than any other phase.\n\n131\n00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:20.260\nSo I'm in check, and\nI'm evaluating the results.\n\n132\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.590\nAnd this says the results of a pilot,\n\n133\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.531\nbecause PDCA is often\nused to pilot a project.\n\n134\n00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:30.890\nSo let's say I actually did a full\nDMAIC project, and I didn't really I\n\n135\n00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:36.088\nhaven't really done my pilot till\nI'm almost at the end of my DMAIC.\n\n136\n00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:40.834\nI could actually use my PDCA as\nthe pilot even though I'm working in\n\n137\n00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:42.115\na DMAIC program.\n\n138\n00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:45.992\nJust to see if my idea works, but\nit doesn't have to be a pilot.\n\n139\n00:07:45.992 --> 00:07:48.870\nAnd then I move over to four, maybe.\n\n140\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.315\n[LAUGH] I move over to four, and\nremember this is Act, Abandon, or Adopt.\n\n141\n00:07:54.315 --> 00:07:57.241\nNow if I'm going to Adopt, or Act.\n\n142\n00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:59.470\nI may need to go through the circle again.\n\n143\n00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.467\nIf I'm acting, I'm just done.\n\n144\n00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:06.124\nNow, what are some of the things\nthat are really interesting\n\n145\n00:08:06.124 --> 00:08:11.072\nabout the PDCA model is that I can\nuse it in a number of other ways.\n\n146\n00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:15.597\nFor example, in an interviewing, even\nthough we're talking about Lean Six Sigma.\n\n147\n00:08:15.597 --> 00:08:18.086\nIf you were in\nan interviewing situation and\n\n148\n00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:22.467\nyou were asked a hypothetical question and\nit's a popular way to interview.\n\n149\n00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:25.134\nI'm not saying it's good or\nbad, but it is a popular way,\n\n150\n00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:29.008\nwhere somebody throws you a scenario, and\nthey just wanna see how you reason it out.\n\n151\n00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.570\nIf you think in terms of plan,\nand then I would do,\n\n152\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.217\nand this is how I would check it.\n\n153\n00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:37.044\nAnd then I would make a decision from\nthere if I would act or abandon.\n\n154\n00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:42.157\nSo, you can also use that method to field\nhypothetical questions in an interview or\n\n155\n00:08:42.157 --> 00:08:45.531\nif you're kind of talking\nthings around in a meeting.\n\n156\n00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:49.319\nAnother place where the PDCA\nis really super valuable,\n\n157\n00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:54.167\nis if you're trying to pull your\npresentation together very quickly.\n\n158\n00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:58.107\nSomeone says, do you mind doing a quick\nreport on what you did last week?\n\n159\n00:08:58.107 --> 00:08:59.885\nAnd you did a lot of things, but\n\n160\n00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:04.133\nyou need to kind of laser focus on how\nto explain it and explain it quickly,\n\n161\n00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:07.719\ncuz maybe you only have five\nminutes to explain your project.\n\n162\n00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:11.779\nSo once again, if you think in terms\nof what I planned, what I did,\n\n163\n00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:12.877\nhow I checked it.\n\n164\n00:09:12.877 --> 00:09:15.410\nThen, you're gonna be\na little bit more successful.\n\n165\n00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.020\nSo Plan, Do,\n\n166\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.980\nCheck, Act, is a really simplistic model,\nbut it's incredibly powerful.\n\n167\n00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.940\nEspecially when you don't really\nhave time to do a full demand.\n\n168\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.140\n>> You know, I think the simplicity of\nthis model is why we see it used so\n\n169\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.640\nfrequently outside of\neven process improvement.\n\n170\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.888\nYou see it everywhere.\n\n171\n00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:36.470\nJust to use an IT example,\nwell if I have a new update that I need to\n\n172\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.480\nroll out some servers I'm not just\ngonna install it and say I'm done.\n\n173\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.425\nI don't just act and that's it, right?\n\n174\n00:09:42.425 --> 00:09:44.748\nI've got to plan when we're\ngoing to deploy that.\n\n175\n00:09:44.748 --> 00:09:48.879\nI have to test it out in a testing pool\nwith a couple of servers that aren't\n\n176\n00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:49.574\ncritical.\n\n177\n00:09:49.574 --> 00:09:52.204\nI need to check to verify that\nthe updates still work and\n\n178\n00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:55.649\nit didn't break all my software and\nany other services on the network.\n\n179\n00:09:55.649 --> 00:10:01.550\nAnd only when all that is done, am I ready\nto actually act I can push that out.\n\n180\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.686\nBut if I encounter problems\nduring that process.\n\n181\n00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.750\nI'm going right back to plan,\nor do, or check.\n\n182\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.677\nSo you'll kinda cycle through\nthis a good bit in that process.\n\n183\n00:10:09.677 --> 00:10:14.504\nAnd that's not a process improvement\nproject, that's just change management.\n\n184\n00:10:14.504 --> 00:10:18.315\nIt's applying and updating, making\nsure that you keep your network safe.\n\n185\n00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:21.241\nYou keep your systems up and\nthat it's all very accountable.\n\n186\n00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:24.490\nYou've got that kind of paper\nrecord of what's being done.\n\n187\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.230\nIt's really critical.\n\n188\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.065\nSo you'll see Plan, Do, Check, Act used\nin a number of different environments.\n\n189\n00:10:29.065 --> 00:10:32.146\nAnd you mentioned several of\nthe different names for it, and I know,\n\n190\n00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:34.006\nI've always called it the Deming Cycle,\n\n191\n00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:36.949\ncuz that was how I learned it in\nthe first textbook I read about it.\n\n192\n00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:39.224\nAnd it doesn't matter\nwhat name you give it.\n\n193\n00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:41.825\nIf you just kind of watch\nout there in the real world.\n\n194\n00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:45.436\nYou'll see people using that model\neven if they don't know what it is or\n\n195\n00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.769\nknow a single name for it.\n\n196\n00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:48.186\n>> Yeah.\n\n197\n00:10:48.186 --> 00:10:49.812\n>> That's definitely\none of the cooler ones.\n\n198\n00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:54.582\nNow the simplicity of it, it really is\nkind of one of the shining factors for it.\n\n199\n00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:58.947\nAnd what we've covered is probably all we\nreally need to know about PDCA, right?\n\n200\n00:10:58.947 --> 00:10:59.528\n>> Right.\n\n201\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:04.499\nI only have one other point to make, and\nthat's that when you're working with\n\n202\n00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:09.113\nthe DMAIC model, which we're gonna\nbe discussing in the next episode.\n\n203\n00:11:09.113 --> 00:11:14.081\nThe DMAIC model has additional tools\nthat you can apply to the PDCA.\n\n204\n00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:17.990\nSo the PDCA, comes with a certain\nset of project management tools.\n\n205\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.184\nAnd I've mentioned in other episodes,\n\n206\n00:11:20.184 --> 00:11:23.870\nproject management tools by default\nare also Lean Six Sigma tools.\n\n207\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.958\nCuz Lean Six Sigma uses all\nthe project management tools.\n\n208\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.728\nBut one of the things that Lean Six Sigma\ndoes with the PDCA, and you got kind of\n\n209\n00:11:30.728 --> 00:11:34.870\na slide of the DMAIC up there,\njust to kind of remember those steps.\n\n210\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:40.401\nIs that there are tools within the DMAIC\nthat, even though they are not\n\n211\n00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:45.849\nin the same order as PDCA, you can\napply to make the PDCA more robust.\n\n212\n00:11:45.849 --> 00:11:48.611\nSo, for example, do, which is execute.\n\n213\n00:11:48.611 --> 00:11:52.466\nHappens in the second\nphase of the PDCA model.\n\n214\n00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:56.413\nIt doesn't happen until the fourth\nphase of the DMAIC model.\n\n215\n00:11:56.413 --> 00:12:00.799\nBut those tools to execute, you can kind\nof slide those over to help you execute\n\n216\n00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:03.270\nbetter, faster, more cost effectively.\n\n217\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.650\n>> So using the example you gave of\nthe company that would have, you\n\n218\n00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.470\nhave to model something through PDCA first\nbefore you submit it to the full DMAIC.\n\n219\n00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.570\nIt's really just a matter of\ntaking that first set of data and\n\n220\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.520\nkind of bolting it into DMAIC so\nthey kind of are compatible.\n\n221\n00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.530\n>> Exactly.\n\n222\n00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.579\n>> Excellent.\n\n223\n00:12:24.579 --> 00:12:28.207\nAll right well,\nI know it's one of our shorter episodes.\n\n224\n00:12:28.207 --> 00:12:31.224\nWe don't have a ton to go in on\nPDCA not that it isn't important.\n\n225\n00:12:31.224 --> 00:12:33.640\nIt's just that it's simple, and\nthat's kinda the glory of it.\n\n226\n00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.695\nWe're certainly gonna spend\nquite a bit more time on DMAIC.\n\n227\n00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:39.539\nSo we'll get a chance to see\nthat coming up, but for now,\n\n228\n00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:43.467\nit's a pretty good spot for us to wrap\nthis one up, so let's close it off here.\n\n229\n00:12:43.467 --> 00:12:44.953\nI do thank you guys for watching.\n\n230\n00:12:44.953 --> 00:12:45.510\nStay tuned.\n\n231\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.808\nWe've got more Lean Six Sigma coming up.\n\n232\n00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.038\nI know I've left us with\na cliffhanger here, right?\n\n233\n00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:53.637\nDMAIC coming up, we're excited about\nthat so stay tuned for it as well.\n\n234\n00:12:53.637 --> 00:12:55.331\nAll right I hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n235\n00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:57.908\nSigning off for ITPROTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n236\n00:12:57.908 --> 00:13:00.556\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern\n>> And will see you next time.\n\n237\n00:13:00.556 --> 00:13:07.612\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

evening.\n\n4\n00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:17.326\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:21.784\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n6\n00:00:21.784 --> 00:00:25.849\nAnd today, this is gonna be a pretty\nexciting episode because we're kicking off\n\n7\n00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:26.880\nthe DMAIC process.\n\n8\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.652\nSo we've mentioned it in\nmore than one episode.\n\n9\n00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:31.408\nNow we're actually gonna take the deep\ndive in there and look at each of\n\n10\n00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:34.069\nthe different phases that make that\nprocess of seeing how it can be so\n\n11\n00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:35.345\nvaluable to our organization.\n\n12\n00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.156\nAnd back again to help me with this, we've\ngot Dr.Stern on the show, thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:40.090\nbeing back with us.\n\n14\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.054\n>> Thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:43.376\n>> And well, let's kick this thing off.\n\n16\n00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.024\nSo you wanna tell us a little bit about\nthe DMAIC process, and how that works?\n\n17\n00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:50.201\n>> I do, but\nbefore we get started on Define,\n\n18\n00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:55.766\nwhich is the very first phase of the DMAIC\nmodel, I wanna remind the viewers\n\n19\n00:00:55.766 --> 00:01:01.270\nthat the DMAIC model is the primary\nmodel used in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n20\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.310\nNow sometimes, you can't use the DMAIC,\nbecause you just don't have time to do it.\n\n21\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.670\nSo there's other models\nin the previous episode.\n\n22\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.510\nWe talked about PBCA, but primarily,\nyou're reaching for the DMAIC model.\n\n23\n00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.661\nNow the really wonderful thing\nabout the DMAIC model is that\n\n24\n00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.329\nyou can use it to do complete reports.\n\n25\n00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.959\nOr you can engage in something\nI call DMAIC thinking,\n\n26\n00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.939\nwhich means when you have\na smaller problem, like you don't\n\n27\n00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.926\nhave a huge problem that you're trying\nto solve that requires an entire report.\n\n28\n00:01:28.926 --> 00:01:33.154\nYou can just go through the phases of\nthe model and solve a lot of problems.\n\n29\n00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:38.546\n>> Yep, and so, like you said, even places\nthat use DMAIC as their primary model\n\n30\n00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:44.197\nmight also use PDCA just to get started\nquickly and then transition over to DMAIC.\n\n31\n00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:45.017\nIt's very powerful.\n\n32\n00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:46.549\nIt's got a lot of flexibility.\n\n33\n00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.274\nIt does break apart into five phases, and\n\n34\n00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.359\nthat's how we're gonna tackle it here,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.321\nSo, in this episode,\n\n36\n00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:54.630\nwe're gonna focus in on the first phase,\nwhich is the Define phase, right?\n\n37\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.905\n>> That's correct.\n\n38\n00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:58.173\nAnd the first thing I'd like to show is,\n\n39\n00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:00.919\nI have a slide that's\ncalled my activity sheet.\n\n40\n00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:04.641\nNow, this particular slide is also\npart of your course files, and\n\n41\n00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:08.637\nI know you can't really see it that well,\nbecause it's kind of small.\n\n42\n00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:11.093\nBut I wanted you to be aware of this, and\n\n43\n00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:14.970\nI will be referring back to this\ncollateral from time to time.\n\n44\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.220\nYou'll notice at the very top is the topic\nwe're gonna be talking about right now,\n\n45\n00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.356\nwhich is Define.\n\n46\n00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:24.963\nAnd in Define, the major goal\nis that when you leave Define,\n\n47\n00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:29.300\nyou wanna make sure that everyone\nunderstands what you're working on.\n\n48\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.782\nNow it's kind of funny because we\nused to say that everyone agrees\n\n49\n00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:35.013\nthat you're working on the right thing.\n\n50\n00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:39.378\nAnd that's almost impossible, but you\ndon't want anyone walking down the hall\n\n51\n00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:42.475\ngoing they have no clue what\nyou're working on, right?\n\n52\n00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:46.637\nSo part of that is just naming\nyour project something simple.\n\n53\n00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:49.419\nIt's kind of fun to have\na really exciting name, but\n\n54\n00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.707\nyou just want to name it something simple,\nso when you say it,\n\n55\n00:02:52.707 --> 00:02:55.379\npeople know exactly what\nyou're talking about.\n\n56\n00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.283\n>> And\nthat one almost seems like common sense.\n\n57\n00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:00.428\nYou'd think, why would I need to\nspecifically call this out, but\n\n58\n00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:04.191\nI personally have been on a project where\nafter the initial kick-off meeting,\n\n59\n00:03:04.191 --> 00:03:07.466\nI didn't really understand what\nthe project was trying to achieve.\n\n60\n00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:08.627\nIt certainly happens.\n\n61\n00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:12.828\nAnd if you're trying to improve a process,\nyou kinda need to understand exactly\n\n62\n00:03:12.828 --> 00:03:17.050\nwhat your goal is so, otherwise you\ndon't know what you've achieved, right?\n\n63\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.527\n>> Right.\n>> You don't know if you're victorious.\n\n64\n00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:19.718\n>> Exactly.\n\n65\n00:03:19.718 --> 00:03:21.152\nThat's some really good point.\n\n66\n00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:26.330\nOn the handout that you're looking at,\nI do wanna point out\n\n67\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.249\ntoo that it's divided into what\nthe phase is trying to accomplish.\n\n68\n00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:39.280\nIn the middle is the activities, and\non the far right hand side are the tools.\n\n69\n00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.729\nNow, this is not to say there aren't\nother activities and other tools.\n\n70\n00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.921\nThese are just the major activities and\ntools, and sometimes you use all of them,\n\n71\n00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:49.888\nsometimes you don't use any of them.\n\n72\n00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:54.424\nBut what it doesn't include on this\nhandout is industry specific tool, so\n\n73\n00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:56.584\nif you're in a specific industry,\n\n74\n00:03:56.584 --> 00:04:00.629\nsometimes you're gonna have tools\nthat no one else has in define.\n\n75\n00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.147\nSo I wanted to point that out, and then\nalso I'm gonna be taking this slide down\n\n76\n00:04:05.147 --> 00:04:07.620\nand referring back to\nit from time to time.\n\n77\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.291\nAnd I think we're just gonna launch\nright into Define right now.\n\n78\n00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:11.957\n>> Absolutely.\n\n79\n00:04:11.957 --> 00:04:15.189\nThat's where we're going to kick off\nour process improvement anyway, so\n\n80\n00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:16.583\nlet's start at the beginning.\n\n81\n00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:17.430\n>> Okay.\n\n82\n00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.896\nSo, my first slide says DMAIC activity,\nand that was the sheet that you looked at.\n\n83\n00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:26.080\nI want to warn you,\nbefore we move forward,\n\n84\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.569\nthat Define takes a lot longer\nto cover than the other phases.\n\n85\n00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.947\nPart of the reason is, in the DMAIC model,\nwe have Define, Measure,\n\n86\n00:04:34.947 --> 00:04:37.189\nAnalyze, Improve, and Control.\n\n87\n00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.315\nDefine, Measure, and Analyze are very,\nvery creative phases, and lots of choices.\n\n88\n00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:47.620\nSo, there's lots of things I can teach you\nand lots of directions that you can go in,\n\n89\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.582\nand however, when you get down\nto improving control, easy for\n\n90\n00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:55.137\nme to teach because it's a basic map,\nnot so easy to do.\n\n91\n00:04:55.137 --> 00:04:58.451\nBut it's just a list of things\nthat you have to make sure.\n\n92\n00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.765\nIt's almost like a check sheet.\n\n93\n00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:02.099\nSo we're gonna look at that,\nand I have some tips and\n\n94\n00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.823\ntricks when we get to those phases\nthat are going to help you.\n\n95\n00:05:04.823 --> 00:05:08.520\nSo don't be concerned if we're\nspending a lot of time in Define.\n\n96\n00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.680\nIn fact, the Lean Six Sigma saying is,\n\n97\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.940\nif you don't have a lot of time,\nyou spend it in Define.\n\n98\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.624\nWhy do you think that is, Don?\n\n99\n00:05:15.624 --> 00:05:18.185\n>> Well, if you make a mistake\nin the Define kind of phase,\n\n100\n00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:22.014\nat the very beginning, that's just gonna\ncascade through the rest of it, right?\n\n101\n00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:23.640\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n102\n00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.308\n>> And you know what?\n\n103\n00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:26.833\nWhile you talk about this, I always kind\nof put it in the frame of mind of project\n\n104\n00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.996\nmanagement, cuz that's where a lot\nof my experience comes from.\n\n105\n00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:32.811\nAnd we have the Plan phase at\nthe beginning, and if you have that bad\n\n106\n00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:36.714\nplanning, it just cascades and\nbecomes worse and worse and worse.\n\n107\n00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:39.723\nAnd if you're trying to improve a process,\nyou'll get that same effect.\n\n108\n00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:41.258\n>> Exactly.\n\n109\n00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:46.580\nSo, one of the things that I want to talk\nabout is the methodology behind the model.\n\n110\n00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.685\nAnd I did mention this briefly\nin another episode, but\n\n111\n00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:52.121\nI think it will help as\nwe move into Define.\n\n112\n00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.203\nIn normal problem solving, well, in fact,\nlet's say human problem solving.\n\n113\n00:05:57.203 --> 00:06:00.848\nSometimes in human problem solving,\nI will present a problem or an issue, and\n\n114\n00:06:00.848 --> 00:06:04.548\nkeep in mind, that when we say problem\nstatement, it could be an actual problem\n\n115\n00:06:04.548 --> 00:06:07.668\nwe're trying to solve, or\njust the task that we're trying to do.\n\n116\n00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.574\nBut let's say that I present\na problem to a friend.\n\n117\n00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:15.060\nSometimes I don't even get the problem\nout before my friend might say,\n\n118\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.920\nI know the solution to that problem,\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.070\nWell, so structured problem solving\nisn't really that much different.\n\n120\n00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.830\nWe put the problem out there, and\nthen we brainstorm a list of solutions.\n\n121\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.714\nAnd then we're supposed to pick a solution\nand then implement that solution, and\n\n122\n00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:36.136\nthen we're supposed to go back and\nkind of tweak that up.\n\n123\n00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:40.954\nAnd even in structured problem solving,\nwhich is a highly respected model and\n\n124\n00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:45.115\nthat we use in critical thinking,\na lot of times we drop the ball when\n\n125\n00:06:45.115 --> 00:06:48.049\nwe come to the part about\ntweaking the process.\n\n126\n00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:52.312\nI'm sure a lot of you have been subject\nto surveys, that the survey went out but\n\n127\n00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:55.948\nthen no one ever really got back\nwith you with the results, right?\n\n128\n00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:58.942\nSo this is the way the DMAIC\nmodel is different.\n\n129\n00:06:58.942 --> 00:07:03.901\nThe first and most primary thing\nis that we define, measure, and\n\n130\n00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:09.326\nanalyze before we even come up with\nthat brainstorm list of solutions.\n\n131\n00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:12.707\nSo we have a lot of information,\nand what ends up on that list,\n\n132\n00:07:12.707 --> 00:07:15.829\nand we're always shooting for\nthree to five solutions,\n\n133\n00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:20.137\nwhat ends up on that list is pretty\nviable, because we've done our research.\n\n134\n00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:22.232\nWe've done a lot of things upfront.\n\n135\n00:07:22.232 --> 00:07:26.466\nThe other thing I want to mention about\nthe DMAIC model before we move forward is\n\n136\n00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:28.337\nthat we don't actually execute.\n\n137\n00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:32.623\nRemember in the PDCA,\nwe execute in step two.\n\n138\n00:07:32.623 --> 00:07:33.612\nIn the DMAIC model,\n\n139\n00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:37.060\nwe don't actually start executing\nuntil the bottom part of Improve.\n\n140\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.880\nSo we have tons and tons of information.\n\n141\n00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.695\nThen finally, the other difference in this\nmodel as opposed to structured problem\n\n142\n00:07:46.695 --> 00:07:52.357\nsolving and also in projects in general is\nthat a project has a beginning and end.\n\n143\n00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:54.536\nAnd we talked about that\nin other episodes, right?\n\n144\n00:07:54.536 --> 00:07:59.465\nIn the DMAIC model,\nthere is a responsibility to\n\n145\n00:07:59.465 --> 00:08:05.670\ndocument how to keep that\nprocess improvement in place.\n\n146\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.800\nSo in the control phase of the DMAIC\nmodel, there's a lot of your typical close\n\n147\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.190\nout things that you would see in a regular\nproject management type scenario.\n\n148\n00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.510\nHowever, there's an extra\npiece in control that says,\n\n149\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.890\nwell there's two extra pieces in control.\n\n150\n00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.100\nOne piece is telling you this is what I\nset out to do, and this is what I did for\n\n151\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.000\nyou, and this is what I made,\nsaved, or avoided you spending.\n\n152\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.424\nIn other words, this is how I made\nthat process better, faster or\n\n153\n00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:34.619\nmore cost affective.\n\n154\n00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:37.288\nAnd the other part of\ncontrol is the biggest piece\n\n155\n00:08:37.288 --> 00:08:40.480\nthat's different from\nstructured problem solving, and\n\n156\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.555\nthat's a plan on how to keep\nthings going in the future.\n\n157\n00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:46.617\nSo having given you a brief\noverview of the DMAIC model,\n\n158\n00:08:46.617 --> 00:08:50.855\nthen we're gonna move into Define and\nremember that there is a handout that we\n\n159\n00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:55.440\nmight be referring to from time to time\nthat says, hey, these are the major tools.\n\n160\n00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.130\nThese are the major activities.\n\n161\n00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:00.411\nThis is the major thing\nthat I'm shooting for, but\n\n162\n00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:05.009\nyou can use lots of other things,\nincluding industry specific tools.\n\n163\n00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:08.729\n>> Now I know you compared this to a\nproject and how once we kick off the DMAIC\n\n164\n00:09:08.729 --> 00:09:12.579\nmodel, it really is a project, right,\nbut it is a little bit different.\n\n165\n00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:16.208\nWould you say that in a normal project,\nI'm always thinking about the end.\n\n166\n00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:18.832\nRight?\nAnd there's this well defined end.\n\n167\n00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:20.720\nBut when we apply the DMAIC model,\n\n168\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.918\ndo we just pretty much count\non having to start over again?\n\n169\n00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:26.679\nNot start from scratch, but\nthat we repeat the DMAIC model over and\n\n170\n00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:29.847\nover and over again, is that what makes\nit kind of different than a project?\n\n171\n00:09:29.847 --> 00:09:34.328\n>> Well, mostly it's that Control\nphase that makes it totally different.\n\n172\n00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:36.810\nAnd in the Control phase,\nI'm handing you a plan so\n\n173\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.669\nyou can move forward into the future.\n\n174\n00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:41.519\nBut you bring up a good point,\nand the point is\n\n175\n00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:46.175\nthat in the Six Sigma environment,\nthe DMAIC model is a waterfall model.\n\n176\n00:09:46.175 --> 00:09:49.220\nAnd I can't go back and forth.\n\n177\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.402\nHowever, in Lean Six Sigma,\nand if you observe the slide,\n\n178\n00:09:53.402 --> 00:09:56.423\nit's kind of thought of as more circular.\n\n179\n00:09:56.423 --> 00:10:00.799\nAnd so there would be times in a Lean\nSix Sigma project that you might go back\n\n180\n00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:03.339\naround in a circle like you do in a PDCA,\nbut\n\n181\n00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:07.952\nmost of the time we're hoping that when\nwe get to Control, that we're done.\n\n182\n00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:12.645\nAnd we're gonna give you a plan to\nkeep that continually improving.\n\n183\n00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:14.949\n>> All right, so\nit's not like there never is an end.\n\n184\n00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:19.435\nThere is eventually an end that we hit\nversus a project which just has that well\n\n185\n00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.272\ndefined end.\n\n186\n00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:24.101\n>> Exactly, the other thing that's kind\nof interesting about the DMAIC model in\n\n187\n00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:26.827\nLean Six Sigma,\nbecause a lot of times people say well,\n\n188\n00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:29.859\nwhat's the difference between\nSix Sigma and Lean Six Sigma?\n\n189\n00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:34.159\nAnd it's important to remember that in\nSix Sigma, you're using the same model.\n\n190\n00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:36.040\nYou're using the same tools.\n\n191\n00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.430\nYou're just approaching\nit slightly different.\n\n192\n00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.620\nOne of the things I just mentioned\nis in Six Sigma environment,\n\n193\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.990\nit's a waterfall method.\n\n194\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.838\nThe reason why it's waterfall is\nthat in Six Sigma environments,\n\n195\n00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:53.003\nthey're working on projects that may\nsave or avoid spending $250,000 or more.\n\n196\n00:10:53.003 --> 00:10:57.763\nSo, many times what happens is each one of\nthese phases are managed by a different\n\n197\n00:10:57.763 --> 00:10:59.513\npart of the company, right.\n\n198\n00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:03.274\nSo the leadership team might\nhave come up with Define, and\n\n199\n00:11:03.274 --> 00:11:06.825\nthen someone in the company\nmight do the measurement.\n\n200\n00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:10.609\nThey might even send\nthe Analyze piece off shore.\n\n201\n00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:16.018\nSo it's really important to have these\nwell-defined phases and not go backwards.\n\n202\n00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:19.837\nIn a Lean Six Sigma project,\nI have the same model, but\n\n203\n00:11:19.837 --> 00:11:23.252\nI'm managing that project\nfrom cradle to grey.\n\n204\n00:11:23.252 --> 00:11:25.547\nSo if I'm in Analyze, for example, and\n\n205\n00:11:25.547 --> 00:11:29.942\nI feel like I didn't truly define my\nprocesses, well, I can kind of go back.\n\n206\n00:11:29.942 --> 00:11:34.780\nI mean, it's certainly not the objective,\nbut nothing crazy happens if you do it.\n\n207\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.461\n>> Excellent.\n\n208\n00:11:36.461 --> 00:11:41.803\nSo, basically when we kick this thing off,\nwe're defining what that structure is.\n\n209\n00:11:41.803 --> 00:11:45.795\nAnd then we're really planning for that\nproject, we're getting things kicked off,\n\n210\n00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:48.638\nand do we follow our standard\nproject management standards,\n\n211\n00:11:48.638 --> 00:11:52.465\nwhere you have your project charter and\nall those other components like normal, or\n\n212\n00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:54.182\nis it done a little bit differently?\n\n213\n00:11:54.182 --> 00:11:55.343\n>> Well, absolutely.\n\n214\n00:11:55.343 --> 00:12:00.614\nWe have a project charter, and the thing\nthat's interesting is that in a project\n\n215\n00:12:00.614 --> 00:12:06.270\nProject charter for a actual project and\nremember projects we know the problem.\n\n216\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.410\nWe know the solution, right?\n\n217\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.530\nAnd we have kind of an idea of\nthe direction that we want to go.\n\n218\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.490\nSo, our project charter sometimes\nwill include an actual project plan.\n\n219\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.780\nIt may even be base lined,\n\n220\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.070\nwhich means that that project plan\nis giving whoever the sponsor is,\n\n221\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.660\nwho's ever signing off on it, it might\ngive them an idea of cost and time.\n\n222\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.360\nRight?\n\n223\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.550\nSo, in a process improvement\nproject charter and\n\n224\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.710\na sample of this charter is\nalso in your course files.\n\n225\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:41.200\nEven though the fields look very much\nthe same in a process improvement,\n\n226\n00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.980\nyou wanna approach it more like it's\na proposal because the idea for\n\n227\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.000\na process improvement project charter,\neven though.\n\n228\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.510\nThough the fields and the dynamics are the\nsame, I'm just trying to get permission to\n\n229\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.460\nwork on the problem because I'm\ntelling you I know this problem.\n\n230\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.510\nI just don't know the solution and I think\nif we solve this problem I can make, save,\n\n231\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.010\nor avoid spending a certain\n\n232\n00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.430\namount of money which is called\nprojected return on investment.\n\n233\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.010\nI believe I could do that and I just need\npermission to go ahead and pursue that and\n\n234\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.340\nthat would be where we move\ninto the measurement phase.\n\n235\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.330\nThe cool thing is that the define phase\ngives us all kinds of tools to come up\n\n236\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.360\nwith the verbiage for\nthat process improvement project charter.\n\n237\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.495\n>> Excellent so, once we kick that off.\n\n238\n00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:29.980\nOnce we kind of move forward,\nwhat's our next step?\n\n239\n00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.600\n>> Okay, so we picked the method and\nwe're saying that the method we\n\n240\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.146\npicked was defined and I like a goal\nwithout a plan is just a wish.\n\n241\n00:13:39.146 --> 00:13:44.125\nIt's just sort of one of those\nthings that kind of gets me centered\n\n242\n00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.940\nwhen I'm thinking about a project.\n\n243\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.590\nIn the define phase,\nthe slide that you're seeing\n\n244\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.810\nright now is kind of something you\nwould see in an average textbook.\n\n245\n00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:01.370\nMost textbooks that cover the model still\nfollow instructional systems design and\n\n246\n00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.400\none of the common things that happens in\ninstructional systems design is that at\n\n247\n00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.790\nthe beginning of the chapter they'll say\nthese are the things we're gonna cover and\n\n248\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.910\nthey take each bullet point and cover it\nexclusively and at the very end they have\n\n249\n00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.280\na summary and they go back over and\ngive you a conclusion, right?\n\n250\n00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.960\nSo, I just wanted you to see an example\nof the things that could be covered and\n\n251\n00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.470\ndefined in the textbook.\n\n252\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.530\nWe're going to cover these\nthings a lot more quickly.\n\n253\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.450\nSo, what you're looking at right now is\na slide right on define a lot to absorb.\n\n254\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.600\nWe're going to be covering this\nlike I said very, very quickly.\n\n255\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.040\nSo, you might wanna take a moment and\n\n256\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.830\npause the tape just to\nlook through these items.\n\n257\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.090\nNow the key tools in define\nare your project charter and\n\n258\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.280\nwe've already spent a little\nbit of time talking about that.\n\n259\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:51.120\nProcess mapping and\nthat can take a couple of different forms.\n\n260\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.307\nTwo forms it can take is just\na regular flowchart where\n\n261\n00:14:56.307 --> 00:15:00.890\nyou say step by step what is\nhappening in the current process and\n\n262\n00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.620\nremember we can't improve a process unless\nwe know what is going on right now.\n\n263\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.650\nSo, one method is you could just use\na flow chart to build a process map.\n\n264\n00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.290\nAnother method that's very popular\n\n265\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:17.800\nin lien sig sigma is something\ncalled a value stream map.\n\n266\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.050\nThe way a value stream map differs from\na process map is that the name of the game\n\n267\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.590\nin a process map is to try to find\nevery single thing that's going\n\n268\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.980\non in that process cuz you're looking for\nprocess improvement, right?\n\n269\n00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.420\nIn a value stream map,\n\n270\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.180\nyou're only documenting the essential\nthings that are happening in that stream.\n\n271\n00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:39.332\nSo, you're looking at your process cradle\nto grave and on your value stream map\n\n272\n00:15:39.332 --> 00:15:45.310\nyou're only recording the things\nthat you absolutely have to do.\n\n273\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.570\nSo, if it's something that's just nice\nto do, let's say you go to the dentist's\n\n274\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.960\noffice and the receptionist greets you and\nasks you would you like some coffee.\n\n275\n00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.230\nThat's a nicety but it's not necessary for\nyou to get to see the dentist.\n\n276\n00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.580\nSo, you would only do those\nessential functions and\n\n277\n00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.480\nanother way to think about it is if you\ntook that off the map, the process,\n\n278\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.630\nproject, or product, or\nservice, won't go out the door.\n\n279\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.120\nIf that one thing was missing,\nthings aren't gonna happen.\n\n280\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.680\nThere are other ways that you can\ndocument your process map as well like\n\n281\n00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.070\nswimlane charts and spaghetti diagrams so\nit's not just those two, but those are two\n\n282\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:26.700\nof the most popular ones to get a really\nquick idea of what's going on right now.\n\n283\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.010\nThen another thing that's a good tool\nif you're in a project management\n\n284\n00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.300\nenvironment is something\ncalled a Deamic WBS.\n\n285\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.290\nNow remember from previous episode,\n\n286\n00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:39.920\nwe identified the WBS as\nthe Work Breakdown Structure and\n\n287\n00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.600\na Work Breakdown Structure is\nsimply an outline that says,\n\n288\n00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.390\nfirst I'm gonna do this, second I'm gonna\ndo that, third I'm gonna do this and\n\n289\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.500\nthen under 1, you would have 1.1, 1.2,\nand under 1.2, you might have 1.2.1.\n\n290\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.430\nRight?\nSo, in a project management environment,\n\n291\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.430\nas we mentioned about the project charter,\nsometimes the project charter actually\n\n292\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:03.290\ncomes with the project plan,\nthat has a work breakdown structure.\n\n293\n00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:08.630\nIn the DMAIC scenario, you don't know\nhow long the project's gonna take.\n\n294\n00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.440\nYou can't baseline.\n\n295\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.777\nYou're not even really sure\nwhat your next step is.\n\n296\n00:17:12.777 --> 00:17:18.015\nYou're hoping define will help you come\nup with things to do and measure but\n\n297\n00:17:18.015 --> 00:17:23.335\nyou could take the define model and\nyou could make define one, measure two,\n\n298\n00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:28.407\nanalyze three, improve four,\ncontrol five, and under those you could\n\n299\n00:17:28.407 --> 00:17:33.174\nlist generic things that need to\nhappen in each one of those phases.\n\n300\n00:17:33.174 --> 00:17:37.616\nSo, if you're working with a boss\nwho typically has a project\n\n301\n00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:42.325\nmanagement mindset,\nthere's something you can show and tell.\n\n302\n00:17:42.325 --> 00:17:45.337\n>> Right and I know that's where I\nwould snap into something like this is,\n\n303\n00:17:45.337 --> 00:17:47.094\nI work with breakdown structures and so,\n\n304\n00:17:47.094 --> 00:17:50.405\nwe take it and we start at that high level\nand we start doing the decomposition,\n\n305\n00:17:50.405 --> 00:17:53.116\nwhere you start breaking them down\ninto actual work packages and\n\n306\n00:17:53.116 --> 00:17:56.579\nif you have a scheduling coordinator, it's\nthe packages you turn over to them and\n\n307\n00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:58.626\nstart kind of actually\nbuilding the schedule.\n\n308\n00:17:58.626 --> 00:17:59.717\nBuilding your budget around that.\n\n309\n00:17:59.717 --> 00:18:00.692\nAssigning your resources.\n\n310\n00:18:00.692 --> 00:18:01.478\nRight?\nWe get into\n\n311\n00:18:01.478 --> 00:18:03.524\nfull-on project management\nmode at that point.\n\n312\n00:18:03.524 --> 00:18:04.593\nNot so much.\n\n313\n00:18:04.593 --> 00:18:06.054\nIt is process improvement, but\n\n314\n00:18:06.054 --> 00:18:09.416\nwe're using all those tools from\nthe project management world, right?\n\n315\n00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:12.780\n>> Exactly.\n\n316\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.524\n>> Now once that's done,\nonce we've generated that WBS and\n\n317\n00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:19.780\nwe might have to iterate a few times\nto get it structured and contain\n\n318\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.610\nall the components we need but once we\nget that done, where do we go next?\n\n319\n00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.920\n>> Well, once we get that, and it's not\nsomething that you always have to use.\n\n320\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.220\nA lot of times it's something where\nyou'll decide if this is the environment.\n\n321\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.190\nIf you're working in an environment that\ndoesn't particularly care about the model\n\n322\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.240\nthat you're using, then maybe that\nparticular tool wouldn't be necessary.\n\n323\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.490\nOne of the things that you wanna remember\nin Define is Define's very creative and\n\n324\n00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.340\nthere's only two rules.\n\n325\n00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.200\nOne rule is that you have\nto have a process map.\n\n326\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.810\nYou have to document\nthe existing process and\n\n327\n00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.010\nas we mentioned, there's a couple\ndifferent ways you can do that and\n\n328\n00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.340\nnumber two, you can't leave\nDefine without a project charter.\n\n329\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.990\nSo, you could actually start\nDefine with a project charter.\n\n330\n00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.540\nYou just can't.\n\n331\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.100\nYou could actually have a project charter\nand the enter in Define but you can't\n\n332\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.970\nleave define without a project charter so\nI just want to point out that all these\n\n333\n00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:16.320\nother things are just ways to get from\nthe process map to the project charter.\n\n334\n00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.640\nTools we know that can help us do that are\nthe 5 Whys, Tim Woods, which we covered\n\n335\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.610\nin a previous episode, a process map which\nwe just talked about and again the WBS.\n\n336\n00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:30.060\nSo, those are things that\nwe know can get us from\n\n337\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.570\nthe beginning of define\nto the end of define and\n\n338\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.040\nsome of these tools are more sophisticated\nand more complicated than others.\n\n339\n00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.160\nThe rule in lean Six Sigma, which is\nanother rule that's slightly different\n\n340\n00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.400\nfrom Six Sigma, is start with the easiest\ntool first because that might actually\n\n341\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.690\nsolve the problem and then if you have\nto move up to a more sophisticated tool,\n\n342\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.120\nyou'll actually have the information\nfrom the easier tool and\n\n343\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.780\nit will make that more\ncomplicated tool easier.\n\n344\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.550\nSo, one of the tools that I'd like to talk\nabout first because it's just a fun tool,\n\n345\n00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:06.380\nis the 5 Whys and so, I'm going to\nbe bringing up another presentation\n\n346\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.465\nand Don have you had any\nexperience with the 5 whys?\n\n347\n00:20:11.465 --> 00:20:13.714\n>> The 5 whys are kind of interesting.\n\n348\n00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:15.833\nIf you're asking yourself,\nwhat are the 5 whys,\n\n349\n00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:19.104\nwell the odds are you've probably\nactually dealt with these before, right.\n\n350\n00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:20.869\nWhen you have a problem.\n\n351\n00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:24.034\nIf we go back to one of our early\nepisodes, where we said Process\n\n352\n00:20:24.034 --> 00:20:27.997\nimprovement is all about having a problem\nand not knowing a solution, right?\n\n353\n00:20:27.997 --> 00:20:32.417\nSo the five lives are all to help us\nunderstand not just what our problem is,\n\n354\n00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:35.027\nbut what leads to\nthe cause of that problem.\n\n355\n00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:38.672\nIt's almost like a root cause analysis,\nwould you say?\n\n356\n00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:39.668\n>> Yeah, it is.\nIn fact,\n\n357\n00:20:39.668 --> 00:20:43.903\noften it's refered to as an RCA tool,\nwhich stands for root cause analysis.\n\n358\n00:20:43.903 --> 00:20:48.643\nI have a slide up that's kind of a fun\nexample, and, Don, if you don't mind going\n\n359\n00:20:48.643 --> 00:20:53.387\nthrough this, I'll start it off, and\nthen if you could answer these questions,\n\n360\n00:20:53.387 --> 00:20:57.150\nand you can follow along in\nthe audience if you'd like.\n\n361\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.989\nYou're on your way home from work and\nyour car stops.\n\n362\n00:20:58.989 --> 00:21:00.150\nWhy did your car stop?\n\n363\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.764\n>> All right, well.\n\n364\n00:21:01.764 --> 00:21:03.784\nWe have to think about why it happened,\nright?\n\n365\n00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:05.524\nSo in this scenario,\nmaybe I ran out of gas.\n\n366\n00:21:05.524 --> 00:21:07.313\n>> And why did you run out of gas?\n\n367\n00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:12.176\n>> So, I ran out of gas because\nI didn't put more gas in the car\n\n368\n00:21:12.176 --> 00:21:14.270\nwhen it was running low.\n\n369\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.700\n>> And\nwhy didn't you buy gas this morning?\n\n370\n00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.222\n>> Well, I know in our example,\nbecause I didn't have any money.\n\n371\n00:21:19.222 --> 00:21:20.918\nIn real life,\nI hate going to the gas station.\n\n372\n00:21:20.918 --> 00:21:22.659\nSo, any one of those scenarios.\n\n373\n00:21:22.659 --> 00:21:24.958\n>> [LAUGH] And\nwhy didn't you have any money?\n\n374\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:28.081\n>> Because I lost it all\nlast night at a poker game.\n\n375\n00:21:28.081 --> 00:21:32.595\n>> So this is a common example that\nyou'll see when people are talking about\n\n376\n00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:33.338\nFive Whys.\n\n377\n00:21:33.338 --> 00:21:37.875\nWhy I like this example is that if you\nnotice and you're looking at your slide,\n\n378\n00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:39.476\nwe only ask why four times.\n\n379\n00:21:39.476 --> 00:21:42.373\nSo even though it's called The Five Whys,\n\n380\n00:21:42.373 --> 00:21:45.354\nyou might get your answer\nin the second why.\n\n381\n00:21:45.354 --> 00:21:48.362\nAnd if you're just on the verge\nof getting your answer,\n\n382\n00:21:48.362 --> 00:21:52.152\nLean Six Sigma doesn't care if you\nhave to ask a sixth and seventh why.\n\n383\n00:21:52.152 --> 00:21:54.568\nThe theory is, if I ask why five times,\n\n384\n00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:59.621\nI keep packaging it back to you after five\ntimes, that I probably need to bump up and\n\n385\n00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:03.602\nuse some more sophisticated tools,\nthis isn't gonna help me.\n\n386\n00:22:03.602 --> 00:22:07.798\nAlso you wanna use some caution, when you\nare using the Five Whys, if you are in\n\n387\n00:22:07.798 --> 00:22:12.645\nthe Advisory role, and you're talking to a\nsubordinate, it can be quite intimidating.\n\n388\n00:22:12.645 --> 00:22:14.963\nSo you might wanna let\nthem in on the game.\n\n389\n00:22:14.963 --> 00:22:16.129\nRight?\nNow in reality,\n\n390\n00:22:16.129 --> 00:22:19.969\nit's more likely you would\nhave a question such as this.\n\n391\n00:22:19.969 --> 00:22:23.945\nCustomers are unhappy because they're\nbeing shipped products that don't meet\n\n392\n00:22:23.945 --> 00:22:25.122\ntheir specification.\n\n393\n00:22:25.122 --> 00:22:28.003\nSo, Don, in that case,\nwhat would be your first why?\n\n394\n00:22:28.003 --> 00:22:28.570\n>> All right.\n\n395\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.858\nSo if we know that our customers are\nunhappy that we've been delivering this\n\n396\n00:22:32.858 --> 00:22:34.139\nproduct, the first.\n\n397\n00:22:34.139 --> 00:22:37.494\nQuestion will probably start at a high\nlevel like why are they unhappy?\n\n398\n00:22:37.494 --> 00:22:40.486\n>> Exactly and we could also\nsay it in another way such as\n\n399\n00:22:40.486 --> 00:22:45.750\nwhy are they being shipped products that\ndon't meet their specifications, right?\n\n400\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.690\n>> Right.\n\n401\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.470\n>> And so the Five Whys can take two\ndifferent directions so is that okay?\n\n402\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.207\nAbsolutely.\nBecause remember Lean 6 Sigma is all about\n\n403\n00:22:53.207 --> 00:22:58.000\ncapitalizing on your critical thinking\nskills, getting your own mind thinking\n\n404\n00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.509\nbecause Lean 6 Sigma partners with\nyour own subject matter expertise, and\n\n405\n00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:05.196\nthese are just tools to\nget the ball rolling.\n\n406\n00:23:05.196 --> 00:23:07.728\nRight?\nSo, I think it would be kind of fun to do\n\n407\n00:23:07.728 --> 00:23:11.860\nsome practice and if you're sitting with\nsomeone out there I would like you to\n\n408\n00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.423\npause the tape and\ndo some practice on your own.\n\n409\n00:23:14.423 --> 00:23:18.538\nI'm going to introduce a couple of things\nwe can practice on and I think Don and\n\n410\n00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:20.010\nI will do one or two of them.\n\n411\n00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.400\n>> Sure.\n\n412\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.713\n>> Okay, so if you have your own idea,\nthen, you know, go ahead\n\n413\n00:23:24.713 --> 00:23:26.455\n>> Go ahead and practice on that one,\n\n414\n00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:30.599\nbut if you don't have an idea, these are\ngood ones, and Don, do any of those sound\n\n415\n00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:34.407\nappealing to you or would you to possibly\nlike to choose your own question?\n\n416\n00:23:34.407 --> 00:23:37.390\n>> All right, let's do,\nI'm always late to work.\n\n417\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.364\n>> Why are you always late to work?\n\n418\n00:23:39.364 --> 00:23:43.496\n>> Because I hit traffic on\nthe road on the way here.\n\n419\n00:23:43.496 --> 00:23:45.390\n>> And why do you hit traffic on the way?\n\n420\n00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.383\n>> Because when I leave at\neight o'clock in the morning,\n\n421\n00:23:48.383 --> 00:23:51.516\nthere's school zones that I hit,\nand they slow me down.\n\n422\n00:23:51.516 --> 00:23:55.522\n>> And why do you allow those\nschool zones to slow you down?\n\n423\n00:23:55.522 --> 00:24:01.465\n>> Because I don't wanna leave earlier\nbecause I don't get up in time.\n\n424\n00:24:01.465 --> 00:24:03.068\n>> Okay.\nSo the root cause.\n\n425\n00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:04.888\nIn this particular scenario,\n\n426\n00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:08.670\nwhat we're gonna say is the root\ncause of Don being late to work.\n\n427\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:09.265\nBut he's really not.\n\n428\n00:24:09.265 --> 00:24:10.851\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz it's just a hypothetical scenario.\n\n429\n00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:15.193\nThat the reason he's late to work is\nbecause he doesn't want to get up early.\n\n430\n00:24:15.193 --> 00:24:19.707\nNow, if we had taken another example\nlike why is my closet a mess,\n\n431\n00:24:19.707 --> 00:24:25.227\nthe beauty of the five whys is that if\nsomeone said, my closet is a mess, right?\n\n432\n00:24:25.227 --> 00:24:31.113\nWe might immediately jump to I\nhave someone who cleans closets or\n\n433\n00:24:31.113 --> 00:24:35.910\nI just bought this great closet organizer,\nright?\n\n434\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.918\nWe might go ahead and\ntry to tackle that problem.\n\n435\n00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:42.624\nWhen if we went through the Five Why\nscenario just like we did on being\n\n436\n00:24:42.624 --> 00:24:47.346\nlate to work, we might discover\nthat the person is staying at work.\n\n437\n00:24:47.346 --> 00:24:49.270\nThey don't have time to\nclean their closet, right?\n\n438\n00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.074\nAnd so the root cause of their closet\nbeing a mess is because they're staying\n\n439\n00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:53.975\nat work too long.\n\n440\n00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:57.492\nThey get there late so\nof course they have to stay later, right?\n\n441\n00:24:57.492 --> 00:25:00.373\nAnd so that's the problem\nthat we want to tackle and\n\n442\n00:25:00.373 --> 00:25:02.852\nthat's I think the beauty\nof the Five Whys.\n\n443\n00:25:02.852 --> 00:25:07.952\nNow I'm gonna go back to my normal\npresentation I just wanted to deviate\n\n444\n00:25:07.952 --> 00:25:12.464\na bit to let you know that the tools\nthat are covered in the define\n\n445\n00:25:13.497 --> 00:25:17.874\nPhase, sorry, sorry [LAUGH].\n\n446\n00:25:17.874 --> 00:25:19.135\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n447\n00:25:19.135 --> 00:25:23.156\nI struggle with that sometimes\nbecause some books call them phases,\n\n448\n00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:27.867\nsome people call them stages, but in the\ndefine phase, one of the things that you\n\n449\n00:25:27.867 --> 00:25:32.819\ncan do are these really simple tools, so\nthings don't have to be as complicated as.\n\n450\n00:25:32.819 --> 00:25:36.776\n>> And you know, the Five Whys\nare a great example of a really simple,\n\n451\n00:25:36.776 --> 00:25:37.847\neasy to use tool.\n\n452\n00:25:37.847 --> 00:25:39.960\nWho’s the best practitioner of the 5 Whys?\n\n453\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.458\nA four year old child.\n\n454\n00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:42.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think we’ve all had that, you know?\n\n455\n00:25:42.979 --> 00:25:43.942\nWhy is the sky blue?\n\n456\n00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.903\nWell the sun reflects off the ocean.\n\n457\n00:25:45.903 --> 00:25:48.400\nWait, why does the sun\nreflect off the ocean, right?\n\n458\n00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.945\nAnd they start drilling you down with\nthe whys until eventually you get\n\n459\n00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:54.770\nto an answer that actually\nsolves the problem.\n\n460\n00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:58.212\nAs adults, we usually get to an answer\nss a child, the whys just continue and.\n\n461\n00:25:58.212 --> 00:25:58.718\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n462\n00:25:58.718 --> 00:25:59.736\n>> You get the 200 whys for them.\n\n463\n00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:02.840\nBut It just shows how it's almost\ningrained in our inquisitive nature to do\n\n464\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.370\nit this way, but I like what you\nsaid about you probably want to let\n\n465\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.982\nyour coworkers in on the game, because.\n\n466\n00:26:07.982 --> 00:26:08.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Otherwise,\n\n467\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.040\nthey're gonna think you're an annoying\nfour-year-old, but it is a great, very\n\n468\n00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.810\neasy to use tool versus some of the more\nadvanced things that we can go through for\n\n469\n00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:18.220\ndoing root cause analysis.\n\n470\n00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.380\n>> Exactly, and when you hear the term,\nroot cause analysis,\n\n471\n00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.010\nyou could go all the way over to the dark\nside, which black belts and master black\n\n472\n00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.590\nblack belts work on where they are doing\nthings such as hypothesis analysis and\n\n473\n00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.970\ndesign of experiments.\n\n474\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.975\nBut even in those scenarios, Lean Six\nSigma says even when you’re working with\n\n475\n00:26:33.975 --> 00:26:36.867\nsomething complicated start\nwith that easy tool first.\n\n476\n00:26:36.867 --> 00:26:39.685\nBecause that tool’s gonna\ngive you some information and\n\n477\n00:26:39.685 --> 00:26:41.156\nyou might solve the problem.\n\n478\n00:26:41.156 --> 00:26:45.705\nSo back to our presentation, tools we\nknow that are going to help us in define\n\n479\n00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:50.414\nare the 5 Whys, which we just saw an\nexample of, SIPOC which is very similar.\n\n480\n00:26:50.414 --> 00:26:53.612\nIf you were watching\nthe episode on Tim Woods,\n\n481\n00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:59.606\nit's very similar that type of exercise,\nbecause it's structured brainstorming.\n\n482\n00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:03.895\nAnd we called structured brainstorming\nwhen we have a list of ideas, but\n\n483\n00:27:03.895 --> 00:27:06.935\nwe kind of jump over to\nthe affinity diagram first.\n\n484\n00:27:06.935 --> 00:27:10.342\nSo in regular brainstorming we say\nwe just write everything down and\n\n485\n00:27:10.342 --> 00:27:12.909\nif we have too many things and\nwe put it in buckets and\n\n486\n00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:15.682\nstructured brainstorming\ndtarts from the other way.\n\n487\n00:27:15.682 --> 00:27:19.402\nAnd SIPOC stands for Suppliers Input\nProcess Output and Customer, and\n\n488\n00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:22.507\nlike I said, we'll be working\non an exercise in that area.\n\n489\n00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:27.221\nTim Woods we covered in another episode,\nbut the reason why it's here is\n\n490\n00:27:27.221 --> 00:27:32.182\nit's possible you already have a project\ncharter before you enter define.\n\n491\n00:27:32.182 --> 00:27:35.160\nHowever, you could\npossibly enter define and\n\n492\n00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.271\nnot have a clue what you need to work on,\nand SIPOC along with Tim Woods could help\n\n493\n00:27:40.271 --> 00:27:45.106\nyou possibly identify some waste or\nan area that you wanna start studying.\n\n494\n00:27:45.106 --> 00:27:50.632\nSo, and a process map which we’ve\ncovered a lot and also that WBS.\n\n495\n00:27:50.632 --> 00:27:54.347\n>> All right so, we’ve got a lot of great\ntools to help us defining, with getting\n\n496\n00:27:54.347 --> 00:27:58.593\nour system moving along, getting into the\nprocess improvements actually gonna occur.\n\n497\n00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:01.193\nI know we’ve got a lot more to talk\nabout with the define phase, but\n\n498\n00:28:01.193 --> 00:28:02.872\nwe’re kind of out of time on this episode.\n\n499\n00:28:02.872 --> 00:28:06.722\nDo you have any last thoughts you want to\nimpart on our viewers before we wrap up?\n\n500\n00:28:06.722 --> 00:28:10.530\n>> Just that to remember define is so\ncreative.\n\n501\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:11.923\nThere's two rules.\n\n502\n00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.165\nAnd this is very important.\n\n503\n00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:16.520\nThe two rules is that in define,\nyou have to have a process map and\n\n504\n00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.586\nyou have to end with a project charter.\n\n505\n00:28:18.586 --> 00:28:19.446\n>> All right.\n\n506\n00:28:19.446 --> 00:28:21.929\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n507\n00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:22.993\nStay tuned.\nWe've got more\n\n508\n00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:25.964\nof the Define phase coming up and\nthen the whole rest of the model coming.\n\n509\n00:28:25.964 --> 00:28:29.366\nMoving down the line too,\nyou don't want to miss out on that.\n\n510\n00:28:29.366 --> 00:28:30.794\nSo stay tuned and\nkeep your eyes on the screen.\n\n511\n00:28:30.794 --> 00:28:34.590\nBut for right now for this episode,\nwe're going to go ahead and sign off.\n\n512\n00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.132\nSo signing off for\nIT

00:00:24.680\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna be continuing on with D,\n\n6\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.604\nthe define phase that we kind of started\nwith the DMAIC model in the last episode,\n\n7\n00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:30.005\nand ran out of time, right?\n\n8\n00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.588\nWe talked about some of the tools, but\nwe've got a lot more to go over here.\n\n9\n00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.672\nSo we're gonna be kicking\nback off with that.\n\n10\n00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:38.797\nAnd back here to help with this,\nwe've got Dr. Stern on the show again.\n\n11\n00:00:38.797 --> 00:00:40.755\nAnd Dr. Stern, where do we wanna start?\n\n12\n00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:45.094\n>> Well I think I'd like to start\naddressing some more tools in the define\n\n13\n00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.680\nphase, because there's tons of tools.\n\n14\n00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.704\nAnd as we mentioned in\nthe previous episode,\n\n15\n00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:52.381\nIf you don't have a lot of time\nyou wanna spend it in Define.\n\n16\n00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.452\nAnd I just wanna remind you\nof the goal in Define is that\n\n17\n00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.731\nwe don't wanna leave Define\nwithout a project charter,\n\n18\n00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:03.512\nbut we also wanna make absolutely sure\nthat everyone knows what we're working on,\n\n19\n00:01:03.512 --> 00:01:07.088\nand we wanna make sure that we're\nworking on the right issue.\n\n20\n00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:10.799\nOne of the beauties of the DMAIC\nmodel is that attention to,\n\n21\n00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.963\nam I working on the right problem?\n\n22\n00:01:12.963 --> 00:01:17.172\nI've mentioned in many episodes that\nwe have a tendency to be reactive,\n\n23\n00:01:17.172 --> 00:01:18.213\nsomeone runs in.\n\n24\n00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:21.520\nIn our last episode we had\nthe opportunity to look at five Y's and\n\n25\n00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.922\nwe could even be working\non the wrong problem.\n\n26\n00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:27.895\nSo Define is just as much about making\nsure you know what you're working on,\n\n27\n00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:31.496\nas the people that you're working for\nknow what you're working on,\n\n28\n00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:32.630\nif that makes sense.\n\n29\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.006\n>> Absolutely, and we talked about\nsome of the ways to do that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:40.506\nWe touched on the WBS\na couple of times now.\n\n31\n00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.796\nThat's one that we've seen.\n\n32\n00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.515\nBut there are a few other tools that we\nlooked at that we haven't really spent\n\n33\n00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:45.630\na lot of time on yet, correct?\n\n34\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.885\n>> That's correct.\nAnd one that we didn't get to address\n\n35\n00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:54.131\nfully in the last episode is the very\npowerful tool called the SIPOC.\n\n36\n00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:58.980\nAnd the SIPOC works an awful lot like Tim\nWoods, so if you saw that episode you'll\n\n37\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.422\nknow that this is a structured\nbrainstorming exercise.\n\n38\n00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:06.880\nAnd the SIPOC is used kind of to\nreplace the old quality circles.\n\n39\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.561\nIn the TQM days, one of the things\nthat happened was people started\n\n40\n00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:16.922\nrealizing that we need to talk to\nthe people who actually touch the process.\n\n41\n00:02:16.922 --> 00:02:21.256\nAnd so quality circles, which still happen\nsometimes in manufacturing environments,\n\n42\n00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:24.954\nquality circles bring everyone that's\nworking together on the process and\n\n43\n00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:26.297\nthey have a conversation.\n\n44\n00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:31.422\nOver the years, sometimes it's turned\nout that that's just not cost effective.\n\n45\n00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:35.356\nAnd sometimes there's challenges,\nlike people are in different buildings or\n\n46\n00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.422\neven in different countries sometimes.\n\n47\n00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:40.927\nSo, the SIPOC is a way to quickly\nidentify the players on the process\n\n48\n00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:45.296\nthat you're working on, and then make sure\nthat you're including everyone in that\n\n49\n00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:48.088\ncircle when you're doing\nthe process improvement.\n\n50\n00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:54.213\nSo, SIPOC is, as I mentioned earlier,\nkind of replaces those quality circles.\n\n51\n00:02:54.213 --> 00:02:58.559\nYou'll see that SIPOC stands for\nsuppliers, input,\n\n52\n00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.213\nprocess, output and customer.\n\n53\n00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.714\nIt's not as jazzy as Tim Woods.\n\n54\n00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:06.172\nTim Woods is a little easier for\nme to remember.\n\n55\n00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:11.630\nI have heard people call this a SIPOC but\ntechnically it's called a SIPOC.\n\n56\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.446\nBut again structured brainstorming,\nand the idea here,\n\n57\n00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:17.505\nI'm gonna show you some other\nways that you can use this model.\n\n58\n00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:21.442\nBut when you're in Define and\nyou're using the SIPOC model,\n\n59\n00:03:21.442 --> 00:03:24.631\nwhat we're trying to do\nis identify the players.\n\n60\n00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:28.870\nAnd Don, I'd just like to talk a little\nbit about what is value in that,\n\n61\n00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.838\njust in general, about knowing\nwho's involved in your project?\n\n62\n00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:36.297\n>> Well, if you think about it, we're\ntrying to do process improvement, right?\n\n63\n00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.672\nAnd, when you're talking of process\nimprovement, that means there's probably\n\n64\n00:03:39.672 --> 00:03:42.673\nsomething wrong, and if we can improve\non it, we can make things better.\n\n65\n00:03:42.673 --> 00:03:46.672\nWell, where could the possible\nsources of that problem be?\n\n66\n00:03:46.672 --> 00:03:50.030\nThere's a lot of people involved\nin any given process, and so\n\n67\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.099\nlooking at this list, when you see\nsupplier, input, process, output,\n\n68\n00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.797\ncustomer, it just reads as a list\nof possible sources of a problem.\n\n69\n00:03:57.797 --> 00:04:00.058\nI could have a problem at any\none of these spots, and so\n\n70\n00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:03.797\nI'm gonna need feedback and input from all\nof them to make that determination, right?\n\n71\n00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:08.778\n>> Exactly, and as in all other\nstructured brainstorming models\n\n72\n00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:13.666\ncovered in Lean Six Sigma,\nthis template is available in your\n\n73\n00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:18.554\ncourse files and also is part of\nthe study package if you decide\n\n74\n00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:23.172\nthat you wanna take the Lean Six Sigma,\nyellow belt exam.\n\n75\n00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:27.610\nThe thing that's kinda cool about SIPOC\nis that it was meant to be a paper,\n\n76\n00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.192\npencil tool, but there's a really jazzy\nway use that you can present this if\n\n77\n00:04:32.192 --> 00:04:36.588\nyou're trying to give some information\nto your sponsor or to your boss.\n\n78\n00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:41.922\nSo, I think the easiest way to do this\nis just to kinda jump into an exercise.\n\n79\n00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:44.397\nAnd we'll use the same example we used for\n\n80\n00:04:44.397 --> 00:04:47.380\nTim Woods where we were\ntrying to identify waste.\n\n81\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.755\nI'm going to pretend like we're\nmanaging a fast-food company.\n\n82\n00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:55.660\nSo, I'm trying to figure out, in this\nscenario I don't even know what it is\n\n83\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.140\nI wanna work on yet, but\nI wanna identify the players, right?\n\n84\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.300\nI could also use this model if I\nknew what I was gonna work on,\n\n85\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.380\nit might be even easier.\n\n86\n00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.210\nBut, in this case I'm using\nit kind of in a generic way.\n\n87\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.045\nSo, if I were a fast-food company,\nwho are some of my suppliers?\n\n88\n00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:14.062\nOf course the first person I\nthink about is the meat supplier,\n\n89\n00:05:14.062 --> 00:05:17.384\ncuz if it's a fast-food place,\nthey probably serve hamburgers.\n\n90\n00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:20.337\nCan you think of any other suppliers, Don?\n\n91\n00:05:20.337 --> 00:05:22.850\n>> There's a lot of inventory,\njust look at your inventory list.\n\n92\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.296\nSo we've got wrappers for the hamburgers.\n\n93\n00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:25.921\nYou have got cups.\n\n94\n00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:27.212\nYou've got soda, syrup.\n\n95\n00:05:27.212 --> 00:05:30.553\nYou've got all those various [INAUDIBLE],\nand they might all come from one supplier\n\n96\n00:05:30.553 --> 00:05:33.910\nif you're lucky, but the odds are they're\ngoing from many different suppliers.\n\n97\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.253\n>> Exactly, and input, and try to remember\nthese are meant to be broad terms.\n\n98\n00:05:40.253 --> 00:05:44.455\nThey're meant to kick off your critical\nthinking, so someone's dropped a problem\n\n99\n00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:47.130\nin your lap that this case\nwe just started the new job.\n\n100\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.712\nAnd so how long do you do this?\n\n101\n00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:53.177\nYou do it until you run out of ideas\nbecause it’s supposed to help you think\n\n102\n00:05:53.177 --> 00:05:55.421\nabout things that you wanna look at.\n\n103\n00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:59.424\nThe other rule about structured\nbrainstorming is that if something shows\n\n104\n00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:03.876\nup in more than one category, that’s kind\nof a cool thing because it’s giving you\n\n105\n00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:06.087\nan automatic prioritization, right?\n\n106\n00:06:06.087 --> 00:06:07.003\nOkay, so input.\n\n107\n00:06:07.003 --> 00:06:08.606\nAnd when we think of input,\n\n108\n00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:12.378\nanything that actually comes\ninto our fast-food restaurant.\n\n109\n00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:15.700\nAnd of course the first thing that\ncomes to my mind is customers.\n\n110\n00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.087\n>> Customers are a big part of it.\n\n111\n00:06:17.087 --> 00:06:19.546\nYou've also got other things.\n\n112\n00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:23.665\nIf you're part of a franchise,\nyou might receive marketing materials from\n\n113\n00:06:23.665 --> 00:06:26.962\nthe franchisee, franchisor,\nI always get those mixed up.\n\n114\n00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:27.796\n>> Yeah, me too.\n\n115\n00:06:27.796 --> 00:06:31.598\n>> So there's other types of input\nthat might happen besides people, but,\n\n116\n00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:34.253\nit all really kinda factors\ninto the full process.\n\n117\n00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:36.297\n>> Sure, and other things come in.\n\n118\n00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:40.399\nCleaning supplies, things that\nyour suppliers might bring to you,\n\n119\n00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:42.670\nyou have money, all of these things.\n\n120\n00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.422\nSo, yes, you just wanna think\nof everything that is an input.\n\n121\n00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:47.420\nNow, process.\n\n122\n00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.905\nFor fast-food we have of course\nthe cooking process, but\n\n123\n00:06:50.905 --> 00:06:53.548\nwhat are some other\nprocesses that we have?\n\n124\n00:06:53.548 --> 00:06:55.004\n>> New employee onboarding.\n\n125\n00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:59.750\n>> Absolutely, and we have the change\nprocess and the delivery process, and\n\n126\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.379\nwe might even have a process\nto keep our bathrooms clean.\n\n127\n00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.754\nI hope, right?\n\n128\n00:07:04.754 --> 00:07:09.670\n[LAUGH] And output is anything that's\ngoing out of the restaurant, so\n\n129\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.753\nthink about things that\nare going out of the restaurant.\n\n130\n00:07:13.753 --> 00:07:15.547\n>> And that's usually gonna\nbe your product, right, so\n\n131\n00:07:15.547 --> 00:07:16.797\nwhatever it is that you're selling.\n\n132\n00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:17.797\n>> Absolutely.\n\n133\n00:07:17.797 --> 00:07:24.087\n>> It could be employees and customers,\ntoo, going out of the organization.\n\n134\n00:07:24.087 --> 00:07:27.171\nReputation and marketing, those are all\nthings that come out of an organization.\n\n135\n00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:30.685\n>> Exactly, and then we get to\nthe final one, customer, and\n\n136\n00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:34.504\nof course if I'm buying the hamburger\nI would be the customer.\n\n137\n00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:39.869\nBut in a fast-food restaurant think\nabout all the other types of customers,\n\n138\n00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:44.670\nand Don already mentioned one,\nlike the franchisee, franchiser.\n\n139\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.600\n>> Yeah, and you may have,\nI don't wanna call it,\n\n140\n00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.546\nI wanna say companies within a company,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:50.546 --> 00:07:53.812\nA lot of larger organizations\nhave different departments, and\n\n142\n00:07:53.812 --> 00:07:57.630\nthey have to do internal billing and\ncode of accounting and all that stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.619\nSo you're kind of a customer of\nyour own business in a way, and\n\n144\n00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:06.087\nso that can happen, it's a very\nreal thing in large organizations.\n\n145\n00:08:06.087 --> 00:08:06.639\n>> Exactly,\n\n146\n00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.879\nand yesterday when we were working on,\nI mean in our former episode, I'm sorry.\n\n147\n00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:15.618\nIn our former episode, we were working\nwith Tim Woods, and we took Tim Woods and\n\n148\n00:08:15.618 --> 00:08:17.755\nwe applied it to our own household.\n\n149\n00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:20.781\nSo I just wanna quickly,\nwe're not gonna go in depth here, but\n\n150\n00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:24.337\njust remember you can use Lean Six Sigma\ntools to help your personal life.\n\n151\n00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:28.379\nIf I'm trying to identify\nthe players in my household,\n\n152\n00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:32.421\nwho are some of the suppliers\nin our house, utilities?\n\n153\n00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.411\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you have your facility itself,\n\n154\n00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:39.373\nthe house itself which in here\nyou have like a breadwinner or\n\n155\n00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:43.588\nsomeone in the family who's\ngenerating money to pay for that.\n\n156\n00:08:43.588 --> 00:08:48.125\nYou've got your utilities that come in,\nyour cable, your phone, electric,\n\n157\n00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.421\nwater, all of those.\n\n158\n00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:51.224\n>> There's a lot.\n>> There's a lot of different components\n\n159\n00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:51.921\nthat go into a home.\n\n160\n00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:56.670\n>> And then when you think input, that's\nanyone that walks across your front door.\n\n161\n00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:02.046\nWell, your family comes in your front\ndoor, you hope, pets, neighbors, right?\n\n162\n00:09:02.046 --> 00:09:03.337\n>> Yeah, bugs.\n\n163\n00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:03.879\n>> Bugs.\n\n164\n00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.927\n[LAUGH]\n>> In Florida,\n\n165\n00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:06.921\nwe have to deal with that, not everywhere.\n\n166\n00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:10.071\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then processes would be,\n\n167\n00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.379\nthere's a dishwashing process.\n\n168\n00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:15.004\nThere's a clothes washing process.\n\n169\n00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:18.338\nThere's an overall cleaning process,\nthat type of thing.\n\n170\n00:09:18.338 --> 00:09:20.945\nAnd output would be anything\nthat goes out your door, so\n\n171\n00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:23.504\nwhat are some things that go\nout your door at your home?\n\n172\n00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:25.421\n>> You would hope a happy family.\n\n173\n00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:27.840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, yes, I love that.\n\n174\n00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.500\n>> Not always, but\nthat's what you hope for.\n\n175\n00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.379\nThat's hard to think of.\n\n176\n00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:33.087\nHow about garbage?\n\n177\n00:09:33.087 --> 00:09:34.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Garbage goes out.\n\n178\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:35.337\nSure.\n\n179\n00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:38.571\nAnd then customers are people like\nyour family and your neighbors and\n\n180\n00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:40.254\nyour friends and things like that.\n\n181\n00:09:40.254 --> 00:09:44.587\nSo, okay, so we kind of got the basic idea\nof the SIPOC, but what do we do with it?\n\n182\n00:09:44.587 --> 00:09:46.505\nWhy do we care about the SIPOC?\n\n183\n00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:53.256\nSo, the reason we care about the SIPOC is\nbecause, well, there's a lot of reasons.\n\n184\n00:09:53.256 --> 00:09:58.128\nJust knowing who's involved is just huge,\nas we mentioned, but\n\n185\n00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:01.504\nalso, it might help us\nidentify a champion.\n\n186\n00:10:01.504 --> 00:10:05.462\nIt might help us identify someone\nwho's already worked on this project.\n\n187\n00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:09.048\nOne of the things that Lean strives for\nis to reduce redundancy.\n\n188\n00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:12.962\nYou'd be surprised at how many people\nare doing the same or similar reports.\n\n189\n00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:17.327\nSo sometimes when you go through a SIPOC\nyou're able to identify things such\n\n190\n00:10:17.327 --> 00:10:17.880\nas that.\n\n191\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.382\nAlso, on a more negative note,\n\n192\n00:10:20.382 --> 00:10:25.482\nyou might identify people that\ncould possibly get in your way, so\n\n193\n00:10:25.482 --> 00:10:30.879\nthat you can start doing a bit of\na risk management strategy, right?\n\n194\n00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:31.587\n>> Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n195\n00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:35.125\nThen we could use this before a problem\noccurs as opposed to waiting until\n\n196\n00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:36.759\nafterwards, and then using it.\n\n197\n00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:37.462\nIt really works both ways.\n\n198\n00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:41.772\n>> Exactly, and there's a real\nadvantage to doing one large SIPOC for\n\n199\n00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:44.504\nthe department that you're working for.\n\n200\n00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:49.630\nBecause then, if you focus in on a\nparticular project, so for example, at our\n\n201\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.087\nfast-food maybe we decide what we want to\nimprove is our cooking process, right?\n\n202\n00:10:55.087 --> 00:11:00.961\nAnd then I would go back and do a SIPOC\nbut just on that one particular process.\n\n203\n00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:05.191\nSometimes you can use the same\nSIPOC from project to project, so\n\n204\n00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:07.629\nit's just a really good thing to do.\n\n205\n00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:12.051\nNow before we move on I wanna point out\nthat there's a couple of other things that\n\n206\n00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:13.379\nSIPOC is valuable for.\n\n207\n00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:16.820\nIt can be used as a mini\nproblem solving model.\n\n208\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.900\nSo let's say you're in a project\nmanagement situation and an employee comes\n\n209\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.190\nto you and you've already decided that's\nnot human resource worthy problem,\n\n210\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.460\nyou can sit down and even though you might\nnot be sitting there going, supplier,\n\n211\n00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:34.130\ninput, process, you can use this as a map\nto kind of talk through their problems.\n\n212\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.400\nWho's contributing to the problem?\n\n213\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.961\nWhich would be your supplier, right?\n\n214\n00:11:36.961 --> 00:11:39.255\nWhat is the input you're getting,\nwhat's the output?\n\n215\n00:11:39.255 --> 00:11:42.796\nYou would use words that make\nmore sense to the employee.\n\n216\n00:11:42.796 --> 00:11:47.629\nIt would just be kind of a map,\na map to help you do some problem solving.\n\n217\n00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:52.547\nAgain, it's just amazing all\nthe things they do a SIPOC now, and\n\n218\n00:11:52.547 --> 00:11:57.824\nyou can make it just really beautiful\npresentation, and a lot of times\n\n219\n00:11:57.824 --> 00:12:04.462\njust giving That information to someone in\nthe C-Suite about your department is huge.\n\n220\n00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:09.052\nTo be able to tell them who contributes\nto your particular department,\n\n221\n00:12:09.052 --> 00:12:13.879\nhow the processes work, and being able\nto put that on just one simple form.\n\n222\n00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:17.614\nIt's very much appreciated, especially\nin large companies that might not\n\n223\n00:12:17.614 --> 00:12:19.962\nreally understand what you or\nyour group does.\n\n224\n00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.763\nSo the next thing I'm gonna move on to,\nand\n\n225\n00:12:24.763 --> 00:12:27.440\nwe'll cover this quickly is a thought map.\n\n226\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.005\nAnd these were quite popular about 20\nyears ago but they've sort of revived.\n\n227\n00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:35.430\nAnd they've been known by\na lot of different names.\n\n228\n00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.712\nWe're calling it a thought process map,\nTPM.\n\n229\n00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:42.747\nSo if you were hypothetically\ntaking a online exam and\n\n230\n00:12:42.747 --> 00:12:48.587\nit asked you what TPM meant, then you\nwould know it was a thought process map.\n\n231\n00:12:48.587 --> 00:12:50.642\nAnd there's lots of different\nways you can do this,\n\n232\n00:12:50.642 --> 00:12:53.440\nand there's tons and tons of software\nout there that can assist you.\n\n233\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.025\nBut if you want to do just a simple bot\nprocess map, in the center of the map you\n\n234\n00:12:58.025 --> 00:13:02.628\nwould put your process, whatever\nprocess that you're trying to improve.\n\n235\n00:13:02.628 --> 00:13:05.331\nAnd in this case we were saying we were\nwere gonna try to improve the cooking\n\n236\n00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:06.510\nprocess, right?\n\n237\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.570\nSo I put the cooking process\nin the middle of the map.\n\n238\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.070\nAnd I would just look at all\nthe different things that are connected.\n\n239\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.837\n>> And we're not necessarily worried\nabout degree of connectivity.\n\n240\n00:13:17.837 --> 00:13:19.287\n>> Exactly.\n>> Like there might be significant things,\n\n241\n00:13:19.287 --> 00:13:20.462\nthere might be insignificant things.\n\n242\n00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:23.087\nWe're just trying to map\nout al the things, right?\n\n243\n00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:23.961\n>> Exactly!\n\n244\n00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:27.717\nAnd it's just that again, designed to\ncapitalize on this critical thinking\n\n245\n00:13:27.717 --> 00:13:30.212\ntools, get me thinking and\nget me moving forward.\n\n246\n00:13:30.212 --> 00:13:34.104\nAnd then finally, the last thing\nwe're gonna be talking about,\n\n247\n00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.671\nis the different voices.\n\n248\n00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:41.060\nLean Six Sigma is quite married to paying\nattention to the different voices.\n\n249\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.254\nNow most of us are familiar with VOC,\nwhich stands for Voice Of the Customer.\n\n250\n00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:50.960\nHowever, Lean really emphasizes Voice Of\nthe Customer to the point that they\n\n251\n00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:57.212\nsay we do not have a successful Lean Six\nSigma project unless the customer's happy.\n\n252\n00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:01.879\nNow, I'm sure a lot of you have heard of\nthe term Internal and External Customer.\n\n253\n00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:06.522\nSo, examples of internal customers would\nbe any be one that you have a little bit\n\n254\n00:14:06.522 --> 00:14:07.504\ndependence on.\n\n255\n00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:10.629\nThat you had to please in order\nto get your job done, right?\n\n256\n00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:14.703\nAnd external customers are obvious,\nthe people who are buying our product or\n\n257\n00:14:14.703 --> 00:14:15.838\nbuying our service.\n\n258\n00:14:15.838 --> 00:14:21.296\nThere is a thought in Lean Six Sigma that\nwhen we think about voice of the customer,\n\n259\n00:14:21.296 --> 00:14:23.920\nwe want to start including suppliers.\n\n260\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.590\nNow remember in the SIPOC,\nwe called them suppliers.\n\n261\n00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.340\nVendors by default are suppliers.\n\n262\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.950\n>> But suppliers could be\nanyone that we have to depend\n\n263\n00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.980\non to get information to get our job done.\n\n264\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.587\nSo, having a really good understanding of\nthe voice of the customer is important.\n\n265\n00:14:40.587 --> 00:14:44.046\nNow, there's tools that\nyou can use to do that.\n\n266\n00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:49.007\nAnd probably the most common tools\nwould be things such as surveys,\n\n267\n00:14:49.007 --> 00:14:52.588\ninterviews, short forum,\nI mean small forum.\n\n268\n00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:53.885\nI don't know if you can\nhave a short forum.\n\n269\n00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:54.631\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don, can you?\n\n270\n00:14:54.631 --> 00:14:56.322\n[LAUGH] It would just\nhave to be really fast.\n\n271\n00:14:56.322 --> 00:14:59.361\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The next term is called,\n\n272\n00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.671\nVoice Of the Employee.\n\n273\n00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:06.270\nNow Voice Of the Employee, we spend a lot\nof time in business, taking about how\n\n274\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:11.080\nimportant the Voice Of Employee is because\nit can give us ideas about the product,\n\n275\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.216\nit can give us ideas about\nhow things are working now,\n\n276\n00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:16.754\nlots of different pieces of information.\n\n277\n00:15:16.754 --> 00:15:21.990\nMany times employees have innovative ideas\nthat just really don't get explored.\n\n278\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:27.370\nNow even though we do a lot of\ntalking about voice of the employee,\n\n279\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.250\nit sometimes gets a little swept under the\ncarpet, people don't really pay attention.\n\n280\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.449\nAnd the thing that is so\n\n281\n00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:37.490\ncool about voice of the employee is that\nyou can use the same exact tools to get\n\n282\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.171\nthe voice of the employee that you\nget from the voice of the customer.\n\n283\n00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:44.684\nBecause you can use surveys and\ninterviews and\n\n284\n00:15:44.684 --> 00:15:49.920\nyou could duplicate those tools, so\nit's kind of a Lean way to do it.\n\n285\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.714\nYou could be asking your employees almost\nthe same thing that you're asking your\n\n286\n00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:54.337\ncustomers.\n\n287\n00:15:54.337 --> 00:15:57.023\n>> And a lot of times you'll be surprised\nwith the input that you get from your\n\n288\n00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:57.830\nown employees.\n\n289\n00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.040\nThere are some employees who may not\nbe very high up in the responsibility\n\n290\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.520\nhierarchy but might have very valuable\nfeedback they can provide you that can\n\n291\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.630\nimmediately isolate the source of\na problem or have a process improvement.\n\n292\n00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:14.290\nIt's as simple as having that\nsuggestion box stuck on the wall that\n\n293\n00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.600\npeople put in suggestions.\n\n294\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.170\nVoice of the employee.\n\n295\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.045\nIt comes right from there.\n\n296\n00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:18.879\n>> Exactly.\n\n297\n00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:22.421\nI'm always amazed at employee suggestions,\nand many,\n\n298\n00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:27.067\nmany of the Lean Six Sigma projects that\nI've worked on have come from a very\n\n299\n00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:31.850\nsimple idea that the employee had but\nwas not able to get to the right person.\n\n300\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.270\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat Lean Six Sigma does.\n\n301\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.289\nIt helps you organize your thoughts so\n\n302\n00:16:36.289 --> 00:16:39.961\nyou can get your suggestions to\nthe right person and really be heard.\n\n303\n00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:44.602\nThe next one is VOP and this stands for\nVoice of the Process and\n\n304\n00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:48.337\nLean Six Sigma has a lot\nof these types of things.\n\n305\n00:16:48.337 --> 00:16:50.171\nWhen they say Voice of the Process,\n\n306\n00:16:50.171 --> 00:16:53.300\nthey want you to actually\npretend like you're the process.\n\n307\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.409\nAnd if the process could speak,\n\n308\n00:16:55.409 --> 00:16:59.087\nwhat kinds of things might\nthat process be telling you?\n\n309\n00:16:59.087 --> 00:17:02.489\nCan you think of anything that the process\nmight be telling you that could be\n\n310\n00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:03.254\nhelpful, Don?\n\n311\n00:17:03.254 --> 00:17:08.055\n>> You know, this has always been a hard\none for me because to think in terms of\n\n312\n00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:13.243\nthe process itself, but when things\nare maybe overly complex, you can -- you\n\n313\n00:17:13.243 --> 00:17:18.295\ncan kind of see that just by looking at\nthe checklist or workflow of a process.\n\n314\n00:17:18.295 --> 00:17:19.893\nIf it looks overly complex to you,\n\n315\n00:17:19.893 --> 00:17:23.379\nthen that's something that process\nwould probably say to you if it could.\n\n316\n00:17:23.379 --> 00:17:28.170\n>> And that's such a great point because\none of the lean six sigma goals is to make\n\n317\n00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.212\nthings simple.\n\n318\n00:17:29.212 --> 00:17:33.830\nWhen we build complexity into\nthe process it slows us down.\n\n319\n00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.711\nThe process could also be saying\nsomething like help me, I’m melting.\n\n320\n00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:37.755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n321\n00:17:37.755 --> 00:17:40.754\nOr it could say I’m outdated.\n\n322\n00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:45.912\nNow the reason why we need to look at the\nvoice of the process is that our boss or\n\n323\n00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:50.749\nour work environment might actually\nbe a asking us to do something where\n\n324\n00:17:50.749 --> 00:17:53.754\nour process is simply\nnot capable of doing.\n\n325\n00:17:53.754 --> 00:17:58.566\nAnd so in define especially in the black\nbelt world a lot of attention is paid to\n\n326\n00:17:58.566 --> 00:18:01.462\nthings called process capability analysis.\n\n327\n00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:05.671\nAnd that's just looking at the process and\nsaying hey, let's be reasonable here.\n\n328\n00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:08.212\nCan this process even really do it?\n\n329\n00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:09.613\nNow if you determine and\n\n330\n00:18:09.613 --> 00:18:12.905\ndefine that there's something\nthat needs to be done but\n\n331\n00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:17.962\nYour process isn't capable of doing it,\nyou're not necessarily dead in the water.\n\n332\n00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:19.122\nBut you do have to stop and\n\n333\n00:18:19.122 --> 00:18:21.895\nhave that conversation with\nwhoever you're working for.\n\n334\n00:18:21.895 --> 00:18:25.158\nBecause if your process isn't capable,\nnothing's going to work.\n\n335\n00:18:25.158 --> 00:18:29.756\nBut there are a myriad of things you can\ndo to make your process capable once\n\n336\n00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:32.885\nyou identify that it can't\ndo what you want it do.\n\n337\n00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:38.882\nSo for example, one of the ones everyone\njumps to is we need more resources.\n\n338\n00:18:38.882 --> 00:18:44.195\nA lot of times in business that isn't\na particularly popular for concept.\n\n339\n00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:47.614\nBut there are other things that you\ncan do, like maybe better equipment,\n\n340\n00:18:47.614 --> 00:18:50.280\nmore office space, more training,\nthat type of thing.\n\n341\n00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.978\nSo, if you do a capability analysis, and\n\n342\n00:18:52.978 --> 00:18:57.849\nsometimes they could be very\nuncomplicated, like observation, right?\n\n343\n00:18:57.849 --> 00:18:58.525\nYou can just go and watch the process.\n\n344\n00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:03.188\nIf you determine it's simply not capable,\nremember, it's not over,\n\n345\n00:19:03.188 --> 00:19:07.784\nthat you wanna just kind of think in\nterms of how can I make this capable?\n\n346\n00:19:07.784 --> 00:19:12.876\nAnd then finally, on this voices is\nsomething called voice of the business.\n\n347\n00:19:12.876 --> 00:19:16.704\nNow, voice of the business is kind of\ninteresting, because you could read 300\n\n348\n00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:19.769\npages about it, or you can just\ntrust what I'm about to tell you.\n\n349\n00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:21.294\nIt says voice of the business,\n\n350\n00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:24.001\nbut what it's really saying\nis voice of the industry.\n\n351\n00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:27.877\nNow, because Lean Six Sigma likes\nyou to think from different lenses,\n\n352\n00:19:27.877 --> 00:19:29.492\nfrom different viewpoints,\n\n353\n00:19:29.492 --> 00:19:33.575\nI think voice of your business is still\nsomething that you wanna consider.\n\n354\n00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:34.185\nThe voice of your culture.\n\n355\n00:19:34.185 --> 00:19:37.473\nHow things are going in your department,\neven.\n\n356\n00:19:37.473 --> 00:19:40.699\nSo, I wouldn't discount\nthat as part of the voices.\n\n357\n00:19:40.699 --> 00:19:45.403\nBut when you hear the term Lean Six Sigma,\nVOB, it says Voice Of the Business.\n\n358\n00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:48.055\nBut just kind of be aware that\nmeans Voice Of the Industry.\n\n359\n00:19:48.055 --> 00:19:53.493\nSo, if the industry could speak,\nwhat might it tell you?\n\n360\n00:19:53.493 --> 00:19:57.158\nAnd first, let's kind of think about,\nwhat are some compliance,\n\n361\n00:19:57.158 --> 00:19:58.843\nOSHA is a compliance, right?\n\n362\n00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:00.328\nSo, that would be an industry thing.\n\n363\n00:20:00.328 --> 00:20:03.695\nSo, the IRS.\n\n364\n00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:04.345\nYikes.\n\n365\n00:20:04.345 --> 00:20:04.879\nFDA.\n\n366\n00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:05.437\nRight?\n\n367\n00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:10.336\nSo, certainly, one of the industries\ncould be just talking about compliance.\n\n368\n00:20:10.336 --> 00:20:14.051\nDon, can you think of any other things\nthat the industry might be telling us?\n\n369\n00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:15.094\n>> We see a lot of it, I mean,\n\n370\n00:20:15.094 --> 00:20:18.137\nit just kind of building off of compliance\nwith EPA rules that are coming up.\n\n371\n00:20:18.137 --> 00:20:19.274\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n372\n00:20:19.274 --> 00:20:23.391\n>> And so you might be in an industry\nwhere you have a factory that has certain\n\n373\n00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:24.750\nemissions that occur.\n\n374\n00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.662\nAnd you might feel that those\nare perfectly normal and safe, but\n\n375\n00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:31.994\nthen the EPA comes along and\npasses a rule tightening or\n\n376\n00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:35.349\nincreasing governance of\nwhatever that emission is.\n\n377\n00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:38.012\nWell, that's their way of\ncommunicating to you, hey,\n\n378\n00:20:38.012 --> 00:20:40.620\nit doesn't matter what you\nnecessarily think is safe,\n\n379\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.965\nwe're telling you, these\nare the standards we're putting in place.\n\n380\n00:20:43.965 --> 00:20:45.057\nAnd so we have to react to that.\n\n381\n00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:46.124\n>> Exactly.\n\n382\n00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:50.790\nExactly, and the industry might\neven tell you some things that\n\n383\n00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.312\nyou learned from the process,\nlike trends, or\n\n384\n00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:59.435\nwhat other people are doing or\nwhat's outdated, what's in vogue.\n\n385\n00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:01.625\nSo, finally, I'd like to address CTQ's.\n\n386\n00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:05.355\nWe mentioned this in another episode,\nearlier in the program and\n\n387\n00:21:05.355 --> 00:21:09.265\nwe said that CTQ stood for\nCritical To Quality.\n\n388\n00:21:09.265 --> 00:21:14.093\nAnd we said that there's actually a little\nbit of a movement to call it Critical to\n\n389\n00:21:14.093 --> 00:21:17.505\nPrice, Critical to Satisfaction,\nCritical to Speed.\n\n390\n00:21:17.505 --> 00:21:19.606\nBut it just got too confusing, so\n\n391\n00:21:19.606 --> 00:21:22.765\nnow everyone refers to it\nas Critical To Quality.\n\n392\n00:21:22.765 --> 00:21:27.435\nCustomer requirements by default are\nCritical to Quality, and as a reminder,\n\n393\n00:21:27.435 --> 00:21:31.225\nCritical to Success, Satisfaction,\nBetter,Faster, More Cost Effective.\n\n394\n00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.995\nThese are the things\nthat we're looking at.\n\n395\n00:21:32.995 --> 00:21:37.129\nNow the reason I'm bringing them up here,\nback in defined,\n\n396\n00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:41.101\nis that if we're trying to come\nup with CTQs and we can't,\n\n397\n00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.910\ntwo of the tools that we just looked at,\nthe SIPOC's and\n\n398\n00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:49.801\nthe thought process map, are gonna\nhelp us determine some of our CTQs.\n\n399\n00:21:49.801 --> 00:21:53.931\nSo if we're having a little bit of\nan issue of what really is Critical to\n\n400\n00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:58.201\nSuccess of this project, we can go back\nand we can look at our SIPOC's and\n\n401\n00:21:58.201 --> 00:22:02.058\nwe can say, well, what is Critical\nto Quality for my suppliers?\n\n402\n00:22:02.058 --> 00:22:04.175\nAnd make sure that we write down a list.\n\n403\n00:22:04.175 --> 00:22:07.355\nWhat's critical to input,\noutput, or to process.\n\n404\n00:22:07.355 --> 00:22:10.769\nOn our thought map, because our\nthought map is a little messier.\n\n405\n00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:14.185\nSIPOC's a bit more structured,\nand so you can guess,\n\n406\n00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:16.273\nthe Six Sigma world likes SIPOC.\n\n407\n00:22:16.273 --> 00:22:19.152\nThe Lean world kind of likes\nthe thought process map.\n\n408\n00:22:19.152 --> 00:22:22.015\nBecause they're a little\nbit more creative.\n\n409\n00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:25.356\nBut if I'm looking at\nmy thought process map,\n\n410\n00:22:25.356 --> 00:22:30.756\nsince it's just a bunch of ideas and\nhow these ideas connect to my process,\n\n411\n00:22:30.756 --> 00:22:34.287\nit might give me some ideas\nabout some of my CTQs.\n\n412\n00:22:34.287 --> 00:22:39.859\nSo, we have other tools that we\nwanna cover in other episodes.\n\n413\n00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.414\n>> Right, but these are really important.\n\n414\n00:22:41.414 --> 00:22:44.185\nI mean you guys have probably\nnoticed the pattern so\n\n415\n00:22:44.185 --> 00:22:47.736\nfar with SIPOC, with CTQ,\nit's all about identifying things.\n\n416\n00:22:47.736 --> 00:22:49.245\nRight?\nIdentifying\n\n417\n00:22:49.245 --> 00:22:50.795\nthe areas that we need to look at.\n\n418\n00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:54.195\nThe possible sources of a problem,\nthe areas that we can measure.\n\n419\n00:22:54.195 --> 00:22:59.318\nMeasure success on critical quality that\nreads as almost like a report card for us.\n\n420\n00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:02.335\nHow do we know if our process\nis where it needs to be?\n\n421\n00:23:02.335 --> 00:23:04.285\nSo, all of this is really important, and\n\n422\n00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:07.463\nit's right here in the define phase\nat the very beginning, and Dr.\n\n423\n00:23:07.463 --> 00:23:11.029\nStern, you said it best, that there's\na lot of stuff that we need to achieve\n\n424\n00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:14.483\nbefore we can move out of the define\nphase, but if we were to jump ahead into\n\n425\n00:23:14.483 --> 00:23:19.195\nour later phases, then we don't actually\nunderstand what's Critical for Quality.\n\n426\n00:23:19.195 --> 00:23:21.705\nThink about the catastrophe\nthat could come out of that.\n\n427\n00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:25.547\nWe might luck out and do okay but there's\njust so many things that could cascade and\n\n428\n00:23:25.547 --> 00:23:29.292\nbecome worse and worse if we don't pay\nattention so, these are all important.\n\n429\n00:23:29.292 --> 00:23:31.498\nWe do still have a little bit more\nto cover on the Define phase, right?\n\n430\n00:23:31.498 --> 00:23:32.635\n>> We do.\n\n431\n00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:36.375\n>> So, I know we're running short on this\nepisode so why don't we pause here we'll\n\n432\n00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:39.895\nwrap this episode up and then we'll\ncome back with more on the Define phase,\n\n433\n00:23:39.895 --> 00:23:41.930\nget a chance to see some other,\nlike I know,\n\n434\n00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.466\nI have the advantage of being\nable to see her computer.\n\n435\n00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:45.685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So she's got some great stuff that\n\n436\n00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:46.928\nwe're gonna be seeing\nhere in a few minutes.\n\n437\n00:23:46.928 --> 00:23:49.018\nBut for right now,\nwe'll go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n438\n00:23:49.018 --> 00:23:56.065\nDo you have any parting words\nyou wanted to throw in?\n\n439\n00:23:56.065 --> 00:23:56.814\n>> No,\njust something that I keep reiterating,\n\n440\n00:23:56.814 --> 00:23:57.628\nremember Define is a very,\nvery creative phase.\n\n441\n00:23:57.628 --> 00:24:02.556\nBut your challenge is not to leave\nDefine without people understanding what\n\n442\n00:24:02.556 --> 00:24:04.665\nit is you're working on.\n\n443\n00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:05.580\n>> Right, not necessarily.\n\n444\n00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:09.238\nReally agreeing with, but at least\nunderstanding and being on the same page.\n\n445\n00:24:09.238 --> 00:24:11.097\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n446\n00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:11.769\nStay tuned.\n\n447\n00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:16.257\nWe've got more Lean Six Sigma coming up,\nbut for now, signing off for ITProTV,\n\n448\n00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:17.184\nI'm Don

and\n\n4\n00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:17.093\ngood evening welcome back to\nanother episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:19.541\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n6\n00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:25.030\nIn this episode we're going to be winding\ndown on the defined phase of the DuMaic\n\n7\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.470\nmodel we've started it off, we've\ntalked about it for two episodes now.\n\n8\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.860\nIt's really good stuff we need to jump\ninto to kind of wrap that up and make sure\n\n9\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.220\nwe're where we need to be before we\ntransition into the next four phases.\n\n10\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.464\nSo I've got back on the show with us Dr.\n\n11\n00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:41.937\nStern is gonna walk us\nthrough that process and\n\n12\n00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:43.271\nI know you've got some good stuff for us.\n\n13\n00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:44.650\nSo I'm gonna turn the floor over to you.\n\n14\n00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.880\n>> Thank you Don.\n\n15\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.943\nI'm actually gonna go back to something\nyou saw in the last episode and\n\n16\n00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:55.740\nthat's the activity and tool sheet.\n\n17\n00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.870\nWe're gonna be spending a lot of\ntime on this particular collateral.\n\n18\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.600\nHowever, we're just gonna\nfocus on the define part.\n\n19\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620\nNow, I know you can't see it, and\nI'm gonna enlarge the define part as we\n\n20\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.220\nspeak about it, but\nI wanna let you know why we're doing this.\n\n21\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.270\nOne, this is an incredible collateral.\n\n22\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.740\nI think the first time my company\ndeveloped this collateral was 2010.\n\n23\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.090\nSo, over the last 14 years,\nwe've streamlined it, made it great.\n\n24\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270\nA lot of times if you're\nin a consulting role,\n\n25\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.350\nyou can use this particular schematic\nwhen you're talking to your client,\n\n26\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060\nand you can kinda figure out\nwhere on the swarm they're at,\n\n27\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.550\nbecause maybe they've already\naccomplished some of these things.\n\n28\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.800\nNow, in this episode, because define is so\n\n29\n00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.450\nimportant, we're gonna just talk\nabout the things in define.\n\n30\n00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.930\nWhen we move onto the other phases,\n\n31\n00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.580\nI'll refer to the handout, but\nwe won't be going step by step through it.\n\n32\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.165\nThe reason we're doing this is\nbecause this is the same for everyone,\n\n33\n00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:56.662\nit doesn't matter if you're Six Sigma, it\ndoesn't matter if you're Lean Six Sigma,\n\n34\n00:01:56.662 --> 00:01:58.998\nit does not matter what\nlevel of belt you are.\n\n35\n00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:03.061\nIf you're a yellow, green,\nblack, or master black belt.\n\n36\n00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:05.750\nDefine is always the same, and\nagain it's a very creative phase.\n\n37\n00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.726\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nenlarge this portion.\n\n38\n00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:17.892\nAnd again, I wanna point out that\nthe end result of this phase is that\n\n39\n00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:22.060\nwe wanna make sure everyone\nunderstands the project goal.\n\n40\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.670\nNow, this is incredibly important, and\nwe're gonna be addressing this later\n\n41\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.890\nin the program, but if you want buy in,\none of the number one reasons people don't\n\n42\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.510\nbuy into your project is they flat don't\nunderstand what it is you're working on.\n\n43\n00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.073\nThe other side of this is that we want\nto make sure that you know what you're\n\n44\n00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:38.708\nworking on.\n\n45\n00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:43.082\nNow in the second column, and again,\nthis is just a good collateral to\n\n46\n00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:47.309\nget familiar with, again,\nthis is part of your course files, it is\n\n47\n00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:52.203\nalso part of the material that you would\nget if you were going to move forward and\n\n48\n00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:55.640\ntake the Lean Six Sigma exam\non the SSD Global website.\n\n49\n00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.540\nSo, you've got two different ways that you\ncan source this particular collateral.\n\n50\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.660\nSo, under Activities the very first thing\nthat you see is project name and purpose.\n\n51\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.810\nWe talked about this in the first\nepisode on the DMAIC model, but\n\n52\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.060\nthe project name and purpose, getting that\nclearly in your head, is really important.\n\n53\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.290\nAnd I think Don and I agree.\n\n54\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.579\nWe've also both worked on projects that\nhad really kind of fun names, like I'm\n\n55\n00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.061\nfrom Denver, and one of the projects I've\nworked on was called Peak Performance,\n\n56\n00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:30.479\nbecause we have all those mountains, and\nit was really cute, but nobody knew what\n\n57\n00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.741\nwe were doing, so it's important that\nyou have the project name and purpose.\n\n58\n00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:40.310\nNow, we said this, and I say it almost\nevery time I talk about define.\n\n59\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.840\nWe have to have a completed\nproject charter.\n\n60\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.600\nIn your sample files, you will have\nthe SSD Global project charter,\n\n61\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.850\nwhich you are able to use at your company.\n\n62\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.590\nObviously anything that\nare in your sample files,\n\n63\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.460\nyou're free to use and manipulate,\nand do whatever you want.\n\n64\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.400\nThe reason why you want to take some time\nto look at the project charter template\n\n65\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.250\nat some point, or even just a project\ncharter template on the internet,\n\n66\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.940\nis because sometimes companies don't have\na a formal project charter template.\n\n67\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.701\nSo then what you're going to want to do,\n\n68\n00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:19.838\nis put the key things of that charter\ntemplate into your email to your boss.\n\n69\n00:04:19.838 --> 00:04:23.646\nSo even though it's not really a project\ncharter that you printed out and\n\n70\n00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:24.715\nyou got signed off.\n\n71\n00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:28.389\nYou want to make sure that you can\ninclude some of those key components.\n\n72\n00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.461\nAnd Don do you want to mention some of\nthe key components that you've noticed\n\n73\n00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:32.374\nin project charters?\n\n74\n00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:36.315\n>> Absolutely, I have a project management\nbackground and if any of you've\n\n75\n00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:39.890\nwatched my PMP show I stress how\nimportant the project charter is.\n\n76\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.420\nThe number one most important\ncomponent on that whole thing is\n\n77\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.370\nthe project sponsor’s\nsignature at the bottom.\n\n78\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.430\nBecause that’s where we’re getting our\nauthority to be able to move forward\n\n79\n00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.437\nwith the project.\n\n80\n00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:51.457\nIf you don’t have that signature\nyou’re gonna be in real trouble.\n\n81\n00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.583\nAnd it’s not going to be your signature,\n\n82\n00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.636\nit’s whoever’s lending their\nauthority to the project.\n\n83\n00:04:56.636 --> 00:04:59.793\nBut while the signature is the most\nimportant part, it doesn’t help by itself.\n\n84\n00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:01.851\nAlthough, I guess if you had a blank sheet\nof paper with the sponsors signature.\n\n85\n00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:03.700\n>> [LAUGH] That would be great.\n\n86\n00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.503\n>> That could be useful, couldn’t it?\n\n87\n00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:07.427\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you typically want to have your\n\n88\n00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:10.879\nproject scope, if it's been defined,\nand your triple constraints,\n\n89\n00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.403\nyour things like your budget,\nyour schedule, and your requirements.\n\n90\n00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:15.937\nNow you may not have all those yet.\n\n91\n00:05:15.937 --> 00:05:16.979\nThey might be very high level.\n\n92\n00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.586\nYou might still be doing planning and\nadditional refining of that information,\n\n93\n00:05:21.586 --> 00:05:25.648\nbut at a minimum you need to be defining\nwhat the goal of your project is,\n\n94\n00:05:25.648 --> 00:05:30.020\nwhat it is that you want to achieve,\nthat's gonna be in that charter.\n\n95\n00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.520\nNow, a charter can be one piece of paper,\na simple email.\n\n96\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.090\nIt can be something written on\na napkin if it really has to be.\n\n97\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.770\nOr, it can be a two-hundred page\nvolume with appendices, and\n\n98\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.050\nall this stuff stuck on there, and\nit can really be extremely detailed\n\n99\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.230\ndepending on the information you have,\nbut it doesn't have to be.\n\n100\n00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.450\nThe key thing is that it exists, right?\n\n101\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.500\nIf you don't Have that charter\nyou're not ready to move forward.\n\n102\n00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.400\n>> Exactly, and often,\nI've used my project charter to go back.\n\n103\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.790\nYou mentioned scoping, and I can't tell\nyou how many times in my professional life\n\n104\n00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.550\nI've gone back to the project charter\nto make sure everyone understood what\n\n105\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.400\nwas our original goal, right?\n\n106\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.390\nAnd you wanna keep in mind that\na project charter in Lean Six Sigma\n\n107\n00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.980\nis a little bit more like a proposal,\ncuz even though it has the same\n\n108\n00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.390\nexact fields as a regular project charter,\nyou're just trying to get to measure.\n\n109\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.720\nYou're just trying to get\npermission to move forward so\n\n110\n00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.200\nthat you can study that problem, right?\n\n111\n00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.070\nOkay, so we've also said that\nanother thing that's required, and\n\n112\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.220\nit says over and over again, and\n\n113\n00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.690\nif you were hypothetically asked on\nan online test, is it required, it is.\n\n114\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.129\nYou need to develop a high level process\nmap and we said there's a lot of different\n\n115\n00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.739\nways that we can do that but\nI basically just need\n\n116\n00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:55.009\nto make sure that I know what's happening\nnow so that I can solve the problem.\n\n117\n00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.891\nNow, the next thing that\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n118\n00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.178\nwe addressed a little bit in\none of our earlier sessions and\n\n119\n00:07:01.178 --> 00:07:05.920\nthat's where we identified the process\nowner, the champion and the team.\n\n120\n00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.700\nNow remember the process owner is the\nperson who's responsible for the project,\n\n121\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.930\nthe champion might be our rah-rah\nsis-boom-bah kind of person, and\n\n122\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.940\nthen there's the team, and ideally\n\n123\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.560\nyou want a cross-functional team where\nyou have people from different areas, but\n\n124\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.689\nremember, in Lean Six Sigma,\nwe take a more realistic view.\n\n125\n00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:30.470\nYou're asking for\nhelp on a project that's probably not\n\n126\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.260\ngonna impact the team's life very much and\neveryone's busy, right?\n\n127\n00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.030\nSo you wanna do as much as possible for\nyour team.\n\n128\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.478\nIn fact,\nyou want to do all the footwork and\n\n129\n00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:42.728\nmaybe use your team more as an adviser.\n\n130\n00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.074\nYou want to reach out to your team.\n\n131\n00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:49.220\nYou might not be able to get\na team in a room together.\n\n132\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.020\nAnd frankly, there's been a lot\nof projects I've worked on\n\n133\n00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.960\nwhere it was just Team Dr. Stern.\n\n134\n00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.870\nSo there is no help.\n\n135\n00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.550\nBut, at this point,\n\n136\n00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.270\nin the beginning of your project,\nyou want to identify who can help you.\n\n137\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.540\nAnd sometimes that SIPOC that we\nlooked at in the episode before this,\n\n138\n00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.290\nsometimes that can help you as well.\n\n139\n00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:13.676\nNow I wanna define my customer and\nmy requirements, which are my CTQs, right?\n\n140\n00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:18.390\nAnd we spent a lot of time in\nthe last episodes talking about CTQs.\n\n141\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.837\nNow there's two that we haven't\nreally addressed but they're very,\n\n142\n00:08:20.837 --> 00:08:22.110\nvery important in the Define phase.\n\n143\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.490\nAnd that's, we wanna align the goals and\nbusiness Initiatives and\n\n144\n00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:34.000\non our project charter or our email, we\nwanna put projected return on investments.\n\n145\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.270\nI'm gonna talk about\nthose two things briefly.\n\n146\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.020\nAligning the goals and\nbusiness initiatives,\n\n147\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.590\nwhat that means is that when I'm\nlooking at my process improvement,\n\n148\n00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.050\nI need to be able to tie it to the\ndepartment goals or to the company Goals.\n\n149\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.960\nThat's even better, if I can do that.\n\n150\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.660\nIf you're working for a public company,\na lot times, you can just look through\n\n151\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.180\nthe annual report, and they'll have\na list of this is what we stand for.\n\n152\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.110\nThese are our goals.\n\n153\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.330\nThese are our values.\n\n154\n00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.230\nThese are our mission.\n\n155\n00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.730\nWe wanna tie that process\nimprovement program to that or\n\n156\n00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.270\nto what those similar things that\nare going on in our department.\n\n157\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.070\nIt does not have to be a dot\nto dot connection, but\n\n158\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.360\nif you're honestly looking at\nthis process improvement and\n\n159\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.170\nyou don't really understand\nhow it connects to something\n\n160\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.600\nthat does tie to the mission, goals,\nvalues, objectives those types of things.\n\n161\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.850\nThe now projects going to be\nthe very first project to\n\n162\n00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.670\nbe dumped if you have\na change in leadership.\n\n163\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.415\nSo it's really important to spend\ntime thinking about how does\n\n164\n00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:41.040\nthis impact the business as a whole.\n\n165\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.660\n>> Yeah, and that's really critical for\nany project, not just process improvement.\n\n166\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.100\nAnd we really blend the lines here\nbetween the two that not every project is\n\n167\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.390\na process improvement project.\n\n168\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.910\nBut process improvement\ngenerally becomes a project, so\n\n169\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.330\nit really kind of falls in that mix.\n\n170\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.940\nAnd a lot of things we can apply\nto process improvement applies\n\n171\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.750\nto the projects too.\n\n172\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.760\nYou want to make sure that everybody's\naligned, has the same vision,\n\n173\n00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.670\nworking towards the same goal.\n\n174\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.012\nOtherwise you get disarray and\nI think we've all seen that at least once.\n\n175\n00:10:10.012 --> 00:10:11.540\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n176\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.277\nThen we want to determine\nprojected return on investment.\n\n177\n00:10:13.277 --> 00:10:21.800\nNow this gets a little different\nin Six Sigma than Lean Six Sigma.\n\n178\n00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.190\nIn Six Sigma, if I were to tell you that I\ninvested $10,000 and I got $10,000 back,\n\n179\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:33.190\nin Lean Six Sigma we're going to say\nwe got a zero return on investment.\n\n180\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.890\nIn Six Sigma, they'll say, well,\nactually, you're kind of behind.\n\n181\n00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.790\nBecause you spent your time and resources,\nand if all you got back was $10,000,\n\n182\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.620\nthen you probably have\na negative return on investment.\n\n183\n00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.220\nSo one of the kind of fun things about\nLean Six Sigma is that when you're\n\n184\n00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.490\ndoing regular return on investment, which\nyou'll do at the end of your project,\n\n185\n00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.660\nyou have definitive numbers and\nso it's not as difficult to do.\n\n186\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.020\nBut in the projected return\non investment world,\n\n187\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.140\nLean Six Sigma takes a more flexible view.\n\n188\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.680\nSo they would say, if you put $10,000 in,\n\n189\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.640\nand got $10,000 back,\nit's zero return on investment.\n\n190\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.810\nBecause projected return on\ninvestment is just your guess.\n\n191\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.320\nNow how do I come up with\na guess when I don't even know\n\n192\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.640\nwhat I'm gonna have to do\nto solve this problem?\n\n193\n00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.470\nWhat you want to do is you wanna step back\nand you wanna look at if this problem did\n\n194\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.530\nnot exist, how much could it potentially\nmake, save, or avoid spending my company?\n\n195\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.580\nAnd it's very important to get that on\nyour initial project charter because why\n\n196\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.870\nwould your boss want you to even do\nsomething if it's not gonna make save or\n\n197\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.500\navoid spending something.\n\n198\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.456\nNow it can get kinda tricky\nDon because I don't wanna say,\n\n199\n00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:50.621\nI don't wanna overestimate because then\neveryone has this high expectation that\n\n200\n00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:52.750\nI'm going to bring in a million dollars.\n\n201\n00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.607\nSo there's some things to think about\nwhen I'm populating projected return on\n\n202\n00:11:57.607 --> 00:11:58.485\ninvestment.\n\n203\n00:11:58.485 --> 00:12:03.732\nCertainly, if you've done the same thing\nat another company, you can use that.\n\n204\n00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:06.708\nAnd projected return on investment,\na lot of times,\n\n205\n00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:09.301\njust is being able to\nhave a logical argument.\n\n206\n00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:10.786\nWhen someone says hey,\n\n207\n00:12:10.786 --> 00:12:15.627\nhow did you come up with that number\nthat you're able to answer back fluidly.\n\n208\n00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:18.727\nAnd certainly, if you did it at another\ncompany, you could say that, right?\n\n209\n00:12:18.727 --> 00:12:20.857\nOr you could go out to the Internet and\n\n210\n00:12:20.857 --> 00:12:25.484\nsee another company that did the same\nthing and use that as a case study, right?\n\n211\n00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:31.381\nThere are a lot of tools to kind of figure\nout projected return on investment.\n\n212\n00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:35.563\nBut again, it goes back to observing and\nlooking at labor and\n\n213\n00:12:35.563 --> 00:12:37.208\nthose types of things.\n\n214\n00:12:37.208 --> 00:12:39.677\n>> Yeah, and\nyou're gonna find on return on investment,\n\n215\n00:12:39.677 --> 00:12:42.526\nthat historical data is really critical,\nif it's available.\n\n216\n00:12:42.526 --> 00:12:44.690\nAnd you might have that internally\nin your own organization,\n\n217\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.240\nyou might actually subscribe to a service.\n\n218\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.841\nI know in the IT world a lot of\ntimes we'll use Gartner Group or\n\n219\n00:12:48.841 --> 00:12:49.665\nplaces like that.\n\n220\n00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:54.042\nAnd we can say well, this other company or\nGartner Group's other members.\n\n221\n00:12:54.042 --> 00:12:56.069\nWhen they deployed a storage area network,\n\n222\n00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:58.986\nhere's the amount of savings\nthey generated when they did it.\n\n223\n00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:02.530\nSo when we do it,\nit would probably be similar, right?\n\n224\n00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.400\nIt's safe to assume,\nI know we don't normally want to assume,\n\n225\n00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.700\nbut it's fairly safe to assume because\nwe've got this historical data.\n\n226\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.370\nBut sometimes you've got\nan initiative that is cutting edge.\n\n227\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.440\nYou're doing something that's different\nthan any other company that's out\n\n228\n00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.800\nthere and you don't have historical data.\n\n229\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.458\nAnd in that scenario, we just have to make\nthe best use of the data that we have\n\n230\n00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:23.590\nwhich unfortunately might be conjecture.\n\n231\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.615\nBut that's where we have to rely\non our subject matter experts and\n\n232\n00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:29.151\npeople that are far more\nknowledgeable in that field.\n\n233\n00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:34.283\nAnd it may take not just one person or\ntwo people, it could take 20 or 30 people.\n\n234\n00:13:34.283 --> 00:13:37.491\nIt may take outside consultants\nto really get reliable data, and\n\n235\n00:13:37.491 --> 00:13:38.904\nthat has a cost too, right?\n\n236\n00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:41.562\nA cost in time and\nmoney of generating that data.\n\n237\n00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:43.488\n>> Exactly.\n\n238\n00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:47.620\nSo when we're looking at the define phase,\n\n239\n00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.544\nif we really follow through\nwith those activities.\n\n240\n00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:57.802\nGenerally speaking, we're set to move\non a small project or a large project.\n\n241\n00:13:57.802 --> 00:14:01.484\nThey're tools that help facilitate that,\na lot of them we've already talked about.\n\n242\n00:14:01.484 --> 00:14:03.754\nBut I briefly wanna\naddress these tools and\n\n243\n00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:05.905\ngive you a little bit more information.\n\n244\n00:14:05.905 --> 00:14:09.279\nAgain, this is a good\nhandout to get familiar with,\n\n245\n00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:13.359\nbecause it tells you the basic\nactivities and the basic tools.\n\n246\n00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:17.389\nSo the basic tools under define,\nthe first one we've done a lot already,\n\n247\n00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:18.826\nwhich is brainstorming.\n\n248\n00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:22.623\nNow, just regular brainstorming\nis still a good tool.\n\n249\n00:14:22.623 --> 00:14:26.404\nWe have a tendency in Lean Six Sigma\nto do structured brainstorming,\n\n250\n00:14:26.404 --> 00:14:28.043\nbecause it speeds things up.\n\n251\n00:14:28.043 --> 00:14:31.457\nA Project Charter Template or\nform can be helpful.\n\n252\n00:14:31.457 --> 00:14:34.689\nAgain, even if you're just\ngonna write an email,\n\n253\n00:14:34.689 --> 00:14:38.759\ngetting the SSV global template or\na template off the Internet.\n\n254\n00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:43.240\nAnd following that template in\nan email is a really good idea.\n\n255\n00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:48.409\nNow one of the things that we haven't\ntalked about is graphing software and\n\n256\n00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:50.961\nspecifically the house of quality.\n\n257\n00:14:50.961 --> 00:14:54.501\nSo I wanna spend a couple of\nmoments talking about that.\n\n258\n00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:57.922\nFirst, I need to remind you\nthat in the activities and\n\n259\n00:14:57.922 --> 00:15:01.199\nthe tools section of this\nparticular collateral.\n\n260\n00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.182\nThese are tools that are used all\nthe way up to master black belt,\n\n261\n00:15:04.182 --> 00:15:06.957\nso some of the tools we don't\nreally cover in this episode.\n\n262\n00:15:06.957 --> 00:15:08.919\nWe just want you to know\nthat they're available.\n\n263\n00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:12.885\nAnd there's nothing that would prohibit\nyou from taking that particular tool and\n\n264\n00:15:12.885 --> 00:15:14.677\nresearching and using it yourself.\n\n265\n00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:18.578\n>> And that's really true of anything on\nthis whole activities spreadsheet, right?\n\n266\n00:15:18.578 --> 00:15:22.293\nThat as a yellow belt,\nI'm not gonna do all of this stuff.\n\n267\n00:15:22.293 --> 00:15:24.163\nIt'll probably just be a handful\nof things, kind of pick and\n\n268\n00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:25.160\nchoose throughout it, right?\n\n269\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.238\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n270\n00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:30.338\nOkay, so graphing software,\nwhen we talk about graphing software.\n\n271\n00:15:30.338 --> 00:15:35.255\nLean Six Sigma has a tendency\nto depend on Microsoft products,\n\n272\n00:15:35.255 --> 00:15:39.729\nbecause Excel has all kinds\nof easy ways to graph things.\n\n273\n00:15:39.729 --> 00:15:43.922\nAnd almost every Lean Six Sigma\nenvironment kind\n\n274\n00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:48.634\nof sticks to the Excel,\nMicrosoft product type line.\n\n275\n00:15:48.634 --> 00:15:53.364\nHowever, there's also software\nthat's independent and\n\n276\n00:15:53.364 --> 00:15:57.631\nyou've probably heard names such as SPC or\nMinitab.\n\n277\n00:15:57.631 --> 00:16:01.775\nAnd those are standalone statistics\npackages that do graphing and statistics.\n\n278\n00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:04.485\nAnd so sometimes,\nas a Lean Six Sigma person,\n\n279\n00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:08.320\nyou might run into standalone\nsoftware that also does graphing.\n\n280\n00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:17.932\nThere are a number of products, the one\nI use is QI Macros, that lay into Excel.\n\n281\n00:16:17.932 --> 00:16:21.291\nAnd what I mean by that is when\nyou purchase those products,\n\n282\n00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:25.130\nNorthwestern University is also\ndeveloping one right as we speak.\n\n283\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.259\nWhen you go into Excel,\nyou see an extra menu item and\n\n284\n00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:34.697\nthat menu item just aids\nyou in doing graphs.\n\n285\n00:16:34.697 --> 00:16:39.478\nExcel however does a great job just on\nit's own, even without the add-ins.\n\n286\n00:16:39.478 --> 00:16:44.455\nNow one of the graphs that's incredibly\npopular is something called house\n\n287\n00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:45.330\nof quality.\n\n288\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:50.310\nThis is a little bit more popular\nin the manufacturing world,\n\n289\n00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.910\nthan it is in the service world.\n\n290\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.211\nHowever, it's kind of making\na comeback in a different way and\n\n291\n00:16:56.211 --> 00:16:59.214\nthat's why I wanted to include\nit in this presentation.\n\n292\n00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:02.620\nA house of quality used to be a very,\nvery,\n\n293\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.932\nin some environments still is,\nkind of a very intricate diagram.\n\n294\n00:17:07.932 --> 00:17:12.669\nIn the middle of the diagram,\nit shows something called the CTQ tree.\n\n295\n00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:15.989\nAnd if you remember,\nCTQ is critical to quality.\n\n296\n00:17:15.989 --> 00:17:20.865\nAnd in the critical to quality tree,\nit lists all the customer requirements and\n\n297\n00:17:20.865 --> 00:17:23.210\nanything that's really important.\n\n298\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.411\nThen along the top part of the house,\n\n299\n00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:29.688\nit says what are our technical\ncapabilities on a scale from one to five.\n\n300\n00:17:29.688 --> 00:17:34.471\nIt's very subjective for fulfilling\nthat particular customer requirement.\n\n301\n00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:38.792\nAnd then different parts of the house\nmight show relationships between\n\n302\n00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:41.970\nthe requirements and\nthe technical capabilities.\n\n303\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.290\nIn some house of quality,\none shutter might say,\n\n304\n00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.750\nhow well the competitors are doing.\n\n305\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.610\nIn another shutter,\nit might be some benchmarking.\n\n306\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:56.281\nSo there's a lot of flexibility, there is\na template available on your course files,\n\n307\n00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.013\nso that you can kind of\nget the swing of it.\n\n308\n00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:03.552\nNow the reason why I'm bringing this up\nis because there's kind of a new thing in\n\n309\n00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:04.910\nLean Six Sigma.\n\n310\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.991\nWhere people are taking this concept,\nhouse of quality, and\n\n311\n00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:10.492\nthey're doing some really\ncrazy things with it.\n\n312\n00:18:10.492 --> 00:18:11.332\nFor example,\n\n313\n00:18:11.332 --> 00:18:15.959\nthey might have pillars on their house\nthat represents their company values.\n\n314\n00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:20.908\nThey might have steps leading\nup to their house that says\n\n315\n00:18:20.908 --> 00:18:23.970\nthese are some of our major goals.\n\n316\n00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.257\nThe sun is their vision.\n\n317\n00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:31.934\nThey sometimes even have a chimney,\nand that represents their waste.\n\n318\n00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:35.880\nAnd so you hear the term house of quality,\nit used to be, like I said,\n\n319\n00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.257\na fairly intricate schematic that you\nhave an example on your sample files.\n\n320\n00:18:40.257 --> 00:18:43.168\nBut these days, people are getting very,\nvery clever with their house\n\n321\n00:18:43.168 --> 00:18:45.605\nof quality and they're using\nit to do lots of other things.\n\n322\n00:18:46.815 --> 00:18:48.985\nNow in define, why is that important?\n\n323\n00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:53.132\nIf you're working for a company that\nhas created a house of quality,\n\n324\n00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.643\nwhich is becoming more and more popular.\n\n325\n00:18:55.643 --> 00:19:00.240\nYou wanna make sure that when you're in\ndefine, that you are recognizing those\n\n326\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.563\nvalues and missions and things that\nthey recorded in at house og quality and\n\n327\n00:19:04.563 --> 00:19:07.880\nmake sure that somehow partners\nwith what you are doing.\n\n328\n00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.730\nNow, so, stakeholders analysis\nis an interesting one.\n\n329\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:16.160\nIn the project management world,\nwe are told that a stakeholder's\n\n330\n00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.495\nanalysis that one thing we can\nuse a stakeholder's analysis for,\n\n331\n00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:24.271\nis to see what is one of the things.\n\n332\n00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:26.025\nSorry, I lost my train\nof thought there Don.\n\n333\n00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:29.421\nThat one of the things that we\ncan use a stakeholders analysis,\n\n334\n00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:32.817\njust to say who's for us,\nwho's against us, who's for us but\n\n335\n00:19:32.817 --> 00:19:37.005\n,they're not gonna help us, who's\nagainst us, but won't get in our way.\n\n336\n00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:39.984\nMe personally, that's the one\npiece of project management,\n\n337\n00:19:39.984 --> 00:19:41.905\nthat's always made me kind of nervous.\n\n338\n00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:45.711\nAnd I am certainly, wouldn't want\na document like that circulating around.\n\n339\n00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:47.154\n>> The challenge with it is,\n\n340\n00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:50.309\ndoing it in a way that actually\nmakes sense to everybody.\n\n341\n00:19:50.309 --> 00:19:52.604\nAnd at the end of the day,\nand the way you describe it,\n\n342\n00:19:52.604 --> 00:19:54.549\nthat's exactly how we wanna use it, right?\n\n343\n00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:56.704\nBut, there are ways to do it\nthat's a little more tactful.\n\n344\n00:19:56.704 --> 00:19:58.968\nAt a minimum,\nyou wanna do a stakeholder analysis so,\n\n345\n00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:00.999\nthat you can build up\nyour communications plan.\n\n346\n00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.183\nHow do I wanna communicate\nwith each of these people?\n\n347\n00:20:03.183 --> 00:20:06.316\nAnd that can be as simple as,\nI need to email this person.\n\n348\n00:20:06.316 --> 00:20:08.139\nI need to call this person on the phone.\n\n349\n00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:12.383\nThis person likes face to face meetings,\nand so, when you build your stakeholder\n\n350\n00:20:12.383 --> 00:20:16.320\nlist, that's kinda the premise that we\nuse to initially build it, but then\n\n351\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.811\nyou start assigning responsibilites, and\nwe can get into things like responsibility\n\n352\n00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:25.052\nassignment matrixes or matrices and all\nthat goodness, but at the end of the day,\n\n353\n00:20:25.052 --> 00:20:28.860\nwhat you really need to know is,\nhow do I handle each of these people?\n\n354\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.737\nAnd some people,\nthis is the one that I always run into.\n\n355\n00:20:30.737 --> 00:20:32.770\nIt's not they're for my project.\n\n356\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.268\nIt's not that they're against my project.\n\n357\n00:20:34.268 --> 00:20:36.851\nIt's that they just don't care, right?\n\n358\n00:20:36.851 --> 00:20:37.432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n359\n00:20:37.432 --> 00:20:39.625\neven that is something that\nwe've gotta say, all right,\n\n360\n00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:42.523\nI don't wanna over communicate to\nthis person, because they don't care.\n\n361\n00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:44.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, I don't wanna under communicate,\n\n362\n00:20:44.235 --> 00:20:46.794\ncuz I do need them to be aware, and\nyou gotta find that sweet spot.\n\n363\n00:20:46.794 --> 00:20:49.466\nSo, there's a lot of\nbenefit to having this,\n\n364\n00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:54.264\nit is something you don't necessarily want\nto share with people because it's your\n\n365\n00:20:54.264 --> 00:20:58.054\nintimate knowledge of the people\nthat you work with, I suppose.\n\n366\n00:20:58.054 --> 00:21:03.219\n>> Exactly, and that's the way that Lean\nSix Sigma uses a stakeholder's analysis,\n\n367\n00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:07.598\njust as Don was expressing,\nis that it's more a communication plan.\n\n368\n00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:14.360\nAnd I don't know I still am\nvery careful when I do it.\n\n369\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.720\nBut, it does bring\ninsight to your project.\n\n370\n00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.309\nNow the next one is called,\nif you're looking at the schematic,\n\n371\n00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:20.635\nthe next one is historical data.\n\n372\n00:21:20.635 --> 00:21:26.040\nNow this is really an interesting one,\nbecause original leans that Sigma\n\n373\n00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.370\nthinking considered historical data\nthings such as the annual report.\n\n374\n00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.043\nLike I need to to know what my company's\ndoing, and I have to tell you for\n\n375\n00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:39.086\nanyone out there that's looking for\na job or working in the consulting world,\n\n376\n00:21:39.086 --> 00:21:43.435\nit's amazing all the things that companies\nhave on their websites that I feed back to\n\n377\n00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.643\nmy client, and they go, wow,\nreally that's interesting.\n\n378\n00:21:46.643 --> 00:21:48.397\nI read it on their website.\n\n379\n00:21:48.397 --> 00:21:54.254\nSo, we started including, if you're\nnew to a job or you're in a consulting\n\n380\n00:21:54.254 --> 00:21:59.855\nsituation that certainly go to\nthe website and look at historical data.\n\n381\n00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:04.261\nAnd examples of that would be press\nreleases, who was in charge before,\n\n382\n00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:05.499\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n383\n00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.759\nSo it sounds kind of simplistic,\nbut it really,\n\n384\n00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.750\nreally can help you when you're\ntrying to define your project.\n\n385\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.916\nBut ,then we even took\nit one step further.\n\n386\n00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:17.693\nIf you're in a department\nlooking at historical data,\n\n387\n00:22:17.693 --> 00:22:19.294\nhow do they put forms together?\n\n388\n00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:21.313\nHow do they communicate with each other?\n\n389\n00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:23.380\nHow are things things handled culturally.\n\n390\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.320\nNow in the Six Sigma world,\nthis is not particularly addressed.\n\n391\n00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.695\nBut, in the Lean Six Sigma world,\nwhich is a little bit more concerned with\n\n392\n00:22:31.695 --> 00:22:36.435\nthe people factor, knowing how people work\nand how to partner with them is huge.\n\n393\n00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:41.077\nBecause remember, Lean Six Sigma isn't\nout to get you to do things differently.\n\n394\n00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:44.263\nIt's out to enhance the ways\nyou're already doing things and\n\n395\n00:22:44.263 --> 00:22:47.891\nmake those things, again, better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n396\n00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:50.504\nAnd finally,\nthe last thing I wanna address,\n\n397\n00:22:50.504 --> 00:22:53.998\nis return on investment formulas and\ncost benefit analysis.\n\n398\n00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:58.780\nIn your sample files, you have an Excel\nspreadsheet that will help you calculate\n\n399\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.030\nreturn on investment,\nit's just an easy way to do it.\n\n400\n00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:06.268\nI wanna caution you that, if you're\nworking for a company and you're not\n\n401\n00:23:06.268 --> 00:23:11.187\na consultant, you're working for an actual\ncompany, you wanna make sure that you go\n\n402\n00:23:11.187 --> 00:23:15.990\nto the finance department and find out how\ndo they calculate return on Investment?\n\n403\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.238\nNow in define, you're doing\nprojected return on investment, but,\n\n404\n00:23:20.238 --> 00:23:22.398\nit's still a good time to find out,\n\n405\n00:23:22.398 --> 00:23:25.939\nhow do they actually discern\nthat they're making money?\n\n406\n00:23:25.939 --> 00:23:31.702\nBecause in some finance departments, they\nhave a little bit more bigger formula,\n\n407\n00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:36.643\nthey might wanna consider things\nlike interest and immatization, and\n\n408\n00:23:36.643 --> 00:23:39.110\ndifferent things like that.\n\n409\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.800\nBut having a calculator just to\nkind of get a quick idea, and\n\n410\n00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.110\nif you're trying to throw some\nnumbers at a projected return on\n\n411\n00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.080\ninvestment it really kind of helps, just\nto have return on investment formulas.\n\n412\n00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.260\nA cost benefit analysis, and that is also\navailable to you on your sample files,\n\n413\n00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.020\nthe value there is when\nyou're trying to come up with\n\n414\n00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.590\nprojected return on investment, sometimes\nit just helps to look at the categories,\n\n415\n00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:08.610\nso we're not really actually saying a cost\nbenefit analysis is an actual tool so\n\n416\n00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.290\nmuch as just a place to get some ideas.\n\n417\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.749\nOh, yeah,\ndid I consider facilities expenses?\n\n418\n00:24:13.749 --> 00:24:14.980\nDid I consider salaries?\n\n419\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.680\nDid I consider equipment and\nthose types of things?\n\n420\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.870\nSo, as I mentioned, moving forward\ninto the other phases, we won't\n\n421\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.650\nbe going in depth for each one of these\nthese phases, like we did on this handout.\n\n422\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.160\nBut, the defined phase is so\nimportant that you get that straight.\n\n423\n00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.427\n>> Well I think that's a pretty\ngood rundown there of the phase,\n\n424\n00:24:35.427 --> 00:24:39.625\nour activities, our tools,\nall things that are involved.\n\n425\n00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:42.386\nRemember, you're not necessarily\ngoing to use 100% of those.\n\n426\n00:24:42.386 --> 00:24:44.948\nYou're going to use the ones that\nare appropriate for your environment,\n\n427\n00:24:44.948 --> 00:24:46.821\nand you may not be responsible for\nall of them either.\n\n428\n00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:48.481\nYou might have multiple\npeople working on these.\n\n429\n00:24:48.481 --> 00:24:50.735\nBut, they're all very critical and\nvery important,\n\n430\n00:24:50.735 --> 00:24:53.362\nso, I think at this point though\n>> That's a pretty good wrap up of\n\n431\n00:24:53.362 --> 00:24:54.355\nthe define phase for us.\n\n432\n00:24:54.355 --> 00:24:56.470\nWe still have four more phases\nto get through, though, so\n\n433\n00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.512\nthose are gonna be coming up\nin our following episodes.\n\n434\n00:24:58.512 --> 00:25:00.477\nDefinitely stay tuned for those,\n\n435\n00:25:00.477 --> 00:25:04.214\nbut do we have anything else we\nwanna throw in on the define phase?\n\n436\n00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:08.441\n>> The only thing that I'd like to add\nis that, typically with my students,\n\n437\n00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:13.285\nthat whole concept of projected return on\ninvestment is usually something that kind\n\n438\n00:25:13.285 --> 00:25:14.460\nof stymies people.\n\n439\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.188\nAnd just remember that the goal,\n\n440\n00:25:16.188 --> 00:25:19.827\nwhen you're doing projected return\non investment for your self or for\n\n441\n00:25:19.827 --> 00:25:22.614\nyour company is just to be\nable to defend that number.\n\n442\n00:25:22.614 --> 00:25:24.378\nHow did you come up with that number.\n\n443\n00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:29.777\nHaving a clear logic that you can explain\nto your boss or to your family is huge.\n\n444\n00:25:29.777 --> 00:25:31.054\n>> Definitely important.\n\n445\n00:25:31.054 --> 00:25:32.737\nAll right, well,\nI hope you guys enjoyed this.\n\n446\n00:25:32.737 --> 00:25:35.353\nDefinitely an area were gonna\nspend a lot of time in,\n\n447\n00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:39.457\nsome good information to have there\nabsolutely stay tune though, because we've\n\n448\n00:25:39.457 --> 00:25:43.262\ngot four more phases to move through,\nas we round off that [INAUDIBLE] model,\n\n449\n00:25:43.262 --> 00:25:46.601\nthat kind of key and critical part\nof the Lean Six Sigma processes.\n\n450\n00:25:46.601 --> 00:25:49.365\nSo, definitely stay tuned for\nthat, but for\n\n451\n00:25:49.365 --> 00:25:52.900\nright now, signing off for\nITPRO TV, I'm Don.\n\n452\n00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.850\n>> And I'm Dr Stern.\n\n453\n00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.016\n>> And we'll see you\n\n454\n00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:04.120\nnext time.\n\n",

and\ngood evening.\n\n4\n00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.971\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:21.100\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Lean Six Sigma and\n\n6\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.423\nfinally, ready to move past the define\nphase that we spent the last few episodes\n\n7\n00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:28.927\non and were gonna be jumping passed\nthat into the measure phase.\n\n8\n00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:30.727\nLots of exciting things here.\n\n9\n00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:34.987\nWe're gonna break out our rulers and\nmeasure some stuff it's going to amazing.\n\n10\n00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:38.284\nSo back on the show again to help\nus out here we've got Dr Stern.\n\n11\n00:00:38.284 --> 00:00:39.689\nDr. Stern thank you for being on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:41.651\n>> And thank you for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.477\n>> Now the measure phase,\nwhen we talk of measuring,\n\n14\n00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.486\nthere is no end to the amount of stuff\nthat we could measure at a given point\n\n15\n00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.600\nin a process or a project or\njust in business in general.\n\n16\n00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.362\nWhere do we start in terms of domain?\n\n17\n00:00:54.362 --> 00:00:58.815\n>> Well what's kind of interesting about\nthe measure phase is that word isn't\n\n18\n00:00:58.815 --> 00:00:59.587\nintuitive.\n\n19\n00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:02.988\nYou are measuring, and so\nthat's a good way to remember it.\n\n20\n00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:07.296\nBut what you're really trying to do in the\nmeasure phase is get a clear as is picture\n\n21\n00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:08.553\nof where you are today.\n\n22\n00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:14.052\nAnd we did talk about and define how we\nhave to have a high level process map,\n\n23\n00:01:14.052 --> 00:01:19.203\nin fact it's a requirement in define\nto have a high level process map,\n\n24\n00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:24.176\nbut when we get to measure what we're\ntrying to do is make sure we have\n\n25\n00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:28.148\na very accurate picture of\nwhat's happening today.\n\n26\n00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:30.005\nAnd we're doing that for\na couple of reasons.\n\n27\n00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:35.126\nOne, we have to establish a good before\npicture so that when we rollout our\n\n28\n00:01:35.126 --> 00:01:40.097\nawesome process improvement we can\ngo back and show our after picture.\n\n29\n00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:43.530\nAnd if we don't have a good clear before\npicture then we can do all kinds of\n\n30\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.080\nprocess improvement and\nmaybe not get credit for it.\n\n31\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.539\n>> Absolutely, and so this is another\none of those that is gonna be kind of\n\n32\n00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.926\nan ongoing things that\nwe're constantly measuring.\n\n33\n00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.535\nI was going to say monitoring right\nwhich really isn't much different is it?\n\n34\n00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:03.596\n>> Right, and a lot of cases that's\nwhat you're doing especially\n\n35\n00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:08.480\nif you're using observation as\na tool then you are monitory.\n\n36\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.437\nAnd in the PTC,\n\n37\n00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:13.565\nthe plan to check act model a lot\nof times when your in the checking,\n\n38\n00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:18.606\nyou're monitoring which maps a lot of\ntimes to the measure phase and the demand.\n\n39\n00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:21.090\n>> So we do have a lot of different\ntools that are available for us and\n\n40\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.750\nwe wanna take a look at\nsome of those tools.\n\n41\n00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.815\n>> We do you and I'm going to go ahead and\nstart my slide show just so\n\n42\n00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:28.600\nthat you can follow along.\n\n43\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.952\nWhen you enter the measure phase you\nhave something called the Y statement.\n\n44\n00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:40.129\nNow the Y statement you wouldn't leave\ndefine without your Y statement and\n\n45\n00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.100\nthe large Y represents positive outcome.\n\n46\n00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.714\nThis is what I'm shooting for.\n\n47\n00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:49.856\nSo whatever process I identified and\ndefined now I want to say,\n\n48\n00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:55.300\ndo I wanna make that process better\nfaster or more cost effective?\n\n49\n00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.297\nAnd so if I came out a define and I wanted\nto make the enrollment process faster,\n\n50\n00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:02.205\nthat would be my Y statement.\n\n51\n00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:06.820\nIf I wanted to make the hotel\nrooms a better experience that\n\n52\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.807\nwould be my Y statement.\n\n53\n00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:13.350\nBut I wouldn't leave define without\nidentifying the process that I want to\n\n54\n00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.028\nmake better faster or more cost effective.\n\n55\n00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:19.937\nNow, the unfortunate thing about this or\nI shouldn't really\n\n56\n00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:25.020\nsay unfortunate thing is that it still\nboils down to cost effectiveness.\n\n57\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.327\nSo even though I'm making something\nbetter or faster at some point,\n\n58\n00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:30.962\nI'm going to have to show\nhow that's cost effective.\n\n59\n00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:32.868\nAnd so lot of people say well in measure,\n\n60\n00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:35.007\nwhy don't you just do\ncost effective tools?\n\n61\n00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:39.268\nIf the name of the game is to show how\nit's going to make money, save money or\n\n62\n00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:42.393\navoid spending money why\ndon't you just start there?\n\n63\n00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:46.351\nAnd that's because the tools\nto make something better, and\n\n64\n00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:51.620\nthe tools to make something faster\nare different than our financial tools.\n\n65\n00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.919\nSo we have to tackle that problem\nfirst and then translate over.\n\n66\n00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.073\n>> And you know that this is something\nI've encountered myself in the IT world\n\n67\n00:03:58.073 --> 00:04:00.240\nthat a lot of times you\ndon't use these tools once.\n\n68\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.792\nRemember this is kind of a cycle\nthat we're constantly going through.\n\n69\n00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:06.218\nSo you might be using the same\ntool over and over and over.\n\n70\n00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:09.982\nAnd the first few times you use the you\nmight be getting a great return and\n\n71\n00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.082\nthen as you move beyond you\nstop getting that same return.\n\n72\n00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:14.545\nAnd we see this in up times.\n\n73\n00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:18.009\nI've designed a disaster\nrecovery center for\n\n74\n00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.088\ncompanies where you might shoot for\n99.99% uptime, right?\n\n75\n00:04:23.088 --> 00:04:23.669\nFour nines.\n\n76\n00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.528\n>> Exactly.\n\n77\n00:04:24.528 --> 00:04:27.012\n>> And then after you achieve\nthat then you say okay,\n\n78\n00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:29.625\nwell what if I wanted five nines, 99.999%?\n\n79\n00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:30.677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n80\n00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:32.620\nit costs more money to\nget that kind of uptime.\n\n81\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.568\nAnd then if you wanna go to six nines,\nit costs even more money.\n\n82\n00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:37.843\nTechnically, I'm using the same\ndifferent types of tools.\n\n83\n00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:42.921\nLike redundancy and backups and all these\ndifferent solutions to achieve that, they\n\n84\n00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:47.786\njust get more expensive and eventually you\nget to a point where the cost to maintain\n\n85\n00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:52.251\nthat high uptime would exceed the money\nyou'd lose, if you had downtime.\n\n86\n00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:55.167\nAnd so at that point you say well,\nI'm just going to have downtime and\n\n87\n00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:55.884\nthat will be it.\n\n88\n00:04:55.884 --> 00:04:57.648\nThat's the cost effective way to do it.\n\n89\n00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:00.354\nSo a tool isn't necessarily always cut and\n\n90\n00:05:00.354 --> 00:05:03.811\ndry that it's going to be cost\neffective all the time or\n\n91\n00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:08.950\nnot be cost effective it might start out\ncost effective and become the office.\n\n92\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.789\n>> Exactly.\nAnd you know what are the things that I\n\n93\n00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.588\nreally love about Lean Six Sigma it's\nthat there's not a lot of rules about\n\n94\n00:05:16.588 --> 00:05:19.938\nusing the tools so\nonce you learn the basic tool set,\n\n95\n00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:23.926\nyou can modify them, reuse them and\nphases that creatively.\n\n96\n00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:28.082\nThere's really kind of no rules and\ntools designed to help you.\n\n97\n00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:33.410\nBut it's a tool itself becomes not cost\neffective, you wanna get rid of that tool.\n\n98\n00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.742\nAnd remember we have said this\nin other episodes as well.\n\n99\n00:05:36.742 --> 00:05:40.337\nYou wanna start with the simple easy tool\nfirst because you might be able to solve\n\n100\n00:05:40.337 --> 00:05:40.990\nthe problem.\n\n101\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.635\nAnd even if you have to bump up to the\nnext sophisticated tool using that kind\n\n102\n00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:46.520\nof thinking,\n\n103\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.185\nyou'll have information that will help\nyou facilitate that tool as well.\n\n104\n00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.199\nSo there's two things in\nmeasure that you're looking for\n\n105\n00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.235\nin order to get the clear as is picture.\n\n106\n00:05:56.235 --> 00:06:01.136\nAnd one of then is you've got to\ndetermine what it is you want to measure.\n\n107\n00:06:01.136 --> 00:06:03.341\nAnd frankly,\nI think that's the hardest part.\n\n108\n00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:07.602\nNow fortunately there's tools that\nhelp you figure out what I should be\n\n109\n00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:08.500\nlooking at.\n\n110\n00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.194\nIf the objective is to get\na clear before picture,\n\n111\n00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:13.582\nwhat do I need to be\nmeasuring to begin with.\n\n112\n00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:18.519\nAnd then the second part of that is\nthat you wanna determine the best tool\n\n113\n00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:22.978\nto use and Lean Six Sigma has\na simple explanation for best tool.\n\n114\n00:06:22.978 --> 00:06:26.704\nWe wanna make sure the tool\nis accurate and valid.\n\n115\n00:06:26.704 --> 00:06:33.322\nNow accurate, it's just what it says,\na very intuitive word, accuracy.\n\n116\n00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:38.094\nValid means that if someone else\nwere using the same tool under\n\n117\n00:06:38.094 --> 00:06:41.776\nthe same conditions,\nthat it would also work.\n\n118\n00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.748\nAnd the reason why I point\nthat out is because, validity.\n\n119\n00:06:44.748 --> 00:06:48.846\nEven in different phases of the debate\nmodel might mean something else but\n\n120\n00:06:48.846 --> 00:06:52.945\nin this particular phase we're saying\nwe want our tools to be reliable and\n\n121\n00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.151\naccurate and valid.\n\n122\n00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:55.779\nAnd we're seeing that valid,\n\n123\n00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.721\nwhen we're talking about it in the measure\nphase means that if someone else\n\n124\n00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.788\ncame right behind me and did the same\nthing I did like they stepped on the well,\n\n125\n00:07:03.788 --> 00:07:07.253\nI guess their weight would be different so\nthat's not a good one.\n\n126\n00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.672\nBut if [LAUGH] they came\nright behind me and\n\n127\n00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:13.457\nlooked at my weight on the scale\nthey would get the same number.\n\n128\n00:07:13.457 --> 00:07:14.222\nThat would probably be more.\n\n129\n00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:16.080\n>> You're moving into dangerous\nterritory on that one.\n\n130\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.194\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:18.320\n>> Maybe we should use age instead.\n\n132\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.705\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah age, that might be better.\n\n133\n00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:25.562\nSo I come in to measure and\nI have my why statement and\n\n134\n00:07:25.562 --> 00:07:29.169\nI have to figure out what\nit is I want to measure.\n\n135\n00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:34.198\nNow, let's say for example,\njust for argument's sake\n\n136\n00:07:34.198 --> 00:07:39.983\nthat I came out of define wanting\nto make a vacuum cleaner better.\n\n137\n00:07:39.983 --> 00:07:41.805\nThat's what I came out of define with.\n\n138\n00:07:41.805 --> 00:07:45.427\nSo my company makes vacuum cleaners and\nI want to make it better.\n\n139\n00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:50.159\nSo I know that the very first thing, even\nthough I'm not a vacuum cleaner expert or\n\n140\n00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:52.969\nengineer, I know the very\nfirst thing I have to do\n\n141\n00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.667\nis get a clear as this\npicture where I am today.\n\n142\n00:07:55.667 --> 00:08:00.241\nSo in this case that means looking at\nthe vacuum cleaner we are now selling.\n\n143\n00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:05.266\nAnd I might want to take that vacuum\ncleaner apart, piece by piece.\n\n144\n00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:08.930\nNow let's say,\nI'm looking at some of the bands and\n\n145\n00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.523\ngears that are working\ninside the vacuum cleaner.\n\n146\n00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:17.689\nI might not really know how to measure the\ndurability of one of the rubber gaskets.\n\n147\n00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:19.744\nBut I know that's what I want to do.\n\n148\n00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:23.163\nSo just knowing what I wanna do,\nsometimes I can outsource that,\n\n149\n00:08:23.163 --> 00:08:25.660\nsometimes I can look it up on the net.\n\n150\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.060\nSo sometimes when I'm trying to\nfigure out how to measure something.\n\n151\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.784\nI might not have a Lean Six Sigma\ntool I might have to look for\n\n152\n00:08:32.784 --> 00:08:34.620\nan industry specific tool.\n\n153\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.306\nBut the deal is when I\nget to measure I want\n\n154\n00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:42.433\nto try to figure out how\nare things going now.\n\n155\n00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:46.252\nAnd so that could be a process map,\nit could be taking things apart.\n\n156\n00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:50.999\nNow after I figure that out again,\nI have to determine what is the best tool.\n\n157\n00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:53.600\nNow there might be\nan industry specific tool.\n\n158\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.091\nBut there also might be a tool\nthat I question the accuracy on.\n\n159\n00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:06.174\nSo for example, several years ago I went\nto a Cinco de Mayo Festival in Anaheim.\n\n160\n00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:09.749\nAnd I have a beach house that has\nhe's incredibly angular walls.\n\n161\n00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.116\nAnd I found a painting\nthat I thought would fit.\n\n162\n00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:13.777\nAnd my husband was like,\nit's not gonna fit.\n\n163\n00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:14.914\nIt's like hey, you know what?\n\n164\n00:09:14.914 --> 00:09:17.237\nI got the dimensions, so I get that out.\n\n165\n00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:21.114\nAnd I realize I don't have\na measuring tape right.\n\n166\n00:09:21.114 --> 00:09:24.779\nSo I go to the 99 Cent Store which\nI absolutely love in California and\n\n167\n00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:28.648\nget a tape come back measure it it\nmeets my dimensions, I'm so excited.\n\n168\n00:09:28.648 --> 00:09:31.817\nAnd the picture comes back to the beach\nhouse and guess what it doesn't fit-\n\n169\n00:09:31.817 --> 00:09:33.315\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:09:33.315 --> 00:09:34.812\n>> And I couldn't figure it out.\n\n171\n00:09:34.812 --> 00:09:38.754\nWell after a while I went to\nlook at my measuring tape and\n\n172\n00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:43.054\nmeasuring tape from the 99\nCent Store was a few ticks off.\n\n173\n00:09:43.054 --> 00:09:47.044\nNow the reason I'm telling you\nthat story is it did not occur to\n\n174\n00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.672\nme to question my measuring technique.\n\n175\n00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:53.108\nWho would think that your measuring\ntape's going to be just enough off.\n\n176\n00:09:53.108 --> 00:09:54.606\nNow it still hangs in my beach house.\n\n177\n00:09:54.606 --> 00:09:57.346\nIt just hangs way off the wall.\n\n178\n00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.947\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it's kind of.\n\n179\n00:09:58.947 --> 00:10:00.449\nAnd it's a good story people come over.\n\n180\n00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:05.436\nBut so what you wanna do is you wanna make\nsure that your tools are calibrated or\n\n181\n00:10:05.436 --> 00:10:10.043\nthat the tool that you're using that\nyou don't just always assume that\n\n182\n00:10:10.043 --> 00:10:11.599\nthat's the best tool.\n\n183\n00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:16.539\nNow, this mostly comes into the picture\nwhen you're doing things such\n\n184\n00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:17.782\nas observation.\n\n185\n00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:24.440\nObservation is an incredible tool to get a\nclear as is picture of where we are today.\n\n186\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.740\nBut there's problems with observations.\n\n187\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.140\nDon, can you think of some problems if\nyou're basing your clear as-is picture of\n\n188\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.097\nwhere we are today on\nobservation what could go wrong?\n\n189\n00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:37.672\n>> Well, there's a lot of things\nthat depending on when you observe\n\n190\n00:10:37.672 --> 00:10:40.864\nthem could be different, so\njust I'm thinking seasons.\n\n191\n00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:42.025\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n192\n00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.277\n>> You observe something in the winter\ntime versus observing in the summer time.\n\n193\n00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:45.960\nIt can be a very drastic difference.\n\n194\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.804\nMetals expand, they contract.\n\n195\n00:10:48.804 --> 00:10:51.382\nSo you've also got peak times for\ncertain activities.\n\n196\n00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:51.962\n>> Sure.\n\n197\n00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:56.426\n>> And so maybe I'll use your fast food\nreference that you've kind of gone to\n\n198\n00:10:56.426 --> 00:11:00.962\nbecause everybody to do with fast food\nthat if you're measuring the amount\n\n199\n00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:03.642\nof time a customer takes\nto get their order.\n\n200\n00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:07.490\nAnd you measure that during the lunch\nrush versus measuring it during a lull\n\n201\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.944\nyou're gonna get two\nvery different results.\n\n202\n00:11:09.944 --> 00:11:14.132\nAnd so you've got to make sure that you\nare getting a bigger picture when you go\n\n203\n00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:18.321\nto monitor that it can I wanna say that\nit taints your results it's just bias,\n\n204\n00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:19.173\nI don't know.\n\n205\n00:11:19.173 --> 00:11:25.883\n>> Yeah, absolutely and I think that word\nbias, the word bias is the absolute key.\n\n206\n00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:28.403\nAnd the deal is, when you are in measure,\n\n207\n00:11:28.403 --> 00:11:33.163\nyou don't want someone to be able to stand\nup and say, well did you check this?\n\n208\n00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:34.300\nDid you check that?\n\n209\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.887\nAnd when you're basing\neverything on observation,\n\n210\n00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:38.502\nyou just wanna cover your bases.\n\n211\n00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:42.211\nSo yes, I observed the fast\nfood line at different times,\n\n212\n00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:46.919\nI had someone else also look at\nthe fastfood line, those types of things.\n\n213\n00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:51.428\nBut observation I think is probably\nstill one of the best tools to get\n\n214\n00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:54.445\na clearer as is picture\nof where we are today.\n\n215\n00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:59.519\nSome other key tools include the following\nbullet points on your slide.\n\n216\n00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.321\nThe detailed process map and\n\n217\n00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:06.591\nI want to talk about how that's a little\ndifferent than the High Level Process Map.\n\n218\n00:12:06.591 --> 00:12:10.622\nAnd because in this case,\nthese are tools that are suggested, but\n\n219\n00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:14.159\nthere's no rules like in define\nyou have those two rules.\n\n220\n00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:17.159\nYou have to have a High Level Process Map,\nyou have to have a Project Charter.\n\n221\n00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:19.351\nIn measure, it's incredibly creative.\n\n222\n00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:22.142\nYou get to measure what\nyou want to measure and\n\n223\n00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:24.943\nyou get to take the tools\nthat you want to use.\n\n224\n00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:29.805\nSo one suggestion is that you take that\nHigh Level Process Map that you had\n\n225\n00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:33.405\nto develop and define and\nmake it a more detailed map.\n\n226\n00:12:33.405 --> 00:12:38.354\nNow the rule of thumb that I use Don is\nthat if I'm parachuted into a department I\n\n227\n00:12:38.354 --> 00:12:39.704\nknow nothing about or\n\n228\n00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:45.043\nI find myself in a consulting situation in\na an industry that I'm not familiar with.\n\n229\n00:12:45.043 --> 00:12:47.882\nI go ahead and\ndo that Detailed Process Map and\n\n230\n00:12:47.882 --> 00:12:50.891\ndefine, because I use\nthat as a learning tool.\n\n231\n00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:52.226\nBut a lot of times,\n\n232\n00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:56.997\nyou're not going to to want to detail\nit out till you get to measure.\n\n233\n00:12:56.997 --> 00:12:59.850\nAnd when you detail it out step by step,\n\n234\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.745\nI almost think about it as\nlike break down structure.\n\n235\n00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:06.721\nWe said work breakdown structure has 1,\n2, 3,\n\n236\n00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:10.061\n4 in the outline and\nthen house those 1.1 and 1.2.\n\n237\n00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:12.061\nWe talked about that a lot of episodes.\n\n238\n00:13:12.061 --> 00:13:17.828\nSo my Detailed Process Map is sort\nof that one point 0.1, 1.2, 1.3.\n\n239\n00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:21.440\nNow what that bias me is that if\nI see the most detail possible,\n\n240\n00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.490\nI can see things such as hand offs and\nbottlenecks and those types of things.\n\n241\n00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.068\nAnd I might be able to study those\nto make those conditions better,\n\n242\n00:13:31.068 --> 00:13:33.377\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n243\n00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:37.635\nHowever in measure,\nI'm trying to not be bias at all,\n\n244\n00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:41.906\nI'm trying to just collect\ncollect the information.\n\n245\n00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:45.296\nAnd sometimes that's kind of hard,\nbecause we've left defined and\n\n246\n00:13:45.296 --> 00:13:47.760\nwe might have an idea of\nhow to solve that problem.\n\n247\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.382\nAnd so there's a tendency,\n\n248\n00:13:49.382 --> 00:13:52.906\nsometimes to measure things that\njust play into our premise.\n\n249\n00:13:52.906 --> 00:13:57.586\nSo it's almost better if you can get\nsomeone else to go out there and measure,\n\n250\n00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:02.194\nbut another thing that we would wanna\nlook at or could look at if we wanted to,\n\n251\n00:14:02.194 --> 00:14:04.512\nif we chose to is we go back to our CTQs.\n\n252\n00:14:04.512 --> 00:14:09.328\nNow if we took time to develop CTQs and\ndefine, because again that was an option.\n\n253\n00:14:09.328 --> 00:14:13.312\nAnd remember, CTQ stands for\ncritical to quality.\n\n254\n00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:20.817\nSo critical to the satisfaction, critical\nto the success, price, speed, quality.\n\n255\n00:14:20.817 --> 00:14:25.562\nIf we took the time to develop critical\nto quality factors, then in measure,\n\n256\n00:14:25.562 --> 00:14:30.316\nwe could say, hey, on a scale from one\nto five or one to ten, how are we doing?\n\n257\n00:14:30.316 --> 00:14:31.837\nDoing on that right now.\n\n258\n00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:36.813\nSo for example,\nin one of our critical to quality factors\n\n259\n00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:41.790\nin a former episode we used\nthe scenario that the facility\n\n260\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:46.885\nmanager needs janitorial help\non the university campus.\n\n261\n00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:50.501\nAnd we determined one of the CTQs\nis that they have proper access,\n\n262\n00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.154\nthat they are able to get\ninto these buildings.\n\n263\n00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:58.626\nSo if that's a CTQ, on a scale from one to\nfive, how are we doing on that right now?\n\n264\n00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:02.682\nSo that's another quick way and\nif you've done it in define,\n\n265\n00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:04.634\nit makes it kind of seamless.\n\n266\n00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:09.172\nAnother way is baseline sigma and we're\ngonna look at some sigma examples here in\n\n267\n00:15:09.172 --> 00:15:11.652\na second and benchmarking and scorecards.\n\n268\n00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:16.083\nAll of those things we're gonna\nbe discussing in this episode.\n\n269\n00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.540\nCurrent ROI.\n\n270\n00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.987\nNow, we talked about\nprojected ROI in define.\n\n271\n00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:26.919\nWhen we're trying to come up\nwith a return on investment,\n\n272\n00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:30.150\nif we took that problem out of the mix.\n\n273\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.260\nIf we took that problem out of the mix,\nwhat could it possibly make us save us or\n\n274\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.350\navoid us spending?\n\n275\n00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.678\nSo we talked about that.\n\n276\n00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:38.694\nNow in this case it's a little different.\n\n277\n00:15:38.694 --> 00:15:42.201\nWe're in measure and\nwe actually do have numbers involved.\n\n278\n00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:46.618\nSo we might be looking at a process\nthat essentially has ROI now.\n\n279\n00:15:46.618 --> 00:15:49.746\nIt tells us exactly the return\non investment is X.\n\n280\n00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:52.396\nSo just for an example, let's say,\n\n281\n00:15:52.396 --> 00:15:57.967\nI make lamps at my manufacturing company\nand I make $2 every time I do a lamp.\n\n282\n00:15:57.967 --> 00:15:59.873\nThat's my clear as is picture.\n\n283\n00:15:59.873 --> 00:16:04.858\nNow hopefully, when I roll out my\nprocess improvement in a later phase,\n\n284\n00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:08.469\nI'm going to increase\nthat to maybe to $2.30.\n\n285\n00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:12.157\nOr let's say, I provide a service and\n\n286\n00:16:12.157 --> 00:16:16.650\nthat service right now,\ntakes an hour to do and\n\n287\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:23.581\nan hour of that service labor-wise costs,\nlet's just say, $50.\n\n288\n00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:25.549\nSo that's my clear as is picture.\n\n289\n00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:28.869\nAnd hopefully,\nwhen I roll out my process improvement.\n\n290\n00:16:28.869 --> 00:16:32.397\nWhen I come back to check that I will say,\nwell,\n\n291\n00:16:32.397 --> 00:16:36.898\nnow this particular service\nonly takes me 30 minutes and so\n\n292\n00:16:36.898 --> 00:16:42.738\nI can show definitively that my labor\nhours went down and so I saved some money.\n\n293\n00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:46.122\n>> And this could actually take I\nguess two different forms depending.\n\n294\n00:16:46.122 --> 00:16:48.935\nWhen we talk about ROI\nin the define phase,\n\n295\n00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:53.859\nwe talk about how you might not have any\ndata to be able to compare against and\n\n296\n00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:56.225\nso you might rely on industry data.\n\n297\n00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:58.622\nThird party is the information\nto find this out there.\n\n298\n00:16:58.622 --> 00:17:03.693\nSo now, you've got this data that you're\nnot 100% sure you can trust and so\n\n299\n00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:08.852\nthis is almost like a way to validate that\ndata versus if you already had ROI data.\n\n300\n00:17:08.852 --> 00:17:12.043\nHere's your chance to validate your\ndata and show that it is accurate.\n\n301\n00:17:12.043 --> 00:17:15.363\nYou are moving in the right direction and\nthen continue on from there, right?\n\n302\n00:17:15.363 --> 00:17:19.605\n>> Exactly and people like to use\nthings like return on investment.\n\n303\n00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:24.591\nBecause if my job is to give you a clear\nas this picture of where we are today,\n\n304\n00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:28.327\nbut the other part of that job\nis I want you to believe me.\n\n305\n00:17:28.327 --> 00:17:30.459\nBecause if you don't believe my book or\npitch,\n\n306\n00:17:30.459 --> 00:17:34.034\nyou're not going to believe my after\npicture and we've all seen those pictures\n\n307\n00:17:34.034 --> 00:17:37.153\nof the lady with all the wrinkles and\nthen she uses the miracle cream.\n\n308\n00:17:37.153 --> 00:17:40.467\nAnd suddenly, she doesn't have any\nwrinkles but she's also taller and\n\n309\n00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:41.506\nhas a different hair.\n\n310\n00:17:41.506 --> 00:17:43.963\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've got to be really careful about\n\n311\n00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:47.277\nthat and we can for\nallow things such as return on investment,\n\n312\n00:17:47.277 --> 00:17:49.204\npeople sort of immediately get it.\n\n313\n00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:51.465\nAnd that's the same thing\nthat's true about benchmarking,\n\n314\n00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:53.475\nwhich we're gonna spend\na little time talking about.\n\n315\n00:17:53.475 --> 00:17:58.099\nPeople understand benchmarks even if they\ndon't really understand the whole dynamic\n\n316\n00:17:58.099 --> 00:17:59.119\nof the benchmark.\n\n317\n00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:02.273\nIf you tell people\nthe benchmark is here and\n\n318\n00:18:02.273 --> 00:18:06.660\nwe're here,\npeople get that we're below the benchmark.\n\n319\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.595\nAnd then finally, one of the things\nthat will be wrapping up the measure\n\n320\n00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:15.964\nphase with is a little bit talk\nabout the data collection plan.\n\n321\n00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:19.991\nOne of the things that you wanna\nremember is that when you're in define,\n\n322\n00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:21.651\nyou are behind closed doors.\n\n323\n00:18:21.651 --> 00:18:26.104\nAnd so really, the most anyone could say\nat the workplace is like, what are they\n\n324\n00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:30.240\ndoing behind closed doors or they sure\nare spending a lot of time in there?\n\n325\n00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.456\nWhen you're in measure,\nyou're on the floor.\n\n326\n00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:36.991\nYou're in your service industry,\nyou're out of the manufacturing floor,\n\n327\n00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:41.804\nyou're in the parking lot, you're in\nthe hospital and just the fact that you're\n\n328\n00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:46.291\ninformation down and writing it in your\nnotebook or putting it on your iPad.\n\n329\n00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.049\nPeople start getting a little nervous.\n\n330\n00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:52.465\nI've even had people go to the complete\nother side of the continuum and say,\n\n331\n00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.433\nthey're there after my job\nreally no matter what.\n\n332\n00:18:55.433 --> 00:18:59.459\nSometimes, people get nervous\nwhen you go ask them for data.\n\n333\n00:18:59.459 --> 00:19:02.570\nSo one of the things that\na data collection plan can do.\n\n334\n00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.579\nIf you can get it released in your\nnewsletter or you can send out an email is\n\n335\n00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:11.117\nit lets people know why you're collecting\nthe day data and what you're going to do\n\n336\n00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:15.326\nwith the data and a lot of times that\nmakes people little bit more comfortable\n\n337\n00:19:15.326 --> 00:19:19.389\nand they're much more likely to give\nyou the information that you need.\n\n338\n00:19:19.389 --> 00:19:24.301\nSo, another thing that data collection\nplans help us with is to make\n\n339\n00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:28.447\nsure that we actually have\nthe authority to get the data.\n\n340\n00:19:28.447 --> 00:19:32.603\nI've been in a couple of situations\nwhere the CEO told me to get data and\n\n341\n00:19:32.603 --> 00:19:36.760\nthere there was a secretary in\nthe records department saying, well,\n\n342\n00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.172\nyou don't have the proper signatures.\n\n343\n00:19:39.172 --> 00:19:44.375\nSo these are key tools that help\nus measure and figure out what\n\n344\n00:19:44.375 --> 00:19:51.328\nwe should be measuring snd the first one\nwe're gonna talk about is sigma levels.\n\n345\n00:19:51.328 --> 00:19:54.113\nIt is just one way to\nmeasure process improvement.\n\n346\n00:19:54.113 --> 00:19:57.581\nWe spend a little bit of time on\nsigma levels and at the same time,\n\n347\n00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:00.613\nwe go really quickly through\nsome other measurements.\n\n348\n00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:04.154\nBut since it is Lean Six Sigma and\nsigma is part of the name,\n\n349\n00:20:04.154 --> 00:20:08.007\nI just wanna make sure that you\nhave a good idea of what sigma is.\n\n350\n00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:10.391\n>> It seems like that would be kind\nof important since it is in the name.\n\n351\n00:20:10.391 --> 00:20:12.231\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n352\n00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:16.049\nWell, you're probably gonna want\nto come back a later time and\n\n353\n00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.642\npause on the slide and\nreally study it, but\n\n354\n00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:22.482\nwhat you're looking at right now\nare the the six sigma levels.\n\n355\n00:20:22.482 --> 00:20:24.547\nAnd you'll notice that it says,\n\n356\n00:20:24.547 --> 00:20:28.100\ndefective items in the middle\nof this particular chart.\n\n357\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.935\nAnd what that's essentially saying is that\nat one sigma, it's based on a million.\n\n358\n00:20:32.935 --> 00:20:39.604\nAt once sigma,\nI could make 697,700 mistakes.\n\n359\n00:20:39.604 --> 00:20:44.044\nNow you get all the way down to 6 sigma,\nI can only make\n\n360\n00:20:44.044 --> 00:20:48.996\n3.4 mistakes per million\nopportunities to do it right.\n\n361\n00:20:48.996 --> 00:20:53.823\nNow you'll notice on the right-hand\ncolumn and don't worry if this seems\n\n362\n00:20:53.823 --> 00:20:57.816\na little crazy, it's just sort\nof a trivia thing to mention.\n\n363\n00:20:57.816 --> 00:21:01.355\nYou'll notice that those\ndeltas seem a little off and\n\n364\n00:21:01.355 --> 00:21:06.313\nthat's because sigma works with\nsomething called probability theory and\n\n365\n00:21:06.313 --> 00:21:11.762\nprobability theory factors in a one point\nfive shift in sigma to the right or left.\n\n366\n00:21:11.762 --> 00:21:15.396\nSo it's not really when\nyou're looking at Six Sigma,\n\n367\n00:21:15.396 --> 00:21:18.952\nit's already calculated\nthat shift back and forth,\n\n368\n00:21:18.952 --> 00:21:24.498\nwhere there is another measurement that's\npopular in manufacturing called CPK.\n\n369\n00:21:24.498 --> 00:21:27.939\nWe talked a little bit about\nthat in one of the episodes and\n\n370\n00:21:27.939 --> 00:21:30.521\nthat measurement only uses one and two, so\n\n371\n00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.411\nyour number can never be bigger\nthan one and it can never be less.\n\n372\n00:21:34.411 --> 00:21:38.011\nI mean, it can never be bigger than\ntwo and it can't be less than one.\n\n373\n00:21:38.011 --> 00:21:42.009\nSo the number's gonna fall\nsomewhere between one and two and\n\n374\n00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:45.627\nthat's a little bit more\npoint point in time related.\n\n375\n00:21:45.627 --> 00:21:49.631\nSo that some people say, well,\nwhy do people use sigma and not CPK?\n\n376\n00:21:49.631 --> 00:21:54.567\nWell, sigma kind of looks at some\nprobability theory type techniques\n\n377\n00:21:54.567 --> 00:21:56.680\nwhen it calculates.\n\n378\n00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.089\nNow sigma is sort of an interesting thing,\n\n379\n00:22:00.089 --> 00:22:03.790\nit's a very,\nvery sensitive way to measure.\n\n380\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:09.333\nBecause the deal is in order to use sigma,\nthere has to be something I can count.\n\n381\n00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:13.044\nNow normally, I'm probably not going\nto have a million episodes to count.\n\n382\n00:22:13.044 --> 00:22:17.905\nSo in your course files,\nwe have a calculator that will allow you\n\n383\n00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:22.677\nto look at sigma,\nif maybe you only had 1,000 incidents or\n\n384\n00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:26.118\neven 100 incidents and it scales it down.\n\n385\n00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:32.814\nBut when I'm looking at sigma, number one\nrule is I have to be able to count it.\n\n386\n00:22:32.814 --> 00:22:35.333\nIf I can't can't count it,\nthen I can't use sigma.\n\n387\n00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:39.510\nThe second rule is that I have to\nget people to agree that everything\n\n388\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.309\nis going wrong is a mistake.\n\n389\n00:22:41.309 --> 00:22:43.622\nSo, I can get a number of mistakes.\n\n390\n00:22:43.622 --> 00:22:45.969\nAnd therefore, make my calculation and\n\n391\n00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:50.178\nthe reason why this gets to be sensitive\nis that sometimes we're lumping\n\n392\n00:22:50.178 --> 00:22:54.126\nthings together that people say\nthat was totally out of my control.\n\n393\n00:22:54.126 --> 00:22:58.914\nThat's not really a mistake and the best\nexample I can use is that if you were\n\n394\n00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:03.854\nworking at a bank and the problem was\nautomatic deposits weren't making it to\n\n395\n00:23:03.854 --> 00:23:08.197\nthe employee account, there could\nbe a number of reasons for that.\n\n396\n00:23:08.197 --> 00:23:09.125\nWould you agree, Don?\n\n397\n00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:11.621\n>> Yeah and this was a really\nhard thing for me to understand.\n\n398\n00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:16.531\nWhen I cracked open my first book about\nSix Sigma is to kinda start learning\n\n399\n00:23:16.531 --> 00:23:17.251\nabout it.\n\n400\n00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:21.895\nWell, basically, what you had on your\nslide there a second ago about how,\n\n401\n00:23:21.895 --> 00:23:25.748\nif you wanted a true Six Sigma,\nit was oh, what was it 3.4.\n\n402\n00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:26.422\n>> Exactly.\n\n403\n00:23:26.422 --> 00:23:28.522\n>> And I'm thinking wow.\n\n404\n00:23:28.522 --> 00:23:32.407\nYou expect me to do something a million\ntimes and only messed up 3.4,\n\n405\n00:23:32.407 --> 00:23:33.846\nthat sounds impossible.\n\n406\n00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:39.326\nBut you said that it's not so much about\nmistakes, it's opportunities for mistakes.\n\n407\n00:23:39.326 --> 00:23:43.350\nAnd in terms of manufacturing,\nlet's say, you're making a toy car.\n\n408\n00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.690\nThere might be thousands\nof opportunity for\n\n409\n00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.544\nmistake just in the manufacture\nof one of those cars.\n\n410\n00:23:48.544 --> 00:23:53.187\nIf you make 100 of those now, you're\ntalking about 100,000 opportunities and\n\n411\n00:23:53.187 --> 00:23:54.602\nyou only made 100 cars.\n\n412\n00:23:54.602 --> 00:23:58.996\nSo you're doing a bank transfer,\nI used to work in the finance industry and\n\n413\n00:23:58.996 --> 00:24:03.670\nthere's a number of things from from data\nentry that the teller does to the check\n\n414\n00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:08.278\nbeing canceled properly, to the electronic\ntransmittal between the bank and\n\n415\n00:24:08.278 --> 00:24:10.770\nthe fed and\nthe fed back to the other bank.\n\n416\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.688\nI mean, there's so many areas for\npossibilities of mistakes and\n\n417\n00:24:13.688 --> 00:24:16.776\nit might not be the tellers fault\nwhen they say, this is not my fault.\n\n418\n00:24:16.776 --> 00:24:17.592\n>> Exactly.\n\n419\n00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:20.936\n>> And it isn't, there was another\nopportunity for mistake somewhere in it.\n\n420\n00:24:20.936 --> 00:24:23.645\n>> Exactly and so\nyou bring a group of tellers in and\n\n421\n00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:26.366\nsometimes that's the exact\npush back you get.\n\n422\n00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:28.894\nIt's like, well, wait a minute,\nthey didn't filled out the form right.\n\n423\n00:24:28.894 --> 00:24:31.958\nExactly, but all you're trying\nto do is get a measurement.\n\n424\n00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:37.064\nSo that after you roll out your process\nimprovement, which in this case might just\n\n425\n00:24:37.064 --> 00:24:41.806\nbe a better form, that you can go back and\nthen check and recheck your sigma.\n\n426\n00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:46.706\nDon brought up a good point about the 3.4\nper million opportunities to do it right\n\n427\n00:24:46.706 --> 00:24:49.159\nthat, it seems like almost impossible.\n\n428\n00:24:49.159 --> 00:24:53.787\nWell, this was one of the reasons\nwhy Bill Smith his real\n\n429\n00:24:53.787 --> 00:24:57.343\nname at Motorola chose the name Six Sigma.\n\n430\n00:24:57.343 --> 00:25:00.656\nBecause he wanted to call his\nprogram that he developed,\n\n431\n00:25:00.656 --> 00:25:03.980\nwhich included the Demaic model and\nthe basic Six Sigma.\n\n432\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.235\nHe wanted to call it zero defects, but\n\n433\n00:25:06.235 --> 00:25:08.918\na lot of people were\nalready using that term.\n\n434\n00:25:08.918 --> 00:25:13.533\nSo this was a another kind of spin on this\nis that one of the reasons that program\n\n435\n00:25:13.533 --> 00:25:18.077\nis called Six Sigma is it's almost zero\ndefects three point four mistakes in\n\n436\n00:25:18.077 --> 00:25:20.132\na million opportunities-\n>> Pretty close.\n\n437\n00:25:20.132 --> 00:25:21.436\n>> To do it, correct?\n\n438\n00:25:21.436 --> 00:25:26.218\nNow, another thing about sigma other\nthan the fact that it's a sensitive\n\n439\n00:25:26.218 --> 00:25:30.781\nissue is that a lot of times it depends\non what you're doing sigma for.\n\n440\n00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:35.006\nSo for example, I fly a lot and\nI certainly want my\n\n441\n00:25:35.006 --> 00:25:39.549\nairplane to be Six Sigma\nwhen it takes off and lands.\n\n442\n00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:41.429\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know what?\n\n443\n00:25:41.429 --> 00:25:44.608\nI probably could deal with\nif it was three sigma,\n\n444\n00:25:44.608 --> 00:25:47.407\nas far as customer service was concerned.\n\n445\n00:25:47.407 --> 00:25:51.717\nNow if you were a patient, hey,\nit gets even a little bit scarier.\n\n446\n00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:55.866\nLet's say, for example, you were going to\none of those center of excellent clinics\n\n447\n00:25:55.866 --> 00:25:58.730\nand a string of clinics that say,\nwe specialize in this and\n\n448\n00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.604\nthis string of clinics they\nspecialize in heart surgery.\n\n449\n00:26:01.604 --> 00:26:05.589\n[LAUGH] And so are you going to go to\na clinic that says, you know what?\n\n450\n00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:07.700\nWe're working it three sigma.\n\n451\n00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.479\nFor every million people we see,\nwe only lose 66,810 people.\n\n452\n00:26:12.479 --> 00:26:13.312\n>> That's it?\n\n453\n00:26:13.312 --> 00:26:14.786\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n454\n00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:18.812\nsometimes sigma depends on what\nit is you're measuring and\n\n455\n00:26:18.812 --> 00:26:24.215\nit's a a little like that adage shoot for\nthe moon and you'll land in the stars.\n\n456\n00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:28.535\nSo sometimes, it's just a goal\nsomething that I'm going after.\n\n457\n00:26:28.535 --> 00:26:34.205\nSo, I'm trying to think of anything else\nthat's really interesting about Six Sigma.\n\n458\n00:26:34.205 --> 00:26:37.805\n>> Well, one thing I found\ninteresting you mentioned Bill Smith,\n\n459\n00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:40.807\nyou mentioned Motorola were\na lot of this came from and\n\n460\n00:26:40.807 --> 00:26:45.408\neven Motorola doesn't actually shoot for\na true Sigma Six sigmas of efficiency,\n\n461\n00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:48.834\nbecause it gets really expensive\nto try and have that level.\n\n462\n00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:53.438\nAnd so even internally, the majority of\ntime they're shooting for 4 or even 4.5,\n\n463\n00:26:53.438 --> 00:26:57.172\nbecause like many manufacturing,\nwhat does Motorola make anymore?\n\n464\n00:26:57.172 --> 00:26:58.652\nChips and cell phones I guess.\n\n465\n00:26:58.652 --> 00:27:01.646\n>> Yeah.\n>> But with microchips to get a million\n\n466\n00:27:01.646 --> 00:27:08.000\nwith only 3.4 failures is something that\nwould be really, really expensive to do.\n\n467\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.066\nSometimes was less expensive going\nto just have a few fillers and\n\n468\n00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:14.755\nchuck them in the trash and move on and\nso even they're not always shooting for\n\n469\n00:27:14.755 --> 00:27:15.978\nthat full Six Sigma's.\n\n470\n00:27:15.978 --> 00:27:20.049\n>> Exactly and you know that also brings\nup a another one of those great points\n\n471\n00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:23.344\nabout the difference between\nLean Six Sigma and Six Sigma.\n\n472\n00:27:23.344 --> 00:27:27.131\nLean Six Sigma is a lot more\nforgiving than Six Sigma and\n\n473\n00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:31.016\nLean Six Sigma a lot of times says,\nto fix that mistake.\n\n474\n00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:34.951\nJust to John's point, it's gonna to cost\nmore or we're going to have to lay people\n\n475\n00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:38.171\noff or we're gonna have to buy a new\nbuilding, which we can afford.\n\n476\n00:27:38.171 --> 00:27:40.523\nSo that's a really, really good point.\n\n477\n00:27:40.523 --> 00:27:46.523\nAnother way that you see a sigma depicted\nmany times is in a bell curve and\n\n478\n00:27:46.523 --> 00:27:52.831\nI don't actually have a slide, but\nI know all of you have seen a bell curve.\n\n479\n00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:55.262\nAnd in the middle of the bell curve,\n\n480\n00:27:55.262 --> 00:28:00.126\nI'm just gonna remind you that in\nthe middle there's usually a line and\n\n481\n00:28:00.126 --> 00:28:03.952\nthat line denotes the middle or\nthe average or the mean.\n\n482\n00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:07.411\nAnd on this bell curve,\nyou might see slices and\n\n483\n00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:12.531\nthose slices represents the two,\nthree, four, five and Six Sigma.\n\n484\n00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:17.193\nSo when you get down on the sides of the\nbell curve, kind of the very, very bottom,\n\n485\n00:28:17.193 --> 00:28:19.775\nthat's where the Five and\nSix Sigma show up.\n\n486\n00:28:19.775 --> 00:28:23.966\nSo sometimes you see it that way nd\nmany times when you're looking at that\n\n487\n00:28:23.966 --> 00:28:28.158\nparticular diagram or even the chart\nthat you're looking at right now,\n\n488\n00:28:28.158 --> 00:28:30.513\npeople start talking about deviation.\n\n489\n00:28:30.513 --> 00:28:35.129\nDeviation from the middle and we'll talk\na little bit about that later, as well.\n\n490\n00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:38.589\n>> Well, Dr. Stern, I know it's a pretty\ngood rundown of the measure phase, but\n\n491\n00:28:38.589 --> 00:28:41.083\nwe still have a few more tools\nthat you want to talk about.\n\n492\n00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:42.996\nUnfortunately, we've kinda run\nout of time for this episode.\n\n493\n00:28:42.996 --> 00:28:45.481\nSo let's break into a part two on this and\nwe'll come back and\n\n494\n00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:48.699\nwe'll talk about some of the other tools\nthat are out there like score cards and\n\n495\n00:28:48.699 --> 00:28:50.864\nbenchmarking, all really\ngood important option.\n\n496\n00:28:50.864 --> 00:28:53.656\nWe wanna make sure we spend\nthe right amount of time on those.\n\n497\n00:28:53.656 --> 00:28:55.680\nSo we'll come back for a part two on it.\n\n498\n00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.915\nBefore we break on this one,\n\n499\n00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:59.392\ndo you have any last minute\nthoughts you want to throw in?\n\n500\n00:28:59.392 --> 00:29:04.109\n>> I just want to remind our audience\nthat it's not enough to get that clear as\n\n501\n00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.012\na picture where we are today,\n\n502\n00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:10.367\nyou wanna make sure that it's\nbelievable before you move forward.\n\n503\n00:29:10.367 --> 00:29:11.895\n>> We want that credibility.\n\n504\n00:29:11.895 --> 00:29:13.896\nOtherwise, we can make\nsome really fun reports.\n\n505\n00:29:13.896 --> 00:29:16.289\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n506\n00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:16.855\nhope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n507\n00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:20.935\nStay tuned, cuz we'll be back with more\nmeasure phase in the next episode.\n\n508\n00:29:20.935 --> 00:29:21.887\nSo, I hope to see you there.\n\n509\n00:29:21.887 --> 00:29:26.039\nBut for right now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n510\n00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:27.207\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern.\n\n511\n00:29:27.207 --> 00:29:28.447\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n512\n00:29:28.447 --> 00:29:35.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

and\n\n4\n00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.900\ngood evening and welcome back\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.361\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n6\n00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.916\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ncontinuing with the measure phase we\n\n7\n00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.397\nleft off in our last episode,\n\n8\n00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:29.791\nready to talk about some of the tools\nwe can use in the measure phase.\n\n9\n00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.491\nWe've got a couple of great\nones that are coming up.\n\n10\n00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:34.331\nAnd I'm gonna turn the floor over to Dr.\nStern.\n\n11\n00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:38.310\nOnce again whose gonna tell us about these\ntools, Dr. Stern, where do we start?\n\n12\n00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.640\n>> Okay well, where I'd like to start this\nepisode is saying that Lean Six Sigma,\n\n13\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.340\nin our first episode we did\nkind of mention this, but\n\n14\n00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.810\nLean Six Sigma is mostly Six Sigma\nwith a strong lean influence.\n\n15\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.598\nBut over the last few years,\nwhat's happened as it's evolved so\n\n16\n00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:03.241\nmuch that it just started kinda stealing\ntools from other methodologies.\n\n17\n00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:08.826\nAnd so one of the popular tools in\nLean Six Sigma didn't originate in Lean or\n\n18\n00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:09.721\nSix Sigma.\n\n19\n00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:11.841\nAnd that's called the balanced scorecard.\n\n20\n00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.056\nI wanna remind you that\nin the measure phase,\n\n21\n00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:17.741\nwhat we're trying to do is get a clear\nas-is picture of where we are today.\n\n22\n00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:22.840\nAnd sometimes the hardest part is figuring\nout what the heck we should be looking at.\n\n23\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.470\nWe have already discussed\nsome great ideas.\n\n24\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.350\nWe could look at a detailed process map,\n\n25\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.490\nwe can see how well\nwe're doing on our CTQs.\n\n26\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.630\nWe could check ROI,\nwe could look at sigma.\n\n27\n00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.710\nBut another method we might choose to use\nis something called Balance Scorecard.\n\n28\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.732\nNow the reason that Lean Six Sigma loves\nBalance Scorecard, is that in Fortune\n\n29\n00:01:44.732 --> 00:01:50.134\n500 companies, the last set of statistics\nthat I looked at, over half of Fortune\n\n30\n00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:56.171\n500 companies use the Balance Scorecard as\ntheir enterprise-wide measurement system.\n\n31\n00:01:56.171 --> 00:02:01.094\nSo what that means is if you are trying\nto give a clear as is picture of where\n\n32\n00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:02.224\nyou are today and\n\n33\n00:02:02.224 --> 00:02:07.637\nyou're already in a company that uses\nBalance Scorecard by using this method,\n\n34\n00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:13.590\nthey might bond with this a lot faster\nthan if you were using a different method.\n\n35\n00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.790\nNow I also want to point out before we\nget started on our Balance Scorecard, and\n\n36\n00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.780\nI do have a slide on this,\nbefore we get really started on this,\n\n37\n00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.040\nI want to point out there's\nsomething called scorecards period.\n\n38\n00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.038\nSo if you were to go to Google and\nyou to type in anything like,\n\n39\n00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:35.041\nhuman resource scorecard,\na scorecard is going to come up.\n\n40\n00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.655\nGenerally speaking, students have done\nthis, sometimes they're no cost, sometimes\n\n41\n00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:43.971\nthere's a nominal fee and it will list all\nthe things that you should be measuring.\n\n42\n00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:46.353\nSome of them are pretty\ndarn sophisticated and\n\n43\n00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:48.622\neven have the excel measurements in there.\n\n44\n00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:52.229\nNow the advantage to this is let's\nsay you've never worked on a supply\n\n45\n00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.423\nchain project before and\nyou don't even know where to start.\n\n46\n00:02:55.423 --> 00:02:57.063\nYou have no clue where to start.\n\n47\n00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:00.073\nYou could type in supply\nchain scorecard and\n\n48\n00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:03.011\na lot of people's ideas are gonna come up.\n\n49\n00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:05.342\nNow granted it's usually\nan Excel spreadsheet, and\n\n50\n00:03:05.342 --> 00:03:08.101\nsome things you're going to\neliminate from the spreadsheet.\n\n51\n00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:09.710\nSome things you're going to add.\n\n52\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.990\nYou're certainly going to want\nto check their calculations.\n\n53\n00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.954\nBut it's better than looking at\na blank piece of paper, Don,\n\n54\n00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.441\nif you get into a situation where you\ndon't even know what to start with.\n\n55\n00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:21.010\n>> Yeah, and it's kind of that\nidea of why reinvent the wheel.\n\n56\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.490\nThere's other people that have already\ngone through this process that at\n\n57\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.620\na minimum you could use their\nscorecards as a starting point.\n\n58\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.180\n>> Exactly.\n\n59\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.200\n>> And adapt it for your needs.\n\n60\n00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.900\n>> Exactly.\n\n61\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.190\nIt's just kind of a lean,\nquick way to get some measurements.\n\n62\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.743\nNow the balance score card always\nworks with four categories and\n\n63\n00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:39.520\nthe categories are learning and\n\n64\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.691\ngrowth, although most companies now\nwill call it training or education.\n\n65\n00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.605\nWhen Kaplan and Norton,\nwho were from Harvard,\n\n66\n00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:51.310\noriginally created this scorecard,\nI think they meant learning and growth.\n\n67\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.530\nAnd I think learning and growth kind of\nmeans more than training and education.\n\n68\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.728\nBut typically at companies you'll\nsee that category called training or\n\n69\n00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:01.291\neducation or something along those lines.\n\n70\n00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.831\nThe second category is financial, and\nthat's actually one of the easier ones.\n\n71\n00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:10.056\nIf I'm trying to look at my\nproject through a financial lens,\n\n72\n00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:14.721\nbecause finance probably already has a set\nof metrics, which just means measurements.\n\n73\n00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.590\nThey already have a set of\nfinancial metrics that I could use.\n\n74\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.074\nAn example of that would be cost of\ninventory returned or cost of hire.\n\n75\n00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:24.774\nThose types of things.\n\n76\n00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:28.129\nSo those are probably already\nestablished in my company, so\n\n77\n00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.383\nthat category often goes very quickly.\n\n78\n00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:35.312\nCustomer means customer service and\nhere's the kind of sticky wicket,\n\n79\n00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:40.180\nI'm not sure exactly why but\nsome people call that final one business.\n\n80\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.201\nThey might call it process.\n\n81\n00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:42.621\nThey might call it operation.\n\n82\n00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:44.281\nThey might use any combination.\n\n83\n00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:46.844\nSo they might call it business processes,\n\n84\n00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:50.271\noperation processes, but\nwhat it means is the process.\n\n85\n00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:53.904\nSo once again, it's a little like\nstructured brainstorming which\n\n86\n00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:56.271\nanother reason why\nLean Six Sigma likes it.\n\n87\n00:04:56.271 --> 00:05:00.145\nI'm looking at the project that I'm\ntrying to make better, faster, or\n\n88\n00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:01.680\nmore cost effective.\n\n89\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.563\nI'm trying to figure out what\nthe heck I should be measuring and so\n\n90\n00:05:05.563 --> 00:05:10.231\nI take a step back and I say, what from\na training aspect should I be measuring?\n\n91\n00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.951\nWhat's from a financial aspect?\n\n92\n00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:14.850\nAnd of course, a lot of times,\nROI's gonna come in there, but\n\n93\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.831\nthere's gonna be other financial\nthings I might wanna look at.\n\n94\n00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.611\nFrom a customer service perspective,\nwhat should I be measuring?\n\n95\n00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:25.571\nAnd then from a process standpoint,\nwhat should I be measuring?\n\n96\n00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:30.471\nAnd it's just a way to get our arms around\nquickly getting a list of measurements.\n\n97\n00:05:30.471 --> 00:05:35.451\nNow, typically, on the Balance Scorecard,\nthey tell us we don't want more then\n\n98\n00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:39.370\nthree to five major measurements\nin each one of these phases.\n\n99\n00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.841\nWhat do you think about that, Don?\n\n100\n00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.006\n>> Well, I think eventually you get\njust measure yourself to death, right?\n\n101\n00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:45.688\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You spend so much time,\n\n102\n00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:48.572\nthe return on it's really\nnot going to be equal.\n\n103\n00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:49.532\nWould you say that's true?\n\n104\n00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:50.752\n>> Exactly.\nIt is true.\n\n105\n00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:52.886\nAnd that's another one of those,\n\n106\n00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:56.720\nwhat's the difference between\nLean Six Sigma and Six Sigma?\n\n107\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.974\nLean Six Sigma is either looking at\nthe methodology in the process and\n\n108\n00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:05.612\nif I'm spending too much time in measure,\nI'm not being cost effective.\n\n109\n00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:08.912\nSo I thought we could take\njust a quick example.\n\n110\n00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.612\nSo let's thing of a company,\nor let's think of a industry.\n\n111\n00:06:13.612 --> 00:06:16.180\nWhat's an industry that\nyou're interested in, Don?\n\n112\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.000\n>> Let's say automotive.\n\n113\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.090\n>> Okay, so automotive industry.\n\n114\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.575\nNow automotive industry sometimes\nhas that challenge that\n\n115\n00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:27.554\nwe come up with a good process\nimprovement that is illegal or against\n\n116\n00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:28.234\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:06:28.234 --> 00:06:28.854\n>> compliance code.\n\n118\n00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:31.254\nSo you always want to\nconsider those things too.\n\n119\n00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:35.334\nBut let's say we have\na automotive industry plant.\n\n120\n00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:40.494\nCan you think that just a simple process\nimprovement that we'd want to do?\n\n121\n00:06:40.494 --> 00:06:41.554\n>> Automation?\n\n122\n00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:42.694\n>> Okay, great!\n\n123\n00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:44.314\nAnd what do you want to automate, Don?\n\n124\n00:06:44.314 --> 00:06:45.834\n>> Maybe painting a vehicle.\n\n125\n00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:48.360\n>> Okay, so we're going to\nautomate painting a vehicle.\n\n126\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.111\nWe're a small company and\nwe want to make this a quicker process.\n\n127\n00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:55.691\nSo we want to make painting\nthe vehicle faster.\n\n128\n00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.480\nWould you say that's\nthe goal of our automation?\n\n129\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.690\n>> Sure,\nwe know we could use people to do it.\n\n130\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.427\nThey can get out their sprayers and\ndo two or three coats or whatever, but\n\n131\n00:07:03.427 --> 00:07:07.302\nI bet we could get some kind of robot or\nmachine in there to do the same thing.\n\n132\n00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:11.825\n>> Okay, and so our first challenge, if\nthat's what we want to do, we want to make\n\n133\n00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:16.620\nthe automation process better or create\nan automation process, and it's still not\n\n134\n00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.631\ngoing from scratch cuz we're obviously\npinging the car somehow now.\n\n135\n00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:24.133\nSo in this scenario what we\nwould do is we would try to look\n\n136\n00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:26.600\nthrough a training education lens.\n\n137\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.811\nBecause I'm trying to see where are we now\nin the picture with painting our vehicles.\n\n138\n00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:35.839\nSo when I am looking at a training aspect,\nsome of the things\n\n139\n00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:40.580\nthat I might look at is how\nlong was the average trainer.\n\n140\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.540\nHow long was the average\ncar painter trained?\n\n141\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.201\nHow many hours of education,\nif any, do they have?\n\n142\n00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:52.281\nHow long does it take to teach\nsomeone how to paint a car?\n\n143\n00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.081\nThose types of things.\n\n144\n00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:59.062\n>> I almost wanna call them like an unseen\ncost that we don't think about all that\n\n145\n00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:02.919\ngoes into getting somebody trained in\nthat skill for them to be able to go and\n\n146\n00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:04.220\nthen paint the vehicle.\n\n147\n00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.890\n>> Exactly.\n\n148\n00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.620\nAnd then, because I'm trying to get a\nclear as is picture of where we are today,\n\n149\n00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.340\nI'm using the Balance Scorecard\nas one of the tools,\n\n150\n00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.480\nbecause I have lots of\ntools to choose from.\n\n151\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.400\nBut I decided to use this one.\n\n152\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.901\nI'm looking from a financial lens.\n\n153\n00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:23.406\nCertainly the cost of painting the car\nwould be something on my financial docket,\n\n154\n00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:26.596\nI'm trying to think of\nother things that I might\n\n155\n00:08:26.596 --> 00:08:29.571\nbe concerned about in the financial world.\n\n156\n00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:34.092\n>> You might have like,\nwaste disposal costs.\n\n157\n00:08:34.092 --> 00:08:35.078\n>> Absolutely.\n>> As far as when you're paying,\n\n158\n00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:35.880\nthat might come up.\n\n159\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.750\n>> Exactly.\n\n160\n00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.340\nThose types of things that maybe\ncomponents or different vendors,\n\n161\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.290\nwhat they charge for their paint.\n\n162\n00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:45.631\nI would report all of that information.\n\n163\n00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:47.611\nNow I'm in the customer service world.\n\n164\n00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:51.497\nGenerally speaking, this is across\nthe board, where I look for information,\n\n165\n00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:53.300\nis customer complaint department.\n\n166\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.352\nHow many complaints are we getting and\n\n167\n00:08:56.352 --> 00:09:00.001\nwhat kinds of complaints are we getting\nand how often do we get those complaints?\n\n168\n00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:01.581\nAnd I gather those measurements.\n\n169\n00:09:01.581 --> 00:09:07.239\nNow remember one of our goals in measure\nis to not be biased, because we're just\n\n170\n00:09:07.239 --> 00:09:12.911\ntrying to get a picture of where we are\nnow, so that we form that before picture.\n\n171\n00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:15.651\nAnd so now I down to processes.\n\n172\n00:09:15.651 --> 00:09:23.371\nAnd so what things can I maybe checkout\nwith metrics about the processes?\n\n173\n00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.411\n>> So maybe how many people\nare involved in the process?\n\n174\n00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:27.211\n>> Absolutely.\n\n175\n00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.272\n>> How long the process takes?\n\n176\n00:09:30.272 --> 00:09:30.992\n>> Exactly.\n\n177\n00:09:30.992 --> 00:09:34.612\n>> Would you put the current\namount of defects in that?\n\n178\n00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:36.892\n>> Yeah, absolutely, yeah,\nthe current amount of defects.\n\n179\n00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.032\nThat's excellent.\n\n180\n00:09:38.032 --> 00:09:42.529\nSo now what I think is kind of fun about\nthe Balance Scorecard, you still have to\n\n181\n00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:46.990\ngo on from here and figure out how\nyou're going to measure these things.\n\n182\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.880\nBut sometimes just getting that\npicture through a financial lens,\n\n183\n00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.030\nthrough an education lens,\nthrough customer service lens,\n\n184\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.440\nthrough a process lens,\nyou can put that on a presentation slide.\n\n185\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.090\nAnd especially if you're working for a\nreally large company, it's an easy way to\n\n186\n00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.720\ntell them what your department does,\nand your state of affairs.\n\n187\n00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:15.431\nOkay so Balance Scorecard is one way that\nI can discern what I should be measuring.\n\n188\n00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:19.071\nNow from there obviously I'd have\nto go and develop some metrics.\n\n189\n00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:22.631\nSome metrics are really easy,\nI would just literally count.\n\n190\n00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.476\nOthers I'd have to probably\ndig through some records,\n\n191\n00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:28.259\nor in the case of finance I\nmight have to go to finance and\n\n192\n00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:31.245\nfigure out what metrics they're using and\nmap to those.\n\n193\n00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:37.020\nSo another way that we\nmeasure its benchmarking and\n\n194\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.550\nwhat's fun about benchmarking is that\nyou can use it in two different ways.\n\n195\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.260\nYou can use it as the actual benchmark or\n\n196\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.180\njust like I was explaining\nabout the scorecards,\n\n197\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.430\nyou can use it to try to figure out\nwhat the heck people are measuring.\n\n198\n00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.947\nSo let's say again I am in a department or\n\n199\n00:10:53.947 --> 00:10:58.683\nindustry that I'm not familiar with and\nI know what I'm supposed to do, but\n\n200\n00:10:58.683 --> 00:11:02.101\nI need to get as clear as\na picture of where we are today.\n\n201\n00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:06.172\nI could go to benchmarking studies and\nsay, well,\n\n202\n00:11:06.172 --> 00:11:11.581\nwhat do other people in my particular\nfield, what do they measure?\n\n203\n00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:14.461\nAnd so that would be a good\nplace to get measurements.\n\n204\n00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:18.772\nNow the other thing about benchmarking is,\nif I were actually to benchmark,\n\n205\n00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:22.420\nit's a good way for\npeople to believe my story.\n\n206\n00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.560\nEarlier we mention that when\nyou say the benchmark is here,\n\n207\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.710\neven if you don't truly\nunderstand the benchmark,\n\n208\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.320\nand you say our company is here,\nor our company is here,\n\n209\n00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.240\nthat gives a clear picture, and\npeople understand that picture.\n\n210\n00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.525\nPart of your objective is to make\nit easy for them to understand.\n\n211\n00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:46.183\nWe can do so many clever, wonderful,\nfun things with graphs and\n\n212\n00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:49.386\nmake them colorful, and 3D,\nand all kinds of things.\n\n213\n00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:53.596\nBut if people don’t understand what we’re\ntrying to say, then it’s all for naught.\n\n214\n00:11:53.596 --> 00:11:58.176\nSo benchmarking is just a simple way to\nget people onboard of where we are today.\n\n215\n00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.872\nNow, the only problem with benchmarking\nBenchmarking is that there are several\n\n216\n00:12:01.872 --> 00:12:05.313\ntypes of benchmarking, and we're just\ngoing to briefly talk about them.\n\n217\n00:12:05.313 --> 00:12:10.645\nFor example, internal benchmarking\nis a benchmarking process where\n\n218\n00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:16.889\nyou're just measuring internally what\ndepartment gets another, for example.\n\n219\n00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:22.055\nNow the reason why we need to know about\nthe different types of benchmarking\n\n220\n00:12:22.055 --> 00:12:26.880\nis it tells us what kind of back up\ndata we need to bring to the meeting.\n\n221\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.470\nSo when we're in measure, even if we\ndon't actually do this, we want to always\n\n222\n00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.770\npretend like we're going to a meeting and\nwe're presenting the as is pitcher.\n\n223\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.540\nAnd that someone asks a question and\nI wanna make sure that I have backup data.\n\n224\n00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.235\nWell if I'm using benchmarking backup data\nbecomes quite important, so if I'm doing\n\n225\n00:12:43.235 --> 00:12:48.300\nan internal benchmarking I did all the\nresearch, I have all that information in\n\n226\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.270\nmy file and I can pretty much trust\nthat if I did the internal benchmarking.\n\n227\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.950\nAnd you might say, well what's an example?\n\n228\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:01.129\nAnd probably the best example that\nI can think of is that when the,\n\n229\n00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:07.551\nI don't remember what they called the\nswine flu virus, the injection, the HV.\n\n230\n00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:08.479\n>> I know what you're talking about,\nI don't remember the name.\n\n231\n00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.530\n>> Okay, well there was a point not too\nlong ago in our history where people\n\n232\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.850\nwere very, very concerned about getting,\nwhat slang-wise we called the swine flu.\n\n233\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.178\nAnd there is actually a more\nofficial name for it.\n\n234\n00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.595\nBut people were really concerned.\n\n235\n00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:28.554\nAnd so what they were trying to do\nin internal benchmarking studies to\n\n236\n00:13:28.554 --> 00:13:33.129\ntry to figure out if our company got hit\nwith this epidemic, what is the absolute\n\n237\n00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:37.520\nminimum amount of workforce that we\ncould work with and keep the doors open?\n\n238\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.098\nSo they had to determine\nan internal benchmark,\n\n239\n00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:45.210\nwhich basically meant how\nmany absences do we have now?\n\n240\n00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.200\nAnd how well do our services work?\n\n241\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.010\nSo, a lot of companies were just\nkind of saying, on an average,\n\n242\n00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.410\nhow many absences in HR?\n\n243\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.966\nHow many absences in operations?\n\n244\n00:13:56.966 --> 00:14:01.230\nHow many absences in\nthe finance department?\n\n245\n00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.420\nAnd then they would put all\nof those figures together and\n\n246\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.440\ncome up with an average.\n\n247\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.736\nAnd then they would go back and\nplot HR against the average\n\n248\n00:14:09.736 --> 00:14:14.110\nfinance against the average and\nso forth and so forth.\n\n249\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.567\nAnd that would give them a kind\nof an internal benchmark.\n\n250\n00:14:16.567 --> 00:14:19.925\nNow since they created\nthat data themselves,\n\n251\n00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:23.210\nit's not a big a deal\nto validate that data.\n\n252\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.492\nIf someone were to stand up and\ngo where did you get those numbers?\n\n253\n00:14:26.492 --> 00:14:27.792\nYou're just like right here in my folder.\n\n254\n00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:28.767\nRight?\n\n255\n00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:34.530\nWell it becomes very different when\nyou're looking at competitive benchmarks.\n\n256\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.030\nAnd competitive benchmark means your\nmeasuring yourself against a company or\n\n257\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.300\nan industry that's doing\nthe same thing you're doing.\n\n258\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.910\nAnd unfortunately we found that\nwith competitive benchmark,\n\n259\n00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.570\nsometimes people aren't all\nthe time truthful, right?\n\n260\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.260\nAnd so\nif I'm doing a competitive benchmark,\n\n261\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.476\nsomeone might actually ask me where\ndid you get that benchmarking study?\n\n262\n00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:54.670\nWho did you actually look at, right?\n\n263\n00:14:54.670 --> 00:15:00.750\nAnd so sometimes it might be necessary to\nlook at more than one benchmarking source.\n\n264\n00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.230\nSo If I were trying to prove my point,\n\n265\n00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.640\nI might wanna look at two\ndifferent benchmarking studies.\n\n266\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.886\nOne of the associations that\nI was with a few years ago,\n\n267\n00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:17.161\nwe had volunteers, but we had\nan executive director that was paid.\n\n268\n00:15:17.161 --> 00:15:22.460\nAnd so we were trying to figure out\nif we were paying enough or more.\n\n269\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.744\nAnd he produced a benchmarking study from\nthe Association of Associations who said\n\n270\n00:15:26.744 --> 00:15:28.221\nwe were paying way too less.\n\n271\n00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:29.830\n>> Of course.\n\n272\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.990\n>> Now do we discount that completely,\nabsolutely not.\n\n273\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.897\nBut it's something that\nwe'd have to consider and\n\n274\n00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:37.067\nlook at another benchmarking study.\n\n275\n00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:39.948\nSo-\n>> Yeah, competitive benchmarks,\n\n276\n00:15:39.948 --> 00:15:42.337\nthey can work in either sides advantage.\n\n277\n00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:43.870\nEasy to get bias into those.\n\n278\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.755\nAnd the way that you do your pool for\ncollecting that data can always influence\n\n279\n00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:50.830\nthe results too, so\nyou gotta take that with a grain of salt.\n\n280\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.450\nIf all competitive benchmarks were\naccurate then we wouldn't need\n\n281\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.895\nlike a consumer protection agency.\n\n282\n00:15:56.895 --> 00:16:00.136\n[LAUGH] Those things exist because\nof how easy these are to manipulate.\n\n283\n00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:01.970\n>> Exactly.\n\n284\n00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.840\nAnd so then we move to something\ncalled functional benchmarking.\n\n285\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.200\nAnd functional benchmarking is where I'm\nactually benchmarking a function and\n\n286\n00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.930\nthe challenge there is that you want to\n\n287\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.480\nbenchmark a function against someone\nthat meets similar demographics.\n\n288\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.058\nSo for example, if I were looking\nat mistakes for payroll checks and\n\n289\n00:16:22.058 --> 00:16:27.360\nI was working and I was at one of the big\ndefense firms where there is literally,\n\n290\n00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.180\n500 people in payroll it wouldn't\nbe fair to benchmark that against\n\n291\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.227\nthe payroll department at\nSSVGlobal which we call Margie.\n\n292\n00:16:36.227 --> 00:16:39.157\nSo, functional benchmarks we\nhave to just make sure that\n\n293\n00:16:39.157 --> 00:16:42.220\nwe're measuring apples to apples and\noranges to oranges.\n\n294\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.280\nAnd you say well what's an example?\n\n295\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.420\nWell most companies have\na recruiting process, right?\n\n296\n00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.350\nMost companies have a way that, they have\n\n297\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.350\na way that they advertise their\njob postings and stuff like that.\n\n298\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.110\nAnd so,\nlooking at how fast do they fill a job.\n\n299\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.190\nSo if they were doing a similar\nmethod of employment recruiting,\n\n300\n00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.300\nhow fast are they filling\nthe job on an average, right?\n\n301\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.850\nSo there's a lot of things that are just\ngeneric to different departments.\n\n302\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.655\nWe've mentioned payroll\na couple of different times.\n\n303\n00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:19.931\nSo functional benchmark admissions\nwould be a good functional\n\n304\n00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:23.482\nbenchmark because we admit\npeople into hospitals,\n\n305\n00:17:23.482 --> 00:17:28.880\nwe admit people into the library,\nwe admit people into fast food, right?\n\n306\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.640\nI mean so how fast do we process\npeople coming in, that type of thing.\n\n307\n00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.540\nSo that would be a functional benchmark.\n\n308\n00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.947\nAnd like I said, if you were presenting\nyour functional benchmark you would just\n\n309\n00:17:37.947 --> 00:17:41.422\nwant to make sure that you're comparing\napples to apples and oranges to oranges.\n\n310\n00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:44.243\nJust not a big company\nagainst a small one, or\n\n311\n00:17:44.243 --> 00:17:47.820\na company that's just known\nto have great expertise.\n\n312\n00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:52.420\nSometimes small colleges benchmark\nthemselves against larger colleges, and\n\n313\n00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.901\nit's really just not particularly fair.\n\n314\n00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:59.855\nCollaborative benchmarking is similar\nto competitive benchmarking in the fact\n\n315\n00:17:59.855 --> 00:18:04.731\nthat you want to make sure you know what\nbenchmarking study you're looking at,\n\n316\n00:18:04.731 --> 00:18:08.181\nand possibly look at a couple\nof benchmarking studies.\n\n317\n00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:13.904\nCollaborative benchmarking is when\nthe industry has got together And\n\n318\n00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:18.851\nthat would be something like\na utility company, or energy or\n\n319\n00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:22.731\nthe automotive industry\nhave come together and\n\n320\n00:18:22.731 --> 00:18:27.295\nthey have collectively decided\nthis is the benchmark.\n\n321\n00:18:27.295 --> 00:18:32.149\nAnd the UN sometimes collectively\nmakes benchmarks about what countries\n\n322\n00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:35.600\nhave to achieve to get support,\nthat type of thing.\n\n323\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.545\nBut again if you're doing something,\nlet's say you're studying the environment,\n\n324\n00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:46.930\nand there's a lot of disagreement in\nthe world about environmental studies.\n\n325\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.995\nSo, someone might say,\nwell who wrote that environmental study?\n\n326\n00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.376\nWhere did those benchmarks come from?\n\n327\n00:18:51.376 --> 00:18:56.370\nSo, just something that\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n328\n00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.760\nAnd then finally,\nthere is generic benchmarks.\n\n329\n00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.847\nAnd all that means is it doesn't\nfit in one one of those categories.\n\n330\n00:19:01.847 --> 00:19:03.414\nAnd what does that mean to you?\n\n331\n00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:07.623\nWhat that means to you is that if you're\ngoing to present a benchmark that doesn't\n\n332\n00:19:07.623 --> 00:19:12.080\ndoesn't fall into one of those categories,\nyou really need a lot of documentation.\n\n333\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.828\nBecause probably people are going\nto have a lot of questions.\n\n334\n00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:18.769\n>> All right.\nSo benchmarking.\n\n335\n00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:20.058\nObviously a very powerful tool.\n\n336\n00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:23.350\nOne that likely we already use.\n\n337\n00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.940\nWe may not formally be\nfollowing lien six signal.\n\n338\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.420\nBut we're probably already using\nit to some extent or another.\n\n339\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.055\nJust because we constantly have\nto deal with things like that.\n\n340\n00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:35.615\nSo what are some of the other things we\nmight wanna look at in terms of measuring\n\n341\n00:19:35.615 --> 00:19:36.116\ntools?\n\n342\n00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:41.085\n>> Okay, well some of the other measuring\ntools remember could be possibly\n\n343\n00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:42.556\nindustry specific.\n\n344\n00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:47.461\nSo when I'm in measure I don't want\nto forget that there are some things\n\n345\n00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:52.287\nthat my industry does that are respected\nmeasurement tools that might\n\n346\n00:19:52.287 --> 00:19:55.167\nnot even be captured in [INAUDIBLE] right.\n\n347\n00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:59.485\nAnd then when I'm thinking about that I\nmight also wanna start thinking about my\n\n348\n00:19:59.485 --> 00:20:00.786\ndata collection plan.\n\n349\n00:20:00.786 --> 00:20:04.967\nBecause in my data collection plan,\nI might wanna explain, I might wanna\n\n350\n00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:09.699\ntake some times to explain the tools that\nI'm using and why I'm using those tools.\n\n351\n00:20:09.699 --> 00:20:14.549\nThe main things in a data collection\nplan typically would include things like\n\n352\n00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:19.113\nwhat data's being collected, and\nwho's collecting the data and why?\n\n353\n00:20:19.113 --> 00:20:23.286\nAnd I think I mentioned earlier,\nyou wanna make sure that you,\n\n354\n00:20:23.286 --> 00:20:25.822\nhave the authority collect the data.\n\n355\n00:20:25.822 --> 00:20:27.981\nIn healthcare,\nthere's a lot of HIPPA rules.\n\n356\n00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:31.197\nAnd I have a funny story.\n\n357\n00:20:31.197 --> 00:20:33.885\nWhen I was working for\na document management firm,\n\n358\n00:20:33.885 --> 00:20:37.399\nwe were looking at mil specs,\nwhich is military specifications.\n\n359\n00:20:37.399 --> 00:20:40.184\nAnd we were trying to figure out\nwhich ones would be data based.\n\n360\n00:20:40.184 --> 00:20:44.224\nAnd so, at that particular time,\nmy role was a little bit different.\n\n361\n00:20:44.224 --> 00:20:48.868\nAnd I was supposed to be bringing\nin former military generals who\n\n362\n00:20:48.868 --> 00:20:51.886\ncould look at these MIL-SPECs, right.\n\n363\n00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.481\nSo we organized this, and\n\n364\n00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:57.041\nthis was something that we were\npaying them to come and do.\n\n365\n00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.866\nAnd of course because they were generals,\nwe had golfing and\n\n366\n00:21:00.866 --> 00:21:04.703\nall kinds of exciting kind of\nextra things planned for them.\n\n367\n00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:07.754\nAnd we got almost down to the wire\nwhen one of the secretaries\n\n368\n00:21:07.754 --> 00:21:11.367\nnoticed in our data collection plan\nthat we could be having a problem.\n\n369\n00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:15.343\nShe said, you know that these\ndocuments are in Washington and\n\n370\n00:21:15.343 --> 00:21:18.336\nrequire certain security level,\nto look at?\n\n371\n00:21:18.336 --> 00:21:22.348\nAnd we didn't, we assumed they were in\nthe warehouse with our other documents.\n\n372\n00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:26.636\nAnd so the fact that we had published\nthe data collection plan and other people,\n\n373\n00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:29.900\nthat voice of the employee,\nthe voice of the employee said,\n\n374\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.503\nhey you might want to hold on.\n\n375\n00:21:31.503 --> 00:21:33.105\nAnd that could have been a real debacle.\n\n376\n00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:37.049\nCan you imagine flying four generals\ndown and having no documents for\n\n377\n00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:38.004\nthem to review?\n\n378\n00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:42.160\nSo and then a lot of times your data\ncollection plan is gonna say next step.\n\n379\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.121\nLike we're collecting this data\nthis is what we plan to do with it.\n\n380\n00:21:45.121 --> 00:21:48.493\nAnd I think that's important these days\nbecause a lot of times people don't want\n\n381\n00:21:48.493 --> 00:21:49.485\nto fill out the survey or\n\n382\n00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:52.624\ngive you information because they\ndon't know what's gonna happen to it.\n\n383\n00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:54.099\nAnd they think why bother.\n\n384\n00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:57.635\nOr, of course, you know that old thing\nwhere they say this survey will take you\n\n385\n00:21:57.635 --> 00:21:59.469\nfive minutes and of course it doesn't.\n\n386\n00:21:59.469 --> 00:22:00.594\nRight?\n\n387\n00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:06.482\nSo the last thing I really wanna address\nis I wanna cycle back to the SIPOC model.\n\n388\n00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:10.840\nI just wanna remind you that\neven though we cover things, and\n\n389\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.744\nthe slide you're looking at right now is\n\n390\n00:22:13.744 --> 00:22:18.539\none of the templates that you have\navailable in your course files.\n\n391\n00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:23.133\nAnd I think I mentioned that SIPOC is\na paper and pencil tool that you can use\n\n392\n00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:27.892\nthe template and crate a beautiful,\nI've seen beautiful SIPOCs, right?\n\n393\n00:22:27.892 --> 00:22:32.333\nBut what I want you to remember is\nthat even though you are in measure,\n\n394\n00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:35.397\nthat you can use some of\nthe tools we looked at and\n\n395\n00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:38.472\ndefined to help you measure and\nget some ideas.\n\n396\n00:22:38.472 --> 00:22:42.770\nIn this particular case, the SIPOC\ntalks about our suppliers, our input,\n\n397\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.399\nour process, our output, and our customer.\n\n398\n00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:48.597\nAnd the idea is that if\nI look at those factors,\n\n399\n00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:52.535\nI may come up with some things\nthat I want to investigate.\n\n400\n00:22:52.535 --> 00:22:56.120\n>> And being able to bring all of that\ninformation together gives us a common\n\n401\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:56.779\nground too.\n\n402\n00:22:56.779 --> 00:23:00.364\nIf somebody comes in asking where\nwe're at on something, where our data\n\n403\n00:23:00.364 --> 00:23:04.385\nis coming from, we've got easy references\nthat we can jump back and get at that.\n\n404\n00:23:04.385 --> 00:23:09.403\nAnd I know the SIPOC form, when you\nshowed me that Excel spreadsheet earlier,\n\n405\n00:23:09.403 --> 00:23:11.162\nit looked really complex.\n\n406\n00:23:11.162 --> 00:23:14.680\nBut at the end of the day it's all nice\nlittle boxes broken down by the phases and\n\n407\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.505\nyou see all the SIPOC sides are on\nthe left and the right side so,\n\n408\n00:23:17.505 --> 00:23:19.813\ndefinitely take a look at\nthat in the course files.\n\n409\n00:23:19.813 --> 00:23:23.880\nIt's a good one to start off with even if\nyou need to tweak it to customize it for\n\n410\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.955\nyour environment.\n\n411\n00:23:24.955 --> 00:23:28.995\nIt's easy enough to do but the point\nis not so much what form you use.\n\n412\n00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:30.797\nJust the fact that you are gathering and\n\n413\n00:23:30.797 --> 00:23:33.314\ncollecting that data because\nyou are going to need it.\n\n414\n00:23:33.314 --> 00:23:37.375\n>> Right and I think that it's so\ntrue that credibility of that true as is\n\n415\n00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:42.147\npictured where we are today, being able\nto show this is where the data came from.\n\n416\n00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:43.737\nHow are things for show and tell?\n\n417\n00:23:43.737 --> 00:23:44.550\nBig deal.\n\n418\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.735\n>> Absolutely.\n\n419\n00:23:45.735 --> 00:23:47.255\nWell we tackled the define phase.\n\n420\n00:23:47.255 --> 00:23:48.973\nWe tackled the measure phase.\n\n421\n00:23:48.973 --> 00:23:52.212\nI think we're probably about ready to\nmove on into the analyze phase next.\n\n422\n00:23:52.212 --> 00:23:54.987\nBut this is a pretty good\nspot to wrap this episode up.\n\n423\n00:23:54.987 --> 00:23:57.994\nDo you have any final thoughts on\nthe measure phase before we move on?\n\n424\n00:23:57.994 --> 00:24:01.394\n>> I think I've said everything\nabout measure I can think about.\n\n425\n00:24:01.394 --> 00:24:02.591\n>> Excellent, all right.\n\n426\n00:24:02.591 --> 00:24:04.332\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nI do hope you you guys enjoyed us.\n\n427\n00:24:04.332 --> 00:24:06.549\nStay tuned, we've got three\nmore phases to move through.\n\n428\n00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:09.387\nWe'll be moving into that analyze\nphase in the next episode so\n\n429\n00:24:09.387 --> 00:24:11.472\nhopefully you'll tune back in for\nthat

00:00:17.552\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITpro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:21.891\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.980\nNow we've been slowly working through the\nDMAIC model and we've reached the point\n\n6\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.020\nwhere we're jumping into\nthe third phase the analyze phase.\n\n7\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.270\nWe're gonna see how we can try to put some\nof that data we collected in the last\n\n8\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.950\nphase to use and\nactually do something with it.\n\n9\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.412\nHere to help us with that, we've got Dr.\nStern back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:39.132\nHow's it going Dr. Stern?\n\n11\n00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:41.572\n>> It's going fine, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:44.417\n>> All right so, with the analyze phase,\nthis is where we jump in,\n\n13\n00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:47.804\nwe start to take a look at some of that\ndata and we actually make it work for us.\n\n14\n00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:50.464\nSo, where do we begin with that?\n\n15\n00:00:50.464 --> 00:00:55.297\n>> Well, what we're wanting to do is,\nwe want to take a critical look at we've\n\n16\n00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:58.996\nbeen measuring and\nbasically we're taking a step back and\n\n17\n00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.262\nwe're seeing why does\nthe picture look like that?\n\n18\n00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:09.611\nAnd the whole purpose of analyze is to end\nup with three to five viable solutions and\n\n19\n00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:14.841\nwe do that by looking at\nthe series of tools and exercises.\n\n20\n00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.017\n>> I know for me, when I'm doing the whole\nmeasure where we're collecting the data,\n\n21\n00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:20.509\nwe're getting it together,\n\n22\n00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.070\nI've got a bad habit of basically\nanalyzing while I'm measuring.\n\n23\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.664\nAnd you really shouldn't do that,\nbecause sometimes you don't have the whole\n\n24\n00:01:27.664 --> 00:01:29.874\npicture, but\nit really is two separate phases.\n\n25\n00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:32.684\nWe gather the data and\nthen we interpret it right, and\n\n26\n00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:35.003\nthat's basically what we're doing here.\n\n27\n00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:39.655\n>> Exactly and that is a very\nimportant point because in measure we\n\n28\n00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:44.304\njust want to get a clean idea of\nhow things look like right now and\n\n29\n00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.700\nwe don't want to over think it.\n\n30\n00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.810\nWe just want to be recorders and\nget that down.\n\n31\n00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.801\nBecause that way when we get to analyze,\nwe're able to sort through the data and\n\n32\n00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:57.493\ntry to figure out why\ndoes it look that way.\n\n33\n00:01:57.493 --> 00:02:01.867\n>> All right, so when it comes to\nthe analyze phase, I've got all of my data\n\n34\n00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:07.053\ncollected, I have it in nice little charts\nor however it is that we've collected it.\n\n35\n00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:10.815\nAnd I'm ready to try and\nlocate those root causes or\n\n36\n00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:15.453\nwhatever it is that I'm gonna\nactually go to work to improve and\n\n37\n00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:19.493\nis there one tool,\nten tools where do we go from there?\n\n38\n00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.550\n>> Again there's just\na myriad of tools in analyze.\n\n39\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.540\nThe ones that we're gonna look\nat are the most popular tools.\n\n40\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.299\nAnd one of the things we're going to\nbe spending time on today is something\n\n41\n00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.621\ncalled the seven tools of quality.\n\n42\n00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.615\nNow these are also called the seven\ntools of process improvement,\n\n43\n00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:37.390\nthe seven tools of critical thinking.\n\n44\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.020\nI've heard it referred to as the seven\nseven tools of management app.\n\n45\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.931\nEven though there is a different set,\nseven tools of management.\n\n46\n00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.983\nBut when you hear that word seven,\ngenerally speaking,\n\n47\n00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.560\nit has to do with these quality tools.\n\n48\n00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.641\nSo we're probably gonna be\nconcentrating a lot on that.\n\n49\n00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:58.201\nI have a slide that kinda talks about\nwhat we'll be looking at in this\n\n50\n00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.561\nparticular phase.\n\n51\n00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.681\nWe're gonna be identifying\npotential root causes.\n\n52\n00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:08.240\nWe're gonna look for sources or variation,\nwe're gonna try to figure out what factors\n\n53\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.441\ncontribute to variation and I wanna spend\na little time talking about variation.\n\n54\n00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:18.550\nAnd we're gonna look at how we would\ngo about conducting a correlation\n\n55\n00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.061\nanalysis and look at studying impacts and\nwhat if scenarios.\n\n56\n00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:25.177\nNow we're not actually\ngoing to do all that, but\n\n57\n00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:27.561\nthose are the things that\nhappen in the analyze phase.\n\n58\n00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:35.042\nWhen we're looking at the data\nthat we gathered for measure,\n\n59\n00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:37.862\nwhen we're looking at\nthat particular data,\n\n60\n00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:41.860\nthe data analysis that we're\ndoing falls into four categories.\n\n61\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.567\nNow data analysis has other things\nthat you might want to study but\n\n62\n00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:52.131\nthe four key things in\nLean Six Sigma are root cause,\n\n63\n00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:55.580\ncorrelation, variation and impact.\n\n64\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.318\nNow, root cause,\nwe already did one root cause tool,\n\n65\n00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:02.500\nwhich was the five whys,\nin another episode.\n\n66\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.970\nSo, it's important,\nwhen I'm looking at this data for\n\n67\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.050\nmeasure, to figure out what is\nthe root cause of this condition.\n\n68\n00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.520\nAnd hopefully, that will lead\nme to three to five solutions.\n\n69\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.940\nSo, even though we in analyze, and\n\n70\n00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.370\nwe have all these tools that we're using,\nand sometimes there's so\n\n71\n00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.670\nmuch data, we have to put it in a graph or\nchart to actually digest it.\n\n72\n00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.161\nWe're still depending on our own minds\nto come up with those three to five\n\n73\n00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:28.800\nsolutions.\n\n74\n00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.219\nThe theory is that with\nall this information,\n\n75\n00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.830\nthat's just going to be\na little bit easier to do.\n\n76\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.638\nSo another thing I'm looking at is\ncorrelation, however, this is one of those\n\n77\n00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:43.447\nkind of strange things in Lean Six Sigma,\nthey talk about correlation, we're\n\n78\n00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:48.257\ngonna look at some correlation charts and\ncertainly a correlation can be used to\n\n79\n00:04:48.257 --> 00:04:53.670\ncome up with different types of solutions\nor lead to different types of solutions.\n\n80\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.670\nBut when they talk about correlation\nit is really more about triggers.\n\n81\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.670\nI'm sure you remember\nfrom statistics 101 that\n\n82\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.270\npeople say correlation doesn't\nnecessarily mean causation.\n\n83\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.790\nBut in Lean Six Sigma it is really what\nthey're looking so, it's kinda funny.\n\n84\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.560\nEven though technically it's not,\nwe're looking more for triggers.\n\n85\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.161\nLike when this happens, does that happen?\n\n86\n00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:22.280\nAnd it's all kind of lumped together\nunder correlation because the graphs look\n\n87\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.491\nsimilar to correlation, so\nthat's just what we labeled it.\n\n88\n00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.366\nBut, the reason that we're looking at\nthat again, the reason why we're looking\n\n89\n00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:33.320\nat root cause, is we want to make sure\nwe're working on the right problem, right?\n\n90\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.713\nThe reason we're looking at triggers is if\nwe come up with three to five solutions\n\n91\n00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:40.426\nand when we do one thing\nthis other thing happens,\n\n92\n00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:43.610\nwe wanna make sure our solution\nhandles both conditions.\n\n93\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.130\nAnd another thing that we're\nlooking at is variation.\n\n94\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.197\nNow this is very important because in the\nSix Sigma world all variation is really,\n\n95\n00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:53.010\nreally bad.\n\n96\n00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.042\nIn the Lean Six Sigma world sometimes\nthere's variation that we say\n\n97\n00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:03.350\ndoesn't have a large impact and so\nmaybe we'll let that variation go.\n\n98\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.861\nNow impact,\nthe fourth condition covers variation, but\n\n99\n00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.660\nit also looks at what is\nthe financial impact?\n\n100\n00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.860\nWhat is the human resource impact?\n\n101\n00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.200\nWhat is the longevity impact?\n\n102\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.680\nWhat is the political impact?\n\n103\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.123\nSo, impact covers more things.\n\n104\n00:06:18.123 --> 00:06:21.971\nAnd backing back up just\na little bit to variation again,\n\n105\n00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:25.511\nthere's a number of different\ntypes of variation.\n\n106\n00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:30.339\nBut the types of variation Lean Six Sigma\nis mostly concerned about is something\n\n107\n00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.730\ncalled special and common variation.\n\n108\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.117\nAnd to make it simple to understand,\n\n109\n00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:39.891\nwe're saying common variation are things\nthat are within our control and\n\n110\n00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:43.820\nspecial variation are things\nthat are outside our control.\n\n111\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.300\nNow common variation also\ncan kind of consider,\n\n112\n00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.911\nthe cost of doing business type thing.\n\n113\n00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:56.257\nSo common variation would include\nthings such as, if I bought a new car,\n\n114\n00:06:56.257 --> 00:07:00.050\nat some point, I know I'm gonna\nhave to get new tires, right?\n\n115\n00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.323\nI have tires for awhile,\nbut at some point,\n\n116\n00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:05.530\nI'm gonna have to replace the tires\nbefore I replace the car.\n\n117\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.260\nSo common variation,\nthings that are within my control,\n\n118\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.162\nthings that I can make the decision,\nright?\n\n119\n00:07:12.162 --> 00:07:15.801\nSpecial variation,\nthings outside my control.\n\n120\n00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:21.109\nNow, the interesting thing about\n\n121\n00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:27.885\nspecial variations is\nit can run the gamut.\n\n122\n00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:32.765\nIt can be anywhere from, I'm a visitor at\nthe facility and I don't know how to fill\n\n123\n00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:37.241\nthe coffee pot because I don't have\nthe key, all the way to an earthquake.\n\n124\n00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:39.600\nSo it really runs the gamut.\n\n125\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.947\nCommon variation is where\nwe usually try to work\n\n126\n00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:47.549\nin Lean Six Sigma because we don't\nhave to ask for permissions and\n\n127\n00:07:47.549 --> 00:07:52.420\nit's something that we can impact and\nsomething that we can change.\n\n128\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.160\nSo another thing that we look\nat when we're in analyze.\n\n129\n00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.467\nIf you were in the green belt,\nblack belt, or master black belt class,\n\n130\n00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:08.129\nthis is where we study statistics and\nstatistics such as competence level,\n\n131\n00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:12.730\nsigma levels, design of experiment,\nhypothesis testing,\n\n132\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.371\nthat's where those types\nof exercises happen.\n\n133\n00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.639\nSo in a green, black, or\nmaster black belt class,\n\n134\n00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.895\nyou'd still be working in the DMAIC model,\nbut when you got here,\n\n135\n00:08:23.895 --> 00:08:29.560\nyou'd kind of take a bit of a detour into\na lot of math, and a lot of statistics.\n\n136\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.201\nNow the good news about that is\nthat there's some basic statistics,\n\n137\n00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.673\nthat a lot of times that's all you\nneed in a Lean Six Sigma report.\n\n138\n00:08:36.673 --> 00:08:41.850\nNow even though green, black and master\nblack belt learn a lot of statistics,\n\n139\n00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.471\nsometimes they revert back\nto the simple statistics.\n\n140\n00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:50.271\nAnd those are mean, mode, median,\nrange and order of operators.\n\n141\n00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:55.171\nAnd so mean, and I know a lot of you\nalready know this but mean average and\n\n142\n00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.792\nmean average all mean the same thing.\n\n143\n00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:01.322\nMode is the number of times\na number shows up in a string,\n\n144\n00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:05.827\nso if you had a string of numbers like,\n15 numbers and the number eight\n\n145\n00:09:05.827 --> 00:09:10.283\nshowed up more times then any other\nnumber that would become our mode.\n\n146\n00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:14.186\nA median is where you take the numbers and\nyou line them up and\n\n147\n00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.621\nyou choose the number in the middle.\n\n148\n00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:21.080\nIn order to do that you have to line\nthem up sequentially first, right?\n\n149\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.880\nSo, if I were grading a test, I probably\nwouldn't be getting a 30, 40, 70, 90.\n\n150\n00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.700\nI'd probably be getting\nthem in a different order.\n\n151\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.326\nSo, I would want to line those\nup in sequential order and\n\n152\n00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:35.110\npick the one in the middle.\n\n153\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.603\nNow, the reason why mean mode and\n\n154\n00:09:37.603 --> 00:09:43.034\nmedian mode are such a big deal in\nLean Six Sigma, is a lot of statistics,\n\n155\n00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:48.222\na lot of measurements a lot of\npresentations are based on the middle.\n\n156\n00:09:48.222 --> 00:09:53.368\nSo, when we're trying to talk about\nsomething like the average number of\n\n157\n00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:59.012\ncustomer complaints, the average number\nof absences, those types of things,\n\n158\n00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:03.670\nwe're looking at a mean, and\nwe're gauging things on that mean.\n\n159\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.214\nIf our mode and our median are close to\nthe mean, then we can pretty much say,\n\n160\n00:10:08.214 --> 00:10:11.558\non an average,\nwe have 15 customer complaints a day.\n\n161\n00:10:11.558 --> 00:10:15.532\nBut if our mode and\nour median are way off from that,\n\n162\n00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:19.710\nthen maybe that's not really\ndepicting the number.\n\n163\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:24.504\nSo since things such as control charts and\nrun charts and a few other charts work off\n\n164\n00:10:24.504 --> 00:10:29.320\nthe middle, we wanna make sure that we're\ngiving a true depiction of the middle.\n\n165\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.320\nSo we're always kinda testing that\naverage against mode and median.\n\n166\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.477\nThen the reason why range is important\nin statistical thinking is that if\n\n167\n00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:44.181\nI'm looking at the number of defects,\nI might be looking at a range for\n\n168\n00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.481\na couple of weeks.\n\n169\n00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:48.734\nAnd there could be special conditions,\nso rather than,\n\n170\n00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:52.750\nI just want to consider that in\nthe mix when I'm analyzing something.\n\n171\n00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.010\nIt could have been an off week for\nexample.\n\n172\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.087\nSo when I'm increasing my range,\nlet's say I'm going to study something,\n\n173\n00:11:00.087 --> 00:11:05.413\na condition for four or five weeks, well\nthen I might get different statistics.\n\n174\n00:11:05.413 --> 00:11:07.780\nAnd then the order of\noperators are kind of funny.\n\n175\n00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.202\nBecause we learned that in third grade,\nbut a lot of times we forgot about it.\n\n176\n00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:14.090\nAnd that's just the way that\nformulas are determined.\n\n177\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.530\nAnd I think, I can't remember what it was\nthat they taught us in or fifth grade.\n\n178\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.140\n>> It was that please,\nmy dear Aunt Sally or-\n\n179\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.616\n>> Yeah, please excuse my dear Aunt Sally,\n\n180\n00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:23.120\nright.\n\n181\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.050\nSo, a lot you probably remember that.\n\n182\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.576\nAnd the reason why that's important\nis that a lot of times when we're\n\n183\n00:11:29.576 --> 00:11:33.869\nlooking at formulas we just forget\nto do it in the correct order and\n\n184\n00:11:33.869 --> 00:11:36.851\nwe're just going to get\na different number.\n\n185\n00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:40.316\nSo, when you are in analyze and\nyou're in the green, black or\n\n186\n00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:44.396\nmaster black belt class, this is\nwhere you start studying statistics.\n\n187\n00:11:44.396 --> 00:11:49.058\nNow in Lean Six Sigma, the good news is\nthat what we want to do is make sure you\n\n188\n00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:53.668\nunderstand the statistic and you\nunderstand why you might want to use it.\n\n189\n00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:56.455\nFor example, why would I want\nto use a confidence level?\n\n190\n00:11:56.455 --> 00:12:02.006\nOnce we're comfortable in those classes\nknowing that You actually have a choice,\n\n191\n00:12:02.006 --> 00:12:05.413\nand your choice is to just\nlet Excel do it for you, or\n\n192\n00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:10.430\nyou can learn the long way of doing that,\nthe actual mathematic formulas.\n\n193\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.758\nBut the task is more, the testing for Six\nSigma is more about that you understand\n\n194\n00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:20.009\nwhy you would be using this statistic and\nwhy you would reach for that.\n\n195\n00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:23.206\nNow the reason why in\nthe Six Sigma environment and\n\n196\n00:12:23.206 --> 00:12:28.004\nthis is one of the big complaints\nabout Six Sigma versus Six Sigma is\n\n197\n00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:32.650\nthat when Six Sigma was created in\nthe 80s by Bill Smith for Motorola.\n\n198\n00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.470\nWe didn't have all these great statistical\npackages, and Excel can just do so\n\n199\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.476\nmany incredible things at\nthe touch of a button.\n\n200\n00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:43.052\nSo it's not always important.\n\n201\n00:12:43.052 --> 00:12:47.051\nIn an earlier episode I mentioned\nthat on your course files\n\n202\n00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:51.716\nyou have a sigma calculator and\na return on investment calculator.\n\n203\n00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:55.728\nWell in the 1980s they had a,\nthings like that as well, but\n\n204\n00:12:55.728 --> 00:12:58.847\nthey just weren't as easy\nto use as they are now.\n\n205\n00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:04.379\nAnd you still had to really understand\nthe mathematical formula to go back and\n\n206\n00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:08.307\ntest your work,\nyou just really don't need that now.\n\n207\n00:13:08.307 --> 00:13:13.664\nSo, what happens sometimes when we go from\nmeasure to analyze is that we just have so\n\n208\n00:13:13.664 --> 00:13:14.440\nmuch data.\n\n209\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.606\nWe cant process that data, and remember,\nwe're looking at that that data because\n\n210\n00:13:18.606 --> 00:13:21.830\nwe're hoping it's going to lead\nus to three to five solutions.\n\n211\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.910\nAnd so sometimes it's important\nto organize that data so\n\n212\n00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.953\nthat we can really study it.\n\n213\n00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:32.759\nAnd what we're going to be doing next\nis just looking at some of the popular\n\n214\n00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:37.643\ngraphs and charts which are included\nin that seven tools of quality which is\n\n215\n00:13:37.643 --> 00:13:42.930\nsometimes called the seven tools of\nprocess improvement or critical thinking.\n\n216\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.314\nThe first one I want to look at,\n\n217\n00:13:44.314 --> 00:13:47.744\neven though the slide said the first\none we're gonna look at is process map.\n\n218\n00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.521\nBut we're going to still talk about that.\n\n219\n00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.576\nBut we've talked about\nprocess mapping a lot.\n\n220\n00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:57.530\nNow when I get to analyze I'm looking\na process map in a different way.\n\n221\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:02.630\nIn define, I was looking at\nthe process map to get a high level\n\n222\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.910\nidea of what is happening with my process,\nright?\n\n223\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.884\nAnd then in measure I might have\ntaken that high-level process map and\n\n224\n00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:14.527\nkind of segmented it out a little bit, but\nwhen I get to analyze what I'm looking at\n\n225\n00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:19.138\nthat process now, I'm thinking from\nthe terms of what boxes could I eliminate?\n\n226\n00:14:19.138 --> 00:14:22.068\nWhat boxes could I maybe\ncombine with another box, or\n\n227\n00:14:22.068 --> 00:14:26.431\nwhat boxes could I maybe move around in\na different order to make things better,\n\n228\n00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:31.397\nfaster, more cost effective, because those\nare the goals we have for Six Sigma.\n\n229\n00:14:31.397 --> 00:14:35.750\nSo the first one we're going to\nlook at is the Fishbone Diagram.\n\n230\n00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.413\nI mentioned in an earlier episode that on\nthe lean side this is called ichikawa,\n\n231\n00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:44.329\non the Six Sigma side it's often\ncalled a cause and effect matrix.\n\n232\n00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:49.277\nWhich brings me to another quick point,\neven though matrixes, diagrams,\n\n233\n00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:53.084\ncharts, all of those things\nare technically different.\n\n234\n00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:54.247\nFor some reason and\n\n235\n00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:59.196\nI'm not sure why, in the Lean Six Sigma\nworld, they use them interchangeably.\n\n236\n00:14:59.196 --> 00:15:03.003\nSo if you were to look up\nthe word diagram versus a chart,\n\n237\n00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.360\nit would have different nuances.\n\n238\n00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.580\nBut just remember, if you hear\nsomething with the word chart or\n\n239\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.998\ndiagram or matrix after it,\nit's actually the same collateral.\n\n240\n00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:16.412\nSo if someone said, I'm doing\na fishbone analysis, fishbone chart,\n\n241\n00:15:16.412 --> 00:15:20.610\na fishbone matrix which that\nprobably wouldn't make much sense.\n\n242\n00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.440\nBut if you hear those terms,\njust know they're all the same tool.\n\n243\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.150\nAnd I think that's kind of a good tip.\n\n244\n00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.193\nSo, anyway, one of the goals of Lean\nSix Sigma is to simplify things and so\n\n245\n00:15:29.193 --> 00:15:31.161\nthis is called a fishbone diagram.\n\n246\n00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:34.969\nAnd in this particular fishbone diagram in\nthe head of the fish we have the problem\n\n247\n00:15:34.969 --> 00:15:37.881\nwhich is we're gonna say it's\nsome kind of quality problem,\n\n248\n00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.233\nsome sort of quality issue.\n\n249\n00:15:39.233 --> 00:15:42.964\nAnd you'll notice in\nthis particular diagram,\n\n250\n00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:47.790\nthe big bones say measure,\nmeasurement, human, machines.\n\n251\n00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.434\nThere's a lot of different ways\nyou can do a Fishbone Diagram, and\n\n252\n00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:54.702\nwe're gonna talk about some of\nthe models that you can use.\n\n253\n00:15:54.702 --> 00:15:57.859\nBut you can also name these\nbig bones whatever you want.\n\n254\n00:15:57.859 --> 00:16:01.932\nWhen I have a lot of time and\nI'm doing it as a facilitation exercise,\n\n255\n00:16:01.932 --> 00:16:06.709\nlike I'm bringing a group in so that we\ncan try to figure out what's contributing\n\n256\n00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.470\nto the problem,\nI like them to name the bones.\n\n257\n00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.740\nBecause that tells me a little\nbit about their process.\n\n258\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.820\nBut the theory of the Fishbone Diagram\nis that the further you\n\n259\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.370\nget down in the process, the more likely\nyou are to identify the root cause.\n\n260\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.110\nSo, you would actually take something\nlike, for example, under Measurement where\n\n261\n00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.850\nit says faulty testing equipment, and\nyou would try to do bones off that.\n\n262\n00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.260\nAnd those bones are where you're\ngonna find that root cause.\n\n263\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.759\nNow, Fishbone Diagram is a terribly\nunder-utilized tool, and\n\n264\n00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:41.604\na lot of white papers will complain\nthat it didn't solve the problem.\n\n265\n00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:45.756\nAnd what I would challenge you to\nremember is that the Fishbone Diagram is\n\n266\n00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.340\nan identification tool.\n\n267\n00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.040\nWe looked at another identification\ntool called Tim Woods that helped us\n\n268\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.710\nidentify areas of waste.\n\n269\n00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.070\nSo kind of think of it in that aspect,\n\n270\n00:16:55.070 --> 00:17:00.400\nall I'm trying to do is identify\nthe root cause, because\n\n271\n00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.810\nif I identify the root cause I may be able\nto come up with three to five solutions.\n\n272\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.710\nNow there's a lot of really clever things\nyou can do with fishbone diagrams.\n\n273\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.681\nAnd you'll see that this\nis just an example,\n\n274\n00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:17.070\nthat you might wanna go back and\nlook at it in depth at another time.\n\n275\n00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:22.092\nOr you might wanna stop the film and\nlook at it now, sorry.\n\n276\n00:17:22.092 --> 00:17:24.106\n[LAUGH] I forgot that you could do that.\n\n277\n00:17:24.106 --> 00:17:25.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you might wanna stop and\n\n278\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.740\nlook at this when you have\na little bit more time.\n\n279\n00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.202\nBut I just wanna show you how you\ncan take these simple things and\n\n280\n00:17:32.202 --> 00:17:34.566\ndo some really pretty diagrams with them.\n\n281\n00:17:34.566 --> 00:17:38.720\nAgain most of the Lean Six Sigma tools and\ncertainly the Seven Tools of Quality,\n\n282\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.696\nthose were all developed\nback in the 40s and 50s, and\n\n283\n00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:44.290\nthey were meant to be paper and\npencil tools.\n\n284\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.580\nAnd so I think that there is a real\nvalue in being able to use them and\n\n285\n00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.085\ndraw them out if you're in a meeting.\n\n286\n00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:54.167\nBut also if you're trying to\nshow them to other people,\n\n287\n00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:58.442\nwe have again templates on your sample\nfiles that allow you to do that as well.\n\n288\n00:17:58.442 --> 00:18:02.928\n>> One challenge I find that a lot of\npeople have when dealing with fishbone\n\n289\n00:18:02.928 --> 00:18:06.293\ndiagrams is in your initial\ndrawing of that diagram,\n\n290\n00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:09.990\nevery possible cause is kind\nof treated equally, right?\n\n291\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.000\nAnd in your second fishbone diagram there,\n\n292\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.250\nthey actually put in the percentages for\neach.\n\n293\n00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.021\nSo you can see like, yeah there might be\nfive different things on the legal and\n\n294\n00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:22.027\nsafety factors, but here's one of them\nthat applies to 81% of our defects, or\n\n295\n00:18:22.027 --> 00:18:24.427\nmistakes, or\nwhatever it is we're measuring.\n\n296\n00:18:24.427 --> 00:18:25.007\n>> Exactly.\n\n297\n00:18:25.007 --> 00:18:26.861\n>> And that really helps to\nrefine the importance and\n\n298\n00:18:26.861 --> 00:18:28.370\nmakes the diagram a lot more useful.\n\n299\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.562\nSo remember that there is more than\none way to apply these diagrams,\n\n300\n00:18:31.562 --> 00:18:35.209\nand you gotta find the one that kind of\nmeets the needs for your organization.\n\n301\n00:18:35.209 --> 00:18:35.975\n>> Exactly.\n\n302\n00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:40.648\nAnd sometimes when you're\ndoing your fishbone diagram,\n\n303\n00:18:40.648 --> 00:18:44.520\nsometimes it's better to\nuse kind of a system.\n\n304\n00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.260\nAnd this system that I'm looking\nat right now is called the 6 Ms,\n\n305\n00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.840\nand, oddly it's called\nthe 6 Ms traditional.\n\n306\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.689\nSo, I haven't really found\nthe 6 Ms non-traditional.\n\n307\n00:18:53.689 --> 00:18:55.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I didn't put that on there.\n\n308\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.933\nSo, you can see it's saying machines,\nmethods, materials,\n\n309\n00:18:59.933 --> 00:19:03.053\nmeasurements, Mother Nature and manpower.\n\n310\n00:19:03.053 --> 00:19:05.583\nAnd, it's just another way\nthat you can remember.\n\n311\n00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:10.401\nSo, let's say you're in a meeting,\nsomeone presents a problem.\n\n312\n00:19:10.401 --> 00:19:12.381\nYou can put it in the head of the fish,\nand\n\n313\n00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:16.306\nif you didn't really have time to think\nabout all the factors that contribute.\n\n314\n00:19:16.306 --> 00:19:21.581\nYou could maybe use these six categories\nto start getting your mind going and\n\n315\n00:19:21.581 --> 00:19:25.882\nyour critical thinking around\neach one of these categories.\n\n316\n00:19:25.882 --> 00:19:29.181\nAnd then there's what, and\nyou might want to stop the tape and\n\n317\n00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:32.101\nlook at these because they're very,\nvery valuable,\n\n318\n00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:36.610\neven if you're just trying to figure\nout what you want to work on, right?\n\n319\n00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.778\nThere's a model that's even simpler,\nthat I'm going to show you in a second.\n\n320\n00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.019\nHere's another fishbone diagram.\n\n321\n00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:46.148\n>> And basically they've used the Ms,\nor most of the Ms right there,\n\n322\n00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:49.026\nwe've got materials, methods, machines,\n\n323\n00:19:49.026 --> 00:19:52.292\neach of those were some of\nthe Ms that you've shown.\n\n324\n00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:56.002\nBut even they mix it up because there's\none in there that's environment, and so,\n\n325\n00:19:56.002 --> 00:19:57.751\nI guess that would be mother nature, so\n\n326\n00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.720\nthat's one of the Ms\nwith a different name.\n\n327\n00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.389\n>> Yeah, but, and\nthe thing is again you can't do it wrong.\n\n328\n00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:06.785\nBut let's say you were in a meeting and\nthat you just kind of didn't remember all\n\n329\n00:20:06.785 --> 00:20:09.673\nof the six Ms, you would just put\nthe ones down that you remembered,\n\n330\n00:20:09.673 --> 00:20:11.415\nit's just supposed to kind of help you.\n\n331\n00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:15.231\nNow, there's even a simpler one,\nlike you're in a real rush,\n\n332\n00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:18.693\nyou've got a problem,\nyou put it in the head of the fish and\n\n333\n00:20:18.693 --> 00:20:21.678\nthe simple one says people,\nproduct, process.\n\n334\n00:20:21.678 --> 00:20:26.402\nNow the product one you says slash\nservice so we keep the three Ps.\n\n335\n00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:30.561\nSo, you would have your fishbone diagram,\nand you would have people issues,\n\n336\n00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:34.530\nproduct slash service issues,\neven if it is a service issue, you'd still\n\n337\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.775\nsay product slash service to keep with\nthat three P nomenclature kind of thing.\n\n338\n00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:41.549\nAnd then you'd have the process, right?\n\n339\n00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:45.032\nAnd the ideas you'd brainstorm around\nthose three particular categories.\n\n340\n00:20:45.032 --> 00:20:50.310\nNow, in my university classes a lot\nof times we do fishbone diagrams,\n\n341\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:55.776\nand the example I use to use is I'd say\nput traffic in the head of the fish.\n\n342\n00:20:55.776 --> 00:20:59.810\nBut inevitably, a student would raise\ntheir hand because I'm in Colorado and\n\n343\n00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.509\nthey would say things like,\nyou mean drug traffic?\n\n344\n00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:07.378\nOr do you mean human trafficking?\n\n345\n00:21:07.378 --> 00:21:09.490\nBut sometimes,\nyou pick something that's too big.\n\n346\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.650\nSo if I, in real life put\ntraffic in the head of the fish,\n\n347\n00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.070\nthat might not be as effective is\nputting something like we can't find\n\n348\n00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.680\nenough qualified nurses or\nsomething that's a very specific example.\n\n349\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.090\nSo what are the rules that you want to\nremember about fishbone diagrams is you\n\n350\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.780\nwant to be as specific as possible,\nand then probably the other rule is\n\n351\n00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.200\njust to kind of remember it's just\nto help you identify the root cause.\n\n352\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.851\nNow, we talked about flow charts, and\nwe're talking about them again, but\n\n353\n00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:43.941\nI just wanted to show you that a flowchart\ndoesn't have to be something that you see\n\n354\n00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:47.225\nin Visio, and you might wanna go back and\nkind of look at this one.\n\n355\n00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:51.409\nIt's kinda cute, but\nwhen you think about flowcharts,\n\n356\n00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:57.076\na lot of times we think about something\nlike a charting program such as Visio or\n\n357\n00:21:57.076 --> 00:22:02.045\nSmartChart, or some of the really\npopular charting programs, but\n\n358\n00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:04.333\nyou can just draw it out, too.\n\n359\n00:22:04.333 --> 00:22:07.653\nWhen you're in the analyze phase,\nit's about thinking.\n\n360\n00:22:07.653 --> 00:22:10.835\nSo you don't necessarily always\nneed a computer program.\n\n361\n00:22:10.835 --> 00:22:15.537\nOne of the things that I appreciate\na lot about Lean Six Sigma is\n\n362\n00:22:15.537 --> 00:22:20.424\nthat it capitalizes on your mental\nability just as much as it does\n\n363\n00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:22.699\non your computerized skill.\n\n364\n00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:27.061\nAnd so some things like the three Ps,\nif you were using them more to just think\n\n365\n00:22:27.061 --> 00:22:30.967\nabout things or those voices that\nwe covered when we were in define.\n\n366\n00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:33.450\nThese are things that you can\nthink about on your walk, or\n\n367\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.656\nwhen you are driving home.\n\n368\n00:22:34.656 --> 00:22:36.468\nYou don't always need to have a computer.\n\n369\n00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:39.972\nAnd even some of the tools that we\nkind of think of as computerized,\n\n370\n00:22:39.972 --> 00:22:41.111\nlike flowcharting.\n\n371\n00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:44.230\nWe can just draw them\nout on a piece of paper.\n\n372\n00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.952\nSometimes that's more lean.\n\n373\n00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:49.722\nNow, one of the quality tools, and\n\n374\n00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:53.870\nI always think this is kind of interesting\nis something called check sheets.\n\n375\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.127\nAnd check sheets are things\njust like to do lists.\n\n376\n00:22:56.127 --> 00:23:00.975\nAnd when you think about the seven,\nwhat people are saying are the seven most\n\n377\n00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:05.523\nimportant tools of quality or\nthe seven most important tools of process\n\n378\n00:23:05.523 --> 00:23:09.865\nimprovement or critical thinking and\ncheck sheets makes the list.\n\n379\n00:23:09.865 --> 00:23:11.954\nI think that's pretty phenomenal\ncuz that's a simple tool.\n\n380\n00:23:11.954 --> 00:23:17.690\nNow, like I said, to do list is\na good example of a check sheet.\n\n381\n00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:20.511\nAnother example is something\ncalled a tollgate.\n\n382\n00:23:20.511 --> 00:23:25.433\nIn very large Six Sigma projects, it\ndoesn't happen as much in Lean Six Sigma\n\n383\n00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:30.207\nprojects, between the various phases,\nso between define and measure and\n\n384\n00:23:30.207 --> 00:23:31.662\nmeasure and analyze.\n\n385\n00:23:31.662 --> 00:23:35.510\nSometimes they put something\nin place called a tollgate.\n\n386\n00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:38.825\nAnd a tollgate is just basically\na checklist after that phase is done to\n\n387\n00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:41.083\nmake sure I've hit all\nthe all the high points.\n\n388\n00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:45.216\nA lot of times tollgates have some\nindustry specific things on them.\n\n389\n00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.502\nSometimes they have compliance issues.\n\n390\n00:23:48.502 --> 00:23:55.111\nIn some cases if a project is incredibly\nbig, there is actually a tollgate monitor.\n\n391\n00:23:55.111 --> 00:23:59.266\nI don't even know what you call them.\n\n392\n00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:02.016\nA tollgate Liaison that goes around and\n\n393\n00:24:02.016 --> 00:24:07.890\nthey're kind of like a compliance person\nthat says you can go to the next phase.\n\n394\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.163\nSo a toll gate would be\nan example of a check sheet.\n\n395\n00:24:11.163 --> 00:24:14.567\nIt's also a great way to\ngather information on the two\n\n396\n00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:19.197\ncharts we're gonna talk about next,\nthe Pareto Chart and a Histogram.\n\n397\n00:24:19.197 --> 00:24:24.257\nSo check sheet's a good way to,\nespecially get some informal information\n\n398\n00:24:24.257 --> 00:24:29.414\nif you're just trying to do quick and\ndirty chart in a Pareto or a Histogram.\n\n399\n00:24:29.414 --> 00:24:34.250\nAnd it can also just be a list of\nthings that you need to do before\n\n400\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.024\nan activity started.\n\n401\n00:24:36.024 --> 00:24:40.758\nI think it's kinda funny in the old Steve\nCovey material that I still go back and\n\n402\n00:24:40.758 --> 00:24:45.061\nreread from time to time, and Lean Six\nSigma has a lot of Steve Covey kind\n\n403\n00:24:45.061 --> 00:24:49.461\nof built into it, but he says we\nshould be keeping a not-to-do-list.\n\n404\n00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:53.685\nAnd just write down everything we are\nnever gonna do again and keep that in our\n\n405\n00:24:53.685 --> 00:24:57.524\npurse or wallet so that we can go back and\nvisit that from time to time.\n\n406\n00:24:57.524 --> 00:25:02.587\nAnother person, the people that\nare doing the research on the brain, or\n\n407\n00:25:02.587 --> 00:25:07.995\nthere's a big group of people that are now\ndoing a lot of studies on the brain.\n\n408\n00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:12.551\nAnd one of the suggestions from the people\nin that world is that we need to do\n\n409\n00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:13.810\na to-done-list.\n\n410\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.972\nAll the things that we accomplish that so\n\n411\n00:25:16.972 --> 00:25:20.600\nthat we can feel better\nabout where we're at.\n\n412\n00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.540\nSo, and here's the, I'm sorry,\nI went past that too fast.\n\n413\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.672\nHere's just some examples of check sheets.\n\n414\n00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:35.842\nSo the next thing we're gonna do is\ngo into histograms and Pareto charts.\n\n415\n00:25:35.842 --> 00:25:39.580\nA histogram can do a number\nof different things.\n\n416\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.823\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\n\n417\n00:25:40.823 --> 00:25:45.338\nwe're primarily using a histogram\nto track the history of an event.\n\n418\n00:25:45.338 --> 00:25:50.030\nSo, even though histograms can\nbe used in other capacities,\n\n419\n00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.276\nthe main thing Lean Six Sigma does\nis use a histogram to track events.\n\n420\n00:25:55.276 --> 00:25:59.504\nSo, number of accidents on the shop floor,\nnumber of broken lightbulbs,\n\n421\n00:25:59.504 --> 00:26:02.265\nnumber of missed calls,\nthose types of things.\n\n422\n00:26:04.513 --> 00:26:09.250\nThe best way to kinda think of it\nis in terms of a frequency diagram.\n\n423\n00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.193\nAnd so in the frequency diagram\nthat you're looking at,\n\n424\n00:26:12.193 --> 00:26:14.410\nyou'll see that we were counting colors.\n\n425\n00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.291\nAnd we thought there\nwere five blue colors.\n\n426\n00:26:16.291 --> 00:26:21.486\nAnd you'll notice the bucket of blue,\nred, yellow, and orange.\n\n427\n00:26:21.486 --> 00:26:25.072\nNow the only problem that I\nhave with this particular idea,\n\n428\n00:26:25.072 --> 00:26:30.090\nbecause we're taking a frequency diagram\nand we're capturing it on a histogram,\n\n429\n00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.908\nis that on this histogram,\nthey put the largest number first.\n\n430\n00:26:33.908 --> 00:26:37.998\nAnd that can happen because histograms\ncan also be used to collect bins of\n\n431\n00:26:37.998 --> 00:26:38.877\ninformation.\n\n432\n00:26:38.877 --> 00:26:43.836\nBut if you were tracking the history\nof events, what you'd wanna do\n\n433\n00:26:43.836 --> 00:26:48.536\nis you'd want to do it related to time and\nnot related to volume.\n\n434\n00:26:48.536 --> 00:26:52.855\nAnd this is an example of an expense\nhistogram that we just used the other day.\n\n435\n00:26:52.855 --> 00:26:55.920\nWe had a small regional conference.\n\n436\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.153\nAnd we were looking at a small\nregional ASU conference.\n\n437\n00:26:59.153 --> 00:27:02.801\nAnd we were trying to look at\nthe average expense money that people on\n\n438\n00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:03.768\nthe board spent.\n\n439\n00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:09.021\nWe already have the hotel room and\nthe meals kind of figured into the mix.\n\n440\n00:27:09.021 --> 00:27:13.033\nAnd so we were just looking at the 40\npeople that we have on the leadership\n\n441\n00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:16.608\nteam and trying to get kind of\nan idea of how much money they spent.\n\n442\n00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:20.938\nAnd you can see on this histogram\nthat the biggest bulk of\n\n443\n00:27:20.938 --> 00:27:23.620\nthe people spent about $738.\n\n444\n00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.125\nNow the reason why that's helpful is\nnext year when we're budgeting for\n\n445\n00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:30.470\nanother regional conference we'll\nhave these figures available.\n\n446\n00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:35.671\nAnd this is just kind of a simple one.\n\n447\n00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:38.968\nThis is looking at parent ages for\npre-school children.\n\n448\n00:27:38.968 --> 00:27:42.000\nAnd you'll see that most\nof the parents in this\n\n449\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.748\nparticular group fall between\nthe ages of 30 and 34.\n\n450\n00:27:45.748 --> 00:27:49.728\nAnd that might be helpful to the teacher\nthat's teaching that class to know the age\n\n451\n00:27:49.728 --> 00:27:50.833\ngroup of the parents.\n\n452\n00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:52.255\nAnd this one I had to throw in.\n\n453\n00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:57.236\nYou don't see these too often anymore but\nif I have any shutterbug people out there,\n\n454\n00:27:57.236 --> 00:28:00.885\nI have any people there are still\ninto the older photography,\n\n455\n00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:03.719\nyou might have seen\na histogram on your camera.\n\n456\n00:28:03.719 --> 00:28:07.551\nNow the next thing we're gonna talk about\nis something called a Pareto chart.\n\n457\n00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:12.827\nSo the way I wanna explain this is if you\nwere looking at the number of customer\n\n458\n00:28:12.827 --> 00:28:17.938\ncomplaints you got every day,\nyour histogram would say something like,\n\n459\n00:28:17.938 --> 00:28:23.316\non Monday I got 15, on Tuesday I got 40,\non Wednesday I got 10, right?\n\n460\n00:28:23.316 --> 00:28:25.545\nThat's how your histogram would go.\n\n461\n00:28:25.545 --> 00:28:27.820\nBut then if you wanted to do Pareto chart,\n\n462\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.007\nit might look at the types of\ncustomer complaints you had.\n\n463\n00:28:31.007 --> 00:28:35.088\nNow if I were looking at the types of\ncustomer complaints I have, then I\n\n464\n00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:39.668\nwould arrange them in sequential order so\nthat the biggest bar would be on top.\n\n465\n00:28:39.668 --> 00:28:42.640\nSo let's say that you were\nan IT help desk, for example.\n\n466\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.425\nAt the IT help desk, I might\ndetermine that my largest amount of\n\n467\n00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:52.663\ncomplaints came from people not being\nable to access a new password or\n\n468\n00:28:52.663 --> 00:28:55.666\ntheir password going bad in 30 days.\n\n469\n00:28:55.666 --> 00:28:58.708\nAnd so I would know that that's\nthe problem that I wanna tackle.\n\n470\n00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:04.374\nSo it gets a little confusing sometimes,\nbecause histograms track the history,\n\n471\n00:29:04.374 --> 00:29:07.833\nwhereas a pareto chart\ntracks the type of events.\n\n472\n00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:11.533\n>> It's funny you mentioned that because\nyou're example there is something that\n\n473\n00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:13.698\nalmost exactly a thing\nthat I did in real life.\n\n474\n00:29:13.698 --> 00:29:17.674\nI used to work for an insurance\ncompany and every six months we would\n\n475\n00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:23.200\ntake the helpdesk and their history of\ncalls and we would break it down by type.\n\n476\n00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.961\nSo they got hundreds or\nthousands of calls in a six-month period.\n\n477\n00:29:26.961 --> 00:29:27.935\nAnd we organize it.\n\n478\n00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:33.092\nWe'd say, okay, out of the thousands of\ncalls, there were 300 password resets,\n\n479\n00:29:33.092 --> 00:29:37.982\nand then there were 100 instances of\npeople infected with spyware or malware.\n\n480\n00:29:37.982 --> 00:29:40.925\nAnd then there were 50\npeople who couldn't print.\n\n481\n00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:42.225\nAnd then we break it down like that.\n\n482\n00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:46.296\nAnd the reason we did was because as we\nplanned our IT budget and software we\n\n483\n00:29:46.296 --> 00:29:50.497\nrolled out if we could eliminate\nthe primary source of support esque calls,\n\n484\n00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:53.780\nthen that would give our end\nusers a better experience, and\n\n485\n00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.903\nit would save us money in the long run.\n\n486\n00:29:55.903 --> 00:29:58.816\nAnd so password resets were always\none of our big ones, and so\n\n487\n00:29:58.816 --> 00:30:01.731\nwe started introducing software\nin like little key tokens,\n\n488\n00:30:01.731 --> 00:30:04.418\nwhere you didn't have to\nremember a password anymore,\n\n489\n00:30:04.418 --> 00:30:08.150\nit was generated by your token,\nthings like that to eliminate those calls.\n\n490\n00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.380\nAnd the key thing for\n\n491\n00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.248\nus was making sure we we're putting\nour effort in the right place.\n\n492\n00:30:13.248 --> 00:30:18.040\nBecause you wanna improve your process\nusing your pareto chart for example,\n\n493\n00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.300\nit had operator errors.\n\n494\n00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.053\nThere were only three instances.\n\n495\n00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:23.955\nWell if I go and\nresolve the operator errors, that's great.\n\n496\n00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:27.925\nBut that was just three instances,\npoor design was 64 instances.\n\n497\n00:30:27.925 --> 00:30:29.086\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n498\n00:30:29.086 --> 00:30:32.513\n>> If I had focused on that I would have\nhad a much greater impact on improving\n\n499\n00:30:32.513 --> 00:30:33.196\nthe process.\n\n500\n00:30:33.196 --> 00:30:37.329\nAnd so, that's a key thing, and pareto\ncharts are great about showing that.\n\n501\n00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:38.119\n>> Exactly.\n\n502\n00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:42.646\nAnd I think that also brings\na good point that we're doing.\n\n503\n00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:47.453\nWe're looking at what it would be\nlike to do an entire DMAIC report.\n\n504\n00:30:47.453 --> 00:30:50.703\nDefining measure, analyzing,\nimproving, rolling it out.\n\n505\n00:30:50.703 --> 00:30:52.282\nWe're looking at that whole process.\n\n506\n00:30:52.282 --> 00:30:55.152\nBut there's so\nmany tools in Lean Six Sigma that you\n\n507\n00:30:55.152 --> 00:30:58.644\ncan use to just fix the problem\nright then just with the tools.\n\n508\n00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:03.210\nSo there's a double reason for learning\nabout the methodology because sometimes\n\n509\n00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:07.311\nthings can be solved without going\nthrough the whole recording process,\n\n510\n00:31:07.311 --> 00:31:08.910\njust based on the tool.\n\n511\n00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.900\nSo we have two more charts to look at.\n\n512\n00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.900\nThe next one is our scatter diagram.\n\n513\n00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.390\nAnd a Scatter Diagram in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n514\n00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.390\nagain, all of these tools can be used for\nmultiple purposes.\n\n515\n00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:27.084\nAnd Lean Six Sigma usually, a scatter\ndiagram is used to look at correlation.\n\n516\n00:31:27.084 --> 00:31:32.339\nAnd here's a, the types of correlation\nwould be two things that are related\n\n517\n00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:37.365\nlike typing errors, how that's\naffected by backlog, accident rate.\n\n518\n00:31:37.365 --> 00:31:41.372\nHow it's affected by overtime,\nmachine break down.\n\n519\n00:31:41.372 --> 00:31:45.719\nIt can be something as simple as people\nare late to work when it's raining,\n\n520\n00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:49.801\npeople order soup in the kitchen\nwhen it's cold, that type of thing.\n\n521\n00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:52.072\nWhen you do a scattered diagram,\n\n522\n00:31:52.072 --> 00:31:57.586\nthey're very simple to do in Excel anymore\nbecause you just set up two columns and\n\n523\n00:31:57.586 --> 00:32:02.881\nyou highlight and press scattered\ndiagram and they're very, very simple.\n\n524\n00:32:02.881 --> 00:32:06.828\nBut the patterns that you are likely\nto see, here's some examples.\n\n525\n00:32:06.828 --> 00:32:10.627\nNow the first two are positive because\nthey are both working together and\n\n526\n00:32:10.627 --> 00:32:13.242\nbecause the data points\nare very tight together,\n\n527\n00:32:13.242 --> 00:32:15.745\nthat's stronger correlation\nthan the other.\n\n528\n00:32:15.745 --> 00:32:20.395\nNow the bottom left diagram\nis what I usually see.\n\n529\n00:32:20.395 --> 00:32:23.918\nI get so\nexcited when I actually see correlation.\n\n530\n00:32:23.918 --> 00:32:27.544\nBut sometimes what happens is that you're\ntrying to implement a solution, and\n\n531\n00:32:27.544 --> 00:32:31.166\nthe person that you're working for is so\nmarried to the fact that if you do this,\n\n532\n00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.811\nthis other thing's gonna happen.\n\n533\n00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:36.827\nThat sometimes being able to show hey,\nthere's no correlation between these two\n\n534\n00:32:36.827 --> 00:32:39.692\nthings helps you get a little\nbit more More of that by-in.\n\n535\n00:32:39.692 --> 00:32:44.652\nThe last one, I think's kinda funny\nbecause on my slide that you might not be\n\n536\n00:32:44.652 --> 00:32:49.223\nable to see unless you stop the film,\nis that it says that the j-shaped\n\n537\n00:32:49.223 --> 00:32:52.420\nassociation suggests\na complex relationship.\n\n538\n00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.205\nWhat it suggests to me is that maybe\nI need to use a different chart.\n\n539\n00:32:55.205 --> 00:32:58.977\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now here's just some more scatter\n\n540\n00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.280\ndiagram patterns.\n\n541\n00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.280\nPositive you can see that's going up.\n\n542\n00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.580\nNo correlation, which I said,\nis what I usually see.\n\n543\n00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.202\nNow remember, we get all this\ninformation from measure and\n\n544\n00:33:08.202 --> 00:33:09.940\nwe're trying to see if it correlates.\n\n545\n00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.400\nIf If this condition happens,\ndoes this other condition happen?\n\n546\n00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.453\nEven though technically, that's\ncalled causation, in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n547\n00:33:16.453 --> 00:33:20.199\nwe call it correlation but\nit's really we're looking at triggers.\n\n548\n00:33:20.199 --> 00:33:22.804\nAnd then of course\nthe negative correlation, and\n\n549\n00:33:22.804 --> 00:33:24.920\nsee where the dots are kind of far apart?\n\n550\n00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:29.790\nThat's not as tight, negative\ncorrelation is the second example.\n\n551\n00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:34.150\nNow, correlation a lot of times is\ngonna be something really simple.\n\n552\n00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:38.994\nFor example, in the the diagram\nthat we're looking at right now,\n\n553\n00:33:38.994 --> 00:33:43.075\nwe're looking at water consumption and\ntemperature.\n\n554\n00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:46.359\nYou wanna think each one of these\ndata points is a population,\n\n555\n00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:50.152\nthis diagram would certainly suggest\nthat as the temperature went up,\n\n556\n00:33:50.152 --> 00:33:52.380\nwater consumption went higher, right?\n\n557\n00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.850\nSo that's a real good example\nof positive correlation.\n\n558\n00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.590\nNow, the last one we're gonna be\ntalking about is control charts.\n\n559\n00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.440\nAnd I'm going to just kind of\nquickly build up to control chart so\n\n560\n00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.390\nthat it makes sense.\n\n561\n00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.875\nNow, the charts that could be used to\ncreate a control chart can also be\n\n562\n00:34:09.875 --> 00:34:11.330\nused independently.\n\n563\n00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.950\nSo for example, what you're looking\nat right now is a line chart.\n\n564\n00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:18.639\nAnd what's kind of fun about line charts\nis that you don't really have to have\n\n565\n00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.730\na lot of information.\n\n566\n00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:24.370\nYou identify a condition that you wanna\ntrack and you just start tracking it.\n\n567\n00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.680\nNow even though we don't\nhave a lot of information\n\n568\n00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.290\non the first diagram on the left\nwhere it says stock value.\n\n569\n00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.910\nWe're probably pretty happy, right?\n\n570\n00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:37.350\nI mean, we don't have a whole lot of\ninformation but our stock is going up.\n\n571\n00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.078\nIn the second diagram, however,\nwe're looking at mistakes and even\n\n572\n00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:45.200\nagain we don't have a lot of information,\nbut we know mistakes are going up.\n\n573\n00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.354\nAnd the reason that we would use a line\nchart is like I said, there's a condition\n\n574\n00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:52.960\nthat's kind of curious, and\nwe're just gonna track it for awhile.\n\n575\n00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.332\nAnd just by collecting the information,\n\n576\n00:34:55.332 --> 00:34:58.460\nit might say,\nhey this is a condition I need to look at.\n\n577\n00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.117\nNow a step up from a line chart and keep\nin mind you can just use the line chart,\n\n578\n00:35:02.117 --> 00:35:04.370\nyou don't have to go to the next step.\n\n579\n00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.438\nBut if you were building up to a control\nchart the next thing you might consider is\n\n580\n00:35:08.438 --> 00:35:10.030\nsomething called a run chart.\n\n581\n00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.670\nNow the difference\nbetween the run chart and\n\n582\n00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:17.302\nthe line chart is that at some point in my\nline chart I might decide that I want to\n\n583\n00:35:17.302 --> 00:35:19.598\nget more information about the data.\n\n584\n00:35:19.598 --> 00:35:23.418\nSo my first step is that I\nneed to create a center line.\n\n585\n00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:27.252\nOn run charts that center line is\nalmost always a mean or an average or\n\n586\n00:35:27.252 --> 00:35:31.713\na mean average because we said those are\nall the same, but it could be a median.\n\n587\n00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:36.486\nA lot of you've probably seen like on CNN\nand the Wall Street, a lot of times they\n\n588\n00:35:36.486 --> 00:35:40.560\nsay median car prices or median house\nprices so it could be a median.\n\n589\n00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.400\nIt's usually a mean.\n\n590\n00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.771\nAnd the way I get that mean,\nis I take all the data points that\n\n591\n00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:53.800\nI got from my line chart, and\nI divide by the number of line charts.\n\n592\n00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.740\nAnd that's how I get my center line.\n\n593\n00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.000\nThen I go back and I plot each one\nof these individual conditions.\n\n594\n00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.160\nSo as a quick example, let's say I\nhave 14 students that took a test.\n\n595\n00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.730\nAnd we're gonna say that the y-axis,\nwhich is on the side,\n\n596\n00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.980\nrepresents the grades that they got.\n\n597\n00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:16.480\nSo I took all 14 students,\nI added their scores together.\n\n598\n00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.420\nI divided by 14, and\nI came up with my center line.\n\n599\n00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.307\nNow I'm going to go back and\n\n600\n00:36:22.307 --> 00:36:28.480\nplot each individual of the 14 students to\nsee how far they are away from the middle.\n\n601\n00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.890\nAnd a lot of you probably remember that.\n\n602\n00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.920\nYour teachers in elementary\nschool would say,\n\n603\n00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.110\nthere was an average of\n80 on the spelling test.\n\n604\n00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.910\nAnd then you would know if you\nwere above or below the average.\n\n605\n00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:45.390\nNow kind of the simple way to\nunderstand standard deviation is\n\n606\n00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.580\nlooking at this chart.\n\n607\n00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.820\nAnd again, this is something that you\nwould cover in a much more advanced class.\n\n608\n00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.795\nBut just kind of a quick understanding,\nis if I wanted to get an average at\n\n609\n00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:59.304\nthe average of how far\npeople were from the middle,\n\n610\n00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:02.910\nthat's a kind of an example\nof standard deviation.\n\n611\n00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.670\nNow, we get to the big one and so\nwe're almost done with analyze.\n\n612\n00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.950\nWe get to the big one and\nthis is the control chart.\n\n613\n00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.790\nNow, here's the thing\nabout the control chart.\n\n614\n00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:19.150\nThat middle line could be a mean or\na median but it could also be a mode.\n\n615\n00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.970\nIt could be a benchmark.\n\n616\n00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.830\nIt could be a customer expectation\nthat has no science behind it at all.\n\n617\n00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.560\nSo the middle line is still\nwhat we're shooting for but\n\n618\n00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.410\nit could be a number of different things.\n\n619\n00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:36.896\nThe other thing that's different on\nthis chart is that you'll notice that\n\n620\n00:37:36.896 --> 00:37:41.250\nthere's an upper and lower control limit,\nso that's your UCL and LCL.\n\n621\n00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.210\nThose lines could also be an upper and\nlower tolerance.\n\n622\n00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.570\nOr a limit or upper and\nlower specification limit.\n\n623\n00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.110\nAnd so\nthe idea is to stay within those lines.\n\n624\n00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.190\nAnd I'm sure a lot of you\nare familiar with the term, outlier.\n\n625\n00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:58.090\nSo, on 7.5, we have an outlier.\n\n626\n00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.536\nThe concept here is if it\ngoes outside the upper or\n\n627\n00:38:01.536 --> 00:38:06.170\nlower control limit,\nthat's a condition that I need to look at.\n\n628\n00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.460\n>> Yeah, and you'll find with a lot of\nthings that we've set, our control limit.\n\n629\n00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.322\nAnd it's not that we have to\nhit that control line exactly,\n\n630\n00:38:14.322 --> 00:38:18.920\nthat we'll actually be okay if we're\na little above or a little below.\n\n631\n00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.300\nThe example I use is like when you go\nto the hardware store to buy paint.\n\n632\n00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.901\nThey just have buckets of white paint and\nthen they put a little color in there and\n\n633\n00:38:25.901 --> 00:38:28.560\nshake it up for you and\nthen you get the color that you want.\n\n634\n00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.440\nBut when they shake it that paint\nneeds to be mixed to a certain level.\n\n635\n00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.400\nSo the dye is certain parts per million,\nspread throughout the paint.\n\n636\n00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.740\nAnd it doesn't have to be perfect for\nthe human eye to visually see it the same.\n\n637\n00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.640\nAnd so, if you were to mix it for\n3 minutes, versus mixing it for\n\n638\n00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.396\n2 minutes and 50 seconds,\nor 3 minutes and 10seconds,\n\n639\n00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:53.170\nyou'd probably get what is\nappreciatively the same result.\n\n640\n00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.270\nBut they are different, right?\n\n641\n00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.280\nOne's more mixed than the other.\n\n642\n00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.080\nAs long as they're within those control\nlimits, we see that and it works out.\n\n643\n00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.500\nBut we need to establish what\nthose limits are, right?\n\n644\n00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.240\nThe upper and lower control limits.\n\n645\n00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.882\nAnd sometimes you might be measuring\nsomething that doesn't have a lower\n\n646\n00:39:07.882 --> 00:39:10.480\ncontrol, it just has an upper or\nit just has a lower.\n\n647\n00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.480\nIt happens like that sometimes.\n\n648\n00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.069\nWith something that could completely fail,\n\n649\n00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:15.960\nyou wouldn't necessarily\nhave a lower limit there.\n\n650\n00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.197\n>> Exactly.\n>> But they're just things that have to be\n\n651\n00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:21.780\nestablished so that we can recognize\nwhen we're moving beyond that.\n\n652\n00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.170\n>> And Don brings up a good\npoint about control charts.\n\n653\n00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.890\nMost control charts, you're gonna see\nan upper and lower control limit.\n\n654\n00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.170\nBut absolutely, sometimes you're not\ngonna have a lower control limit.\n\n655\n00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.709\nIf you're tracking accidents\non the shop floor,\n\n656\n00:39:33.709 --> 00:39:37.160\nyou're not gonna say we have to\nhave a certain amount of accidents.\n\n657\n00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.283\nAnd statistical packages that you\nwork with typically set the upper and\n\n658\n00:39:41.283 --> 00:39:43.420\nlower control limit at three sigma.\n\n659\n00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.570\nSo just kind of a little trivia there.\n\n660\n00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.948\nSo, I'd like to wrap up by saying that the\nreason why you might be using one of these\n\n661\n00:39:50.948 --> 00:39:54.450\ncharts or graphs, remember,\nis because you have information.\n\n662\n00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.940\nYou have a ton of information for\nmeasure on a particular topic.\n\n663\n00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.270\nAnd it's easier to digest if\nyou put it in a chart of graph.\n\n664\n00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:06.990\nA lot of charts and graphs are generated\nfrom an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n665\n00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.000\nSo if I only had ten data points,\nI can look at the data points.\n\n666\n00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.490\nI'm not going to make a correlation chart.\n\n667\n00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.727\nI'm not gonna make a control chart.\n\n668\n00:40:14.727 --> 00:40:19.460\nBecause I can look at the data on the\nspreadsheet without putting it on a chart.\n\n669\n00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.900\nSo the purpose of charts and\n\n670\n00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.040\ngraphs are always just to digest the\ninformation that I receive from measure.\n\n671\n00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.843\nBut even on a higher leve,l I'm just\ntrying to come to those three to five\n\n672\n00:40:29.843 --> 00:40:30.720\nsolutions.\n\n673\n00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.359\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n674\n00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:34.400\nI think that's a pretty good\nrundown of the whole phase.\n\n675\n00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.980\nWe've seen a lot of different\nways to use our data.\n\n676\n00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.465\nJust remember, you're collecting all of\nyour data and now you gotta analyze it.\n\n677\n00:40:41.465 --> 00:40:45.420\nYou gotta put it to work in its raw form,\na lot of the data's not terribly useful.\n\n678\n00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.000\nWe refine it,\nwe turn it into useful information, and\n\n679\n00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.590\nthen we're ready to start\ndoing something with it.\n\n680\n00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.850\nSo, that's gonna wrap\nup our analyze phase.\n\n681\n00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.083\nWe do still have a little bit more\nbecause now that we've analyzed,\n\n682\n00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:59.825\nwe need to figure out how we can improve\nand that's gonna be our next phase, but\n\n683\n00:40:59.825 --> 00:41:01.490\nwe are out of time on this episode.\n\n684\n00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.729\nSo stay tuned.\nWe're gonna be moving into that phase next\n\n685\n00:41:04.729 --> 00:41:09.753\nbut for right now signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet And I'm Dr Stern.\n\n686\n00:41:09.753 --> 00:41:11.433\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n687\n00:41:11.433 --> 00:41:17.780\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.980\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.520\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.760\nAnd if you've been following along,\nyou know we've been slowly working our way\n\n6\n00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.790\nthrough the model and\nwe've kind of reached the improved phase.\n\n7\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.170\nWhich is where we actually do\nthe stuff that we get paid for\n\n8\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.430\nand improve a process.\n\n9\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.460\nIt's kinda the whole point\nof this Six Sigma thing.\n\n10\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.240\nSo, that's what we're gonna\nbe diving into today.\n\n11\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.370\nAnd back in the studios again Again\nwe've got Doctor Stern here to help us.\n\n12\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.120\nAnd walk us through the improve phase.\n\n13\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.110\n>> Thank you for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.050\n>> All right so basically we've defined\nour issue, you know, what our problem is.\n\n15\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.790\nWe've measured it.\n\n16\n00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.490\nWe've analyzed our data.\n\n17\n00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.080\nAnd now we're ready to actually\ndo something about it, right?\n\n18\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.000\nThe improve phase is where we\nactually get to work, right?\n\n19\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820\n>> Exactly.\nAnd I mentioned this Former episode I'd\n\n20\n00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.180\nlike to explain that define, measure, and\n\n21\n00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.560\nanalyze are very very creative processes\nand so you have a lot of flexibility,\n\n22\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.680\nthere's only a couple of rules\nin this first three phases.\n\n23\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.068\nWhen you get to improve you have\nto follow a specific map, and\n\n24\n00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:27.760\nwhat that does is makes it incredibly\neasy to explain and teach to you.\n\n25\n00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.390\nIt's not so easy to do But\nbecause there's not a lot of deviation,\n\n26\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.060\nthere's not a lot of extra things that you\ncan do, it's almost like a check sheet.\n\n27\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.450\nAnd in improve, one of the challenges,\nand I have a slide about\n\n28\n00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.130\nthe major things that you're gonna do\nin improve, one of the challenges is\n\n29\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.770\nto remember this is where you're going\nto be spending most of your actual time.\n\n30\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.230\nSo, earlier we said if you don't have\na lot of time, spend it in define, right?\n\n31\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.230\nBut the actual physical\nwork doesn't really happen\n\n32\n00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.520\nuntil the bottom part of Improve.\n\n33\n00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.600\nAnd so if you're working\nthrough the demake model,\n\n34\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.950\nyou don't wanna spend too much\ntime in measure and analyze.\n\n35\n00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.160\nYou wanna be very careful on\nthat you're not measuring and\n\n36\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.370\nanalyzing too many things, and not having\nenough time to actually do your project.\n\n37\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.860\nSo, when you enter the improve phase,\nand i'm gonna go through it quickly and\n\n38\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.100\nthen go back and\ntalk a little bit more in depth.\n\n39\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.310\nWhen you Enter the improve phase the very\n\n40\n00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.840\nfirst thing you do is you list\nyour three to five solutions.\n\n41\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.470\nNow, this is the easiest part of\nimprove because you got your solutions\n\n42\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.840\nfrom the bottom part of analyze.\n\n43\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.270\nSo, I would not have left analyze\nwithout my three to five solutions.\n\n44\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.360\nThe next thing is that I have to gain\nsome consensus on which solution to try.\n\n45\n00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.610\nAnd then once I do that I want to pilot My\nidea I want to make sure that it works.\n\n46\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.800\nAnd then I'm going to start creating\nmy project plan using my WBS method.\n\n47\n00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.580\nMy work breakdown structure method.\n\n48\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.880\nNow, something to keep in mind,\n\n49\n00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.200\nis until you get to that fourth bullet\npoint create project plan using your\n\n50\n00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.950\nWBS you really haven't done anything that\nyou could get in too much trouble for.\n\n51\n00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.230\nOnce you make your project Plan.\n\n52\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.300\nThe execution starts\ngoing into full force.\n\n53\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.610\nAnd when you come up with the baseline.\n\n54\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.070\nAnd I'll remind you from a former\nepisode that a baseline is how\n\n55\n00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.140\nlong is this project going to take?\n\n56\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.350\nAnd how much is it going to cost?\n\n57\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.240\nWell.\nOnce I come up with my project baseline.\n\n58\n00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.320\nAnd baseline is one of\nthose interesting words.\n\n59\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.220\nCuz it would mean something different\nin some of the other phases.\n\n60\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.750\nBut on a project plan once I come\nup with my time and my cost.\n\n61\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.420\nThat's what I'm going to be judged on for\nthe rest of the project.\n\n62\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.360\nSometimes this becomes very challenging\nwhen you're just doing a regular project\n\n63\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.910\nbecause you not have spent enough\ntime thinking about your baseline.\n\n64\n00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.330\nIf you're a little below the baseline\neveryone's pretty happy.\n\n65\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.160\nCertainly if you're on baseline,\nthey're great.\n\n66\n00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.340\nBut if you're a little above baseline,\npeople start getting panicky and\n\n67\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.140\nif you're way above baseline you\nmight not have The job the next day.\n\n68\n00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.380\nBut if you're way below baseline,\nthere's also a problem with that,\n\n69\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.600\nbecause sometimes people think\nyou were a poor project planner,\n\n70\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.350\nor maybe they didn't get everything\nthat they were supposed to get.\n\n71\n00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.540\nNow, the advantage of using\nthe DMAIC model is that when\n\n72\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.720\nyou get to this part where you're\nbuilding your project plan and\n\n73\n00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.070\nyou're creating your baseline,\nyou have so much information that you're,\n\n74\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.140\nYou're gonna be pretty close\nto your baseline, right.\n\n75\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.140\nSo, now the next thing that happens\nis I actually execute the plan, so\n\n76\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.390\nquite a lot of things are happening\nin the improve phase of this model.\n\n77\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.500\nSo, I'm actually gonna implement and\nroll out the plan.\n\n78\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.830\nNow, I stay in improve until\nan improvement is made.\n\n79\n00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.620\nThe way I know an improvement\nis made is that I take the after\n\n80\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.350\npicture that I've created Created by\nimprovement and I look back at my picture\n\n81\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.200\nthat I created in measure and I compare\nmy after picture to my before picture.\n\n82\n00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.750\nNow, I'm not really dead, and\nI know this isn't proper english, but\n\n83\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.760\nafter I roll this out and\nI notice and improvement or\n\n84\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.870\nI'm starting towards improvement, me and\nmy project plan can move over to control.\n\n85\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.990\nNow, there's still tons of things\nI'm gonna do in control to close\n\n86\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.660\nout my project.\n\n87\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.577\nMy project isn't over.\n\n88\n00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:16.170\nBut I get to,\n[INAUDIBLE] Even prove when I can\n\n89\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.680\nhonestly say an improvement's been made.\n\n90\n00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.610\nSo, if I use, balance scorecard,\nand I assigned a, and\n\n91\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.510\nI looked at certain conditions, and\nmaybe I assigned myself a grade.\n\n92\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.700\nIt's usually articulated in a number, but\nlet's say I assign that the way I handle\n\n93\n00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.670\ncustomer complaints on a scale from one\nto five, let's say I gave myself a three.\n\n94\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.410\nAfter I rolled out my process improvement\nsolution I'm going to give myself a four.\n\n95\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.140\nWell, that would indicate that I did make\nsome sort of process improvement and\n\n96\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.990\nthat would allow me to go over in control.\n\n97\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.660\nSo, now I want to go back and we're\ngoing to talk about a couple of tools.\n\n98\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.750\nI list my three to five solutions.\n\n99\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.270\nOne of the things that I want to be aware\n\n100\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.020\nof is that my boss is probably going\nto say which one would you choose.\n\n101\n00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.910\nNow, I want them to pick a solution.\n\n102\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.340\nAnd why do I want them to pick one?\n\n103\n00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.623\n>> Accountability?\n\n104\n00:06:11.623 --> 00:06:12.279\n>> Yeah.\n\n105\n00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Accountability.\n\n106\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.410\nI want their buy-in.\n\n107\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.690\nI want to make sure they've got some They\nhave some confidence in that solution.\n\n108\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.420\nAnd this gets really challenging.\n\n109\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.630\nAfter you've had a couple of really\nsuccessful projects people will start\n\n110\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.530\nsaying, well,\nyou picked the one that you like best.\n\n111\n00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.140\nNow, the other thing that\nmakes this a little bit\n\n112\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.260\ndifficult is that sometimes they're\nnot going to agree with you and\n\n113\n00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.170\nthey're not going to pick the solution but\nthey are going to ask you.\n\n114\n00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.800\nAnd so\nwe're going to look at a couple of tools\n\n115\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.490\nthat we can use if we don't have a good\nidea why we picked one over the other.\n\n116\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.100\nIt doesn't really do good for\n\n117\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100\nyour credibility if you say well all\nthree of these or all five of these.\n\n118\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.730\nI like all of them.\nNow,\n\n119\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.410\nsometimes you're automatically going to\nknow which one to say that you like best,\n\n120\n00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.180\neven though they might not pick this\nBecause when you were in analog,\n\n121\n00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.160\nyou looked at some things.\n\n122\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.540\nLike, perhaps you found out in define or\nin measure\n\n123\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.350\nthat they wanted to do anything as long\nas it didn't mean hiring an extra person.\n\n124\n00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.600\nSo, you already know that, right.\n\n125\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.060\nSo, you might say something\nabout your solution.\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.960\nWell, I pick solution one because\nwe had existing resources.\n\n127\n00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.330\nYou might have found out something.\n\n128\n00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.570\nBeing about the budget when you were\ndefining and measuring and analyzing, and\n\n129\n00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.570\nyou might use that.\n\n130\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.180\nThey might have told you something like,\n\n131\n00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.000\nwe're not gonna do any\nsolutions unless they're green,\n\n132\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.670\nunless they're environmental friendly,\nso you might be able to use that.\n\n133\n00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.800\nYou might be able to say,\n\n134\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.270\nI pick solution number one because it's\nthe most environmentally friendly.\n\n135\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.280\nBut in some cases you're at a loss, so\n\n136\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.390\nwe're gonna talk a little bit, we'll look\nat a tool that you're Probably already\n\n137\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.880\nfamiliar with to kinda help\nus reason through which one.\n\n138\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.210\nSo I list my three to five solutions, and\n\n139\n00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.720\nI'm gonna probably be ready to answer\nthat question, which one would I pick.\n\n140\n00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.850\nAnd I'm gonna gain consensus.\n\n141\n00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.610\nNow, this is really simple if\nI'm only working for one person.\n\n142\n00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.170\nI send them an email.\n\n143\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.160\nThey send me an email back.\n\n144\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.290\nBut it can also be a very complicated\nprocess if you're talking to\n\n145\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.120\na steering committee.\n\n146\n00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.920\nOr that's really ultimately deciding\nwhich direction you're gonna go.\n\n147\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.850\nAny kind of evaluation panel,\n\n148\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.360\nsometimes there could be compliance\nissues involved, and other people.\n\n149\n00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.250\nAnd so\nyou might have to go about developing, or\n\n150\n00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.860\nusing, I should say,\nsome consensus gathering tools.\n\n151\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.620\nSo, if you have a lot of solutions,\nlet's say you have five solutions,\n\n152\n00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.030\ncuz you're You're shooting for\nthree to five.\n\n153\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.920\nLet's say you have five solutions and\n\n154\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.560\nyou have ten people in the room that\nare trying to make this decision.\n\n155\n00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.290\nYou might go about listing\nall five solutions and\n\n156\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:51.230\ntelling the people in the room\neveryone can choose three.\n\n157\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.030\nAnd then maybe one or\ntwo will just naturally fall off, right,\n\n158\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.730\nand then you could narrow it down and\nsay pick two then pick one.\n\n159\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.150\nSo, that's an example of\na consensus gathering tool.\n\n160\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:06.240\nAnd there's an Number of consensus\ngathering tools that you could use.\n\n161\n00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.770\nAnd some of those are part of the Lean\nSix Sigma kind of philosophy or body of\n\n162\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:16.640\nknowledge, and some of them are just\nones that you can find on the Internet.\n\n163\n00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.190\nSo, once you gain consensus,\nit gets kind of tricky,\n\n164\n00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.340\nbecause Lean Six Sigma says\nyou have to do a pilot.\n\n165\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.090\nAnd a formal pilot, sometimes it's\nhard to get buy in on a formal pilot\n\n166\n00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.490\nBecause people just want\nyou to get it done.\n\n167\n00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.630\nOr you don't have the money\nto do a formal pilot.\n\n168\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.169\nSo, what you want to think about\nis what is the idea of a pilot?\n\n169\n00:09:35.169 --> 00:09:38.072\nWhy do you do a pilot in the first place?\n\n170\n00:09:38.072 --> 00:09:40.347\nDon, why would you do\na pilot in the first place?\n\n171\n00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.905\n>> Sometimes you're unsure of whether\nthe solution is actually going to\n\n172\n00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:45.503\nimprove anything, and so you don't\nwant to roll it out wide-scale and\n\n173\n00:09:45.503 --> 00:09:46.560\naffect all of your systems.\n\n174\n00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.120\nYou might want to do it on a small scale\nso you can measure the improvement.\n\n175\n00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.110\nDetermine whether your plan is\nactually coming to fruition.\n\n176\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.060\nIf you have ten automotive factories,\nyou might retrofit just\n\n177\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.290\none of those factories as a test and that\nway if it doesn't work you're exposure or\n\n178\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.090\nyour impact is a lot smaller,\nyour wasted effort.\n\n179\n00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.400\nIf you succeed, well you just\nroll it out to the other nine.\n\n180\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.820\nIt helps minimize that\nrisk of implementation.\n\n181\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.220\n>> Exactly, and in a perfect world they'd\njust let us do a pilot, but sometimes, as\n\n182\n00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.800\nI mentioned, they don't and so we'd have\nto think about why we're doing that pilot.\n\n183\n00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.690\nAnd so there's some other ways,\nthere's some other things that we can use.\n\n184\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.940\nFor example,\nmaybe we could do a simulation.\n\n185\n00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.710\nIn some environments I called it\na focus group instead of a pilot and\n\n186\n00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.360\nsometimes that buys me a little time and\nI get to do a pilot.\n\n187\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.190\nAnother method is you could roll it out\nincrementally because you're basically\n\n188\n00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.160\nstill doing a pilot.\n\n189\n00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.610\nSo, I guess the point is\nis that if you can't pilot,\n\n190\n00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.250\nif you can't really have a physical\nhigh profile pilot for whatever reason,\n\n191\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.770\nyou just wanna think of other\nways that you could test it out.\n\n192\n00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.360\nThis is where I believe that our\nassociations come in really handy,\n\n193\n00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.350\nin the quality world that\nis generally the American.\n\n194\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:11.670\nDeciding the quality, but it could also\nbe the project management institute, PMI,\n\n195\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.570\nand so what you could do is you could go\nand bounce this idea off people in other\n\n196\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.120\ncompanies that your association like it\nat a round table or something like that.\n\n197\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.110\nSo, I found that to be a really\ngreat way to pilot an idea.\n\n198\n00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.130\nYou could watch a company\nthat's done it before.\n\n199\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.360\nYou could read case studies, but\n\n200\n00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.620\nanyway you don't Don't really wanna\nmove forward without piloting.\n\n201\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.840\nNow, the beauty of the DMAIC model,\nis that if I pilot something,\n\n202\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.550\nand it goes awry, or it doesn't work, or\nit doesn't set well with the employees,\n\n203\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:47.715\nI just go back up to my list of three to\nfive solutions and I I pick another one.\n\n204\n00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:51.565\nI'm not going to my boss going well,\nit's back to the drawing board.\n\n205\n00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:53.624\nI've got a whole host of other\nthings that I could try.\n\n206\n00:11:53.624 --> 00:11:57.976\nIn this scenario we're gonna say that\nit went perfect, it was awesome, and\n\n207\n00:11:57.976 --> 00:11:59.885\nwe can go ahead and move forward.\n\n208\n00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:03.786\nAnd this is where we start\ncreating our project plan.\n\n209\n00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:07.940\nThe reason we pilot is because we're\ntrying to do mistake proofing, and\n\n210\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.310\nremember in the lean world, it's got\nthat kind of funny name, poke a joke.\n\n211\n00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.719\nBut we're trying to mistake proof,\nso that's one thing, but\n\n212\n00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:20.154\nwhen we get to the project plan, we want\nto mistake proof our project plan as well,\n\n213\n00:12:20.154 --> 00:12:23.400\nand there's a couple of different\nways that we can do that.\n\n214\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.672\nOne simple way that I do my project\nplans is I stamp draft all over it,\n\n215\n00:12:28.672 --> 00:12:31.980\nor I put draft in the watermark.\n\n216\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.168\nAnd then I pass it out to\nanybody that cares, and\n\n217\n00:12:34.168 --> 00:12:37.780\nthen that way if they come running into\nmy office and say, that can't be done,\n\n218\n00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.100\nI can say,\nwell that's why it says it's a draft.\n\n219\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.860\nThat's a simple way you could\nmistake proof your project plan.\n\n220\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:48.323\nWe have a tool that we're gonna look at\nin a little bit called FMEA Thinking,\n\n221\n00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:52.370\nwhich stands for Failure Mode Effect\nAnalysis, which can be used for\n\n222\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.910\na number of things, but it can be used\nto mistake proof your project plan.\n\n223\n00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.358\nSo just because you're\nbuilding a project plan,\n\n224\n00:13:00.358 --> 00:13:03.570\nyou wanna make sure that\nyou mistake proof it.\n\n225\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.225\nNow, another thing that helps your\nproject plan is if you took the time, and\n\n226\n00:13:08.225 --> 00:13:12.240\nthis is the preferred way,\nto do it in work break down structure.\n\n227\n00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.478\nThe more you break down your pieces of\ninformation, the more likely you are to\n\n228\n00:13:17.478 --> 00:13:21.944\nlook at each single piece of information\nand say to yourself, okay how long is that\n\n229\n00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:25.790\ngonna take, how much is that gonna cost,\nwhat resources are needed?\n\n230\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:29.335\nAnd so that's kind of another way to\nmistake proof your project plan and\n\n231\n00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:31.120\ncome up with an accurate baseline.\n\n232\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.452\nNow, when you're looking at each item\non your work breakdown structure and\n\n233\n00:13:35.452 --> 00:13:38.970\nyou're looking at cost or\nwhat you think it's going to cost,\n\n234\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.708\nyou can just add up all of that to\ncome up with your baseline right?\n\n235\n00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:48.280\nBut then there's some\nspecial challenges with time.\n\n236\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.369\nWhen I say a certain task\nwill take a certain amount of\n\n237\n00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:54.947\ntime because a lot of tasks\nare going to be working in tandem,\n\n238\n00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:59.600\nthere are things that might have to\nhappen before other tasks happen, right?\n\n239\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.956\nSo time gets a little bit trickier,\nbut basically,\n\n240\n00:14:02.956 --> 00:14:08.730\nyour work breakdown structure also helps\nyou mistake proof your project plan.\n\n241\n00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:14.570\nAnd then as mentioned,\nI implement the solution per the plan,\n\n242\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:20.590\nand I just kinda hang out and approve\nuntil I have a process improvement.\n\n243\n00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:25.084\nAnd remember, I look at the picture that I\ncreated in measure against the picture I\n\n244\n00:14:25.084 --> 00:14:27.169\ncreated when I implement my plan, and\n\n245\n00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:31.490\neven though my project isn't completely\nover yet, I can go to the next phase.\n\n246\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.944\nSo sticking in the improve phase,\none of the things that we mentioned, and\n\n247\n00:14:35.944 --> 00:14:39.780\nthis is something you might be\nfamiliar with, A SWOT analysis.\n\n248\n00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.608\nIn your sample file you have a template\nfor the SWOT analysis that gives you a lot\n\n249\n00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:47.437\nof different ideas for words for strengths\nand weakness and opportunities and\n\n250\n00:14:47.437 --> 00:14:50.530\nthreats in case you don't want\nto use those particular words.\n\n251\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.591\nBut we had said earlier that if I\nhad three to five solutions, and\n\n252\n00:14:55.591 --> 00:15:01.527\nmaybe I don't have one that just sticks\nout in my mind as being the best one.\n\n253\n00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:05.223\nOne way I can look at it is I could\nrun it through a SWOT analysis, and\n\n254\n00:15:05.223 --> 00:15:07.071\nso I would basically be looking,\n\n255\n00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.042\nI think I have a little bit different\ntemplate here that you can look at.\n\n256\n00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:14.285\nThe template on the sample file,\nas I said,\n\n257\n00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:20.350\nhas a number of different words that you\ncould use if you don't like the word SWOT.\n\n258\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.943\nThe reason why you might do that is when\nyou're working in international countries,\n\n259\n00:15:24.943 --> 00:15:27.432\nthese words aren't always\nas transferable so\n\n260\n00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:29.750\nyou might wanna use a different word, so.\n\n261\n00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.295\nSo I would look at my three solutions,\nand at this point, three to five, but\n\n262\n00:15:34.295 --> 00:15:36.155\nwe'll say we only have three.\n\n263\n00:15:36.155 --> 00:15:40.079\nAnd right now I'm kinda thinking,\nhey they're all equal, so\n\n264\n00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:44.910\nwhat I might do is I might say, what is\nthe strength of this solution, right?\n\n265\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.220\nAnd then I would look, and\nwanna kinda think of that as pro.\n\n266\n00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.496\nAnd I know a lot of you have worked\nwith SWOT analysis before, but\n\n267\n00:15:52.496 --> 00:15:56.390\nLean Six Sigma has a tiny difference,\na little bit of a different spin on it.\n\n268\n00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.026\nSo I would look at all the pros for\nthat solution and\n\n269\n00:16:00.026 --> 00:16:05.250\nthen all the weaknesses, and\nthat would be all the negative things.\n\n270\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.730\nNow an interesting thing\nabout this is that for\n\n271\n00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.250\nyears those top two pros and cons,\nit's called a force field analysis, and\n\n272\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.780\nthis is how we made go, no go decision.\n\n273\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.268\nIf the good things outweighed the bad\nthings, then we went with it.\n\n274\n00:16:19.268 --> 00:16:24.556\nIf the bad things outweigh the good\nthings, then we made a no go decision.\n\n275\n00:16:24.556 --> 00:16:27.112\nAnd then somewhere along the line, and\n\n276\n00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:31.294\nno one really knows who actually\ncreated the SWOT analysis, but\n\n277\n00:16:31.294 --> 00:16:36.190\nsomewhere by the 1960s we were using\nSWOT analysis on a regular basis.\n\n278\n00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.698\nBut we were adding things,\nyou could have a number of weaknesses, but\n\n279\n00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:43.384\nthe opportunities, and that means\nthings that could happen, could be so\n\n280\n00:16:43.384 --> 00:16:46.070\ncool that maybe you would go ahead and\ntake that risk.\n\n281\n00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.809\nAnd the same thing, there might be\na lot of strengths but the threats,\n\n282\n00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:56.920\nwhich is just another way of saying risks,\nmight just completely outweigh that.\n\n283\n00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.800\nSo, just quickly I just want to do, and\nlike I said, I know a lot of you have\n\n284\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.930\nbeen exposed to this particular tool but\nI want to mention a couple of other things\n\n285\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.181\nabout it so I just quickly\nwanna run through an exercise.\n\n286\n00:17:10.181 --> 00:17:12.252\nAnd actually we can even use\nthe exercise as our example,\n\n287\n00:17:12.252 --> 00:17:13.763\nif I wanted to start an exercise program,\n\n288\n00:17:13.763 --> 00:17:16.290\nwhat are some of the strengths that\nyou can think about doing that on?\n\n289\n00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.529\n>> Well if you're starting a program,\n\n290\n00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:22.730\nthe strength of it is you're going\nto be making yourself healthier.\n\n291\n00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.440\n>> Okay, good.\n\n292\n00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.975\n>> And that means that after you start it,\nthe more you do it, the easier it becomes,\n\n293\n00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:33.970\nand it kinda self perpetuates at that\npoint, that'd be a strength of it.\n\n294\n00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.114\n>> Okay, good, so\nif you had to think of a weakness, and\n\n295\n00:17:36.114 --> 00:17:38.691\nkeep in mind, I mean I'm gonna\nactually take this back away from\n\n296\n00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:41.810\nyou because weaknesses almost always\nhave to do with time and money, right.\n\n297\n00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.914\n>> Yeah, they really do, and see I\nalways have a problem with weakness and\n\n298\n00:17:44.914 --> 00:17:46.590\nthreat because they're so similar.\n\n299\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.320\nBut, a weakness is something that\nwe do have some control over,\n\n300\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.660\na threat is something we\ndon't have any control over.\n\n301\n00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.590\n>> Exactly, and\nthat's a good way to keep it.\n\n302\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.846\n>> And time and money,\ncan kinda fall in both in my book.\n\n303\n00:17:56.846 --> 00:17:58.903\n>> Yeah.\n>> But usually we have some kinda control\n\n304\n00:17:58.903 --> 00:17:59.724\nover, right?\n\n305\n00:17:59.724 --> 00:18:03.732\n>> Exactly, and then what could\nmaybe be some of the opportunities?\n\n306\n00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:06.470\n>> The opportunity,\nif we're starting a workout program,\n\n307\n00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.530\nyou've got the opportunity of\nfinding one that's perfect for you,\n\n308\n00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.990\nthat's going to encourage you to do it\nmore often versus finding one that maybe\n\n309\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.505\nisn't necessarily perfect for you, then\nbecomes a struggle to do it day after day.\n\n310\n00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:19.670\n>> Exactly.\n\n311\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.175\n>> So then there's different\nlevels of opportunity depending on\n\n312\n00:18:22.175 --> 00:18:23.080\nthe program you pick.\n\n313\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.655\n>> Right, and\n\n314\n00:18:23.655 --> 00:18:27.780\nthen certainly the thread of an exercise\nprogram is that you could get hurt, right?\n\n315\n00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.758\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Now, Don brought up a good point about,\n\n316\n00:18:29.758 --> 00:18:33.277\nthat sometimes it's hard to tell\nthe difference between the strength and\n\n317\n00:18:33.277 --> 00:18:35.620\nan opportunity, and\na weakness, and a threat.\n\n318\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.400\nAnd again,\n\n319\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.510\nthis is another one of those little\nbit Six Sigma versus Lean Six Sigma.\n\n320\n00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:47.172\nIn the six sigma world as well as a lot of\npeople who formally take classes in SWOT,\n\n321\n00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:52.520\nthere are still two and three day classes\nthat you can take in SWOT analysis.\n\n322\n00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.610\nThere are some people that have worked\nwith this tool so much that they get\n\n323\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.460\nreally excitable about, no, no, that's\na strength, no, it's an opportunity!\n\n324\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.800\nNo, it's a weakness, no, it's a threat!\n\n325\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.960\nBut Lean Six Sigma looks at this\ntool just like it looks at other\n\n326\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.030\nstructured brainstorming, and\nit's a lot more forgiving.\n\n327\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.270\nIt's more about trying to\ncapture your ideas, and so\n\n328\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.770\nnow I have been with groups that were\nformally trained in SWOT, and there was so\n\n329\n00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.250\nmuch disagreement that I had to put\nit on the line and I'd have to say\n\n330\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.440\nsomething like, usually you look at this\nand it's kind of a crosshair where you've\n\n331\n00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.820\ngot four different quadrants, and I've\nliterally had to write things on the lines\n\n332\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.760\nbetween the two things just to keep\nthe peace, and just to keep people happy.\n\n333\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.310\nBut Lean says, hey,\nit's a structured brainstorming,\n\n334\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.850\nit's just used to gather your thoughts.\n\n335\n00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.085\nHowever, Lean Six Sigma also uses it\nin a couple of different ways, and\n\n336\n00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:49.760\nsince we're on the topic of SWOT,\nI'd just like to share that with you, Don.\n\n337\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.751\nFor example, if I have a super good idea,\nsomething I really, really wanna do,\n\n338\n00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:57.040\nI wanna sit down and think about\nthe strengths and the weaknesses,\n\n339\n00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.886\nthe opportunities and the threats.\n\n340\n00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:02.350\nBut where I want to sell from\nis from the opportunities,\n\n341\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.680\nbecause if I were to come home and tell\nyou, I wanna start an exercise program,\n\n342\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.150\nyou're gonna be automatically\nthinking pros, cons,\n\n343\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.050\npros, cons, because that's\nthe way our mind works, right?\n\n344\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.382\nSo if I wanna sell you on that,\nI wanna look at the opportunities, and\n\n345\n00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.490\nthat's the place I want to sell.\n\n346\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.622\nNow, I want to be ready for\nall the things that could go wrong, so\n\n347\n00:20:22.622 --> 00:20:26.103\nI look at my threat box, and those\nare the questions you might ask me, so\n\n348\n00:20:26.103 --> 00:20:28.440\nI'm going to be prepared for\nthose questions.\n\n349\n00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.661\nSo just kind of remember, and I challenge\nyou to try it sometime this week,\n\n350\n00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:37.150\nthe next time you have a really great idea\nand you want buy-in and you want people\n\n351\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.840\nto really listen to what you're trying to\nsay, go ahead and do the SWOT analysis and\n\n352\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.927\nyour sales pitch comes from opportunity,\nbut anything that you wrote in\n\n353\n00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:50.370\nin the threat box, anything that's a risk,\nyou wanna be prepared to answer.\n\n354\n00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.293\nAnother way that you can use the SWOT\nanalysis is if you're trying to give\n\n355\n00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:55.270\na presentation.\n\n356\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.469\nAnd again, you don't have to\nnecessarily say those words,\n\n357\n00:20:58.469 --> 00:21:02.180\nyou can use different words,\nyou might not even need the words at all.\n\n358\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:07.169\nBut if you're trying to present an idea,\nif you follow this particular pattern,\n\n359\n00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:12.088\nhere are the strengths, here are the\nweaknesses, here are the opportunities,\n\n360\n00:21:12.088 --> 00:21:15.950\nhere are the threats,\nthe presentation comes off very fluid.\n\n361\n00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:20.134\nAnd if you don't have a lot of time, like\nsomeone pops into the office and says,\n\n362\n00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:23.080\ndo you mind coming and\ntalking to our group for a moment?\n\n363\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.380\nThis is a really quick way\nto organize your thoughts.\n\n364\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.196\nAnd also if you're doing a written report,\n\n365\n00:21:28.196 --> 00:21:33.678\nif you're using these quadrants in that\nway, you're talking about the strengths,\n\n366\n00:21:33.678 --> 00:21:38.710\nyou're talking about the weaknesses,\nthe opportunities, and threats.\n\n367\n00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:44.250\nIf in an interviewing situation, And we\ntalked about how you can use a model like\n\n368\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:49.640\nPDCA if they throw a hypothetical question\nat you like, what would you do if?\n\n369\n00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.271\nIf someone were to say to you\nin an interviewing situation,\n\n370\n00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:53.806\nwhat do you think about this idea?\n\n371\n00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:58.158\nThis is another place, and again you\nmight not be yelling out the strength,\n\n372\n00:21:58.158 --> 00:22:01.567\nthe weakness,\nit's just a way to organize your thoughts.\n\n373\n00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:07.270\nSo we're going to move on from SWOT to\nanother thing that is a helpful tool.\n\n374\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.480\nNow, this is straight from Steve Covey,\nalthough Lean Six Sigma has\n\n375\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.440\na slightly different spin on it,\nand this is a time analysis tool.\n\n376\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.575\nNow I'm gonna explain it in terms\nof using it as a personal tool,\n\n377\n00:22:20.575 --> 00:22:26.010\nso I can explain how it can help you\nmistake proof your project plan.\n\n378\n00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:30.272\nCuz remember, in improve,\nwe've got our three to five solutions,\n\n379\n00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:33.369\nwe're getting consensus,\nwe're piloting it.\n\n380\n00:22:33.369 --> 00:22:38.250\nAnd then we're rolling out our project\nplan, and if we use this time tool,\n\n381\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.975\na lot of times it help us\nmistake proof our project plan.\n\n382\n00:22:41.975 --> 00:22:44.344\nBut first we'll use it as\na personal time tool so\n\n383\n00:22:44.344 --> 00:22:48.265\nI can show you how Lean Six Sigma sort of\nmodified it from the Steve Covey model.\n\n384\n00:22:48.265 --> 00:22:54.205\nNow in the Covey model,\nurgent not important and\n\n385\n00:22:54.205 --> 00:22:58.995\nnot important not urgent, the difference\nat Lean or the spin that Lean put on it,\n\n386\n00:22:58.995 --> 00:23:02.445\nis that it says that for\nthis period of time.\n\n387\n00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:06.055\nSo in the original model it's\njust kind of open ended.\n\n388\n00:23:06.055 --> 00:23:12.442\nSo, let's say I wake up one morning and\nI have tons of overwhelming tasks.\n\n389\n00:23:12.442 --> 00:23:15.641\nOne way I can organize my time on\na personal basis is I can sit down and\n\n390\n00:23:15.641 --> 00:23:18.225\nwrite down all the things\nthat are urgent important.\n\n391\n00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:23.255\nAnd if I'm just doing it for the day,\nbecause this is what Lean Six Sigma's\n\n392\n00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:28.134\nsaying, so only thing that goes in\nthe urgent important box are all\n\n393\n00:23:28.134 --> 00:23:31.565\nthe things I absolutely have to do today.\n\n394\n00:23:31.565 --> 00:23:32.411\nBefore I go to bed,\nthese are the things I have to do.\n\n395\n00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.989\nBecause those are the things\nI'm really stuck with, right?\n\n396\n00:23:34.989 --> 00:23:39.566\nIn the next box,\nwhere it says Important Not Urgent,\n\n397\n00:23:39.566 --> 00:23:43.445\nthat's the list of stuff\nI'd like to get to.\n\n398\n00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:45.941\nIn a perfect world that\neverything goes okay,\n\n399\n00:23:45.941 --> 00:23:48.379\nthat's the types of\nthings that I want to do.\n\n400\n00:23:48.379 --> 00:23:52.795\nNow, Urgent Not Important and that means\nUrgent Not Important for that day.\n\n401\n00:23:52.795 --> 00:23:54.663\nSo it could be really\nurgent to someone else.\n\n402\n00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:56.545\nSomeone else might want my time.\n\n403\n00:23:56.545 --> 00:24:00.088\nSomeone else needs me\nto fill out a form but\n\n404\n00:24:00.088 --> 00:24:04.652\nit's really not Urgent Important to me for\nthat day.\n\n405\n00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.552\nIt could be tomorrow but not that day.\n\n406\n00:24:06.552 --> 00:24:08.758\nSo that's what I'm gonna\nput in that category.\n\n407\n00:24:08.758 --> 00:24:13.637\nAnd the Not Important/Not Urgent just\nmeans if I don't, I might have to do\n\n408\n00:24:13.637 --> 00:24:18.225\nit tomorrow but if I don't get to\nit even tomorrow maybe that's okay.\n\n409\n00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:24.015\nNow in this particular model\nin personal time management,\n\n410\n00:24:24.015 --> 00:24:28.395\nhow that helps us like I said is if we\nwake up and we're just kinda overwhelmed.\n\n411\n00:24:28.395 --> 00:24:31.049\nWe can do it on a week or monthly model or\n\n412\n00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:36.645\nan annual model but\nwhen we feel like we run out of\n\n413\n00:24:36.645 --> 00:24:41.705\ntime a lot of time it's because we don't\nget to the important not urgent things.\n\n414\n00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:42.920\nWe get to the end of the day and\n\n415\n00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.415\nit's like I didn't really get\nto do anything for myself.\n\n416\n00:24:45.415 --> 00:24:49.213\nCovey points out in his original\nmodel that we have a tendency to go\n\n417\n00:24:49.213 --> 00:24:52.874\nfrom urgent important right over\nto urgent not important and so\n\n418\n00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:56.347\nwe're all of a sudden doing\nthings that don't even count.\n\n419\n00:24:56.347 --> 00:24:59.186\nWhere what we should be doing\nis urgent important and\n\n420\n00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:03.006\nthen moving to important not urgent so\nthat's kind of the structure.\n\n421\n00:25:03.006 --> 00:25:06.885\nNow, let's say I'm building my project\nplan, I already know I'm gonna use\n\n422\n00:25:06.885 --> 00:25:10.479\nwork breakdown structure because\nthat's a good way to mistake proof.\n\n423\n00:25:10.479 --> 00:25:14.877\nBut if I'm trying to get a handle on\nthings that are dependent on other things,\n\n424\n00:25:14.877 --> 00:25:19.335\nthings that absolutely have to happen\nin this project, I can use this model.\n\n425\n00:25:19.335 --> 00:25:23.425\nI can say you know what, these are the key\nthings that have to happen in the project\n\n426\n00:25:23.425 --> 00:25:25.405\nand I'm gonna put those\nunder urgent important.\n\n427\n00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:29.614\nAnd then here's some things\nthat are important, not urgent.\n\n428\n00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:33.165\nAnd that would be sort of my wish list,\nright?\n\n429\n00:25:33.165 --> 00:25:36.545\nAnd then I would move to the things\nthat are urgent, not important.\n\n430\n00:25:36.545 --> 00:25:39.995\nAnd those are the things that other people\nare telling me need to be done, right?\n\n431\n00:25:39.995 --> 00:25:43.925\nAnd I'd like to get to them, but\nthey're not gonna be my first choice.\n\n432\n00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:45.165\nThey're things that people would,\n\n433\n00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:48.745\nit's things like when people want\nme go a little out of scope or\n\n434\n00:25:48.745 --> 00:25:52.685\nthey're wanting me to come and\ndo something for their project.\n\n435\n00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:56.298\nIt's stuff I might really feel\ncommitted to but they're not,\n\n436\n00:25:56.298 --> 00:26:00.950\nthey're urgent but not important to\nthe project that I'm working on right now.\n\n437\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.249\nAnd then of course the not important,\nnot urgent,\n\n438\n00:26:04.249 --> 00:26:09.234\nare just things that I want you to kinda\nthink of those as, if I get to them there\n\n439\n00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:13.555\nare ancillary benefits but,\nif I don't get to them that's okay.\n\n440\n00:26:13.555 --> 00:26:15.415\nNow, the stuff that ends\nup in the not important,\n\n441\n00:26:15.415 --> 00:26:18.615\nnot urgent could be delighters and\nLean Six Sigma\n\n442\n00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:23.035\nlikes to do things a little bit more than\nwhat the boss or the client asked for.\n\n443\n00:26:23.035 --> 00:26:26.255\nSo, in a regular project\nwe try to stay in scope,\n\n444\n00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:31.060\ncuz if we go outside scope it's going\nto cost us more time and more money.\n\n445\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.798\nIn the Lean Six Sigma world,\nwe try to give a few delighters.\n\n446\n00:26:34.798 --> 00:26:36.585\nSo, kinda think of that\nas your delighters box.\n\n447\n00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:39.311\nIf you can do them, that'd be really\ngreat, but not to worry about them.\n\n448\n00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:43.575\nAnd then, I organize my project\naround there to make sure that my\n\n449\n00:26:43.575 --> 00:26:47.075\nUrgent Important things to get done,\nand the things that I really\n\n450\n00:26:47.075 --> 00:26:50.675\nwant to get done get done next,\nand then I don't get sidetracked.\n\n451\n00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:53.145\nSo, it's just a great way\nto mistake proof a project,\n\n452\n00:26:53.145 --> 00:26:54.975\nit's also a great way to manage your time.\n\n453\n00:26:58.957 --> 00:27:01.675\nAnd I'd like to say again,\nthese templates, and\n\n454\n00:27:01.675 --> 00:27:05.431\nyou'll notice the templates are very\nlean because all of the stuff in\n\n455\n00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:08.640\nLean Six Sigma was meant to be paper and\npencil tools.\n\n456\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.515\nBut a set of these templates\nare in your sample file just so\n\n457\n00:27:11.515 --> 00:27:12.427\nthat you have something.\n\n458\n00:27:12.427 --> 00:27:15.931\nEventually you'll get to the point\nwhere you don't need the template and\n\n459\n00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:17.355\nthat's even really better.\n\n460\n00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:23.035\nSo I have one more collateral that I would\nlike to talk about as far as mistake\n\n461\n00:27:23.035 --> 00:27:28.465\nproofing your project plan and\nthen we'll be wrapping up the improve.\n\n462\n00:27:28.465 --> 00:27:32.641\nBecause like I said, there's not a lot I\ncan teach you in improve because it's just\n\n463\n00:27:32.641 --> 00:27:34.505\na map of how to do things.\n\n464\n00:27:34.505 --> 00:27:39.259\nSo I'd like to explain\nFMEA thinking quickly.\n\n465\n00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:42.906\nThe idea is that I look at\neach task individually, and\n\n466\n00:27:42.906 --> 00:27:46.393\nthen I try to figure out\nthe potential failure, and\n\n467\n00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:51.280\nthe potential cause of the failure,\nand the current process control.\n\n468\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.375\nAnd that means, what do I have in place\nnow to make sure that that doesn't happen?\n\n469\n00:27:56.515 --> 00:28:01.160\nNow, FMEA thinking is sort of\nthe inside of an FMEA form.\n\n470\n00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.341\nAnd FMEA forms are often\nused in the control phase.\n\n471\n00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:08.160\nThe thinking is sort of\nthe psychology behind the form, right?\n\n472\n00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.275\nAnd so\na form has all kinds of functions on it.\n\n473\n00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:16.852\nWhen you're doing FMEA thinking, you're\ntrying to take each thing at one time.\n\n474\n00:28:16.852 --> 00:28:20.927\nSo for example the function is,\nand sometimes it's called task,\n\n475\n00:28:20.927 --> 00:28:23.625\nyou can use a word that feels good to you.\n\n476\n00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:26.355\nThe function is nurses wash their hands.\n\n477\n00:28:26.355 --> 00:28:26.995\nNow, for\n\n478\n00:28:26.995 --> 00:28:31.145\nsome reason, the hardest part of this\nwhole thing is to remember to flip it.\n\n479\n00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:35.365\nSo the potential failure is nurses\ndon't wash their hands, right.\n\n480\n00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:39.345\nThe potential effect of the failure\ncould be nosocomial infection, and\n\n481\n00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:42.525\nthat's the infection you get\nwhen you go into a hospital, and\n\n482\n00:28:42.525 --> 00:28:47.265\nyou didn't have that infection, but\nyou were in the hospital, okay.\n\n483\n00:28:47.265 --> 00:28:49.955\nAnd there's a lot of studies that\nsay the number one reason for\n\n484\n00:28:49.955 --> 00:28:52.635\nnosocomial infection is, guess what?\n\n485\n00:28:52.635 --> 00:28:53.604\nNurses don't wash their hands.\n\n486\n00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:58.542\nNow, the potential cause of the failure,\nnot enough hand-washing stations, okay?\n\n487\n00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:02.945\nAnd in this case, if you've been into\na modern hospital then you know that there\n\n488\n00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:05.851\nare hand-washing stations every three or\nso feet.\n\n489\n00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:06.710\nRight?\n\n490\n00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.852\nWell, now when you're\nlooking at this model,\n\n491\n00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:12.925\nnotice I put a couple of\nextra things on there.\n\n492\n00:29:12.925 --> 00:29:16.865\nIt's just column one and\ntwo that can be singular.\n\n493\n00:29:16.865 --> 00:29:21.073\nSo I've got the task and the opposite of\ntask since the other three columns work\n\n494\n00:29:21.073 --> 00:29:23.127\noff the opposite of the task, right?\n\n495\n00:29:23.127 --> 00:29:26.870\nBut the potential effect of the failure,\ncause of the failure, and\n\n496\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.705\ncurrent process control can be multiple,\nright?\n\n497\n00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:33.365\nIf I were using this FMEA\nthinking process in define,\n\n498\n00:29:33.365 --> 00:29:38.545\nand let's say identified a function and\nthe potential failure.\n\n499\n00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:41.575\nAnd the effect and\nthe cause of the failure,\n\n500\n00:29:41.575 --> 00:29:43.725\nand there was nothing in that\nprocess improvement box,\n\n501\n00:29:43.725 --> 00:29:47.255\nguess what, that's an automatic\nopportunity to do a process improvement.\n\n502\n00:29:47.255 --> 00:29:49.935\nBut sometimes,\nthere's not enough stuff in that box.\n\n503\n00:29:49.935 --> 00:29:55.875\nWhen you consider that a person could die,\nyou can just have an infected finger,\n\n504\n00:29:55.875 --> 00:30:00.435\nbut you could also die from a nosocomial\ninfection, that's pretty severe, right?\n\n505\n00:30:00.435 --> 00:30:05.155\nAnd maybe the control I have,\nhand washing stations, isn't enough.\n\n506\n00:30:05.155 --> 00:30:09.165\nMaybe I need to put some other\ncontrols in place, right,\n\n507\n00:30:09.165 --> 00:30:11.075\nbased on the potential failure.\n\n508\n00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:13.152\nOkay, so you can use this even in measure,\n\n509\n00:30:13.152 --> 00:30:16.000\nbecause you could say how well\nis the control working now?\n\n510\n00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.634\nI'm sure a lot of you have been in\nsituations where there's a control in\n\n511\n00:30:19.634 --> 00:30:24.135\nplace, like this is what's gonna\nbe in place, so it doesn't happen.\n\n512\n00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:25.835\nBut nobody's paying\nattention to that control.\n\n513\n00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:26.875\nSo it could also be used there.\n\n514\n00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:31.735\nBut what I'd like to wrap up with,\nis that if you're doing a project plan,\n\n515\n00:30:31.735 --> 00:30:36.745\nbecause remember this is the first time\nyou have accountability in the model.\n\n516\n00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:39.777\nUp to this point, you're just talking and\ndrawing pretty pictures and thinking and\n\n517\n00:30:39.777 --> 00:30:40.597\nreasoning out stuff.\n\n518\n00:30:40.597 --> 00:30:45.243\nI do my project plan and another\nmethod I could use to mistake proof my\n\n519\n00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:49.644\nproject plan to move forward is I\ncould look at the key things that\n\n520\n00:30:49.644 --> 00:30:54.655\nmust happen on my project plan and\nrun them very quickly through an FMEA.\n\n521\n00:30:54.655 --> 00:30:58.325\nAnd if there isn't a control in\nplace to make sure that happens,\n\n522\n00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:00.075\nmake sure that I build that into my plan.\n\n523\n00:31:01.155 --> 00:31:04.155\n>> And just a quick question,\nI apologize if you said this, but\n\n524\n00:31:04.155 --> 00:31:06.725\nI don't think I caught\nwhat FMEA stood for.\n\n525\n00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:10.095\n>> Oh yeah,\nit's Failure Mode Effect Analysis.\n\n526\n00:31:10.095 --> 00:31:14.915\nAnd most people don't really\nremember that, and there are forms.\n\n527\n00:31:14.915 --> 00:31:17.025\nWe'll look at a form in the control model.\n\n528\n00:31:17.025 --> 00:31:20.415\nSometimes, you'll see\nforms that say P-FMEA,\n\n529\n00:31:20.415 --> 00:31:23.485\nwhich is a process failure\nmode effect analysis.\n\n530\n00:31:23.485 --> 00:31:26.625\nOr you might see E-FMEA,\nwhich is equipment.\n\n531\n00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:30.668\nAnd then every now and\nthen you'll see FMECA,\n\n532\n00:31:30.668 --> 00:31:35.644\nwhich includes a criticality\ncolumn that says, again,\n\n533\n00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:41.674\non a scale from one to ten how bad is\nthis if this really happens or not?\n\n534\n00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:42.535\n>> That's a good point.\n\n535\n00:31:43.565 --> 00:31:46.670\nI mean you gotta know the impact,\nbecause you have a possible failure,\n\n536\n00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.049\nyou have an effect that's\ngonna come as a result of it,\n\n537\n00:31:49.049 --> 00:31:52.102\nif it's not a terribly critical effect,\nwe might not worry about it,\n\n538\n00:31:52.102 --> 00:31:54.624\nversus if it is critical,\nthen we do need to deal with it.\n\n539\n00:31:54.624 --> 00:31:56.250\n>> Exactly.\n\n540\n00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.729\n>> Excellent, well, you know, we got\na chance to see quite a bit in here,\n\n541\n00:32:00.729 --> 00:32:04.163\nwe got to see SWOT,\nwe saw time analysis, we saw FMEA,\n\n542\n00:32:04.163 --> 00:32:06.551\nso a lot of good things there as we go and\n\n543\n00:32:06.551 --> 00:32:11.665\nwe implement whatever our solution happens\nto be to try and improve our process.\n\n544\n00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:14.052\nIs there anywhere else we need to\ngo on the improvement phase, or\n\n545\n00:32:14.052 --> 00:32:14.948\nis that pretty much it?\n\n546\n00:32:14.948 --> 00:32:16.876\n>> I think that's pretty much it, and\n\n547\n00:32:16.876 --> 00:32:20.860\nthe only thing we have to keep in mind\nis if you were doing the DMAIC report,\n\n548\n00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:24.996\nyou're doing a full blown report,\nyou literally have to follow each step.\n\n549\n00:32:24.996 --> 00:32:28.864\nThere's lots of flexibility in\nthe other phases, but in order for it\n\n550\n00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:33.695\nto be a legitimate Lean Six Sigma report,\nyou really have to follow those steps.\n\n551\n00:32:33.695 --> 00:32:36.215\n>> All right, well we do still\nhave one more phase to get\n\n552\n00:32:36.215 --> 00:32:38.845\nthrough in the DMAIC model,\nthe control phase.\n\n553\n00:32:38.845 --> 00:32:42.175\nSo we're going to tackle that one next,\nbut we're out of time for this episode.\n\n554\n00:32:42.175 --> 00:32:44.162\nSo we'll wrap this one up right here.\n\n555\n00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:47.155\nDefinitely stay tuned as we wrap up\nthe model and move in to some of the other\n\n556\n00:32:47.155 --> 00:32:49.925\nremaining topics before we wrap up\nour whole yellow belt training.\n\n557\n00:32:49.925 --> 00:32:51.307\nSo all coming down the line.\n\n558\n00:32:51.307 --> 00:32:52.561\nWe definitely hope to see you then.\n\n559\n00:32:52.561 --> 00:32:56.043\nBut for now, signing off for\nIT Pro TV I'm Don Pisette.\n\n560\n00:32:56.043 --> 00:32:57.285\n>> And I'm Doctor Stern.\n\n561\n00:32:57.285 --> 00:32:58.922\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n562\n00:32:58.922 --> 00:33:06.330\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:10.320\nWelcome back to another\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.860\nI'm you host Don Pizzette, back again\nwith another episode of Lean Six Sigma,\n\n5\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.010\nand this episode we're\ngonna be winding down,\n\n6\n00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.000\nthe domaic model as we get to that\nfinal phase, the control phase.\n\n7\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.620\nWe've gone through our define, and\nmeasure, our analyze, our improve.\n\n8\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.840\nAnd now, we're ready to kinda\nwind this whole thing down, and\n\n9\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.070\nsee where we go from there.\n\n10\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.660\nAnd so, back on the show with us\nwe've got Doctor Stern here, and\n\n11\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.730\nshe's gonna help us kinda see, what's\nnecessary as a part of that control phase,\n\n12\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.230\nand kinda walk through there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.130\nSo, Doctor Stern where do we start?\n\n14\n00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.210\nWell, I have a slide about what\nwe're gonna do in the control phase.\n\n15\n00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.460\nAnd I'd like to point out that\ncontrol is a lot like improve.\n\n16\n00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.060\nIt's not as long.\n\n17\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.080\nIt's only gonna take me\na short period of time\n\n18\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.530\nto make sure that you\nhave the gist of control.\n\n19\n00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.770\nBut control, similar to improve,\nis a map, and\n\n20\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.680\nwe have to do it in the correct order,\nand the correct way.\n\n21\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.140\nNot a lot of flexibility.\n\n22\n00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.870\n>> Alright, so basically\n>> We've implemented our improve,\n\n23\n00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.190\nwe know we've achieved what we want.\n\n24\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.310\nAnd now, we have effectively like\na checklist that we run through, to-\n\n25\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.430\n>> Kind of similar.\n\n26\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.580\nOne of the things that we\nwant to think about is,\n\n27\n00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.140\nwe might, when we get to control, we could\nbe almost finished or completely finished.\n\n28\n00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.910\nBut sometimes we still have other things\nthat we need to do in our project.\n\n29\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.800\nSo, the moment we notice that we have made\nan improvement, it doesn't somehow we\n\n30\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.210\ndon't have to realize the entire\nimprovement, but the moment we know that\n\n31\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.190\nwe've made an improvement, that's when\nwe can move over to the control phase.\n\n32\n00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.310\nThe very first thing that happens is\nthat we have to articulate the benefit.\n\n33\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240\nWhat I mean by that is that\nwhen we were in improve and\n\n34\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.740\nwe compared that after picture\nto the before picture,\n\n35\n00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.480\nwe're going to have to tell\nthe person that we're working for.\n\n36\n00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.710\nWhy they care.\nSo, if we use a financial metric,\n\n37\n00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.970\nit's sort of downhill.\n\n38\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.440\nSo, if I use return on\ninvestment in measure,\n\n39\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.530\nand then, and let's say in improve,\n\n40\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.740\nI was able to show that we now have\na better return on investment, right?\n\n41\n00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.300\nThat's not as hard to\narticulate at this point.\n\n42\n00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100\nHowever, if I said hey, we were\nthree-sigma when this happened, and\n\n43\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.810\nnow, I'm at the end of the improve,\nand we're four More sigma, and\n\n44\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.790\nthat's an amazing improvement.\n\n45\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.380\nI'm still going to have to say in dollars,\nand\n\n46\n00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.710\ncents what did I make you,\nsave you or avoid you spending.\n\n47\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.690\nRIght?\nNow, keep in mind the other\n\n48\n00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500\nchallenge is that if I went after\nthe process to make it better then,\n\n49\n00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.970\nthat means that cost you money.\n\n50\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.100\nSo, when I'm in the control phase, and\n\n51\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.050\nI'm explaining how much the improvement\ncosts because I made It better then,\n\n52\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.390\nI need to balance that out with something\ncalled the cost of poor quality.\n\n53\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.180\nAnd what that means is what would have\nbeen the cost if we didn't do it?\n\n54\n00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.750\nSo, that kind of helps us,\nthat make saver, avoid spending.\n\n55\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.000\nFaster a lot of times is really\neasy because there's only one\n\n56\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.200\nway to make things faster.\n\n57\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.450\nWe talked about that\nearlier in the program.\n\n58\n00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.580\nIf my employer, my boss, or my client\nwants me to make something faster.\n\n59\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.480\nI create a process map of\nthe existing process, and\n\n60\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.600\nI try to figure out what process\nI can eliminate or combine.\n\n61\n00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.580\nAnd a lot of times,\nhow that makes it a little easier for\n\n62\n00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.490\nme is whatever box I took off\nthe process map, I can say how much does\n\n63\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.810\nthat box cost, like, say, in labor,\nfacility cost, equipment, extra supplies.\n\n64\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680\nSo then, I have that statement I made,\nsaved, or\n\n65\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.060\navoided you spending that dollars.\n\n66\n00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.870\nAnd then,\nof course if I use something again,\n\n67\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.570\nlike maybe I decide to use\nbalance scorecard, and\n\n68\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.710\nI can show you that because\nscore cards are really,\n\n69\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.570\neven though they're done in percentages,\nI'm basically giving myself a grade.\n\n70\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.990\nSo, I may have given myself a grade\nin customer service of a c ,and now,\n\n71\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.660\nthat I'm finished and improved, I'm giving\nmyself an a A or A plus I still have to\n\n72\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.330\ntell you what that means to you\nin dollars and cents, right?\n\n73\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.110\nSo, sometimes that can get a little\ntricky, so I open my control phase of\n\n74\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.220\nmy report with a statement that says this\nis what I made, saved, or voided spending.\n\n75\n00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.230\nNow, the only flexibility that you have\nin the control phase is that if you're in\n\n76\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.530\na lean six sigma environment\nthis is not necessarily true\n\n77\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.920\nin the six sigma environment.\n\n78\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.430\nIf I'm working with people that\nunderstand what my department does,\n\n79\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.720\nI don't have to give you a lot of history.\n\n80\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.450\nBut if this reports is going to be\ngiven to let's say, my bosses boss,\n\n81\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.420\nI might end that first paragraph\nwhere I'm articulating the benefits.\n\n82\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.960\nI may take time to say,\nthis is what my department does,\n\n83\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.910\nthis is what we set out to do,\nthis is what we accomplished.\n\n84\n00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.050\nIs why.\nSo, sort of a mini executive summary.\n\n85\n00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.960\nBut it just depends on who it is\nI'm handing that report off to.\n\n86\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.570\nSo, that's the first part.\n\n87\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.680\nThe middle part of the report,\nwhat I want to do,\n\n88\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.240\nis I want to explain to you how to keep\nthat process improvement in place.\n\n89\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.850\nAnd again, in the Leensick Sigmund\nenvironment they're very, very sensible.\n\n90\n00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.270\nAnd they're gonna say things like well,\n\n91\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.190\nif I'm handing this to a peer, I might not\nhave to give you all the instructions.\n\n92\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.960\nI might be able to give you\na couple of bullet points, and\n\n93\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.300\nyou'll be able to keep\nthis process in place.\n\n94\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.350\nBut let's say I'm the IT person,\nand I'm handing\n\n95\n00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.440\nthis project off to the office manager\nwho doesn't have a lot of IT experience.\n\n96\n00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.330\nMy process improvement might\neven include a training manual.\n\n97\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.850\nIt might include a cheat sheet of\nwhich buttons Buttons to push.\n\n98\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.010\nSo, the idea is the middle\npart of the report\n\n99\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.790\nI'm going to tell you how do you keep this\nawesome process improvement in place.\n\n100\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.970\nHow are you going to do that?\n\n101\n00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.420\nAnd then, the bottom part of the report is\njust like closing out a regular project.\n\n102\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.260\nI need to let people know that we're\ndone doing the process improvement,\n\n103\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.500\nthat we've moved into\nthe continuous improvement phase.\n\n104\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.650\nAnd sometimes,\nagain we've talked about this in a,\n\n105\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.060\na lot of phases that sometimes that is\nwhere my side pot comes back into play,\n\n106\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.260\nbecause I might want to look through my\nside pot, or my stakeholders analysis\n\n107\n00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.180\njust to make sure that everyone knows that\nwe've moved into the second phase, or that\n\n108\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.360\nwe've moved into the continuous process,\ncontinuous improvement phase, sorry.\n\n109\n00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.280\nIt's like fighting to get\nto the end of control.\n\n110\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.100\nThere's tools that can\nkind of help us do that.\n\n111\n00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.540\nI do also want to point out though,\nsomething I forgot to say is\n\n112\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.220\nin the close-out part a lot of times\nthat's where we update our SOP's or\n\n113\n00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.750\nStandard Operating Procedures.\n\n114\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.320\nIf you are working in an ISO environment\na lot of times we call those QMS or\n\n115\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.790\nQuality Management Systems documents.\n\n116\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:04.210\nBut even though most literature\nwill say that in control,\n\n117\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.950\nthat that's where we do that.\n\n118\n00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.790\nIf there's anything that you might\nneed to do before you can roll your\n\n119\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.930\nproject out you might want to\nthink about that in define.\n\n120\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.570\nIf there's a standard operating procedure\nthat needs to be changed before you can do\n\n121\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.510\nyour roll out, you might be\nfinishing that up in control, and\n\n122\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.360\ndocumenting it, but you certainly want to\nbe thinking about that in define hands.\n\n123\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.480\nAnd then, we close out the project.\n\n124\n00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.870\nSo, the key tools that are used is,\nreturn on investment formulas, or\n\n125\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.910\ncost savings calculations, because\nremember, the first paragraph in our\n\n126\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.360\ncontrol report is letting you know, what\nwe made, saved, or avoided you spending.\n\n127\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.340\nSigma calculations, those are kind of\nhelpful, if I'm trying to now figure out,\n\n128\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.590\nif I'm trying now to figure out\n\n129\n00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:56.910\nwhat I want to Sigma calculations\nare helpful, I'm sorry.\n\n130\n00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.200\n>> Well we've got approval, we did, right?\n\n131\n00:07:59.200 --> 00:07:59.710\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n132\n00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.960\n>> And\nthis is kinda the math behind it, and\n\n133\n00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.100\nit's one of those components that I\nthough it was really funny a moment ago.\n\n134\n00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.920\nWe've got to show how to maintain\nthis improvement because people will\n\n135\n00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.740\nkind of undo your work if you let them.\n\n136\n00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.750\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n137\n00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.930\n>> And you've got volumes\nof data that you work on,\n\n138\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:19.150\nlike your sigma calculations that to\na lot of your employees are meaningless.\n\n139\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.250\nAnd so, we might not know normally does\nprovide those sigma calculations but\n\n140\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.320\nwe've got to have them on record because\nwhen somebody does want to see those,\n\n141\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.900\nwe want to show that we didn't\njust make this improvement up.\n\n142\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.544\nThis is real, we've got the calculations\nhere, that's a piece of that.\n\n143\n00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:39.280\n>> Another thing we could use in\nthe control phase is our FMEA forms.\n\n144\n00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.530\nThat's failure, mode, effect, analysis.\n\n145\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.540\nWe did some FMEA thinking where\nessentially we used the middle part\n\n146\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.290\nof the form for critical thought\non what controls were in place,\n\n147\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.230\nbut there's actually\na form which is basically,\n\n148\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.310\na checklist that keeps people on target,\nwe'll look at an example of that.\n\n149\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.460\nThe main difference of the FMEA\nforms as opposed to FMEA thinking,\n\n150\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.200\nis their level of accountability.\n\n151\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.970\nSo, the people sound off on a little\n\n152\n00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.510\nbit like a responsibility\naccountability matrix.\n\n153\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.340\nThey say, hey I agree to,\nto do this improvement.\n\n154\n00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.840\nBut then, they have to sign off again,\n\n155\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.770\nto show that they actually\ndid the improvement.\n\n156\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:21.690\nAnd then, control charts which we\ncovered in our episode on analyze.\n\n157\n00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.605\nControl charts are helpful as far as\nkeeping that process improvement in place\n\n158\n00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:31.260\n,because we might tell the person, and\neven if it's ourselves who are inheriting\n\n159\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.120\nthe process improvement ongoing,\nwe might set up a control chart.\n\n160\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.370\nSo, that we know if a data\npoint goes outside the upper or\n\n161\n00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.600\nlower control limits that is a red\nflag to pull things back in.\n\n162\n00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840\nControl charts are often used\nin the control phase to do that.\n\n163\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.090\nAlso, another tool is transition plan\ntemplate because if I am going to\n\n164\n00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.090\nbe handing this process off\nto someone else to manage,\n\n165\n00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.900\nI might need to give them some\ninformation, we kind of think of it in\n\n166\n00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:06.380\nlean six sigma is sort of pretend like\nsomeone new is going to have a job.\n\n167\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.830\nAnd what kind of things would they need?\n\n168\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.360\nThey'd need to know what resources,\nwhat websites they need to go to,\n\n169\n00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.680\nwho to call if things get in trouble.\n\n170\n00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.470\nSo, a transition plan template a lot\nof times is used when an employee\n\n171\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.390\nis leaving a job, and being promoted\nto another job or leaving a company.\n\n172\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.230\nAnd they're giving information to\nthe person who's going to be handling\n\n173\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.900\ntheir job.\n\n174\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.870\nSo ,on a bit of a smaller scale,\ncuz you're just addressing the process\n\n175\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.890\nimprovement, you can use this\ntemplate to kind of go through.\n\n176\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:40.820\nAnd again, this template is\navailable in your sample files.\n\n177\n00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.760\nSo, before I show you the FMEA form which\nis just about the last thing I have to\n\n178\n00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.280\nshow you in control, I just wanna remind\nyou about the FMEA thinking process.\n\n179\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.080\nNow, the reason why I'm having\n\n180\n00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.420\nyou look at this is that FMEA\nforms are all slightly different.\n\n181\n00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.970\nIn fact, some call function a task,\nsome people call it an activity.\n\n182\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.010\nBut in the heart of any FMEA form you're\ngoing to see this function potential\n\n183\n00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:10.210\nfailure, affected the failure, cause of\nthe failure, and current process controls.\n\n184\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.930\nYou're gonna see something like\nthat in the middle of the Form.\n\n185\n00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.230\nFMEA forms are really kind\nof interesting because there\n\n186\n00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.880\nare industry standard FMEA in aerospace,\nin hospitals, for manufacturing.\n\n187\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.910\nAnd some people in aerospace, hospitals or\n\n188\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:34.080\nmanufacturing use the industry standard\nforms, and some make up their own form.\n\n189\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.010\nBut all the forms have this\nkey information in the middle.\n\n190\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.700\nA typical form will look\nsomething like this.\n\n191\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.425\nAnd I know petty busy, so I don't think I\ncan enlarge this on my PowerPoint screen,\n\n192\n00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:48.544\nso you're just gonna have to [CROSSTALK]\n[LAUGH], maybe stop the film, and\n\n193\n00:11:48.544 --> 00:11:52.350\nkind of look at this in depth, but\nyou'll have to trust me on this.\n\n194\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.188\nIt looks like there's a lot of busy\nthings on this one., but essentially,\n\n195\n00:11:57.188 --> 00:12:01.346\nyou've got the heart of the form\nthat we talked about, and then,\n\n196\n00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:05.060\ninside the categories,\nyou have things that relate to.\n\n197\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.890\nDo an RPN, a Risk Priority Number.\n\n198\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.440\nAnd if you'll remember from\nour very first session,\n\n199\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.370\nwe were saying we want sigma to go up.\n\n200\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.410\nWe want Risk Priority Number to go down.\n\n201\n00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:21.350\nA Risk Priority Number is built by\nlooking at the severity of what\n\n202\n00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:26.400\ncould happen on a scale from one to 5 or\none to 10.\n\n203\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.700\nThe occurrences, what's actually\nhappening, and then, detection, and\n\n204\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.770\ndetection means again on\na scale of one to ten,\n\n205\n00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.800\nhow likely are we to notice\nthis before it happens?\n\n206\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.480\nThat's right.\nSo, those numbers are multiplied together.\n\n207\n00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.310\nThey actually, technically could be added\ntogether but typically, they're multiplied\n\n208\n00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.810\ntogether, and you get a number, and so,\nit's another thing that you could use, and\n\n209\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:52.030\nmeasure, get your risk priority number,\nand then, if you lowered\n\n210\n00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:58.100\nyour risk priority number in a prove,\nthat that's another one of those things\n\n211\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:02.130\nthat you would still have to go into\ncontrol, and articulate dollars and cents.\n\n212\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:06.450\nBut you have a statistical backup\nthat says, hey, I lowered my RPN.\n\n213\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.180\nSo sometimes the RPN\nnumbers can be gathered\n\n214\n00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.930\nfrom this form cuz it's looking at\nseverity, occurrence and detection.\n\n215\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.910\nOne of the things that's kinda cool\n\n216\n00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.430\non the severity side is that many\nindustries already have a schedule.\n\n217\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.530\nSo, for example the EPA has already\nfigured out on a scale from one\n\n218\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.670\nto ten what's a really bad thing to\nhappen, and a good thing to happen.\n\n219\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.310\nWhich brings up another point.\n\n220\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.850\nIf you're taking these RPN numbers, you\nwant to make sure all the schedules that\n\n221\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:38.280\nyou're looking at are rating\nthings the same way.\n\n222\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.410\nYou wouldn't want to have a schedule that\nrates the worst thing as a number one, and\n\n223\n00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.410\nthe other schedule rate\nthe worst thing as a number ten.\n\n224\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:51.600\nAnd one thing that's kind of interesting\nabout these schedules, in the EPA world,\n\n225\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:58.740\nthe worst thing that can happen is a ten,\nand it used to be death.\n\n226\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.130\nAnd now, ten is injury or death.\n\n227\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.825\nBut it used to be that\ninjury was just a nine.\n\n228\n00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.763\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's fairly severe getting to death.\n\n229\n00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:11.340\n[LAUGH] I'll derail something.\n\n230\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n231\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:17.820\nAnd the other thing that theses FMEA forms\n\n232\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.270\ndo is again there's this\nlayer of accountability.\n\n233\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.040\nOnce the process control is identified,\nif there's no process control,\n\n234\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.470\nit's assigned to someone to\ncome up with a process control.\n\n235\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.680\nOnce the process control is assigned\nthen there's a monitoring process.\n\n236\n00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.520\nAnd either way, a person, a specific\nperson, and it could probably be you,\n\n237\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.720\ncuz remember sometimes when you're\ndoing [INAUDIBLE] sigma projects,\n\n238\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.740\nit's just team Dr. Stern, but\nwhoever is responsible says,\n\n239\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.750\nI am the person responsible, this is\nthe action I'm going to take, and then,\n\n240\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.430\nthey still have to kind of\nsign off as they do it.\n\n241\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.760\nA lot of you have probably\n\n242\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.420\nseen something that's kind of\nlike a fmea form in bathrooms,\n\n243\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:00.280\nwhere everyone's taking turns to sign off\nto say that the bathroom is looking clean.\n\n244\n00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.630\nSo, that last part of the fmea\nlooks a lot like that but\n\n245\n00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:08.307\nonce again the control phase of the (.)\nmodel is pretty straightforward.\n\n246\n00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:12.808\nI mean you open it up with what you did,\nand why your client or\n\n247\n00:15:12.808 --> 00:15:17.600\nboss should care, and\nyou articulate the financial benefit.\n\n248\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.460\nYou move on to say how do I\nkeep this process in place, and\n\n249\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.860\nyou go to your regular close out\nactivities, so it sounds simple.\n\n250\n00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.830\nIt takes a while to do it.\n\n251\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.420\nIf you, one of the tips that I have in\nyour control plan is that since you're\n\n252\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.740\naccountable to do a process improvement\nsustainability plan, then when you're in\n\n253\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:47.060\nanalyze, you might want to make\nthat one of your conditions.\n\n254\n00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.540\nSo, when you're coming up with\nyour three to five solutions\n\n255\n00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.450\nyou might want to start looking at is\nthis process improvement sustainable?\n\n256\n00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.650\nSo, that when you get to\nthe part of how to sustain\n\n257\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.090\nyou know that at least it's possible.\n\n258\n00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.060\n>> Excellent, and then,\n\n259\n00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.930\nonce all that's done,\nit's not that our work is completely done.\n\n260\n00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.215\nRemember, this is a cycle.\n\n261\n00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.450\nSo,we may find we made an improvement,\nwe've updated everything,\n\n262\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:10.330\nit's all in place.\n\n263\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.510\nNow, we just go back and\nsee if we can't do it all over again and\n\n264\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.020\nmake it even better.\n\n265\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.020\nBetter right?\n\n266\n00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.900\n>> That's correct.\n\n267\n00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.550\nAnd sometimes during\nthe process of working\n\n268\n00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.160\nin the domaic model I'm going to identify\nadditional things I can work on.\n\n269\n00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.371\nAnd what's kind of fun about that,\n\n270\n00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.867\nis sometimes the information that I\ngleaned, and measure and analyze,\n\n271\n00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:34.954\nnow define's gonna be different because\nI'm defining a different problem, but\n\n272\n00:16:34.954 --> 00:16:40.080\nI can use it on a repetitive basis that\ninformation, and measure, and analyze.\n\n273\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.940\nIn our control phase too it's always\nkinda nice if you came up with some\n\n274\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:44.970\nancillary benefits.\n\n275\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.440\nSo, even though you did what\nyou said you were gonna do,\n\n276\n00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.730\nand I think I mentioned this earlier\nlean six sigma calls those delighters.\n\n277\n00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.390\nI call them ancillary benefits so,\n\n278\n00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.280\nwhen you get done telling the client all\nthe wonderful things that you've done for\n\n279\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.040\nthem you might wanna say here's\nsome byproducts of what I did.\n\n280\n00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040\n>> Yeah.\n\n281\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.280\nThere's a lot of times where we get\nthose kind of unseen benefits, and\n\n282\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:08.960\nit's a nice thing.\n\n283\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.040\nI mean the flip side of that\ncan be true too though.\n\n284\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.940\nThere could be some unseen\nnegative effects, but\n\n285\n00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.590\nthat's why we do our pilot programs,\n\n286\n00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.485\nand other things to test that out before\nwe sign off on all this at the end.\n\n287\n00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:21.800\nAlright, well, I know the control\nphase is one of the shorter ones.\n\n288\n00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.460\nI think we've done a pretty\ngood run through on it.\n\n289\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.590\nIs there anything else\nwe need to add on that?\n\n290\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.830\n>> You know, just to keep in mind that\nwhen you're looking at the demaic\n\n291\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.500\nmodel as a whole.\n\n292\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.190\nWhole.\nIf you do everything you're supposed to\n\n293\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.110\ndo, and define, you're gonna have a good\nidea of what you do to add measure.\n\n294\n00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.170\nIf you do measure correctly,\nyou're gonna know what to analyze, and\n\n295\n00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.810\nif you analyze correctly you're gonna come\nup with those three to five solutions,\n\n296\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.990\nso just kind of trust the model.\n\n297\n00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:54.580\nI use the model certainly when there's\na problem, and I don't know the solution.\n\n298\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.380\nThat's It's probably\nthe number one reason.\n\n299\n00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.020\nBut sometimes I still\ngo through the model.\n\n300\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.100\nIf I'm absolutely positive I\nknow the solution because that\n\n301\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.930\ncould be the a red flag too.\n\n302\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.530\n>> Alright.\n>> Well,\n\n303\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.710\nthat's a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this one up.\n\n304\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.190\nWe got to see the final\nphase of the Demag model.\n\n305\n00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.620\nWe do still have a little more to cover\nbefore we wrap up our whole yellow\n\n306\n00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.335\nbelt training shows.\n\n307\n00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:19.815\nYou should definitely stay tuned for\nanother episode coming up next, but for\n\n308\n00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:23.300\nnow heres a pretty good thought for\nus to wrap up, so signing off for\n\n309\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.565\nITpro.tv I'm your host Dom Pizzette\n>> And I'm Dr. Stern.\n\n310\n00:18:25.565 --> 00:18:30.734\n>> And we'll see you,\n\n311\n00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:33.781\nnext time.\n\n",

evening welcome back to\nanother episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:22.840\nI'm your host Don Pezet back again with\nanother episode of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n5\n00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.180\nAnd in this episode we're going\nto be wrapping things up.\n\n6\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.340\nWe've moved through the DMAIC model,\n\n7\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.660\nwe've seen a lot of other components that\nmake up the Lean Six Sigma process and\n\n8\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.608\ngot a chance to see the methodology and\njust tons of great information.\n\n9\n00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:39.034\nNow what we want to do\nis wrap all this up.\n\n10\n00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:43.898\nA little bit of closure on buy in and\nhow you get your organization\n\n11\n00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:48.682\nto adopt the processes and\nreally make the best use out of them.\n\n12\n00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.236\nSo, we got Dr. Stern back on\nthe show with us to jump in there.\n\n13\n00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:53.488\nDr. Stern,\nwhere do we want to go with this?\n\n14\n00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.595\n>> First, I want to say that\nI would like to use this\n\n15\n00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:02.910\ntime to review the DMAIC\nmodel in kind of a fun way.\n\n16\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.332\nAnd what I mean by that is that I'm going\nto show you ways that you can gain buy in,\n\n17\n00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:11.754\nnot just for your project, just anything\nthat you're looking for in life, but\n\n18\n00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:14.868\nI'm going to use the DMAIC\nprinciples to show you that.\n\n19\n00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:19.950\nAnd I have a slide just to kind\nof remind you of DMAIC terms.\n\n20\n00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.710\nAnd here's the deal,\n\n21\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.460\nthere's a lot of different reasons why\npeople don't buy into our ideas or\n\n22\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.970\nwe get push back or people are reluctant\nin a change management situation.\n\n23\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.640\nLots of different reasons, but the top\nfive reasons that people don't buy into\n\n24\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.290\nour ideas or our projects or our thoughts\nactually map directly to the DMAIC model.\n\n25\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.520\nSo for example,\n\n26\n00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.650\nthe number one reason people don't buy\ninto our ideas is something really simple.\n\n27\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.060\nThey don't understand it.\n\n28\n00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.689\nThey don't understand the idea.\n\n29\n00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.825\nSo in the defined portion\nof the DMAIC methodology,\n\n30\n00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:04.080\nthere's all kinds of ways that we can\nget people to buy into our project.\n\n31\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.150\nA lot of tools that we could use.\n\n32\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.302\nFor example, if I feel I'm getting\nsome push back, the first thing\n\n33\n00:02:09.302 --> 00:02:12.697\nI wanna think is that maybe they just\ndon't understand what I'm doing.\n\n34\n00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:16.136\nAnd so one way I can solve that,\nis to take a step back, and\n\n35\n00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.798\nthink about those voices.\n\n36\n00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:23.086\nThink about looking through the lens of\nthe customer, the lens of the employee,\n\n37\n00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:28.009\nthe lens of the process, the lens of\nthe industry or the business, right?\n\n38\n00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:29.450\nSo that's one way.\n\n39\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.884\nSometimes putting a side pot together is\ngonna give me some ideas on how to relate\n\n40\n00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:37.925\nto people, how to explain it to\nthem in their particular language.\n\n41\n00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:41.555\nCertainly the stakeholder's analysis,\nwe said that we\n\n42\n00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:45.475\nexpanded that to kinda say how do\npeople like to be communicated with.\n\n43\n00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:49.425\nSo let's say on our stakeholder analysis,\nI've reported even on another project,\n\n44\n00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:50.715\nthat someone likes to be emailed or\n\n45\n00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:55.800\nsomeone else wants me to verbally come and\ntalk to them.\n\n46\n00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.930\nSometimes the fact that I emailed someone\nwho would prefer verbal communication,\n\n47\n00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.000\nthey're just not listening.\n\n48\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.190\nThey don't understand.\n\n49\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.090\nThey don't get what I want to do.\n\n50\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.020\nSo, one of the biggest reasons\npeople don't buy into your\n\n51\n00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.460\nidea is that they flat\ndon't understand the idea.\n\n52\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.180\nThe second biggest reason people\ndon't buy into our ideas, and\n\n53\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.820\nyou've probably heard this, they're trying\nto fix something that's not broken.\n\n54\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.280\nIt's just not broken.\n\n55\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.334\nSo what's really kind of fun is that\nthe measure phase of the DMAIC model\n\n56\n00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:29.150\nis teaching us how to give a clear\nas is picture of where we are today.\n\n57\n00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.518\nSo sometimes people just don't believe us.\n\n58\n00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:35.553\nWhen you're in the DMAIC model, sometimes\nyou get to the end of measure and\n\n59\n00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:38.830\nyou find out, you know what,\nit's not really that bad.\n\n60\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.550\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go back up and\n\n61\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.780\npick a different process improvement.\n\n62\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.552\nBut generally speaking,\nwhen we get to the end of Measure,\n\n63\n00:03:47.552 --> 00:03:52.229\nwe have a lot of proof, a lot of\ndocumentation, that shows where we are and\n\n64\n00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.281\nwhy we need to fix that problem.\n\n65\n00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.881\nAnd so Measure is filled with\nall kinds of ideas on charts and\n\n66\n00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:01.697\ngraphs that you can use,\nthat you can also use and analyze, but\n\n67\n00:04:01.697 --> 00:04:05.892\nsome of the analyze tools that we\nlooked at, you can use and measure.\n\n68\n00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:10.235\nSo, if you think people are having\na problem understanding that something's\n\n69\n00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:14.509\nbroken, you might use something simple\nlike a Prado chart, that says look,\n\n70\n00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.625\nhere's the biggest problem that we have,\nand here's the next biggest.\n\n71\n00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.385\nAnd sometimes people see it visually,\n\n72\n00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.598\nthey get over that you're trying to\nfix something that's not broken.\n\n73\n00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:28.430\nNow, it's interesting,\nthe number three reason people have\n\n74\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.580\ntrouble with buy-in,\nis that they don't understand our logic.\n\n75\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.130\nActually, you have the buy-in as far\nas they think it's a real problem, and\n\n76\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.870\nthey know it's broken.\n\n77\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.801\nBut they just can't figure out\nwhy you made that decision.\n\n78\n00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:47.270\nWhy did you go with that one\ninstead of this other decision?\n\n79\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.230\nAnd that's why in Analyze,\nwhen you're analyzing and\n\n80\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.940\nthinking about your solutions,\nif someone's made a suggestion to you.\n\n81\n00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.478\nYou definitely wanna take the time,\neven if you think it's the silliest thing\n\n82\n00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:59.958\nyou've ever heard, and\nkind of reason through that.\n\n83\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:04.231\nBecause when you get to improve,\nif someone says, well I'm surprised that\n\n84\n00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:08.904\ndidn't make the list, you're going to be\nable to have solid information on why you\n\n85\n00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:14.130\nmade the decision that you did, and why\nyou may have discounted that situation.\n\n86\n00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.602\nSo in Analyze, analyze is all about\nthinking through our logic and\n\n87\n00:05:17.602 --> 00:05:21.825\ngetting our story right, so that we can\nget to the right three to five solutions.\n\n88\n00:05:21.825 --> 00:05:25.213\nSo again, someone might even believe\nit's a problem and say, wow,\n\n89\n00:05:25.213 --> 00:05:26.510\nthis is really messed up.\n\n90\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.802\nAnd where you might lose their buy-in is\nthat they're just thinking you should have\n\n91\n00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:32.077\ndone it a different way.\n\n92\n00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:35.890\nThe number four reason that people\ndon't buy into our solutions,\n\n93\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.352\nis they don't believe they have a choice.\n\n94\n00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:42.996\nSo, people don't like it when we\nsay it's my way or the highway.\n\n95\n00:05:42.996 --> 00:05:48.871\nIn Improve, it tells us how to\npresent those three to five solutions.\n\n96\n00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:53.230\nHow to gain consensus, how to get\nthat passed on to that person, like,\n\n97\n00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.438\nhere are the three or\nfive things that I came up with.\n\n98\n00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:57.819\nWhat do you think?\n\n99\n00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.272\nBecause even when, and there are some\ntimes that you're shooting for three\n\n100\n00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:07.630\nto five solutions, but there are times\nwhere you only come up with two solutions.\n\n101\n00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.630\nWell, it's best to take\nthose two solutions and\n\n102\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.090\nunless they're mutually exclusive,\n\n103\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.250\ncreate a third decision by saying,\nor we could do both of those things.\n\n104\n00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.550\nSo coming up with three isn't\nreally as difficult as it sounds.\n\n105\n00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.080\nNow, there are times, however,\n\n106\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.940\nwhere there really is only one solution\nbecause it's a compliance-related thing.\n\n107\n00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.781\nYou still want to try to come\nup with other things to say,\n\n108\n00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:34.362\nbecause people don't like to be told\nthere's only one way to do this.\n\n109\n00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:39.327\nWe used to get something, well, we still\ndo it, we just do it computerized now.\n\n110\n00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:42.597\nIn our master black belt class,\nwe do a disk profile,\n\n111\n00:06:42.597 --> 00:06:46.980\nwhich is similar to Myers-Briggs,\nit's just not as exclusive.\n\n112\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.580\nIn the old days,\nthis particular profile that helped you\n\n113\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.880\nunderstand your personality,\nwas a manual form that could only be,\n\n114\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.670\nyou could only use a dime to\nscrape off these bubbles.\n\n115\n00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.660\nAnd the manufacturer told you be\nsure to take a bunch of dimes so\n\n116\n00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.070\nyou can scrape this off.\n\n117\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.089\nWell, I gave it to a group\nof engineers once, and\n\n118\n00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:07.275\nthey had about an hour to\ntake this particular test.\n\n119\n00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:10.767\nMost of them spent their entire\nhour trying to figure out\n\n120\n00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:15.020\nif there was something else other\nthan the dime to scratch this off.\n\n121\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.930\nSo they tried staples and paperclips.\n\n122\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.700\nSo we're that married to the idea that\nwhen someone tells us there's only one way\n\n123\n00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.290\nto do things, something psychological\nhappens in our brains where we go,\n\n124\n00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.004\nI bet there's some other way to do that,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:29.004 --> 00:07:33.570\nSo, finally of the top reasons,\nand like I said, there's many, but\n\n126\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.880\nof the top five reasons,\nthe number five reason, the fifth reason\n\n127\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.340\nis that people think it, why bother?\n\n128\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.300\nIt's just gonna go back\nto the way it was before.\n\n129\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.255\nAnd control is all about\nexplaining your sustainability.\n\n130\n00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:53.130\nAnd I'm sure you've heard\nthis many times as well.\n\n131\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.927\nI would go ahead and do the effort, but\n\n132\n00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:59.960\non Monday it's just gonna\ngo back to the same, right?\n\n133\n00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.190\nAnd sometimes our kids say why bother\ncleaning the room, or the dishes,\n\n134\n00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.030\nthey're just gonna be dirty tomorrow,\nright?\n\n135\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.144\nSo the fifth reason of the popular reasons\npeople don't buy into things is that they\n\n136\n00:08:11.144 --> 00:08:12.988\ndon't believe it's sustainable.\n\n137\n00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:16.830\nThey think it's just gonna go back,\nwhy bother putting in the effort.\n\n138\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.410\nAnd so in each phase of the debate model,\nthere are tools.\n\n139\n00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.740\nThere's tools in Define\nto help you understand or\n\n140\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.258\nget people to understand what it\nis that you're trying to explain.\n\n141\n00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:31.890\nThere's tools in Measure that\nhelp you show people the true,\n\n142\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.040\nclear as this picture.\n\n143\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.473\nThere are tools in Analyze that\nare gonna help you explain your logic.\n\n144\n00:08:38.473 --> 00:08:41.530\nThere's tools in Improve\nthat are gonna show you how\n\n145\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.350\nto present the three to five solutions and\nhow to get consensus and\n\n146\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.180\nexplain to people, make them feel\nlike they really do have the choice.\n\n147\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.120\nAnd finally there's all kinds of tools\nthat control if you think you're\n\n148\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.140\nrunning up against kind\nof a lack of motivation.\n\n149\n00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.100\nSo when you're listening to people, and\nthey're not buying into your ideas,\n\n150\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.390\nif you can kind of identify which area,\n\n151\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.680\nyou have the automatic tools\nto cover those top five.\n\n152\n00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.540\n>> And it's kind of funny because\nafter you've gotten your first two or\n\n153\n00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.340\nthree process improvement projects under\nyour belt, the buy-in becomes easy, right?\n\n154\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.266\nThey say well you've saved us money or\nhelped us avoid spending money or\n\n155\n00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:18.204\nwhatever in the past.\n\n156\n00:09:18.204 --> 00:09:20.966\nWe know you're gonna do it again,\nit's easy.\n\n157\n00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:23.578\nSo it's really just the first\ncouple of times that you do this.\n\n158\n00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:28.016\nAnd it's really, one of the parts I like\nthe most about Lean Six Sigma is that you\n\n159\n00:09:28.016 --> 00:09:32.673\ncan adopt it just yourself, and you don't\nhave to have the whole company adopt it.\n\n160\n00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:35.713\nAnd you can start implementing it\neven if you don't have that buy-in.\n\n161\n00:09:35.713 --> 00:09:39.551\nAnd as soon as people start seeing those\nresults they will say, how do you do that?\n\n162\n00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:40.758\nHow did you achieve that result?\n\n163\n00:09:40.758 --> 00:09:44.856\nAnd you say well, I'm actually\napplying this methodology, and\n\n164\n00:09:44.856 --> 00:09:47.997\nwe should consider getting\neverybody to do that.\n\n165\n00:09:47.997 --> 00:09:49.866\nIt kind of just falls all into place.\n\n166\n00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:50.411\n>> Right.\n\n167\n00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:54.699\nAnd probably the final thing that you\nwanna remember about the DMAIC model is\n\n168\n00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:58.480\nthat there are a lot of companies\nnow that formally use this model.\n\n169\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.860\nBut there's also a lot of people that just\nwant you to come into that department and\n\n170\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.823\nfix the problem.\n\n171\n00:10:03.823 --> 00:10:07.140\nAnd they may not be as\nexcited about the model.\n\n172\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.396\nThe model is really your map to\nkeep your thoughts organized and\n\n173\n00:10:11.396 --> 00:10:14.150\nto easily go from one phase to another.\n\n174\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.162\n>> Excellent, well I think once companies\nhave recognized the benefit of this,\n\n175\n00:10:18.162 --> 00:10:21.748\nthey've recognized you get that buy\nin after that you move forward and\n\n176\n00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:23.604\nyou're Lean Six Sigma all the way.\n\n177\n00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:27.168\nAnd then things continue to work\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n178\n00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:30.662\nWe continually improve as we make\nour systems better and better.\n\n179\n00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:31.985\nAll right, well.\n\n180\n00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:33.623\nWe've had quite a long run.\n\n181\n00:10:33.623 --> 00:10:37.288\nWe went through a lot of different topics,\nand a lot of different forms, and\n\n182\n00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:40.053\nthe DMAIC model, the PVCA and\nall those other good ones.\n\n183\n00:10:40.053 --> 00:10:42.187\nIt's all a part of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n184\n00:10:42.187 --> 00:10:45.056\nI think that we've pretty\nmuch moved through it all.\n\n185\n00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:46.727\nAre there any other concepts\nthat we need to hit on?\n\n186\n00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:48.526\n>> I don't think so.\n\n187\n00:10:48.526 --> 00:10:51.551\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think we've really just done a great\n\n188\n00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:55.420\njob on quickly giving the gist of\nwhat Lean Six Sigma's all about.\n\n189\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.570\n>> Excellent.\nWell I\n\n190\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.860\nknow I've enjoyed the process myself.\n\n191\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.299\nIt's a lot to take in, and this is\nreally just the introduction, right?\n\n192\n00:11:01.299 --> 00:11:02.482\nThe yellow belt.\n\n193\n00:11:02.482 --> 00:11:02.993\n>> Exactly.\n\n194\n00:11:02.993 --> 00:11:03.740\n>> We've got more to go beyond that.\n\n195\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.190\nIf you move into green belt and\nhigher, but\n\n196\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.750\nfor now this is a pretty good spot for\nus to wrap this series up.\n\n197\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.770\nSo I really hope you all enjoyed it out\nthere as much as we enjoyed filming it.\n\n198\n00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.470\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n199\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.327\n>> And I'm Dr.

lean\n\n3\n00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.810\nsix sigma yellow belt\nof course on our site.\n\n4\n00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.340\nNow for a lot of you guys, you've watched\nthe whole series from beginning to end.\n\n5\n00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.668\nWe've covered a bunch of great content.\n\n6\n00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:25.650\nA lot of methodologies and models and\nforms and tools and techniques.\n\n7\n00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.816\nAll sorts of craziness and\n\n8\n00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:29.390\nnow you're probably wondering\nwhere do I go from here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.792\nRight?\nWhat's my next step once I've watched\n\n10\n00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.451\nthe series and I've been turning\nloose on the wild so, I brought Dr.\n\n11\n00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.575\nStern back into the studio so we can kind\nof talk about that and see where to go.\n\n12\n00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:40.755\nDr. Stirling, what do you say?\n\n13\n00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.701\nAfter somebody's watched the series,\nwhat are our next moves from there.\n\n14\n00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.557\n>> Okay.\nWell, it depends on your goal and\n\n15\n00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:50.373\nif your goal is to get certified.\n\n16\n00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:57.843\nThe fastest way to do that is to go to\nmy website, which is ssbglobal.net and\n\n17\n00:00:57.843 --> 00:01:02.863\nthere you'll see instructions\non how to sign up for\n\n18\n00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:06.505\nthe Lean Six Sigma yellow belt exam.\n\n19\n00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:11.817\nNow one of the criteria to sit through\nthat exam is that you've had a certain\n\n20\n00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:17.906\namount of training in yellow belt, which\nyou have because you watched these series.\n\n21\n00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:22.040\nIt's probably gonna ask you a couple\nquestions about those types of things.\n\n22\n00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.338\nThe exam has 100 questions on it.\n\n23\n00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:25.429\nIt is timed.\n\n24\n00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.540\nIt's a nominal fee of $40 but\nit also includes a study guide and\n\n25\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.246\na cheat sheet, [LAUGH] that's hard to say.\n\n26\n00:01:32.246 --> 00:01:36.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The questions are multiple choice.\n\n27\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.750\nIt's not meant to trick you.\n\n28\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.790\nDo you have to study?\n\n29\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.470\nAbsolutely, just like you\nwould with any exam but\n\n30\n00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.840\nI think the study guide\nthat we give you and\n\n31\n00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.010\nthe cheat sheet that we give you, gives\nyou enough information to pass the test.\n\n32\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.705\n>> Yeah, and that's really important\ncuz you said it's an open book but for\n\n33\n00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.499\na lot of our viewers,\nthey just watch this show.\n\n34\n00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:56.463\n>> Exactly.\n\n35\n00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:57.113\n>> So, is it an open show?\n\n36\n00:01:57.113 --> 00:02:00.235\nWell, it would take you a long time\nto search for information that way.\n\n37\n00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.453\nSo, the study guide, you can download.\n\n38\n00:02:02.453 --> 00:02:04.508\nWhen you sign up, you'll pay the $40.\n\n39\n00:02:04.508 --> 00:02:06.790\nYou immediately get that guide,\nand it's available to you.\n\n40\n00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.110\nSo, you can jump right in and start\nstudying and then you take the exam and\n\n41\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.560\nyou have that study guide you can flip\nthrough and the cheat sheet, right?\n\n42\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.604\n>> Right.\n>> Which is hard to say.\n\n43\n00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.011\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, and\n\n44\n00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.397\nthen in the test itself there\nare a lot of different questions so\n\n45\n00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:25.281\nyou never know which questions you're\ngoing to get in your hundred but\n\n46\n00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:29.831\none of the things it's gonna ask\nyou is where do you get your formal\n\n47\n00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:35.424\nLean Six Sigma training, so you just wanna\npick the bubble that you got it here.\n\n48\n00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:37.096\nSo, that covers you there.\n\n49\n00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:41.479\nIf you pass the test with a 75% or\nmore, we contact you and\n\n50\n00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:46.770\nget your information, if you want\na hard copy of your certificate.\n\n51\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.570\nYou can always of course get a soft\ncopy but if you want one of our nice,\n\n52\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.440\npretty copies with the seal,\nwe'll be contacting you for\n\n53\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.850\nyour address and letting you know\nthat that certificate is coming.\n\n54\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000\nThat certificate comes\nwith a certificate number.\n\n55\n00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.620\nSo, you actually can\nuse it as a reference,\n\n56\n00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.800\nif you wanna put it on your resume.\n\n57\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.730\nI may have mentioned in some of the other\nepisodes that we do have some companies\n\n58\n00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.170\nthat I work with, that you have to be a\nYellow Belt to actually be considered for\n\n59\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.930\na position or for a promotion,\nso that's kind of interesting.\n\n60\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.580\n>> All right so, let's say I'm go getter,\nI'm fully bought\n\n61\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.370\ninto the Lean Six Sigma world and I hit\nmy Yellow Belt Certification and now.\n\n62\n00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.809\nI want to progress further.\n\n63\n00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.277\nI want to move on to one\nof the specialties and\n\n64\n00:03:28.277 --> 00:03:29.281\nthe more advance trainings.\n\n65\n00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:32.637\nI know the green belt it the next step up.\n\n66\n00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:33.681\nWhat's involved in that?\n\n67\n00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:35.544\nWhat's the process\npertaining to green belt?\n\n68\n00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:36.056\n>> Okay.\n\n69\n00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:40.350\nWell, step number one is that\nyou want to have a yellow belt.\n\n70\n00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.940\nI did mention that if you pass\na test with 75 percent or\n\n71\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.580\nmore you would have the yellow belt now.\n\n72\n00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.466\nIf for some reason you didn't pass that,\n\n73\n00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:53.500\nyou're able to take that test again\nat no charge in one week increments.\n\n74\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.661\nSo, we want to give you a week to study.\n\n75\n00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.161\nWhen you download the test a second\ntime it's gonna be a different set of\n\n76\n00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:00.035\nquestions.\nSame topic but\n\n77\n00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.383\nit's not gonna be the same test.\nSo,\n\n78\n00:04:02.383 --> 00:04:06.790\nlet's say you have your\nyellow belt in hand\n\n79\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.010\nthen our company offers green belt, black\nbelt, and master black belt training.\n\n80\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.040\nIf you've got an awful lot of\nexperience in process improvement and\n\n81\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.620\njust didn't realize it until you\nwatched this video and said wow,\n\n82\n00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.320\nI've done this all of my life.\n\n83\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.895\nYou could be a candidate for our green\nbelt-black belt combo workshop and\n\n84\n00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:29.217\nthat usually requires you\nsubmitting your resume but\n\n85\n00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:32.534\ntypically if you just want to sign up for\na green belt,\n\n86\n00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:36.702\nwhich would be the typical next step,\nwe do offer classes in that.\n\n87\n00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:41.479\nYou just go to our website at SSBGlobal\nand we have, sort of, all the endings.\n\n88\n00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.240\nIf you type in SSBGlobal into\nyour in your web browser,\n\n89\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.810\nyou're gonna end up at our\nsite eventually, right?\n\n90\n00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.930\nThe process for the green belt is that\nour program is a three phase program and\n\n91\n00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.820\ndifferent vendors teach it a different\nway, but the important thing if you decide\n\n92\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.050\nto go to another vendor is we're all\nworking from the same play book.\n\n93\n00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.590\nWe're all using material\nfrom ASQ about Six Sigma.\n\n94\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.950\nFrome SME's,\nSociety of Mechanical Engineer's on Lean.\n\n95\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.550\nWe've blended that together because when\nyou take the two different methodology,\n\n96\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.070\nLean and Six Sigma.\n\n97\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.360\nThey're synergies but\nthere are some things that are left out.\n\n98\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.020\nThere's some things that are simplified.\n\n99\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.880\nThere's an emphasis in a different way.\n\n100\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.480\nLean six sigma really is a whole separate\nbody of knowledge from six sigma and lean.\n\n101\n00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.190\nIt has a lot of continuity.\n\n102\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.470\nSo, all vendors are working\nessentially from that playbook.\n\n103\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.550\nThe way we structure the class\nis that it's in three phases and\n\n104\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.920\nphase one can be a live classroom or\nonline live opportunity and\n\n105\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.193\nthat's usually three days and\nthen the second\n\n106\n00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:59.070\nphase you're given a series\nof homework assignments and\n\n107\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.180\nexercises to complete, and that goes back\nto sort of like traditional education.\n\n108\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.390\nSo, you're reading a textbook but we've\nsummarized the textbook in a way that\n\n109\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.230\nmakes it simple to understand and there's\nquestions that you have to answer and\n\n110\n00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.070\nturn in, and then our instructors look to\nmake sure that you're on the right track.\n\n111\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.370\nOnce you've completed those assignments\nand generally there's five assignments.\n\n112\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.300\nIf everything's going well you\nonly have five assignments.\n\n113\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.276\nIf we kinda think you're veering off in\nanother direction you might end up with\n\n114\n00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:28.094\nanother online assignment or two.\n\n115\n00:06:28.094 --> 00:06:32.994\nOnce we feel comfortable with that\nmaterial and we're in constant\n\n116\n00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:38.254\ncontact with you online, then we set\nyou up for another open book test.\n\n117\n00:06:38.254 --> 00:06:40.042\nNow this one is a little more complicated.\n\n118\n00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:41.713\nIt's a three hour test.\n\n119\n00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.635\nIt has a lot more questions but again it's\nopen book and as long as you pass that\n\n120\n00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:52.260\ntest with a 75% or more you go on to\nthe final phase, which is phase three.\n\n121\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.600\nNow in phase three,\nyou're assigned a mentor.\n\n122\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.610\nAn actual mentor that works with you.\n\n123\n00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.280\nWe try as much as possible to find a\nmentor that's in your industry, if that's\n\n124\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.480\nthe industry you want to stay in so\nthey can relate a little better with you.\n\n125\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.560\nYou fill out a project charter and\n\n126\n00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.100\nwhen you fill out that project\ncharter your instructor says, yes,\n\n127\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.540\nI think this is a great lean sig sigma\nproject or no and here's the reason why.\n\n128\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.890\nOnce your project charter's accepted then\nto shop the project, you just submit\n\n129\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.000\na lean sig sigma report but what's kinda\nnice about it is that you have a mentor\n\n130\n00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.280\nright there and if you want to send them\nthe divine portion of your report and\n\n131\n00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.650\nget some feedback before\nyou go on to measure.\n\n132\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.180\nYou can do it that way.\n\n133\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.210\nIf you have a lot of experience\nwith the demat model or\n\n134\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.090\nyou just sort of get it intuitively,\nyou could actually submit your\n\n135\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.360\nentire project and\nthen when that project is submitted,\n\n136\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.510\nyour instructor goes through and\nmakes sure it's perfect and\n\n137\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.680\nthen they submit it to a committee and\nthe committee has four PhDs.\n\n138\n00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.980\nAnd they can't be your primary\ninstructor or your secondary instructor,\n\n139\n00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.650\nwhich is the one that\nhelped you in phase three.\n\n140\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.323\nSo, it's four independent eyes that\nlook at this Project and they say yay or\n\n141\n00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:08.536\nnay but usually by the time\nit gets to the committee,\n\n142\n00:08:08.536 --> 00:08:12.644\nyou're gonna get feedback like\nthat chart should go on page nine.\n\n143\n00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:16.731\nI mean the instructors don't wanna\nsend stuff off to the committee that\n\n144\n00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:17.556\nisn't well.\n\n145\n00:08:17.556 --> 00:08:20.436\nSo, once your project's\napproved it's the same thing.\n\n146\n00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:25.413\nYou get contacted because on our database\nwe typically just have your email\n\n147\n00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:30.311\naddress and your phone number so you\nget contacted to make sure that we have\n\n148\n00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:35.050\nyour name correct and you get a number\nthat's listed in our database.\n\n149\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.550\nSo, you can use this as a reference\nif somebody is trying to verify that\n\n150\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.000\nyou have a project.\n\n151\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.520\nYour mentor, a lot of times,\nyou can use as your personal\n\n152\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.410\nreference because they have actually\nworked with you on the project.\n\n153\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.680\nSo, the system from there,\nyou just keep wanting to go on.\n\n154\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.120\nWhen you repeat that in black belt and\nmaster black belt,\n\n155\n00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.100\nshould you decide to keep going further.\n\n156\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.250\nWe generally say you want to stay in that\ngreen belt role for a year or two and do\n\n157\n00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.590\nsome projects before you move on to black\nbelt but if you move onto the blackbelt.\n\n158\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.800\nOr master blackbelt,\n\n159\n00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.890\nthose follow a similar model except that\nyou're in class online or in person for\n\n160\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:19.120\nfive days but they have a phase\ntwo where you have assignments.\n\n161\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.650\nThey're more aggressive assignments and\nthen in phase two in the blackbelt class,\n\n162\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.080\nyou're responsible for\ntwo lean six sigma projects.\n\n163\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.390\nIf you've been in our program and\nyou've done a really good job\n\n164\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.510\non your greenbelt project, we will accept\nthat as one of your blackbelt projects.\n\n165\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.700\nIf that's something that you're thinking\nyou're wanting to do down the line,\n\n166\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.990\nyou just need to make sure that\nyour mentor knows that you\n\n167\n00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.920\nwant to do a blackbelt level project first\nand so you kinda get that pre-approved.\n\n168\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.740\nAnd in the master black belt program\nthere's a phase one five days,\n\n169\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.270\na phase two which a lot of assignments,\nand phase three is a little bit different.\n\n170\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.932\nIn that particular program you're\nnot doing a lot of projects because\n\n171\n00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:04.329\nyou've already proven that\nyou can do projects and\n\n172\n00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:08.833\nit's more about going on site and\nhelping our instructors teach and\n\n173\n00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:13.437\ndesigning classes and we put you\ninto some coaching type scenarios.\n\n174\n00:10:13.437 --> 00:10:17.991\nSo, I don't know if I explained all that\nand all that information is on the website\n\n175\n00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:20.507\nwith the outlines and\nthose types of things.\n\n176\n00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:25.077\nI do want to take a quick moment to\nexplain that when you do a lean sigma\n\n177\n00:10:25.077 --> 00:10:27.654\ngreen belt internal certification.\n\n178\n00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:31.762\nSo, a lot of many companies will\nhire a master black belt and\n\n179\n00:10:31.762 --> 00:10:36.196\na lot of people who are in our black\nbelt program are there because\n\n180\n00:10:36.196 --> 00:10:40.606\ntheir company decided they want\nto build an internal program.\n\n181\n00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:48.820\nWhen you are doing the internal program,\nfor the company it's a really great deal.\n\n182\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.390\nFor the employee it's better to\ncome to an outside company to do\n\n183\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:57.310\nthat because the assumption is if you take\nan internal program you might have just\n\n184\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.540\nconcentrated on manufacturing or\nretail or hospitality.\n\n185\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.150\nSo, it's always really better for the\nstudent to get an outside certificate but\n\n186\n00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.280\nit's a really pretty good deal for\na company to bring on a master black belt.\n\n187\n00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.986\nWhen you take an internal program,\nwhich is what I started to say,\n\n188\n00:11:13.986 --> 00:11:15.984\nit works a little bit differently.\n\n189\n00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:20.898\nTypically, internal programs call\nthe training waves and there will be three\n\n190\n00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:25.439\nwaves of training and in the first wave,\nyou're with the instructor for\n\n191\n00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:29.844\nfive days and then you go back into\nthe field and try to use those tools.\n\n192\n00:11:29.844 --> 00:11:32.899\nSecond wave, you're with\nthe instructor for another week.\n\n193\n00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:37.370\nThird week, you're with the instructor and\nthe instructor or the black belt or\n\n194\n00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.981\nmaster black belt assigns\nyou a project to do.\n\n195\n00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:42.154\nSo, but\nyou're still covering the same material.\n\n196\n00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:47.670\nSo, sometimes, and the reason why\nI'm mentioning this is because\n\n197\n00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.840\nours is an accelerated program even though\nwe cover everything everyone else does.\n\n198\n00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.262\nSometimes you'll hear people that\nwill tell you, it took me a year or\n\n199\n00:11:56.262 --> 00:11:57.796\ntwo years to get my green belt.\n\n200\n00:11:57.796 --> 00:12:02.037\nWell, a lot of times the reason is because\nthese waves, the second wave will come up\n\n201\n00:12:02.037 --> 00:12:05.326\nand all of a sudden your boss can't\nlet you go for a week, right?\n\n202\n00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:08.519\nOr you get in the third wave and\nyou're working on a project and\n\n203\n00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:12.460\nmaybe that person goes to another country,\nanother company.\n\n204\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.330\nThey could go to another country.\n\n205\n00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.870\nThey go to another company and\n\n206\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.310\nso you have to kind of start over and\nfind another project.\n\n207\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.550\nSo, I just don't want you to get\nnervous if you meet someone and\n\n208\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.610\nthey tell you that it takes a year.\n\n209\n00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.150\nOur program, our green belt program,\n\n210\n00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.560\nwhich would be your next step if\nyou take the yellow belt exam.\n\n211\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.957\nOur green belt program is designed to be\ncompleted within three to six months.\n\n212\n00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:35.583\nA lot of people do it in three minutes.\n\n213\n00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:37.765\nSome people get a new job.\n\n214\n00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:41.968\nThey need to take some time off so,\nphase one is at three days.\n\n215\n00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.934\nPhase two usually takes you,\nwe give you three weeks but\n\n216\n00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:48.100\nyou could do it in a weekend if\nthat's what you wanted to do.\n\n217\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.530\nPhase three is always the wild card\nbecause it just depends on what kind of\n\n218\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.553\nproject you choose.\n\n219\n00:12:52.553 --> 00:12:55.735\nIf you choose a simple project,\nyou're gonna be done pretty quickly.\n\n220\n00:12:55.735 --> 00:12:58.300\nIf you pick something\na little more complex,\n\n221\n00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.024\nit could take you a couple of months but\nthat is strictly up to you.\n\n222\n00:13:02.024 --> 00:13:04.547\n>> Excellent.\nWell I think that's a pretty good basis\n\n223\n00:13:04.547 --> 00:13:06.614\nthere for where people are going to go.\n\n224\n00:13:06.614 --> 00:13:08.752\nNow, keep in mind you\nwatch the whole series.\n\n225\n00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:11.874\nMaybe you got the information you needed\nand that's where you want to stop and\n\n226\n00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:12.941\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n227\n00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:15.611\nI do encourage you to go ahead and\nget the certification.\n\n228\n00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:19.440\nLike Dr. Stern said,\nthere's a real low barrier to entry there.\n\n229\n00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.830\nYou might as well get something to\nshow for the work that you've done and\n\n230\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.790\nget that on the old resume if nothing\nelse but moving on to the green belt,\n\n231\n00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.260\nmoving onto the black belt's a natural\nprogression as you learn and\n\n232\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.680\nget involved more with the system.\n\n233\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.300\nIt's really a pretty\nstraightforward process.\n\n234\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.515\nAll right, well I think that's\na pretty good rundown for us.\n\n235\n00:13:37.515 --> 00:13:40.590\nDr. Stern,\ndo you have anything else you wanna add?\n\n236\n00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.970\n>> No, except that I want\nto reiterate what Don said.\n\n237\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.480\nYou can go out today and\njust start using those tools.\n\n238\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.314\nYou don't need to be certified but the\nadvantage of the yellow belt certification\n\n239\n00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:54.807\nis that you're telling the employer\nI'm familiar with this methodology.\n\n240\n00:13:54.807 --> 00:13:57.420\n>> All right, the only other thing\nthat I'd like to mention and\n\n241\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.973\nI didn't talk to you about this before the\nshow but Dr. Stern does have a book out.\n\n242\n00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:04.888\nIt's available on Amazon,\nif you go and search for,\n\n243\n00:14:04.888 --> 00:14:08.863\nI just searched for-\n>> Lean Six Sigma International Standards\n\n244\n00:14:08.863 --> 00:14:10.421\nand Global Guidelines and\n\n245\n00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:14.400\nthe exciting thing about that book\nis it's in its second edition.\n\n246\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.080\n>> Absolutely and so\nit's available right there through Amazon.\n\n247\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.218\nGreat way to get that and just a great\nresource for studying and learning.\n\n248\n00:14:20.218 --> 00:14:22.825\nSo, definitely be sure to check that out.\n\n249\n00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:25.333\nAll right, well guys,\nthat's about it for this video.\n\n250\n00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:27.330\nI do thank you all for watching and\n\n251\n00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.540\nbest of luck as you move\nforward with Lean Six Sigma.\n\n252\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.915\nThanks for watching.\n\n253\n00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:40.594\n>> [SOUND]\n\n",
