          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:05.279\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma,\n\n2\n00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.994\nGreen Belt Certification Preparation\nseries overview.\n\n3\n00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:10.467\nI'm your show host.\n\n4\n00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:14.525\nAnd we're briefly going to be describing\nwhat this series is all about and\n\n5\n00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:17.440\nwhat we'll be covering\nthroughout the series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.806\nWith us to help me explain that,\nis Dr Terra Vanzant-Stern.\n\n7\n00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:24.410\nThank you for joining us today doctor\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Cherokee.\n\n8\n00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.090\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome.\n\n9\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.035\nSo, when I decide I wanna sit for\nthe Green Belt Certification,\n\n10\n00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.139\nwhere do I begin?\n\n11\n00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:32.910\nWhat are we gonna be\ncovering within this series?\n\n12\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I think I would like to\nbegin by saying that my company,\n\n13\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.370\nSSD Global Solutions, takes a leaner\napproach to teaching Lean Six Sigma.\n\n14\n00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910\nIn fact, we call it Leaner Six Sigma.\n\n15\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.900\nSo when you get done, you can still sit\nfor the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt exam.\n\n16\n00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.243\nBut we just teach the concepts in\na little bit easier way to understand.\n\n17\n00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:55.891\nTo prepare you for the test, and-\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm all for that.\n\n18\n00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.289\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\nthe first thing we're gonna do,\n\n19\n00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.291\nis we're just gonna talk\nabout what you need to know.\n\n20\n00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:05.406\nAnd there's a little bit of confusion\nbecause you can be Six Sigma certified or\n\n21\n00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:08.350\njust Lean certified or\nLean Six Sigma certified.\n\n22\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.800\nSo we're gonna talk\na little bit about that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.884\n&gt;&gt; And you'll break it down for us.\n\n24\n00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:11.507\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n25\n00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n&gt;&gt; The different paths that you can go on.\n\n26\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.990\nI shouldn't say little, cuz they all\nrequire some studying, obviously.\n\n27\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.435\nAnd then what we're gonna do,\n\n28\n00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.337\nis we're going to use a method\ncalled accelerated learning.\n\n29\n00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:24.470\nAnd what that means is we're gonna\nkind of take a top-down approach.\n\n30\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.377\nSo we're gonna give you sort of the idea\nof what are the process improvement\n\n31\n00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:28.879\nbasics?\n\n32\n00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:32.695\nWhat are the math and statistics basis?\n\n33\n00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:35.810\nWhat are the actual models and\nmethodologies?\n\n34\n00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.050\nBecause we believe at SSD Global\nSolutions, that a lot of times if we\n\n35\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.630\nprovide a framework,\nyou can fill in some of the blanks.\n\n36\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.810\nMany of the things that you'll be learning\nin this program, you've done before.\n\n37\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.730\nYou just call them different things.\n\n38\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.160\nSo some of the other topics is we're\ngonna talk about critical to quality.\n\n39\n00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.120\nWe're gonna really concentrate\non the DMAIC model,\n\n40\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.700\nthe different phases of\nthis problem solving model.\n\n41\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.310\nWe're also gonna address\nother problem solving models,\n\n42\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.670\nsuch as typical problem solving and\nscientific problem solving.\n\n43\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.650\nAnd plan, do, check, act, which is\nsomething you may have already studied\n\n44\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.790\nin your project management program.\n\n45\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.830\n&gt;&gt; Well that sounds amazing.\n\n46\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.220\nI can't wait to get started, and I hope\nyou guys are excited just as much as I am.\n\n47\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.210\nAnd I just wanna really say thank\nyou Dr Stern for being with us.\n\n48\n00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.720\nAnd well, let's go ahead and get started.\n\n49\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.930\nSo we'll wrap up this particular intro and\nsign off as your show host.\n\n50\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.240\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n51\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.887\nI'm Dr Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global,\n\n52\n00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:32.011\nhoping that you're going to go lean.\n\n53\n00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.851\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next\ntime here at ITProTV.\n\n54\n00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:38.449\n[SOUND]\n\n",

you're\ndefinitely in the right place because we\n\n7\n00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:32.410\nhave a really great expert in house for\nthis specific series.\n\n8\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.430\nHere name in Dr.\n\n9\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.110\nTera Vanzant Stern, and she came all\nthe way from Colorado to be with us.\n\n10\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.820\nSo we`re really excited about starting\nthis theory and thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.010\njoining us today doctor.\n\n12\n00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.540\n&gt;&gt; So, what we gonna be looking at for\nthe overview,\n\n14\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.038\nor what do thy need to know before\ngetting started this wonderful journey?\n\n15\n00:00:50.038 --> 00:00:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat I'd like to do is go to my slide deck\n\n16\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.390\nbecause cuz I think the best thing is\njust to say is what you need and why?\n\n17\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n18\n00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:02.398\nAnd I'm gonna take a second\nto introduce myself and\n\n19\n00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:04.771\ntell you why you should\neven wanna certify, and\n\n20\n00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.710\nwhat types of certifications are\navailable, and then how the process works.\n\n21\n00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.890\nThat's how we'll finish up.\n\n22\n00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.150\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n23\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.500\n&gt;&gt; And this is just a brief bio.\n\n24\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.560\nI'm Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern, I did\nthe IT Pro TV series for Yellow Belt.\n\n25\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.000\nAnd the reason why that\nmight be important is that\n\n26\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.010\nif there's a section that you want more\nin-depth on, there'll be several times\n\n27\n00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.190\nthat we'll say that's covered\nmore in-depth on the Yellow Belt.\n\n28\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.250\n&gt;&gt; So if they haven't already been working\nin this field, then it would probably be\n\n29\n00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.040\na good idea to jump to that first so\nthey have that background knowledge?\n\n30\n00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.260\n&gt;&gt; I think it's just individual\ndecision about if you see a topic and\n\n31\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.050\nyour familiar with it,\nyou can just keep going.\n\n32\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But if it's a topic that you're not\n\n33\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.180\nfamiliar with, I'll try to remember to say\nthis is covered more fully on Yellow Belt.\n\n34\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good\n&gt;&gt; Does that sound fair?\n\n35\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n36\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.367\nOkay, so I did the ITProTV Lean\n6 Sigma Yellow Belt, and\n\n37\n00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:08.000\nthat exam is available on\nthe SSDglobal.net page, SSDglobal.net.\n\n38\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.350\nI also was\nthe ASQ Lean Enterprise Division Chair.\n\n39\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.310\nAnd I'm currently\nthe ASQ Denver Education Chair.\n\n40\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.170\nAnd you'll see why all this ASQ stuff\nmeans something here in a second.\n\n41\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.960\nI'm also the chair of\nthe Rocky Mountain Quality Conference,\n\n42\n00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.160\nwhich is a virtual conference\nthat we do every year in March.\n\n43\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.090\nAnd it's a completely virtual conference.\n\n44\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.700\nThe students sign in and\nso do all the instructors.\n\n45\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.610\nIt's pretty exciting.\n\n46\n00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.790\nAnd then, my credentials is that I'm a\ncertified quality engineer, a PMP, a GPHR.\n\n47\n00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.460\n&gt;&gt; There's lots of acronyms there, yeah.\n\n48\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.240\n&gt;&gt; HR, Six Sigma master black belt.\n\n49\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.590\nThe reason I'm telling you all that\nis just so that you'll trust me.\n\n50\n00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.172\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n[LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:49.172 --> 00:02:49.697\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n52\n00:02:49.697 --> 00:02:50.877\nMy latest books\n\n53\n00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:54.087\nare the Lean Six Sigma\nInternational Standards and\n\n54\n00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:58.760\nGlobal Guidelines, which we draw a lot\nof information from from this class.\n\n55\n00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.770\nAnother book, another newer book,\nis Lean and Agile Project Management.\n\n56\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.620\n&gt;&gt; And we will also be covering\nthat on a separate series,\n\n57\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.740\nif you're interested as well.\n\n58\n00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.750\n&gt;&gt; And I've got lots of white papers and\narticles out there, but\n\n59\n00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.070\nthis is just my latest work.\n\n60\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.870\nNow, if you're a student\ntaking the ITProTV class, and\n\n61\n00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.150\nyou decide to take the certification\nthrough our organization, SSD Global,\n\n62\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.470\nthen there's also going to be an e-book\navailable called Leaner Six Sigma,\n\n63\n00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.310\nbecause that's the product\nthat we promote.\n\n64\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.960\nNow, your certification will\nstill say Lean Six Sigma,\n\n65\n00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.700\nit's just that we have a leaner,\nmore concise easier approach to studying.\n\n66\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.060\nSo, Cherokee, what's the deal\nwith certification, anyway?\n\n67\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.310\nWhy certify in anything?\n\n68\n00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.780\nAnd I think the answer to that question is\nthat it shows you have current knowledge.\n\n69\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.350\nAnd especially if you're trying\nto maybe cover up a little bit of\n\n70\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.220\nan educational gap, or it's been a while\nsince you've been to school, showing that\n\n71\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.090\nyou're certified in anything tells the\nemployer that you have the basics down for\n\n72\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.040\nwhatever they're hiring you for.\n\n73\n00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.070\nMany, many times, I have a large\nbackground in executive HR, and\n\n74\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.810\nmany times it's the certification piece\n\n75\n00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.520\nthat's the differentiator between two\nemployees, one certified one's not.\n\n76\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.970\nIt's like well, I'm gonna go\nwith the one that's certified,\n\n77\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.830\nbecause that's a safer bet.\n\n78\n00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.150\nIn the Lean Six Sigma\nfamily of certifications,\n\n79\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.200\nthere's a number of certifications you can\nget, and they are hierarchical in nature,\n\n80\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.440\nand they follow a martial\nart nomenclature.\n\n81\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.170\nSo you can be a Yellow belt, a Green belt,\na Black belt or a Master Black belt.\n\n82\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.280\nThose are the certifications available.\n\n83\n00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.380\nSome of you may have heard of\nthe term called White Belt.\n\n84\n00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.350\nAnd that's really sort of just\nan information orientation.\n\n85\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.980\nAnd there's usually not a test or\nanything that you have to take.\n\n86\n00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.945\nIt's just some basics.\n\n87\n00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.900\nSometimes White Belt's just a lunch and\nlearn.\n\n88\n00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.380\nSo, in the Yellow Belt program,\nwhich we do offer through ITProTV,\n\n89\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.380\nthere is an exam on\nthe SSD Global Solutions site,\n\n90\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.580\nand that's www.ssdglobal.net.\n\n91\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.270\nIt's at a discounted rate\nfrom our other students.\n\n92\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.851\nYou have to have seen all\nthe Yellow Belt programs, and then there\n\n93\n00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:14.410\nare a couple of other little requirements\nthat we give you a study book, and\n\n94\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.060\nthat type of thing, and\nyou can take that exam.\n\n95\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.860\nThe difference between Green and\nBlack belt is that the Green belt\n\n96\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.630\ntypically is focusing their\nefforts on process improvement,\n\n97\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.090\nwhich means making things better,\nfaster, more cost effective\n\n98\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.480\nin their particular vocation or\nthe job that they want some day.\n\n99\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.936\nSo I'm gonna take everything that\nI learn in Lean Six Sigma, and\n\n100\n00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:40.560\nI'm gonna apply it specifically\nto what I do during the day.\n\n101\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.080\nNow, the cool thing about this is that, in\nthe Green Belt Program, many of the things\n\n102\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.370\nthat you apply to your job you can\nalso apply to your personal life.\n\n103\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.260\nSo, I think that's pretty cool.\n\n104\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.520\nNow, the Black Belt, on the other hand,\n\n105\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.140\nis saying I have a good enough\nbasic business knowledge.\n\n106\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.450\nAnd that's typically a Masters\nin Business Administration,\n\n107\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.970\nMBA student, someone whose already\nowned their own business and\n\n108\n00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.390\nhad to wear the customer service hat, and\nthe marketing hat, and the financial hat.\n\n109\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.120\nOr, sometimes people in IT\nwho have had the opportunity\n\n110\n00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.848\nto interface with enough\ndepartments at a company.\n\n111\n00:06:14.848 --> 00:06:19.240\nWhat I'm saying in this case as\na Black Belt, is that I could go into\n\n112\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.970\nany department and help you be better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n113\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.890\nNow that's not to say that I have\nthe subject matter expertise in\n\n114\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.210\nevery department, but\nthat I could kind of get you started.\n\n115\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.530\nAnd so a lot of times, IT professionals\nwill end up staying in IT, but\n\n116\n00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.190\nthe certification says you know what, I'm\ncomfortable with all aspects of business.\n\n117\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.820\nAnd then there's the Master Black Belt\ncertification, and\n\n118\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.758\nthis is a very misunderstood,\nI think, certification.\n\n119\n00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.490\nTypically, Master Black Belts\ngo into companies and\n\n120\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.940\ndesign internal Lean Six Sigma programs.\n\n121\n00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.490\nThey're teachers,\nthey're facilitators, they're coaches.\n\n122\n00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.790\nWhat I think's kind of interesting\nis a lot of people struggle with,\n\n123\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.830\na lot of teachers, for example,\nstruggle with the Black Belt curriculum.\n\n124\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.340\nBut then they get to Master Black Belt,\n\n125\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.620\nand they're like, wow, this is just\nall about teaching and facilitating.\n\n126\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.780\nAnd then there's some people who are\nquality engineers, and sometimes IT people\n\n127\n00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.200\nthat take the Black Belt program, and\nthen they go to the Master Black Belt\n\n128\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.920\nprogram and they've never taught a class,\nor put a class together, or\n\n129\n00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.610\nput a program together and\nthat's what they find difficult.\n\n130\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.920\nSo it just depends on what it\nis that you're wanting to do.\n\n131\n00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.720\nNow, the certification world gets a little\nconfusing when you're talking about\n\n132\n00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.270\nLean Six Sigma, and\nI'd like to explain that next.\n\n133\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.568\n&gt;&gt; Good, I'm glad you're here to do so.\n\n134\n00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:35.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n135\n00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.480\nYou can actually, these days,\ncertify separately.\n\n136\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.720\nYou can certify in Six Sigma.\n\n137\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.149\nAnd back to that thing,\nall the connections I have with ASQ,\n\n138\n00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.926\nit is a volunteer job, however, so\nI would like to point that out.\n\n139\n00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:53.228\nBut ASQ is probably the most\nknown group of people that\n\n140\n00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:56.201\nadminister the Six Sigma only test.\n\n141\n00:07:56.201 --> 00:08:00.860\nYou could also just take\nthe Lean only test, right?\n\n142\n00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.670\nAnd the most known person, although in\nboth of these cases there are other\n\n143\n00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.760\nvendors and other universities\nthat will offer this test but\n\n144\n00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.340\nthe most known person in Lean is\nthe society of mechanical engineers.\n\n145\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.120\nSo just so you know that you could\nget certified in one or the other.\n\n146\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.040\nNow, on the six sigma, and this is all six\nsigma, whether you take it through ASQ or\n\n147\n00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.290\nnot, on the six sigma, certification,\n\n148\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.410\nit still follows the same\nmarshal art nomenclature.\n\n149\n00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.270\nYou can be a yellow,\ngreen,black or master black bell.\n\n150\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.535\nYou can sit for exams in those topics.\n\n151\n00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:40.200\nOn the lean side,\nthey do bronze, silver, gold.\n\n152\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.360\nAnd right now with the lean exams, keeping\nin mind that SME is the most popular place\n\n153\n00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.240\nto take it, but there are other vendors\nand other associations that offer it.\n\n154\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.985\nHowever right now it is still fairly\nhierarchical, where in ASQ and\n\n155\n00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:59.070\nwith our organization is\nit possible to skip a step.\n\n156\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.910\nThe Lean organizations\npretty much to say you know\n\n157\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.494\nyou need to have that\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] You must join this\n\n158\n00:09:04.494 --> 00:09:06.053\norganization and have these prerequisites.\n\n159\n00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:08.537\n&gt;&gt; Exactly thank you thank you.\n\n160\n00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:11.291\nNow there are people that allow\nyou to certified together and\n\n161\n00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:13.130\nfrankly that's the trend.\n\n162\n00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.380\nCertifying in Lean Six Sigma together.\n\n163\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.414\nCertainly SSD Global Solutions.\n\n164\n00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:20.970\nThat's my company,\nhas a test that you can take.\n\n165\n00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.540\nWe do have some requirements\nthat I will explain at the end.\n\n166\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.230\nBut different vendors have different\nrequirements for sitting for that exam.\n\n167\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.260\nWe teach a project called Leaner Six Sigma\neventhough your certification\n\n168\n00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.050\nis gonna say Lean Six Sigma Green Belt,\nwe teach Leaner Six Sigma.\n\n169\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.838\nAnd what that means is we take a leaner\napproach to teaching the statistics and\n\n170\n00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:44.948\nmath piece and\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n171\n00:09:44.948 --> 00:09:46.960\nIt's a little bit more template based.\n\n172\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.060\nHowever, if you sit through the series\nof ITPro.TV programs on Green Belt, you\n\n173\n00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.560\nwill be prepared to sit for\nthe Lean only or the Six Sigma only exam.\n\n174\n00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.472\nAnd then the only codicil to that is in\nyour student package, which is included in\n\n175\n00:10:02.472 --> 00:10:06.211\nthis program, we might point out that\nif you're sitting just for Six Sigma,\n\n176\n00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.359\nsince it's a little bit more statistical.\n\n177\n00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:11.840\nOr you're sitting just for Lean, which\nis a little bit more people oriented.\n\n178\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.950\nThat you might want to study\nthese collaterals, but\n\n179\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.310\nthey'll be in your student package.\n\n180\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.579\nAny industry standard, Lean,\nSix Sigma, exam you'll be covered for\n\n181\n00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.809\nin this program.\n\n182\n00:10:26.544 --> 00:10:30.911\nSo the reason why Lean and Six Sigma\nhooked up in the first place is that they\n\n183\n00:10:30.911 --> 00:10:33.430\nhave a lot of the same tools and methods.\n\n184\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.540\nThey have a lot of the same tools and\nthey recognized a lot of the same models.\n\n185\n00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.150\nOn the Lean side, we're trying\nto make things better, faster,\n\n186\n00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:45.630\nmore cost effective in existing activity\nby reducing and eliminating waste.\n\n187\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.160\nAnd there's a whole host of other things.\n\n188\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.210\nBut that's sort of like the big\nword that gets attached to lean.\n\n189\n00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.520\nOn the six sigma side we're tying to make\nthings better, faster, more cost effective\n\n190\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.800\nbut we're gonna concentrate on\ndefects if we're in manufacturing and\n\n191\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.890\nmistakes if we're in the service industry.\n\n192\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.360\nSo anything nonmanufacturing we might call\nit mistakes where manufacturings are gonna\n\n193\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.560\ncall it defects, but\nthere's a lot of the same tools.\n\n194\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.644\nThe focus of the tool is different but\nthat's what makes it so\n\n195\n00:11:10.644 --> 00:11:14.467\nfun to study it together because you're\nkilling two birds with one stone.\n\n196\n00:11:17.384 --> 00:11:20.555\nYou'll notice that if you're a train,\nlike I said, this is the trend but\n\n197\n00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:24.293\nyou wanna remember that there's companies\nout there that are just Lean manufacturing\n\n198\n00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:27.050\nand companies that are just Six Sigma for\nservice.\n\n199\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.100\nSo being a Lean Six Sigma person,\nyou might end up in one of those areas.\n\n200\n00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.690\nNow, even those companies are starting\nto recruit people that have\n\n201\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.850\nthe other side of the puzzle.\n\n202\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.150\nAnd that's why Lean Six Sigma is so\npopular right now.\n\n203\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.405\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so\nit's a little bit of cross training, or\n\n204\n00:11:42.405 --> 00:11:45.645\na little bit of extra information that\nyou may be bringing to the table.\n\n205\n00:11:45.645 --> 00:11:47.369\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n206\n00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:52.981\nNow in the Leaner Six Sigma program which\nwe're gonna be teaching here at ITPro.Tv.\n\n207\n00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:57.866\nAnd you can also take the Leaner Six Sigma\nprogram for your blackbelt studies.\n\n208\n00:11:57.866 --> 00:12:02.092\nOne of the things that we've done that\ndoesn't hurt you on in industry standard\n\n209\n00:12:02.092 --> 00:12:06.065\nexam at all is the biggest complaint we\nhave from students is all the math and\n\n210\n00:12:06.065 --> 00:12:09.570\nstatistics and the acronyms,\nso we've simplified that.\n\n211\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.350\nAnd some of the terms that,\nin the past, that you've heard,\n\n212\n00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:17.470\nlike DPMO, Sigma, CPK,\nCost of Poor Quality.\n\n213\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.830\nSome of those terms we break down and\nthen we also give you a handout.\n\n214\n00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.360\nIn the case of these statistics, we have\na handout that includes all of this stuff.\n\n215\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.100\nSo, it's kind of easier to study.\n\n216\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.850\nWe explain metrics through the course.\n\n217\n00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.360\nWhat we want you to do in Leaner Six Sigma\nis we wanna make sure you\n\n218\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.280\nunderstand the concept of\nthe statistic because then you'll be\n\n219\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.890\nable to pass the Lean Six Sigma exam.\n\n220\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.760\nHowever, if you're taking the Six Sigma or\nLean exam in your student package we\n\n221\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.012\nare gonna provide you the formulas\nthat they want you to memorize.\n\n222\n00:12:49.012 --> 00:12:49.512\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n223\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:57.550\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of people ask me do you\nhave know statistics to be certified?\n\n224\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.680\nDo I have to know statistics?\n\n225\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.120\nAgain, and this seems to be the biggest,\nbiggest concern.\n\n226\n00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.130\nDo I have to know statistics?\n\n227\n00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.640\nOkay well, you need to understand\nwhy you would use that statistic.\n\n228\n00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.310\nWhy would I use a confidence level?\n\n229\n00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.080\nWhich we're gonna teach you,\nwhy would I use a DPMO or Sigma.\n\n230\n00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.720\nWhy would I do those things, right?\n\n231\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.720\nThat's what we care about.\n\n232\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.840\nSo on the actual heavy lifting,\n\n233\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.110\nthe actual math, when these programs\nwere created, Lean and Six Sigma,\n\n234\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.510\nit was in the 80's and we really just\ndidn't have sophisticated software.\n\n235\n00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.629\nRight now Excel actually handles most\nof the statistics that you would need.\n\n236\n00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:38.540\nThe other thing that I get asked a lot is,\nwill I have to know the history?\n\n237\n00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.360\nLeaner Six Sigma takes\na lighter view of the history,\n\n238\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.350\nso we just tell you the basic\nhistory that you need to know,\n\n239\n00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.360\nit's on one piece of paper that\nyou get in your student pack.\n\n240\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.410\nI think if you're taking the Lean or Six\nSigma exam, you want to be familiar with\n\n241\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.420\nsome people's names a little bit\nmore than the Leaner Six Sigma.\n\n242\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.270\nNot that we don't think the history's\nimportant, but we don't want you to have\n\n243\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.390\nto memorize things like, in 1945,\nthis particular tool was developed.\n\n244\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.260\nDon't really worry about that.\n\n245\n00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.610\nThere are other programs that are process\nimprovement programs, so we'll be talking\n\n246\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:18.600\na little bit about ISO CMM and\nother continuous improvement programs.\n\n247\n00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.052\nLean Six Sigma,\none of the things that's so cool about it,\n\n248\n00:14:22.052 --> 00:14:25.865\nis it works in concert with other\nprocess improvement programs.\n\n249\n00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:29.685\nSo if your company is already ISO,\nor they're already CMM, or\n\n250\n00:14:29.685 --> 00:14:33.657\nthey're already have some other\nprocess improvement program.\n\n251\n00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:37.301\nLean Six Sigma works with that program\nto make that program better, faster,\n\n252\n00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.490\nmore cost-effective.\n\n253\n00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.826\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you can use the tools\nthat you learned here, or\n\n254\n00:14:41.826 --> 00:14:45.091\nthat you know from your\nLean Six Sigma background and\n\n255\n00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:50.231\napply it to those prerequisites, or\nexcuse me, those regulatory compliances.\n\n256\n00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and so now I wanna\naddress the certification process.\n\n257\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.170\nNow, vendors' requirements vary, so\nyou wanna kinda keep that in mind.\n\n258\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.840\nWhichever vendor that you're\ngoing to to take the test from,\n\n259\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.480\nyou wanna make sure that you meet\ntheir quals for sitting for the exam.\n\n260\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.000\nAnd some vendors have\nmore quals than others.\n\n261\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.510\nSo you wanna kinda keep that in mind.\n\n262\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.640\nTesting fees to take the test run in\nthe $300 range for almost all tests.\n\n263\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.730\nWe have discounted prices for\nour ITPro.TV students.\n\n264\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:25.290\nSome require classroom training,\nsome don't.\n\n265\n00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.802\nOurs does require an education component,\nbut\n\n266\n00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:34.352\nyou will meet that education requirement\nfor attending ITProTV classes.\n\n267\n00:15:34.352 --> 00:15:37.939\nAll legitimate programs, and I think this\nis the most important thing, because\n\n268\n00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:41.649\nemployers are starting to ask now, where\ndid you get your Lean Six Sigma training?\n\n269\n00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:46.209\nBecause there are a couple places where\nyou can spend the day in Hawaii and\n\n270\n00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:49.646\nbe a LEAN six sigma black belt\nwhich I really wanna go and\n\n271\n00:15:49.646 --> 00:15:54.058\njust see what they talk about, but\nmost Legitimate programs are going\n\n272\n00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:57.580\nto require some sort of\nLean Six Sigma project.\n\n273\n00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.860\nNow, if you decide to take the exam\nthrough us, we give you the templates if\n\n274\n00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.900\nyou don't already have a project\nthat meets the criteria.\n\n275\n00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.070\nWe give you the templates.\n\n276\n00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.100\nAnd you can take an older project and\nmaybe redo it in the DMAIC.\n\n277\n00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.320\nIt's just, we require that you have that\nknowledge before you sit for our exams.\n\n278\n00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:17.979\nI think I said all of this.\n\n279\n00:16:17.979 --> 00:16:18.572\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n280\n00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:24.993\n&gt;&gt; Now, if you want to study for\nany of the exams,\n\n281\n00:16:24.993 --> 00:16:28.630\nyou want to review the ITProTV shows.\n\n282\n00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.720\nThen you want to look at\nyour student package.\n\n283\n00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.000\nBecause remember in the student package,\n\n284\n00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.458\nit's going to have some of\nthe collaterals in the student package.\n\n285\n00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:40.070\nYou're going to say, if you're sitting for\nthe Six Sigma only exam.\n\n286\n00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.730\nOr if your sitting for the Lean only exam.\n\n287\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:48.350\nThe Lean and the Six Sigma only exam's\nstill have the tendency to have a lot\n\n288\n00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.040\nof manufacturing examples.\n\n289\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.505\nSo what we provide you with is like kind\nof easy to understand manufacturing terms.\n\n290\n00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:57.150\nBecause you might know\nthe answer to the question but\n\n291\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.950\nyou're not familiar with\nthe manufacturing environment.\n\n292\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.570\nAnd so the question,\ndoes it make sense, right?\n\n293\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.110\nSo you want to pay attention to those.\n\n294\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.850\nYou'll also receive a cheat sheet\nin your student package to study.\n\n295\n00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.770\nAnd say here's the terms that you\nwant to make that you're familiar\n\n296\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.950\nwith before you set for the exam.\n\n297\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.980\nAnd again,\n\n298\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.590\nI've already covered that part for our\ncompanies that have to submit a project.\n\n299\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.280\nAnd it has to be approved for\nyou to move forward.\n\n300\n00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.400\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n301\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.310\nAnd so would it be important\nto go ahead and delineate\n\n302\n00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.070\nwhere you received your certification\nto kind of add that credibility?\n\n303\n00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, that's what\nwe're going to talk about next.\n\n304\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.710\n&gt;&gt; Great!\n&gt;&gt; On your resume,\n\n305\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.770\nyou want to put because I\nget this question a lot.\n\n306\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.330\nLike what do I put down for certification?\n\n307\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.940\nOn your actual resume, you want to\nspell it out Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n308\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.940\nAnd it really does help\nif in parenthesis you put\n\n309\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.790\nwhere you got your Green Belt from.\n\n310\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.420\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because people these days want to go\n\n311\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.160\nlook it up on the net.\n\n312\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.920\nAnd make sure it's a legitimate program\nthat has all of the endorsements.\n\n313\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.560\nNow, on your actual business card\nyou can just put LSS Green Belt.\n\n314\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.070\nOr you can spell it out.\n\n315\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.260\nOther acceptable designations\nare what's on the screen right now.\n\n316\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.900\nI'll go ahead and pull up my screen again.\n\n317\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.510\nSo you see the other\nacceptable designations.\n\n318\n00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.580\n&gt;&gt; With the hyphen?\n\n319\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it seems like right now,\n\n320\n00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.210\nmost times on the business card they're\nputting Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n321\n00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n322\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.000\n&gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; What are your next steps after this\n\n323\n00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.960\nprogram?\n\n324\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.490\nYou take, after you watch this program, if\nyou decide that you want to be certified.\n\n325\n00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.490\nAt that point you decide if you\nwant to take the Lean only or\n\n326\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.440\nthe Six Sigma only exam through a vendor.\n\n327\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.680\nAnd, like I said, ASQ has a lot of\ninformation about the Six Sigma only test.\n\n328\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.420\nSME has a lot of information\nabout the Lean only test.\n\n329\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.830\nAnd just keep in mind that there\nis other vendors and universities,\n\n330\n00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.570\nI see that typo, [LAUGH].\n\n331\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:51.556\n&gt;&gt; I can't see that far.\n\n332\n00:18:51.556 --> 00:18:55.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\ndownwards [CROSSTALK] university.\n\n333\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.830\nSo just kind of keep in mind,\n\n334\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.740\nyou might want to get your\ninformation from those entities.\n\n335\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.970\nAnd then still kind of shop around\n&gt;&gt; Then you want to take the lean six\n\n336\n00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.950\nif you want to get certified\nwith the lean six sigma.\n\n337\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.580\nThere's a number of indoors who do that.\n\n338\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.010\nLike I said,\nthey all have different requirements.\n\n339\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.080\nIf you decide to go through\nSSD Global Solutions, my company,\n\n340\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.330\nyou've already met the educational\nrequirements to sit for the exam.\n\n341\n00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.220\nAnd like I said, we just also require\nproject chartering and project report.\n\n342\n00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.300\nBut we give you the templates.\n\n343\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.410\nAnd we kind of walk you through what\nhas to be approved before you can\n\n344\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.770\nsit for an exam.\n\n345\n00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.640\nNow once you do that,\nonce you sit for the exam you are.\n\n346\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.350\nAnd that you pass the exam,\nyou are a certified green belt.\n\n347\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:40.920\nIn our company if you pass the exam\nwith 75% or more you're done.\n\n348\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.230\nIf you do not pass with 75% or\n\n349\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.780\nmore we allow you to take\nthe test until you do pass.\n\n350\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.500\nWe just ask that you wait\n&gt;&gt; Two weeks between and we'll also give\n\n351\n00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.140\nyou some, some kind of clues like this is\nthe part that you really need to study.\n\n352\n00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.670\nBut we want you to study in between.\n\n353\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.790\nBut we'll let you keep taking the test.\n\n354\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.830\nBut that is something you want\nto check with other vendors.\n\n355\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.340\nSome vendors,\nthere is a re-testing charge.\n\n356\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.220\nOr after the second the second time you\ntake it there is a re-testing charge.\n\n357\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.140\nSo that's something you kind\nof want to keep in mind.\n\n358\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.390\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and you also would probably want.\n\n359\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.790\nSo I have received the Green Belt\ncertification, and\n\n360\n00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.630\nyou can use it as a stepping stone\nto advance to the next level, right?\n\n361\n00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.360\nThat's right.\n\n362\n00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.160\nAnd at SSD Global Solutions,\none of the things that we specialize in\n\n363\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.230\nis teaching\nthe Lean Six Sigma Black Belt courses.\n\n364\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.570\nAnd like I said, you want to check\naround with other vendors because\n\n365\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.370\nwe are actually kind of pricey.\n\n366\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.000\nIt's a big financial commitment\nto come to our class.\n\n367\n00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.030\nBut we also have a lot of endorsements and\nmost of her students are working.\n\n368\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.180\nBut you might be in a different situation.\n\n369\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.540\nSo you want to shop around,\n\n370\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.340\nmake sure you're comfortable with\nthe different prices that are out there.\n\n371\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.800\nBut for our class,\n\n372\n00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.910\nif you've taken the Lean Six Sigma\nGreen Belt And you've passed it.\n\n373\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.760\nThen we'll count one of your two\nprojects as your green belt project.\n\n374\n00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.110\nSo you'll just have to go on and\ndo one more project in phase three.\n\n375\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.940\nBut the way it works at our company\nis that you attend an online\n\n376\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.810\nlive presentation.\n\n377\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.650\nSo it's an interactive presentation,\nthat's phase one,\n\n378\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.570\nthat lasts about five days.\n\n379\n00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.120\nThen you move on to Phase II where\nyou do some things on the internet.\n\n380\n00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.690\nSome exercises,\nsome assignments, some testing.\n\n381\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.560\nAnd then you move to Phase III,\n\n382\n00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.600\nwhere we assign you a personal mentor\nthat helps you work through your project.\n\n383\n00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.220\nNow if you didn't come to the ITPro.tv,\nyou're having to do two projects.\n\n384\n00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.060\nBut If you're coming through this program,\nyou would only have to do one project.\n\n385\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.500\nBut our mentors work with you sort\nof like a consultant to make sure\n\n386\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.960\nthat your project reflects\nthe proper return on investment.\n\n387\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.180\nAnd those types of things.\n\n388\n00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.354\n&gt;&gt; So you're really getting that\npersonalized training [CROSSTALK] that\n\n389\n00:21:45.354 --> 00:21:47.322\nyou might not get with some of\nthose other companies out there?\n\n390\n00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:49.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so we do\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n391\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.200\nwhen we do a fair amount\nof online live training.\n\n392\n00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.220\nBut we also offer public\nclasses throughout the U.S.\n\n393\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.160\nSo if you're wanting to just\ncome to an actual class,\n\n394\n00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.870\njust look at our website and\nsee if you're in that area.\n\n395\n00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.370\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n396\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.660\n&gt;&gt; And I think that's about all I have to\nsay about why you want tp be certified,\n\n397\n00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.790\nand how to get certified and-\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n398\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.670\ntaking the time to explain all of that.\n\n399\n00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.280\nAnd I'm really excited to get\nstarted with this series.\n\n400\n00:22:14.280

Welcome to section one of\n\n5\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.231\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt\nCertification Preparations Series.\n\n6\n00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:20.628\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:25.200\nIn this segment, we'll be taking a look\nat our process improvement basics.\n\n8\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.690\nTo help us with that today.\n\n9\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.570\nIn house, we have Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern.\n\n10\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.880\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n11\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; So where do we get started?\n\n12\n00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.190\nWhat are the first topics that we\nshould go ahead and investigate?\n\n13\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.770\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think I'd like to\ngo over to my slides, and\n\n14\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.960\ntalk about the process improvement basics,\njust like you said.\n\n15\n00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n16\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.740\n&gt;&gt; The reason why I think this is\nimportant is because if you get the basic\n\n17\n00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.340\nunderstanding of process improvement, you\nwill be able to answer the test questions.\n\n18\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.230\nYou'll remember from before, we said that\nyou might be sitting for a Lean exam.\n\n19\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.440\nYou might be sitting for a Six Sigma Exam.\n\n20\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.520\nHopefully, you'll take our suggestion and\nsit for the Lean Six Sigma Exam.\n\n21\n00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.790\nBecause that's the trend these days.\n\n22\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.680\nHowever, sometimes just\nunderstanding the concepts,\n\n23\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.030\nyou can reason through the question,\nno matter what exam you're taking.\n\n24\n00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.550\nSo what we're gonna try to cover in this,\nmay morph over into our next program,\n\n25\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.040\nbut we're gonna talk about the core\nconcept of process improvement.\n\n26\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.530\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n27\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.910\nSome other process improvement programs.\n\n28\n00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.890\nAnd you need kind of a high\nlevel of knowledge just to know\n\n29\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.190\nthat there are other process\nimprovement programs.\n\n30\n00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.829\nAnd what's so cool about Lean Six Sigma\nis it's sort of a hybrid of all of those.\n\n31\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.940\nWe're gonna talk about ROI projected and\nreal ROI because for some\n\n32\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.765\nreason this seems to be one of the biggest\ntopics that people miss on their exams.\n\n33\n00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:51.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; It's also one of the topics that's\n\n34\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.105\nthe hardest when they're\ndoing Lean Six Sigma report.\n\n35\n00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n36\n00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.300\n&gt;&gt; So I think we're gonna go over that.\n\n37\n00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.343\n&gt;&gt; Start with the difficult topics,\nI love it.\n\n38\n00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:02.186\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so.\n\n39\n00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n40\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.930\nthen we're gonna talk a little bit about\nthe difference between charters and\n\n41\n00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.860\nreports, cuz that's just\nanother basic thing.\n\n42\n00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.740\nAnd then we'll continue to learn about\nhow to put our projects together.\n\n43\n00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n44\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.240\nSo simply stated, process improvement\nis gonna take an existing process and\n\n45\n00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.550\nmake that existing process better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n46\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.550\nSo when we talk about process, and some of\nyou may have watched the lean Six Sigma,\n\n47\n00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.500\nYellow Belt Program given by ITProTV,\nwe gave some examples of process.\n\n48\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.630\nBut just as a reminder of that,\nany activity is going to be a process.\n\n49\n00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.730\nSo a task is one thing.\n\n50\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.950\nBut a process is a series of things.\n\n51\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.660\nFor example,\nthere is a washing your clothes process.\n\n52\n00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.810\nAnd there's a cleaning your house process.\n\n53\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.095\nAnd there's a driving to work process,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:57.095 --> 00:03:02.570\nBusiness processes, typically\nare things like the payroll process.\n\n55\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.890\nWithin the payroll process,\nwould you agree Cherokee,\n\n56\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.240\nthere's probably a lot of mini processes.\n\n57\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of those sub-processes.\n\n58\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n59\n00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.670\nSo if you look at it, we have a marketing\nprocess, we have an operations process.\n\n60\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.530\nWe have, if you're working in\na manufacturing environment,\n\n61\n00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.420\nthere's obviously different\nmanufacturing processes.\n\n62\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.120\nSo just kind of think any\nkind of activity, and\n\n63\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.850\nwithin that activity there may be\nsub-processes that you're looking at.\n\n64\n00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.720\nBut I'm taking something\nthat's already happening, and\n\n65\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.810\nI'm trying to make that something better,\nfaster, or more cost effective.\n\n66\n00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.990\nNow when we say more cost effective,\nwhat we're trying to do is we're trying to\n\n67\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.660\nmake money, save money, or\navoid spending money, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.640\nNow, the part where it gets a little\ntricky is that when you say save money\n\n69\n00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.240\nin a process improvement program, Lean Six\nSigma, remember is an example of a process\n\n70\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.820\nimprovement program, but in any of them,\nwhen you say your gonna save money,\n\n71\n00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.860\nit's not quite the same as when\nyou just save money on your own.\n\n72\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n73\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.390\n&gt;&gt; So for example, if I went to the store\nand I saw a designer dress that I really\n\n74\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.690\nwanted, and then I went to another store,\nand I saw that same dress for cheaper.\n\n75\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.820\nSort of like some of those\ncommercials you see on television.\n\n76\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.170\nIn my mind, I've saved money.\n\n77\n00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.010\nBut the way saving money works in process\nimprovement is I had to have already been\n\n78\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.190\ngiven the money, and I gave you some back,\nor the money was already budgeted.\n\n79\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.310\nSo just cuz I go out, and\n\n80\n00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.720\nI get a good deal doesn't mean I've\nsaved money in process improvement.\n\n81\n00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.250\nI have to actually have the money\nin my hand or it's budgeted.\n\n82\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?\n\n83\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.110\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then cost avoidance is just\n\n84\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.764\nwhat it says, but sometimes that\ngets a little hard to process.\n\n85\n00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:50.540\nBecause I'm going to have to give you\na stronger argument for cost avoidance.\n\n86\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.850\nSo, you may have wanted to spend a certain\namount of money on a process improvement.\n\n87\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.660\nI think if we spend a little bit\nmore money up front, down the line,\n\n88\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.930\nwe may avoid spending more money.\n\n89\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.140\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So if I go in to my boss and\n\n90\n00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.300\nI say, I have a process improvement\nthat's gonna make us money,\n\n91\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.650\nbecause making money profit is still king.\n\n92\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.578\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n[LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.956\n&gt;&gt; At least they're gonna listen.\n\n94\n00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:13.457\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n95\n00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:14.252\n&gt;&gt; Someone's gonna\n\n96\n00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:15.470\nlisten to me.\nRight?\n\n97\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.010\nAnd if I go in and I say guess what\nI've made a process improvement and\n\n98\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.440\nhere's a $1,000 back,\nthere going to be like yay, right?\n\n99\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.570\n&gt;&gt; It's going to be really exciting.\n\n101\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.710\nThe cost avoidance.\n\n102\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.510\nIf you set out thinking you were going\nto spend a certain amount of money and\n\n103\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.310\nI'm saying you know what we spent more but\nwe going to.\n\n104\n00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.220\nWe're gonna make it up the next quarter.\n\n105\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.600\nI'm already kinda losing my audience,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.530\nSo I have to really kind of, I don't know,\n\n107\n00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.550\nhave my story straight when\nI talk about cost avoidance.\n\n108\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.020\nAnother example of cost avoidance\ndirectly relates to compliance issues.\n\n109\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.020\nSo, think of some compliance agencies.\n\n110\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.660\nThere's the EEOC\n&gt;&gt; HIPAA.\n\n111\n00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.350\n&gt;&gt; HIPAA.\n\n112\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.350\n&gt;&gt; What is the nuclear regulations?\n\n113\n00:05:57.932 --> 00:05:59.510\nI can't remember the acronym.\n\n114\n00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.460\nBut they're definitely prevalent\nwithin that industry, for sure.\n\n115\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.100\nIt's very bureaucratic and by the book.\n\n116\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n117\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.005\nAnd then all of us, IRS.\n\n118\n00:06:10.005 --> 00:06:11.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n119\n00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.060\n&gt;&gt; So if I notice something\nthat's out of compliance, and\n\n120\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.700\nif we get caught we're\ngonna have to pay a fine.\n\n121\n00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.222\nWell then,\n\n122\n00:06:19.222 --> 00:06:23.100\nthat process improvement is considered\na cost avoidance process improvement.\n\n123\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.810\nAnd what I like about cost avoidance is\nthat it's a little easier to explain.\n\n124\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.750\nBecause there's a lot of\npeople that have schedules.\n\n125\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.490\nSo, for example, the EPAs says,\nif you make a number one violation,\n\n126\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.420\nit's gonna cost you x amount of dollars.\n\n127\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.240\nWell, I can go in and\n\n128\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.830\nsay, I saved us from being fined\nthat particular amount of money.\n\n129\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.330\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n130\n00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.136\nLike you said,\n\n131\n00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:47.618\nby implementing something ahead of time,\nbefore that cost was actually warranted.\n\n132\n00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:48.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n133\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.040\nNow, another tricky thing, and\n\n134\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.230\nthis may show up on another slide so\nI'll just reiterate it.\n\n135\n00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.870\nAnother tricky thing about\nmaking things better, faster and\n\n136\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.560\nmore cost effective is bottom line,\nguess what?\n\n137\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.530\nIt's all about being cost effective.\n\n138\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.080\nSo people say well why would I\neven try to make something better?\n\n139\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.920\nWhy would I even try to make something\nfaster, if it's all about the money?\n\n140\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.090\nAnd that's because, and you'll see\nthis as you go through these programs,\n\n141\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.950\nthe tools to make something\nbetter are different,\n\n142\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.210\nthe tools to make something\nfaster are different.\n\n143\n00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.940\nSo I have to tackle those problems\nfirst and then I have to go back and\n\n144\n00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.690\nsay, did it make me money?\n\n145\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.770\nDid it save me money?\n\n146\n00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.610\nDid it avoid me spending money?\n\n147\n00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.250\nNow, sometimes I can just go\nstraight to the money argument.\n\n148\n00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.010\nAnd it's easier.\n\n149\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.710\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, it all boils down to that.\n\n150\n00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.550\nBecause if you're able to produce or\n\n151\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.170\nprovide a service at a more rapid\nrate than what you previously were.\n\n152\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.265\nWell, I can only assume that you're\nincreasing your revenue as well.\n\n153\n00:07:42.265 --> 00:07:44.414\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; And if I provide you with a quality\n\n154\n00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:48.952\nproduct, I may be getting repeat customers\nor they may be spreading the word,\n\n155\n00:07:48.952 --> 00:07:49.872\nword of mouth.\n\n156\n00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:52.923\nWhich would be bringing additional\nmoney into that organization as well.\n\n157\n00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:54.028\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n158\n00:07:54.028 --> 00:07:56.573\nAbsolutely.\n\n159\n00:07:56.573 --> 00:08:00.668\nNow, there are other process improvement\nprograms, and what I think is so\n\n160\n00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:04.470\nimportant about these is that\nthey use that same concept.\n\n161\n00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.870\nWe're trying to make an existing process\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n162\n00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.600\nThey just take a different approach.\n\n163\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.670\nNow, on the Lean Six Sigma exams, you\njust have to have a high level knowledge\n\n164\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.120\nof the ones I'm gonna talk about next.\n\n165\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.660\nOn the Lean exam, and\n\n166\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.920\nthe Six Sigma Exam, sometimes there's\na few more questions related.\n\n167\n00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.090\nAnd that's why in your student package,\nyou're going to get a little\n\n168\n00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.600\nbit more of a breakdown of\nthese different categories.\n\n169\n00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.110\nOn the Lean Six Sigma Exam,\nbasically, they want you to know that\n\n170\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.340\nLean Six Sigma isn't the only\nprocess improvement program.\n\n171\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.050\nBut again, especially in Lean,\nbecause so much of Lean comes from TQM.\n\n172\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.500\nYou could have some\nspecific TQM questions, and\n\n173\n00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.250\nthat's why when you're looking\nto your student package,\n\n174\n00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.040\nit might say something good for\nthe Lean only, or the Six Sigma only exam.\n\n175\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.850\nIt's interesting reading, I mean,\nit won't hurt you to read it for\n\n176\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.020\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam.\n\n177\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.780\nBut we mostly want you to\nknow that Lean Six Sigma,\n\n178\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.890\nalthough it's the best process improvement\nprogram, it's certainly not the only one.\n\n179\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.340\nSo TQM, we've talked a little\nbit about that before.\n\n180\n00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.170\nThat's total quality management.\n\n181\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.780\nAnd that's where all process\nimprovement started.\n\n182\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.443\nAnd it was in a manufacturing environment,\nand it was just about being better,\n\n183\n00:09:18.443 --> 00:09:22.281\nit wasn't about being cost effective,\nit wasn't about speed.\n\n184\n00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:22.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n185\n00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:26.319\n&gt;&gt; It was just about being better, and\nit wasn't until the 1980s that any of\n\n186\n00:09:26.319 --> 00:09:28.807\nthe process improvement program said,\nyou know what?\n\n187\n00:09:28.807 --> 00:09:30.582\nIt's gonna be about the money,\n\n188\n00:09:30.582 --> 00:09:33.820\na little bit about how fast we\ncan get something to market.\n\n189\n00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.340\nISO, International Standard Organization,\nis a set of standards.\n\n190\n00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.240\nIn the States, we're mostly familiar\nwith 9,000 series and the 14,000 series.\n\n191\n00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n192\n00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.370\n&gt;&gt; However, there's,\n\n193\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.530\nif you can believe this-\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n194\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.590\nI don't even know.\n\n195\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.260\n&gt;&gt; 350 standards you can get certified in.\n\n196\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.700\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, it's just amazing.\n\n197\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.130\nBut here in the States,\nwe kinda know about that.\n\n198\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.450\nBut there is now, for example,\nan ISO standard for medical labs,\n\n199\n00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.470\nan ISO standard for medical device,\nthose types of things.\n\n200\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.270\n&gt;&gt; And also, I have a bit of a background.\n\n201\n00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.960\nI worked for a manufacturing company.\n\n202\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.740\nBut ISO is not constrained or\nconfined to just a manufacturing,\n\n203\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.810\nit can also apply to services as well.\n\n204\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nISO works a little differently than TQM.\n\n205\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.120\nTQM, it's a lot like\nLean Six Sigma is now.\n\n206\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.420\nIn the TQM days,\nit was very people centric,\n\n207\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.940\nbecause people time didn't cost\nquite as much as machine time.\n\n208\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.950\nSo, the big difference between TQM and\n\n209\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:38.010\nLean Six Sigma is that Lean Six Sigma\nhas a lot newer, jazzier tools.\n\n210\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.810\nNow, ISO, the way it works is it\ngives you a list of best practices.\n\n211\n00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:45.370\nSo, these books are filled with,\nin a perfect world,\n\n212\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.040\nthis is what it should look like.\n\n213\n00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.294\nAnd the idea of making you better, faster,\nmore cost effective in an ISO environment\n\n214\n00:10:52.294 --> 00:10:54.789\nis that you're gonna try\nto map to that standard.\n\n215\n00:10:54.789 --> 00:10:55.743\nMedical device, those types of things.\n\n216\n00:10:55.743 --> 00:11:00.247\nSo, when you first get certified, or\nwhen you first get considered to get ISO\n\n217\n00:11:00.247 --> 00:11:03.520\ncertification, someone comes in and\nthey do an audit.\n\n218\n00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.840\nLean Six Sigma people,\n\n219\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.930\na lot of times, become involved\nin the recertification process.\n\n220\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.590\nIn the recertification process,\n\n221\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.790\nyou have a burden of showing people that\nyeah, I'm trying to map to the standard.\n\n222\n00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.095\nYou don't-\n&gt;&gt; I'm continually trying to improve\n\n223\n00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.807\nnot just one time,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n224\n00:11:20.807 --> 00:11:22.798\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Thinking about it.\n\n225\n00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:24.335\n&gt;&gt; That's so important, it's like\nI've continually trying to improve,\n\n226\n00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:24.890\nand who cares about that?\n\n227\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.470\nWell, your stockholders, right?\n\n228\n00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you can-\n\n229\n00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:28.578\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n230\n00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:29.661\n&gt;&gt; Even whomever you're doing business\n\n231\n00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:30.750\nwith, even if it's international.\n\n232\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.465\nJust, again, adds that\ncredibility to your organization.\n\n233\n00:11:33.465 --> 00:11:35.570\nYeah, and that's such a great point,\n\n234\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.840\ncuz a lot of people who get involved\nin ISO it is for that market thing,\n\n235\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.050\nso that they can market their\nmedical device, say, overseas.\n\n236\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.457\nBecause they've got that kind of stamp,\nthat good housekeeping stamp of approval.\n\n237\n00:11:46.457 --> 00:11:47.369\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n238\n00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:49.895\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I think the thing is,\n\n239\n00:11:49.895 --> 00:11:55.100\npeople a lot of times, don't realize\nabout ISO, is that the standard is there.\n\n240\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.420\nThey're not saying to\nget initially certified,\n\n241\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.060\nthat you have to meet the standard.\n\n242\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.580\nThey're just saying to get recertified,\n\n243\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.650\nyou have to be going\ntowards that standard.\n\n244\n00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.850\nAnd to your point, continuous improvement.\n\n245\n00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.050\nBut it's just a list of things,\na list of standards, right?\n\n246\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.140\nThat's how they make things better,\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n247\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.590\nAnother popular program is\nCapability Maturity Model Integrated,\n\n248\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.866\nand--\n&gt;&gt; That's a mouth full.\n\n249\n00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:17.652\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n250\n00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:20.131\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of people just call it CMM,\n\n251\n00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:22.575\nCapability and Maturity Model--\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that better.\n\n252\n00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is easier to say.\n\n253\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.570\nThat's a product that we actually\npaid for, through our tax dollar, but\n\n254\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.530\nit's managed by Carnegie Mellon.\n\n255\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.900\nAnd their basic jist of it Is that\nthe way I'm gonna make things better,\n\n256\n00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.580\nfaster and more cost effective,\nis I'm going to establish five levels, and\n\n257\n00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.180\nI'm gonna get everyone in\nthe plane field in each level.\n\n258\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.470\nSo, there are certain things\nthat I have to do in level one,\n\n259\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.560\ntry to figure out what types or\nprocesses are repeatable.\n\n260\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.313\nAnd again, in your student package, it's\ngonna break down what happen in level one,\n\n261\n00:12:54.313 --> 00:12:58.360\ntwo, three, four and five,\ngives you sort of the short summary,\n\n262\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.070\nbecause in the Lean exams or\nthe Six Sigma exams, it could come up.\n\n263\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.841\nBut the gist of it pretty much,\n\n264\n00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:07.362\nis that there's only a few\ncompanies that are level five.\n\n265\n00:13:07.362 --> 00:13:10.201\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's going to be our goal.\n\n266\n00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:13.608\nYes, our goal is to get to\nthe top of that level ladder.\n\n267\n00:13:13.608 --> 00:13:16.797\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, and when you're a CMM company,\n\n268\n00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:18.864\nonce you've established level three,\n\n269\n00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:22.648\nthat's when you can start putting it\non your website and stuff like that.\n\n270\n00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:23.607\n&gt;&gt; Advertising?\nOkay, perfect.\n\n271\n00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:28.067\n&gt;&gt; ITIL, which a lot of people are\nfamiliar with in the IT history in the IT.\n\n272\n00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:29.195\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n273\n00:13:29.195 --> 00:13:31.408\n&gt;&gt; And you might even here that as ITIL.\n\n274\n00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:34.021\nSome people will go ahead and\nsay that as well.\n\n275\n00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:37.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's one of the things\nthat I'm always kind of struggling with,\n\n276\n00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:40.544\nwhen I'm in England,\nwhere I actually originated,\n\n277\n00:13:40.544 --> 00:13:43.870\nthere's a lot of people that say ITIL,\nso they can hear it's ITL.\n\n278\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n279\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.355\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes I don't even know\nwhat they're talking about.\n\n280\n00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:49.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It stands for, wait, information?\n\n281\n00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Information Technology, what's the I?\n\n282\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.420\nInfrastructure library.\n\n283\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:54.920\nThere we go.\n\n284\n00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nit works a lot like ISO does.\n\n285\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.090\nThere's five books, and a lot of\nyou are already familiar with this.\n\n286\n00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.776\nBut it's listing in a perfect world, this\nis what should happen in customer service.\n\n287\n00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:06.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, best practices.\n\n288\n00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:09.901\nLook, this is what we've gone through,\nwhat seems to work best, so\n\n289\n00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:12.852\na lot of companies look at that and\ntell their employees,\n\n290\n00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.556\nI would like you to try to\nfollow these standards, or\n\n291\n00:14:15.556 --> 00:14:20.001\nthese guidelines to make your life, and\nwell, everyone else's, a little easier.\n\n292\n00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so we're trying to make\nthose processes better, faster and\n\n293\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.510\nmore cost effective.\n\n294\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:31.420\nAnd then Agile is kind of a new kid on\nthe block as far as project management.\n\n295\n00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.460\nRight, and that is covered in\nmy newest book, The Lean and\n\n296\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.390\nAgile Project Management.\n\n297\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:42.130\nBut Agile started out as\na software kind of idea.\n\n298\n00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.070\nAnd its morphed over into project\nmanagement in the way we can manage\n\n299\n00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.610\nprojects in general.\n\n300\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.970\nSo, a lot of people that\naren't IT people use Agile.\n\n301\n00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.960\nAnd I would say the biggest thing about\nAgile, about making things better, faster,\n\n302\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.330\nmore cost effective, is the flexibility.\n\n303\n00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.280\nI don't know if you want to add to that,\nbut that's the biggest thing,\n\n304\n00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.300\nthe people interface.\n\n305\n00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.541\nAnd here at ITPRO.TV,\nthere is a lot of Agile process.\n\n306\n00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:07.999\n&gt;&gt; So, we do try to implement Lean and\nAgile methodology, I haven't been\n\n307\n00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:13.051\nformerly trained on Agile, but I here as\na buzzword all the time, so I definitely\n\n308\n00:15:13.051 --> 00:15:17.465\nthink it's something you should\nexplore and dive a little deeper in.\n\n309\n00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:21.361\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we do have a program on Lean\nand Agile project managements, so, that's\n\n310\n00:15:21.361 --> 00:15:25.280\nkind of something that people can think\nabout if they're interested in that area.\n\n311\n00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.190\nSo, if I'm trying to make things better,\nfaster, more cost-effective, and\n\n312\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.320\nsomeone uses that term Agile,\nI think the word, as far as testing and\n\n313\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.540\nstuff is concerned, is just remember it's\nless bureaucratic, it's more flexible.\n\n314\n00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.740\nThere is a downside to Agile,\nunfortunately.\n\n315\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.110\nIt's not the best product to use if\nyou're in a compliance situation.\n\n316\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.610\nBecause sometimes in compliance,\nthey want to see the steps that you took..\n\n317\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.862\n&gt;&gt; The rigorous activity.\n\n318\n00:15:48.862 --> 00:15:52.282\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They're not as flexible.\n\n319\n00:15:52.282 --> 00:15:58.555\n&gt;&gt; And then, again, remember, Lean and\nSix Sigma are separate methodologies.\n\n320\n00:15:58.555 --> 00:16:01.734\nLean, it started out, all of these\nthings started out in manufacturing.\n\n321\n00:16:01.734 --> 00:16:03.860\nBut, lean was called lean manufacturing.\n\n322\n00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.890\nAnd it morphed into lean thinking.\n\n323\n00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:11.070\nAnd Six Sigma was a manufacturing thing\nthat became Six Sigma for service.\n\n324\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.410\nNow lean Six Sigma, kind of,\nlooks at all of the above, and\n\n325\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.590\nthat's why it's such a cool thing.\n\n326\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.760\nYou're gonna see literature, and this is\ncovered in the ebook on Lean Six Sigma,\n\n327\n00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.540\ncuz that's the product that SSD Global\nsays let's make it simpler to understand.\n\n328\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.450\nThe deal is with, with Leaner Six Sigma,\nthe idea is there's\n\n329\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.810\na lot of things in all those other process\nand prevent programs that can be valuable.\n\n330\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So if I'm kind of.\n\n331\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.500\n&gt;&gt; Supplemental knowledge\nis always a good idea.\n\n332\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n333\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.200\nAnd the, and so if I'm trying to look for\n\n334\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.160\nprocess improvement And\nI'm a Lean Six Sigma person.\n\n335\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.580\nWell, why not go to a book\nof best practices and say,\n\n336\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.010\nare we doing any of these things in\ncustomer service or manufacturing?\n\n337\n00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.460\nSo, that would be\nan example of me using ISO.\n\n338\n00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.950\nI might be working on a project that\nIt's a little bit more fragmented and\n\n339\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.100\ncan afford some flexibility,\n\n340\n00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.130\nbecause maybe we don't really\nknow what it is we want to do.\n\n341\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.500\nSo, lean six sigma takes\nadvantage of both of those things.\n\n342\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.990\nNow what I started to say is\nthat in a lot of literature, and\n\n343\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.200\neven some of my early literature,\ncuz I got into the game Pretty early on.\n\n344\n00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.310\nI won't say how early on.\n\n345\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.000\nYou'll hear people say,\nLean Six Sigma is a blend between Lean and\n\n346\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.640\nSix Sigma and the insinuation there\nis certainly that it's 50-50.\n\n347\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.300\nAnd I wanna clear up is\nthat it's mostly Six Sigma.\n\n348\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.440\nIt's just that Six Sigma was\nvery statistically based.\n\n349\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.400\nIt was working on projects that\ncould bring in 250,000 or more.\n\n350\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.100\nMake, save, or\navoid spending that kind of money.\n\n351\n00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.120\nAnd so Lean Six Sigma Did\nbring some Lean influence.\n\n352\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.140\nFor example, in Six Sigma there's\nnot a lot of attention to people.\n\n353\n00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.220\nLean and Agile are both kind of people\ncentric and really care about the people.\n\n354\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.000\nIt's not that Six Sigma doesn't care\nabout people or leadership or teams and\n\n355\n00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.130\nit's certainly mentioned\nin their body of knowledge\n\n356\n00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.490\nIt's just there's not\na big emphasis on that.\n\n357\n00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.280\nSo, one of the things that Lean\nbrought to the Lean Six Sigma\n\n358\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.710\nparty is that kind of focus on people.\n\n359\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.910\nThe other thing is that Lean started\nkind of taking a different look at those\n\n360\n00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.860\nstatistics and promoting charts and\ngraphs a little bit more.\n\n361\n00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.530\nBut still, the core concept is six sigma.\n\n362\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.910\nSo, if you're looking for,\n\n363\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.700\nlet's say you're doing a process\nimprovement at your company.\n\n364\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.310\nStudying the six sigma\nliterature is going to help.\n\n365\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.810\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n366\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.080\nSo, one of the things that's tricky about\nprocess improvement is first what I've\n\n367\n00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.170\ngotta do is I've gotta figure out\nwhat methodology I wanna use.\n\n368\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.700\nAnd sometimes,\nyou can be a lean six sigma person, but\n\n369\n00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.290\nyour company is heavily invested in TQM or\nCMMI or ISO.\n\n370\n00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.440\nThe thing that I love about lean\nsix sigma Is that it doesn't care.\n\n371\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.230\nIt will make your CMM program better,\nfaster, more cost-effective.\n\n372\n00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:02.820\nIt will make your ISO program better,\nfaster, more cost-effective.\n\n373\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.980\nThe next challenge is,\nam I working on the right thing?\n\n374\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.010\nAnd so\nthere's a lot of tools in Lean Six Sigma\n\n375\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.650\nthat help you determine am I working\non the biggest thing for my buck.\n\n376\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.559\n&gt;&gt; Ok, kind of like that 80/20 rule that\nI'm sure we'll be talking about later\n\n377\n00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n378\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:24.510\nYou know, am I putting my effort\ntowards what's important.\n\n379\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I wanna go ahead and put my\nefforts towards my biggest return or\n\n380\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.930\nmy biggest, I guess reward.\n\n381\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n382\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:36.380\nAnd then we're gonna go back to\nthat ROI thing, still bottom line,\n\n383\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.890\nwhat did you make me, save me,\nor avoid me spending?\n\n384\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.470\nThat's what I really wanna know.\n\n385\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.830\n&gt;&gt; As long as you keep your focus.\n\n386\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n387\n00:19:45.564 --> 00:19:50.760\nSo, I think we have time to finish up\ntalking about return on investment.\n\n388\n00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because it's so huge.\n\n389\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.900\nOkay, and this is one of the concepts\nthat in your Lean exams and\n\n390\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.270\nSIx Sigma exams is a little\nbit over complicated.\n\n391\n00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:04.310\nSo, you wanna kind of just get\nthe idea of return on investment and\n\n392\n00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.560\nit'll be easier to answer\nthose questions on that exam.\n\n393\n00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.210\nAgain on the Lean Six Sigma exam,\n\n394\n00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:14.530\nWe're mostly concerned that you\nknow what Return on Investment is.\n\n395\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:20.690\nSo, if, so let's say in simple terms,\nwithout a calculator.\n\n396\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n397\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.520\n&gt;&gt; If I buy something for\na dollar and I sell it to you for\n\n398\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.600\na dollar, I have a zero return.\n\n399\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.310\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n400\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.570\n&gt;&gt; Because I gave this, I sold it,\nI got back a dollar, right?\n\n401\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.402\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So I put a dollar in and\n\n402\n00:20:33.402 --> 00:20:37.263\nI got everything back,\nwhere it gets tricky is\n\n403\n00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:42.128\nif I put $10,000 in and\nI get $10,000 back.\n\n404\n00:20:42.128 --> 00:20:46.690\nNow the reason why\nthat's tricky is that It\n\n405\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:51.630\ncould be a negative return on investment\nbecause that $10,000, I mean once we start\n\n406\n00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.470\ngetting up into bigger money, that money\ncould have been working someplace else.\n\n407\n00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.270\nIf I put that $10,000 in the bank,\nfor example.\n\n408\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.330\n&gt;&gt; Or accumulating interest.\n\n409\n00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n410\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.840\nSo, this money could be\ndoing something else for me.\n\n411\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.480\nSo, I put $10,000 in, I get $10,000 back.\n\n412\n00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.280\nTechnically I could have\na negative return on investment.\n\n413\n00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:08.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now,\n\n414\n00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Calculators aren't that smart.\n\n415\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.450\nThey don't know that, right?\n\n416\n00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.040\nSo, when I'm doing a return on investment\nformula, like I'm saying, I put this in,\n\n417\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.220\nI got this out,\nit's gonna give me the raw number, right?\n\n418\n00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.040\nAnd so that's the big thing to remember.\n\n419\n00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.880\nThe other thing is the simplest\nreturn on investment formula,\n\n420\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.820\nkeeping in mind it's not\n&gt;&gt; It's not smart enough to\n\n421\n00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.130\nthink about those other factors.\n\n422\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.370\nWhat if I did this with this with it?\n\n423\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.780\nWhat if I did that?\n\n424\n00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.420\nThe simpler it is.\n\n425\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Is this when a human comes into play or\nwill our Excel spreadsheets or\n\n426\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.440\nsoftware be able to intuitively\naccount for those types of things.\n\n427\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where it\nbecomes not just a science.\n\n428\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.420\nIt becomes a bit of an art.\n\n429\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.790\nBecause it's just gonna know you\nput this in, you took this out,\n\n430\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.370\nthis is the percentage.\n\n431\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.660\nAnd so, the regular one, and the one that\nyou would use on lean six sigma exams as\n\n432\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.000\nwell as the lean and six sigma exam,\nthe basic formula is\n\n433\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.670\nnet profit divided by cost of investment,\nand then you multiply it by 100.\n\n434\n00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.110\nAnd just to simplify this, so\n\n435\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:16.230\nlet's say you bought a used car for $1200\nand then you sold that car for $1800.\n\n436\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.801\nSo you net profit is $600, right?\n\n437\n00:22:19.801 --> 00:22:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So, what's the return on investment?\n\n438\n00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.120\nIn this case you would use that\nformula that we just looked at.\n\n439\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.750\nYour investment was 12,\nyour net profit was 6.\n\n440\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.120\nSo, you divide those two,\nmultiply it by 100.\n\n441\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.130\nAnd then you'd have 50%\nreturn on investment.\n\n442\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:40.290\nNow in your student package, we have\nother return on investment formulas.\n\n443\n00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.180\nThis is just the simplest one.\n\n444\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.110\nIn some companies,\nthey're considering things like taxes and\n\n445\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.920\nthere's all kinds of other\nthings that you consider.\n\n446\n00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.880\nBut if you kind of stick to this, you'll\nbe able to answer the test questions.\n\n447\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.370\nSo, let's do another example,\nand then we can wrap up.\n\n448\n00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.750\nIf I invested $2000 in stock, okay, and\n\n449\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.620\nthen a year later I sold that stock for\nwhat?\n\n450\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.271\n&gt;&gt; No, $1200.\n\n451\n00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:08.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n452\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.360\nnow my net profit is -$600, right.\n\n453\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.380\nThat's my -$600.\n\n454\n00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.630\nSo, I still use that same formula.\n\n455\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.850\nMy net profit Is -$600.\n\n456\n00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.490\nMy investment was $2000, right.\n\n457\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay and\n\n458\n00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.670\nthen multiply that by a hundred and\nso you'll see the bottom part of this\n\n459\n00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.240\nstory is that I have a -30%\nreturn on investment.\n\n460\n00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.860\nSo, just to kind of wrap this up on my end\n\n461\n00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.690\nThere are some core concepts in process\nimprovement that are very important.\n\n462\n00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.890\nIf you get the core concepts down,\n\n463\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.880\nyou can answer any test question\nthat's a lean six sigma.\n\n464\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.817\nOr hopefully, the lean six sigma exam.\n\n465\n00:23:45.817 --> 00:23:49.494\nOne of the core concepts is I'm\ntaking an existing activity.\n\n466\n00:23:49.494 --> 00:23:52.169\nAnd I'm trying to make that\nactivity better, faster, and\n\n467\n00:23:52.169 --> 00:23:53.570\nmore cost effective, right?\n\n468\n00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.891\nAnd if I can't, I can't.\n\n469\n00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:56.996\nThen I'm going to go on\nto another activity.\n\n470\n00:23:56.996 --> 00:24:01.990\nSo what happens is choosing\nthe activity becomes very key.\n\n471\n00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.734\nAnd so Lean Six Sigma has tools,\n\n472\n00:24:03.734 --> 00:24:06.964\njust like some of the other\nprocess improvement programs,\n\n473\n00:24:06.964 --> 00:24:11.440\non how to make sure I'm really working on\nthe thing I should be working on, right?\n\n474\n00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.434\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n475\n00:24:12.434 --> 00:24:15.737\n&gt;&gt; And then the next thing that's\nreally important is the concept of\n\n476\n00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:17.435\nreturn on investment.\n\n477\n00:24:17.435 --> 00:24:20.055\nI'm going to have a projected\nreturn on investment.\n\n478\n00:24:20.055 --> 00:24:22.635\nLet's say I bought that used car, right?\n\n479\n00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:26.957\nAnd I'm thinking if I use that used car\nall year, it has an intrinsic value,\n\n480\n00:24:26.957 --> 00:24:28.647\nmaybe the Blue Book value, right.\n\n481\n00:24:28.647 --> 00:24:32.147\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe I even become an Uber driver,\nand I'm using it as part of an income.\n\n482\n00:24:32.147 --> 00:24:32.987\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n483\n00:24:32.987 --> 00:24:37.157\nBut I don't know that for\nsure, right, I just think.\n\n484\n00:24:37.157 --> 00:24:41.591\nSo as part of my story to get you to let\nme buy this car, whether you're my parent,\n\n485\n00:24:41.591 --> 00:24:44.806\nor my spouse, or my child,\nwhoever I may be reporting to.\n\n486\n00:24:44.806 --> 00:24:46.624\n&gt;&gt; You seem like you've\nbeen through this before.\n\n487\n00:24:46.624 --> 00:24:48.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n488\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:52.580\nSo as part of that argument I'm gonna say,\nI think I could make, and\n\n489\n00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.960\nthat's all it is,\nprojected return on investments.\n\n490\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.710\nSo there's really no formula there,\nunless you look at the cost,\n\n491\n00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.080\nyou're gonna have that.\n\n492\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.340\nBut you're kind of guessing\non the benefit, and\n\n493\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.190\nthat's projected return on investments.\n\n494\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.098\nSo there's no real formula for\nthat because you're using your brain.\n\n495\n00:25:08.098 --> 00:25:09.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n496\n00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:13.800\nAlthough you could use a cost benefit\nanalysis form to kind of get your\n\n497\n00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.460\nhands around it.\n\n498\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.220\nYou still wouldn't know.\n\n499\n00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.706\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could go online and look at,\n\n500\n00:25:16.706 --> 00:25:18.475\nsee what other Uber\ndrivers in your area make.\n\n501\n00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.220\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n502\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.020\n&gt;&gt; And use that information, but again, it\ndoes tie into the whole human intuition.\n\n503\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.920\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so your best guess,\nright, is your return on investment.\n\n504\n00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.632\nOr your projected return on investment.\n\n505\n00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:34.240\nWhen you're talking real return on\ninvestment, your project's done and\n\n506\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.860\nyou do have some finite numbers.\n\n507\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.578\nThe thing is is to kind of remember that\nyour calculator can help you some, but\n\n508\n00:25:40.578 --> 00:25:45.297\nyour calculator is going to come back and\nit's going to say negative 30% or\n\n509\n00:25:45.297 --> 00:25:48.730\nplus 30% or\nyou made 100% return on investment.\n\n510\n00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.280\nThat core number in reports\nis gonna be huge, but\n\n511\n00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.960\nyou might have to consider some\nhuman factors to your point.\n\n512\n00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.750\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n513\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.350\nI think that does about wrap it up for\n\n514\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.690\nthis particular episode unless you\nhave any other final thoughts?\n\n515\n00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.269\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n516\n00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.693\n&gt;&gt; All right, we were able to go ahead and\ntake a look at the different governing\n\n517\n00:26:05.693 --> 00:26:08.330\nbodies that are available and\ndifferent options we have.\n\n518\n00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.348\nAnd sometimes it might not be your option,\n\n519\n00:26:10.348 --> 00:26:13.556\nit might just be adhering to your\ncompany and what their culture is.\n\n520\n00:26:13.556 --> 00:26:15.761\nSo thank you for\nclarifying that, Dr. Stern.\n\n521\n00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:16.875\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n522\n00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.407\n&gt;&gt; And we did start to see some formulas.\n\n523\n00:26:19.407 --> 00:26:21.351\nI think we have a lot more formulas and\n\n524\n00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:24.390\ntools that we will be looking\nat throughout this series.\n\n525\n00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.638\nSo thank you guys for\nwatching but stay tuned.\n\n526\n00:26:26.638 --> 00:26:31.110\nWe have a lot more Green Belt\ntraining headed your way.\n\n527\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.797\nThat about wraps it up, so I'm gonna\nsign off as your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n528\n00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:39.820\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Tara van\nZansteren with SSD Global Solutions.\n\n529\n00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.810\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here ITProTV\n\n530\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:49.547\n[MUSIC]\n\n531\n00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:54.449\nThank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma:\nGreen Belt Certification Prep series.\n\n6\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.360\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.710\nIf you've been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.390\nwe've already taken a look at\nour process improvement basics.\n\n9\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.100\nWe ran out of a little time with the last\nepisode, so in this episode we are gonna\n\n10\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.640\nbe covering a part two and with us today\nwe have Dr. Terra Stern in the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.820\nThank you for joining us, Dr. Stern.\n\n12\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.750\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.\n\n13\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.204\n&gt;&gt; So where did we leave off?\n\n14\n00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:42.061\nI know you had said we would look at some\ninteresting tools to help us through this\n\n15\n00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:46.490\nbeginning of process improvement, but\nwhere are we gonna be starting today?\n\n16\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.294\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, let's go to my notes.\n\n17\n00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:54.630\nAnd as you mentioned,\nwe're gonna do Process Basics, Part Two.\n\n18\n00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.546\nAnd to just kind of recap,\nin the last session, we talked about,\n\n19\n00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:00.409\nwhat is process improvement?\n\n20\n00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.248\nAnd we determined that that's taking\nan existing activity and making it better,\n\n21\n00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:06.310\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n22\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.850\nAnd we talked about other\nprocess improvement programs.\n\n23\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.580\nAnd we also addressed return on\ninvestment projected versus actual.\n\n24\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n25\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.500\nwe said that this is what we\nthink our project could make,\n\n26\n00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.720\nsave or avoid spending,\nwhereas actual return on investment,\n\n27\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.770\nwe have the numbers and we know exactly\nwhat we made, saved or avoided spending.\n\n28\n00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.310\nAnd what we're gonna go through\ntoday is project charters versus\n\n29\n00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.861\nthe project report because those\nare two separate collaterals.\n\n30\n00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.739\nAnd we are gonna look\nat project planning and\n\n31\n00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.110\nhopefully the work breakdown structure,\nwhich is part of project planning.\n\n32\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.941\nSo, the first thing that I wanna talk\nabout is the project charter and\n\n33\n00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:53.880\nhow that is different than\na process improvement charter.\n\n34\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.890\nCharters are just a form,\nit's just a template.\n\n35\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.030\nThis comes up a lot on\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam as\n\n36\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.295\nwell as the Lean by itself, and Six Sigma\nexam, is what is the purpose of a charter?\n\n37\n00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:11.699\nSo, the first thing we wanna think about\nis the purpose of the charter is just to\n\n38\n00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.852\nget all the information\ncollected in one area, right?\n\n39\n00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:17.479\nAnd we're saying what we wanna do,\nwhy we wanna do it,\n\n40\n00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.580\nwho's going to be working\non that project with us.\n\n41\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.868\nWhen we know the problem and\nwe know the solution,\n\n42\n00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:28.805\nthen that's really just a straight\nproject charter because I'm gonna say\n\n43\n00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:33.294\nthis is who's gonna work with me,\nthis is why I wanna do it, right?\n\n44\n00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:37.211\nHowever sometimes we have the problem and\nwe don't know the solution, and\n\n45\n00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.830\nthat's where process improvement\ntools come in handy.\n\n46\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.720\nIf I know the problem, but I don't know\nthe solution, all I'm trying to get you to\n\n47\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.240\ndo on my project charter is say it's\nokay to work on that particular problem.\n\n48\n00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.660\nI need to time to reason this problem out,\nwhereas if I already know the answer,\n\n49\n00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.085\nmy project charter, even though\nthey have the same fields, name,\n\n50\n00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.830\nwho's gonna work on it,\nwhat are your constraints.\n\n51\n00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.770\nEven though they have the same fields,\nI already\n\n52\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.810\nhave it reasoned out in a regular project\ncharter what it is I want you to do.\n\n53\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.820\nIn a process improvement project charter,\nI know the problem,\n\n54\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.100\nI don't know the solution.\n\n55\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.628\nSo what I'm trying to get you to do after\nyou read my project charter is just say\n\n56\n00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:21.930\nhey, that's a worthwhile\nproblem to work on.\n\n57\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.146\nI think you should see how\nto handle that problem.\n\n58\n00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.572\n&gt;&gt; And for\nour process improvement charter,\n\n59\n00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:32.275\nthis is something that we would be\nsubmitting to our superiors for\n\n60\n00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:36.990\nbasically approval to verify that we're\ngoing through the proper channels before\n\n61\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.300\nwe just say, identify this as a potential\nproblem without getting any approval.\n\n62\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, so now, in a regular\nproject charter, you'd have to have\n\n63\n00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.680\npeople signing off, a multiple signing\noff sometimes, because you are asking,\n\n64\n00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.910\nI wanna spend x amount of money,\nI wanna spend x amount of time.\n\n65\n00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.360\nWhat I'm just trying to get you to say,\n\n66\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.880\nhey, it's okay to spend some\ntime working on this problem.\n\n67\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.827\nI don't have to give as much information,\nbut I do wanna remember that my process\n\n68\n00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:09.103\nimprovement project charter\nis like a proposal, and\n\n69\n00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:12.778\nI wanna make it interesting,\nand I want you to understand.\n\n70\n00:04:12.778 --> 00:04:16.124\nAnd that's why a lot of times it includes\nsomething called Projected Return\n\n71\n00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:16.868\non Investment.\n\n72\n00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:21.780\nAnd our last session we said\nProjected Return on Investment is\n\n73\n00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.708\nwhat I think we could make save or avoid\nspending if this project's successful.\n\n74\n00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.298\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; If I am able to make this activity\n\n75\n00:04:28.298 --> 00:04:31.770\nbetter, faster, and more cost effective,\nthis is what I can do.\n\n76\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Go ahead and strengthen your argument.\n\n77\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nwhereas an irregular project charter,\n\n78\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.720\nI'm actually part of what I'm asking\nyou for is the money and the time.\n\n79\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n80\n00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n81\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.410\nSo, if I know the problem,\n\n82\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.930\nand I know the solution, then,\nit's just a regular charter.\n\n83\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.020\nI just need to do it, right, and\nI move immediately to the project plan,\n\n84\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.370\nwhich we'll be talking\nabout here in a second.\n\n85\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.710\nIf I know the problem, but I don't know\nthe solution just trying to get you to let\n\n86\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.420\nme work on the problem, I don't\nreally have a project plan yet, but\n\n87\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.410\nat some point, all process improvements\nare going to become a project.\n\n88\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.420\nThat's our goal.\n\n89\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.810\nWe want a project that people say,\nhey, you can do it or not.\n\n90\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.310\nIn the meantime,\nwe just need the time to work on it.\n\n91\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.370\nWhat is a Project Charter?\n\n92\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.330\nNow this is process improvement or\nregular project charter.\n\n93\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.930\nIt clearly describes the problem, yet\n\n94\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.450\nconfirms that the team matches\nthe expectations of senior management.\n\n95\n00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.130\nSo a lot of times I've\nused project charters\n\n96\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.320\njust to kinda go back to if someone came\nin and asked me to do something else or\n\n97\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.710\nthey thought I was going\nin a different direction.\n\n98\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.760\nI can bring the charter back\nthat you've signed and said,\n\n99\n00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.380\nwell, this is what I thought we agreed to.\n\n100\n00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.090\nAnd it establishes a timeline, and\nit serves as a communication vehicle.\n\n101\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.650\nSo it does all those things.\n\n102\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.700\n&gt;&gt; And when you say communication vehicle,\n\n103\n00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.870\nI just wanna elaborate on\nthat a little bit more.\n\n104\n00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.310\nSo, would it specify who\nI needed to contact,\n\n105\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.840\nkind of like a hierarchy,\nor something like that?\n\n106\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.220\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwell it's sort of like your promo.\n\n107\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.110\nYou're kind of putting it out\nthere almost like a press release.\n\n108\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.925\nSo kind of think of it\nthat way like this is-\n\n109\n00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:08.602\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n110\n00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:11.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n111\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Again, it has the same fields.\n\n112\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.237\nThe process improvement one, again,\nI'm kind of repeating myself,\n\n113\n00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:20.784\nis just more of a proposal.\n\n114\n00:06:20.784 --> 00:06:26.146\nSo project charters can be informal and\nwhen I say informal that means you might\n\n115\n00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:31.560\nbe working in a company that has a project\ncharter form they want you to use.\n\n116\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.134\nLean Six Sigma is very high on.\n\n117\n00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:38.240\nIf there is a collateral there, if there\nis a form, if there is a template, use it.\n\n118\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.920\nNow if you have to add some thing to it,\nfine.\n\n119\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.420\nBut you don't know the hours that might\nhave gone into developing that charter.\n\n120\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.750\nSo some companies have one, and\neveryone just has to use the same form.\n\n121\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.870\nSome companies aren't\ninto project chartering.\n\n122\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.300\nSome companies don't\neven know what that is.\n\n123\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.635\nAnd so your project charter might take\nan informal form, such as an email, or\n\n124\n00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:02.550\nyou write it down in a report and\n\n125\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.380\nget signatures from there,\nbut not a specific thing.\n\n126\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.328\n&gt;&gt; That's [INAUDIBLE] letter,\nsomething that you use.\n\n127\n00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:08.631\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n128\n00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.437\nAnd so,\nif you did an informal project charter,\n\n129\n00:07:11.437 --> 00:07:13.770\nyou still wanna have those components.\n\n130\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.950\nWhy am I doing this?\n\n131\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:15.830\nWho's gonna help me?\n\n132\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.350\nHow long is it gonna take?\n\n133\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.955\nAnd you want some kind of acknowledgment,\na read receipt or\n\n134\n00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:24.470\nsomething because once again,\nyou're gonna constantly be going back\n\n135\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.350\nto that project charter saying,\nthis is what we agreed on.\n\n136\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.857\n&gt;&gt; So informal.\n\n137\n00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:30.406\nWe're not talking about just\nwriting it on a cocktail napkin.\n\n138\n00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:32.504\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n139\n00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:34.508\n[LAUGH] Not quite that informal,\nbut it could be.\n\n140\n00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:36.531\nI mean you never know, right?\n\n141\n00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:41.784\nSo when we talk about what would make\na good Lean Six Sigma project in a perfect\n\n142\n00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:47.961\nworld, right, because sometimes things get\nassigned to Six Sigma, or Lean Six Sigma.\n\n143\n00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:50.700\nAnd they really,\nthey really are just projects.\n\n144\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.465\nWe already know what\nwe are supposed to do.\n\n145\n00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:55.379\nAnd so, sometimes the tools are kind\nof wasted because we know what we're\n\n146\n00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:56.040\nsupposed to do.\n\n147\n00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.369\nWe should go to project plan,\n\n148\n00:07:57.369 --> 00:07:59.930\nfigure out who's gonna do\nwhat when it happens, right?\n\n149\n00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.600\nSo in a perfect world,\nthere's no known solution, At this point.\n\n150\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.265\nOkay, sorry.\n\n151\n00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:11.680\n[LAUGH] The root cause is not known,\nand this is really huge.\n\n152\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.541\nWe don't know why.\n\n153\n00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:15.940\nWe don't know how to solve the problem.\n\n154\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.790\nBut we don't even know\nwhy is it happening.\n\n155\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.670\nThe problem's complex and\nneeds statistical analysis.\n\n156\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.480\nNow that's gonna fall more\non the Six Sigma side.\n\n157\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.930\nBecause remember Lean Six Sigma and\ncertainly the product that I teach,\n\n158\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.020\nLeaner Six Sigma,\nsays sometimes statistical analysis isn't\n\n159\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.010\nas important as Six Sigma\nwould maybe make it.\n\n160\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.300\nThe problem is part of a process,\n\n161\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.100\nso it could be something that's\njust a component of that process.\n\n162\n00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.600\nIt's something that we know\nis gonna be repeatable,\n\n163\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.390\nbecause what's gonna happen is\nif I solve that problem and\n\n164\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.820\nI figure out how it's gonna help, then\nI can just use it over and over again.\n\n165\n00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.237\nThe defect can be defined,\nthat's another one.\n\n166\n00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:00.210\nNow, it doesn't have to have all these\ncomponents, these are just ideas.\n\n167\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.050\nAnd this sheet, what makes a good\nlooking Lean Six Sigma project,\n\n168\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.570\nis one of the sheets that is\nincluded in your student package.\n\n169\n00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.710\nSo kinda keep that in mind and\nit doesn't have to be all of these things.\n\n170\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.770\nTypical exam questions are gonna say,\nname three or four things, right?\n\n171\n00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.840\nSo they're not gonna expect\nyou to name all of them.\n\n172\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.350\nSo these are some of them.\n\n173\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.950\nThe project will take 3-6 months.\n\n174\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.440\nThis is another big difference\nbetween Lean Six Sigma and Six Sigma.\n\n175\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.855\nLean Six Sigma encourages\nyou to take projects,\n\n176\n00:09:30.855 --> 00:09:32.480\nnow sometimes it doesn't\nwork out that way, but\n\n177\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.370\nit encourages you to take projects\nthat you can finish within 3-6 months.\n\n178\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:40.610\nSix Sigma projects can be two or\nthree year projects.\n\n179\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.740\nNow the new kind of thinking, the more\ninnovative thinking is even in those two\n\n180\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.670\nto three year projects, it's still\nbetter to chunk it out into two or\n\n181\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.500\nthree months, and\ndo a lot of mini projects.\n\n182\n00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.690\nThat kind of protects you\nbecause if leadership changes,\n\n183\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.620\nthen you've got something to show, right?\n\n184\n00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.570\nYou're not like in the middle\nof a measure or something, yeah.\n\n185\n00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nwould you kind of define those?\n\n186\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.760\nCould you use the terminology sprints like\nwe might have seen for smaller segments,\n\n187\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.130\nor is that too long to\nreally define it as that?\n\n188\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.970\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that I think\nis interesting about Agile in doing\n\n189\n00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.740\nthe sprints is that that\nnaturally parallels with\n\n190\n00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.650\nwhat Lean Six Sigma wants you to do.\n\n191\n00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.580\nNow, sprints are typically three,\nfour weeks.\n\n192\n00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.340\nSometimes in some environments,\nthey're only two weeks.\n\n193\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.820\nBut that's the kind of thinking, is that\nif you can just kind of get through a body\n\n194\n00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.650\nof work, and then you have\nthat body of work to present.\n\n195\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:40.812\nLean Six Sigma promotes that\nover really super long projects\n\n196\n00:10:40.812 --> 00:10:45.991\nthat you can't really document that you-\n&gt;&gt; As long as you can segment them and\n\n197\n00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:49.540\nbreak them down into smaller,\nmore manageable chunks maybe?\n\n198\n00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's very lean.\n\n199\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.804\nSprints are very lean.\n\n200\n00:10:52.804 --> 00:10:53.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\nVery lean.\n\n201\n00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.410\nOkay, got it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n202\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.620\nthe other thing that makes a good Lean Six\nSigma project is that data is available.\n\n203\n00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.890\nNow I'm gonna show you some tricks\na little bit later in the series,\n\n204\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.240\nwhere if you don't have a lot of data, how\nyou can still do a process improvement.\n\n205\n00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.270\nBut certainly when\nyou're first looking for\n\n206\n00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.240\na Lean Six Sigma project, what you want to\nbe looking for are things that have data,\n\n207\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.250\nthat you have something that\nyou can kind of fall back on.\n\n208\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.620\nSo again, in a testing environment,\nLean test,\n\n209\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.350\nSix Sigma test, or\nthe Lean Six Sigma test,\n\n210\n00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.790\nthey are not going to expect\nthat you know all of these.\n\n211\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.380\nBut what I would suggest is that when\nyou look at your student package,\n\n212\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.180\npick a few that resonate with you.\n\n213\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.310\nAnd then that way, you'll be able\nto answer the questions related to\n\n214\n00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.490\nwhat makes a good Lean Six Sigma project.\n\n215\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.080\nThere are a number of different forums and\n\n216\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.870\ntemplates that you can use for\nproject charters.\n\n217\n00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.000\nIf your company already\nhas a project charter,\n\n218\n00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.380\nyou want to use that, even if you\nhave to add something on to it.\n\n219\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.397\nTraditional project charters look\nlike forms and they have fields and\n\n220\n00:11:59.397 --> 00:12:03.891\nthat's what you, if you're taking\nthe class through SSD Global Solutions,\n\n221\n00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:06.905\nyou will see a formal\ntraditional project charter.\n\n222\n00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:10.750\nAnd the reason for that is that's\nstill what most companies are using.\n\n223\n00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:15.790\nHowever, there are some very other\nclever forms and templates, and\n\n224\n00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.090\none of them is something called the A3.\n\n225\n00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.050\nNow, the A3 actually has a number of\ndifferent ways it can be presented,\n\n226\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.260\nbut the idea's that you can get\neverything on one page, right.\n\n227\n00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.540\nIt used to be a page that you printed out.\n\n228\n00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.360\nNow it's on the computer, so\nit might still be a number of pages but\n\n229\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.910\nyou can go over to Excel and\nkind of look at these different areas.\n\n230\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.460\nAnd you'll see some of the headings here,\nyour scope, your goal.\n\n231\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.110\nAnd we're gonna be talking about all of\nthose things, the customer requirements.\n\n232\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:52.690\nWhat I want you to concentrate on now\nis that the project charter is a form,\n\n233\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.590\nor a template, that you submit to get\napproval to work on your project.\n\n234\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:01.830\nAnd that would be if you\nknew the project goals,\n\n235\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.450\nyou're just trying to get the money and\nthe resources and the timeline approved.\n\n236\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.710\nIf you don't know, again,\n\n237\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:13.090\nyou're just trying to get permission\nto work on the actual problem.\n\n238\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.860\nSo the form that you use\nisn't really as important as\n\n239\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.110\nthe audience that you're presenting it to,\nyou wanna make sure that they understand.\n\n240\n00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.463\nAnd if you're doing the informal project\ncharter, which we just talked about,\n\n241\n00:13:26.463 --> 00:13:28.831\nthen you might still\nwanna go look at an A3 or\n\n242\n00:13:28.831 --> 00:13:33.396\na traditional project form just to make\nsure you're including all the components.\n\n243\n00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:34.068\n&gt;&gt; Covering all the fields, okay.\n\n244\n00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:35.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:41.730\nAnd again, you know the answer,\nproject charter.\n\n246\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.800\nI know I keep driving this home, but\n\n247\n00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.980\nthere's a number of questions on the test\nabout what is a project charter?\n\n248\n00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.830\nWhat is a process\nimprovement project charter?\n\n249\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.739\nSo this may seem really redundant, but\n\n250\n00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:56.896\nit's just such a huge piece\nof all three of those tests.\n\n251\n00:13:59.465 --> 00:14:06.190\nNow, the project report has a lot of\nthe same dynamics as the project charter.\n\n252\n00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.870\nBut at this point what you're\ndoing is a narrative and\n\n253\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.360\nyou're collecting information\nabout the project.\n\n254\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.810\nSo the project charter is one form, And\nthe project report is your second form.\n\n255\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.050\nSometimes, the people you're working with\nare gonna be very interested in your\n\n256\n00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.240\nproject report.\n\n257\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.630\nSometimes they're just gonna fast-forward\nto the end and read your summary.\n\n258\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.980\nThey're not gonna really care.\n\n259\n00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.089\nSo what I want you to think\nof as the project report,\n\n260\n00:14:30.089 --> 00:14:33.670\nit's another conceptual thing\nthat will help you with the test.\n\n261\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.910\nIn essence, the project report is more for\nyou than it is for them.\n\n262\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.410\nYou're trying to collect the information,\nmake sure that your logic's clear,\n\n263\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.880\nthat you're doing everything,\nthat you've covered all your bases.\n\n264\n00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.220\nNow, there are gonna be times where\nyou're working with a company that has,\n\n265\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.990\nagain, a formal reporting process, and\nagain, you're gonna wanna use their form.\n\n266\n00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.700\nBut a lot of times you're just\ngonna write it up as a narrative.\n\n267\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.750\n&gt;&gt; And you would probably\nstore this in a centrally, or\n\n268\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.550\nshare it out with your co-workers or\nproject team members.\n\n269\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.393\nSo if they had a question, you weren't\navailable, they wouldn't be wasting time.\n\n270\n00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:12.417\nAnd they could look at this and say,\nlook, this is what we need to be doing or\n\n271\n00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:13.700\nthis is who we need to contact.\n\n272\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.780\nSo it's just kind of documentation,\nit's not always fun to write but\n\n273\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.980\nit's good to have.\n\n274\n00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.060\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and a lot of companies\nhave something called a PMO,\n\n275\n00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.890\na project management office,\nthat actually formally collects that.\n\n276\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.020\nWhat I think that you wanna keep in mind\nis that even if you don't have that,\n\n277\n00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.610\njust for yourself you wanna collect that.\n\n278\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.775\nYou wanna always be able to produce\nthat information if someone asks.\n\n279\n00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:41.090\nSo the project report\nis the actual report.\n\n280\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.670\nIt's a narrative.\n\n281\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.447\nAnd the narrative, typically,\nwill follow, in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n282\n00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.594\none of these types of models.\n\n283\n00:15:49.594 --> 00:15:53.371\nPDCA, DMAIC, or Design for Six Sigma.\n\n284\n00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:57.450\nSo PDCA is Plan Do Check Act,\nwe're gonna look at that briefly, and\n\n285\n00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.254\nthen we'll go into depth\na little bit latter.\n\n286\n00:16:00.254 --> 00:16:05.380\nDMAIC is the flagship model of\nLean Six Sixma, and also Six Sigma.\n\n287\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.300\nSo kind of an interesting thing is,\non the Lean side,\n\n288\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.420\nif you're just taking the Lean test or\neven the project management exam.\n\n289\n00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.070\nYou wanna concentrate all of\nyour efforts on the PDCA.\n\n290\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.140\nIf you're taking just the Six Sigma,\n\n291\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.520\nyou want to concentrate most of\nyour efforts on the DMAIC model.\n\n292\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.260\nIf you're doing Lean Six Sigma,\nyou're looking at both, but\n\n293\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.040\nDMAIC is still kind of\nthe king of the hill.\n\n294\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.585\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good to know.\n\n295\n00:16:29.585 --> 00:16:31.666\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the design for Six Sigma,\n\n296\n00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:34.528\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout that particular model.\n\n297\n00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:38.152\nBut just briefly, that's when you\ndon't have an existing process, and\n\n298\n00:16:38.152 --> 00:16:40.730\nyou're building something from scratch.\n\n299\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.910\nSo Lean Six Sigma talks about it.\n\n300\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.150\nThere's a lot of Lean Six Sigma\ntools that you use.\n\n301\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.920\nBut technically design for\nSix Sigma is a whole different program.\n\n302\n00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.520\nAnd the reason it's different is\nbecause it has that design factor.\n\n303\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.100\nSo you have to have a phase in\nthere to actually build one.\n\n304\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.470\n&gt;&gt; Creating a new prototype, or\na new product, or a new process, and\n\n305\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.020\nit just hasn't been done before.\n\n306\n00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.910\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n307\n00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.204\nA Lean Six Sigma model that\nwe discuss later in depth,\n\n308\n00:17:05.204 --> 00:17:10.176\nbut you can start using right now,\nis something called PDCA.\n\n309\n00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:13.270\nAnd that stands for plan, do, check, act.\n\n310\n00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.980\nAnd it feels pretty intuitive.\n\n311\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.730\nI'm gonna plan my work.\n\n312\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.840\nI'm gonna do it.\n\n313\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.890\nThen I'm gonna check and\nmake sure that it's okay.\n\n314\n00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.826\nAnd then I'm gonna go back and\nI'm gonna either act,\n\n315\n00:17:22.826 --> 00:17:25.641\nmove forward and\nfollow through with the project.\n\n316\n00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:28.439\nI'm gonna abandon,\nlike I'm never gonna do this again.\n\n317\n00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:32.710\nOr I might adapt it, which means I'm\njust gonna go back and tweak it up.\n\n318\n00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.290\nSo it seems pretty intuitive.\n\n319\n00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.530\nHowever, it's a very\nhistorically significant\n\n320\n00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.648\nmodel because it was a classified\ndocument in World War II.\n\n321\n00:17:42.648 --> 00:17:44.205\n&gt;&gt; That's really interesting.\n\n322\n00:17:44.205 --> 00:17:45.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n323\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.960\nSo sometimes when we're\nlooking at the simple stuff,\n\n324\n00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.600\njust keep in mind,\nit wasn't always that simple.\n\n325\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.020\nBut of course in my\nprogram Leaner Six Sigma,\n\n326\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.320\nwe love it because it just makes so\nmuch sense.\n\n327\n00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.750\nSo I just want to take the PDCA and\napply it to certification,\n\n328\n00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.460\nbecause we are gonna come back to\nthis model when we talk about models.\n\n329\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.233\nThere are a lot of questions\nrelated to the PDCA in the Lean,\n\n330\n00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:12.775\nthe Six Sigma, and\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam.\n\n331\n00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:18.320\nHowever, keep in mind PDCA was,\nno pun intended, leans more towards Lean.\n\n332\n00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.200\nIt's very prevalent in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n333\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.430\nAnd Six Sigma does recognize this model.\n\n334\n00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.502\n&gt;&gt; So pay attention,\nin other words, right?\n\n335\n00:18:25.502 --> 00:18:27.030\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really, really,\n\n336\n00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:28.220\nthis is important.\n\n337\n00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.080\nSo if I were applying\nthe PDCA to certification,\n\n338\n00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.570\nthe first thing I would do is plan.\n\n339\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.190\nAnd one component of the plan, not all\nthe components of the plan, but one,\n\n340\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:39.060\nis I'm gonna have to come\nup with my timeline, right.\n\n341\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.140\nNow my suggestion is that when you come up\nwith a timeline you divide it by four, so\n\n342\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.900\nthat you can have four\nsegments that you can plan.\n\n343\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.124\nIt makes planning just\na little bit easier.\n\n344\n00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:53.060\nWhat do you realistically think that\nyou can do in that period of time?\n\n345\n00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.670\nRight, now once you actually plan it,\nand we're really good planners but\n\n346\n00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.890\nsometimes we don't execute.\n\n347\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.805\nAnd this is another place where\nthis model comes in very handy,\n\n348\n00:19:01.805 --> 00:19:03.520\ncuz you can keep yourself on target.\n\n349\n00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.780\nI'm gonna plan it, now I'm gonna go do it.\n\n350\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.940\nSo now I'm gonna do it, but at some point,\nand I would have determined this during my\n\n351\n00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.890\nplan, at some point I\nwanna check up on myself.\n\n352\n00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.060\nI wanna take them temperature,\n\n353\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.460\nI wanna make sure that I'm\nreally on the right track.\n\n354\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.409\nIf I'm on the right track,\nI'm gonna just continue doing it,\n\n355\n00:19:19.409 --> 00:19:20.868\nwhich is another word for act.\n\n356\n00:19:20.868 --> 00:19:24.437\nIf I'm not on the right track,\nI may abandon the idea altogether and\n\n357\n00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:26.300\ngo back to plan, right?\n\n358\n00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.280\nAnd then, if I like it, but\nI just need to fix it, tweak it up,\n\n359\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.290\nthen I would go to adapt.\n\n360\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.420\nSo in the plan, technically, I would\nneed a project charter to move forward.\n\n361\n00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.940\nSo, in this case,\nif I'm trying to study for an exam,\n\n362\n00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.570\nI might really have to send\na little email to my boss and\n\n363\n00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:48.250\nsay, I'm planning to do this, and see\nif I could maybe do it on company time.\n\n364\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.600\nI'm not really sure.\n\n365\n00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.610\nSo this might be an example of\nan informal project charter.\n\n366\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.520\nI might need to run it by my family or\n\n367\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.950\nsomeone to let them know this\nis what I'm planning to do.\n\n368\n00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.780\nKeep in mind the project charter needs\nto say what it is that you wanna do, and\n\n369\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.220\nit might have a project plan.\n\n370\n00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.180\nYou might have gone ahead in this case,\nin this scenario,\n\n371\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.150\nmapped out what you're gonna accomplish\nin each one of these four segments.\n\n372\n00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.160\nIn execute,\nyou're really just working the plan.\n\n373\n00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.710\nSo if you did a really good plan,\n\n374\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.170\nall you're really doing is\nmoving through those steps.\n\n375\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:25.810\nAnd then check, a lot of times what people\ndon't think about is in the planning,\n\n376\n00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.550\nyou need to think about, well,\nwhat is it that I want to check?\n\n377\n00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.670\nWhat is it that I want to look at, right?\n\n378\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.700\nAnd then again, you get to the bottom and\n\n379\n00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.600\nyour report would explain why you act,\nabandon, or adapt.\n\n380\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.520\n&gt;&gt; So Dr. Stern,\nafter our project plan has been approved,\n\n381\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.290\nwhat would be the next step?\n\n382\n00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.340\n&gt;&gt; Well then, what we we're gonna wanna\ndo is make the actual project plan.\n\n383\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.630\nNow I should point out that,\n\n384\n00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:55.150\nin the PDCA model, I may have done\nthis in the first phase of the model.\n\n385\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.400\nSome other models that we're looking at,\n\n386\n00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.000\nthat project plan doesn't happen\nuntil the fourth or fifth stage.\n\n387\n00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.810\nIn the PDCA model, we probably would\nleave plan with our actual project plan.\n\n388\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.370\nIn other models we won't\nleave until three or\n\n389\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.670\nfour steps into the model after\nwe've kind of reasoned it out.\n\n390\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.530\nBut at some point,\nno matter what we're doing,\n\n391\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.490\nwe're gonna end up with a project plan.\n\n392\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.580\nAnd typically, Lean Six Sigma\nprefers something called the work\n\n393\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:27.530\nbreakdown structure,\nthe acronym being WBS.\n\n394\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n395\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.540\n&gt;&gt; And you've seen these before.\n\n396\n00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.212\nSo for example, if you're on Wikipedia and\nyou looked up something like IT design,\n\n397\n00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:39.840\nall right, it's gonna tell you all the\nstuff that you can see in that segment.\n\n398\n00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.240\nSo a lot of times work\nbreakdown structures used for\n\n399\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.570\neducational purposes as\njust an overall outline.\n\n400\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.400\nAnd notice on this outline,\nit's gonna give you an overview,\n\n401\n00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.090\nit's gonna give you a history.\n\n402\n00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:55.180\nAnd then design principles starts\ngetting broken down into smaller chunks.\n\n403\n00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.130\nSo 3.1, then there's 3.1.1.\n\n404\n00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.477\n&gt;&gt; Pretty specific.\n\n405\n00:21:59.477 --> 00:22:06.330\n&gt;&gt; Very specific, and if I had something\nthat went under 3.1.1 it'd be 3.1.2.\n\n406\n00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.320\nNow the reason why we want to break\ndown things in chunks is that\n\n407\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.387\nthat way we can look at it\nin a more concise way and\n\n408\n00:22:13.387 --> 00:22:17.430\ncome up with a time and a budget for\neach one of those items.\n\n409\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.750\nBut this is just an example that you see\nwork breakdown structures all the time.\n\n410\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.670\nSo it's nothing scary.\n\n411\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.910\n&gt;&gt; And this would be kind of a visual one.\n\n412\n00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.250\nI'm not gonna keep this slide up for\nvery long, I just want you to get an idea.\n\n413\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.530\nI'm taking a main idea and\nI'm just breaking it down.\n\n414\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:34.458\n&gt;&gt; Just a different format.\n\n415\n00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:40.923\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so WBSs can be use a lot\nof times for strategic thinking.\n\n416\n00:22:40.923 --> 00:22:43.972\nAnd the reason why I say that\nis if I get up one morning and\n\n417\n00:22:43.972 --> 00:22:47.370\nI have a to do list,\nI could come up with my four major things.\n\n418\n00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.640\nIt's a great time management tool too.\n\n419\n00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.680\nI could sit down and I could say, this are\nthe four things that I need to do today.\n\n420\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.333\nAnd then go back and say under 1,\nthere's a 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.\n\n421\n00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.922\nAnd by the way, under 1.3,\nI better do a 1.3.1 and\n\n422\n00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:06.900\na 1.3.2 I want to break it down as much\nas I can, because that's gonna help me\n\n423\n00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.910\nfigure out how long things are gonna take,\nhow much those things are gonna cost.\n\n424\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.110\nWork breakdown structure is a good\nthing to do for your study plan.\n\n425\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.720\nWe talked about doing the plan do,\ncheck, act.\n\n426\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.710\nJust sitting down and saying these are\nthe things that I need to study, and then\n\n427\n00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.830\nsaying, here's the high level concepts,\nand then breaking that down, 1.1, 1.2.\n\n428\n00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Really granular.\n\n429\n00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nI think that takes some pressure off.\n\n430\n00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.270\nBecause if you've got a big body of\nknowledge to study, you can say, hey,\n\n431\n00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:38.506\nI'm just gonna knock\nout my 1.1.3.20 today.\n\n432\n00:23:38.506 --> 00:23:41.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Give yourself a little goal.\n\n433\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n434\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.740\nSo, let's go back to our example that we\nused for the PDCA for getting certified.\n\n435\n00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:54.521\nIf I did it on a work breakdown structure\nas opposed to just using that whole PDCA.\n\n436\n00:23:54.521 --> 00:23:57.872\nKeeping in mind that I might have ended\nup with work breakdown structure when I\n\n437\n00:23:57.872 --> 00:23:58.399\nleft plan.\n\n438\n00:23:58.399 --> 00:23:59.639\nIt's very possible.\n\n439\n00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:02.341\nSo determine timeline would be one.\n\n440\n00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:05.340\nTwo, organize my materials.\n\n441\n00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.280\nThree, find an area to study.\n\n442\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.950\nWe mentioned in another session,\n\n443\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.930\nthat a great study trick\nis to go stage your area.\n\n444\n00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:14.520\nSo that you don't have to study that day,\nyou're just staging it.\n\n445\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.886\nYou're just putting everything together.\n\n446\n00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:20.400\nAnd then number four design the matrix and\nmeasurements to know if my plan\n\n447\n00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.280\nis working, so that's kind of\nthe flow that it would follow.\n\n448\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.600\nNow, when I'm looking at\nI wanna break it down.\n\n449\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.070\nI'm saying determine timeline right and\n\n450\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:35.000\nmy 1.1 is figure out when I want\nthat certification in my hand.\n\n451\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.735\nBut then if I went down further.\n\n452\n00:24:37.735 --> 00:24:43.970\n1.1.1 and I divide by four, 1.1.2 I\ncheck results after the first session.\n\n453\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.560\nThis would all be part of my plan,\nand 1.2, I'd alert my family and\n\n454\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.350\nfriends, that I won't be\navailable during that time.\n\n455\n00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.500\n&gt;&gt; Facebook, I'm signing off.\n\n456\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly true.\n\n457\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.540\n&gt;&gt; So, Work Breakdown Structure is\nsort of a magical tool in a way,\n\n458\n00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.530\nbecause it's used in Lean Six Sigma\nto do my project plan.\n\n459\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:07.213\nWhat I want you to think of,\nas far as the exam is concerned,\n\n460\n00:25:07.213 --> 00:25:10.615\nis WBS in this sense is nothing\nmore than a to-do list.\n\n461\n00:25:10.615 --> 00:25:14.656\nHowever, I can I can use it for\n\n462\n00:25:14.656 --> 00:25:19.200\na number of just to get organize.\n\n463\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.280\nI can use it write my paper, right?\n\n464\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.240\nBut in the project plan, when I seen\nto do by breaking it down into those\n\n465\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.540\nsmall chunks, I can now go back and\nbaseline my project.\n\n466\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.130\nAnd what that basically\nmeans is that I can tell you\n\n467\n00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.960\nhow long ps this project gonna take and\nhow much time is it going to.\n\n468\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.090\nHow much is it gonna cost?\n\n469\n00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.850\nAnd how long is that going to take?\n\n470\n00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.920\nBecause I can go through each\none of those tiny objects and\n\n471\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.940\nsay it's gonna cost x amount of dollars,\nand I can just add up the money, right?\n\n472\n00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.550\nThen I can go back and I can look at time,\n\n473\n00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.460\nthere's some things that\ncan be done together.\n\n474\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.370\nSo for example if I'm waiting for\na signature for\n\n475\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.318\n24 hours I'm obviously\ngonna be doing things.\n\n476\n00:26:00.318 --> 00:26:02.120\nIn the in-between, right?\n\n477\n00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.750\nAnd then I can add up my time.\n\n478\n00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.670\nSo that's a little bit about\nproject planning and your most\n\n479\n00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.640\nimportant tool in project planning is\nyour WBS, your work breakdown structure.\n\n480\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for that.\n\n481\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.030\nIn this episode, we were able to\nlook at our project charter and\n\n482\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.540\nhow it differentiates between\nour process improvement charter.\n\n483\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.250\nWe were introduced to some planning and\n\n484\n00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.530\nthen we also saw our,\nwe're breakdown structure.\n\n485\n00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.880\nYou mentioned different types of\nmetrics that we may be learning about.\n\n486\n00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.620\nSo I think that's what's coming up next.\n\n487\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.670\nSo don't go anywhere.\n\n488\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.210\nWe have some really great metrics ahead.\n\n489\n00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.970\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this episode.\n\n490\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.200\nAnd your host,\nCherokee Boose And this is Dr.\n\n491\n00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.660\nVanzant Stern with SSD Global Solutions.\n\n492\n00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.031\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.500\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n7\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.880\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.980\nIn this episode, we'll be looking at\nsome lean six sigma metrics basics.\n\n9\n00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.090\nWith us today we have\nDoctor Terra Stern in the studios.\n\n10\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.420\nThank you for being with us, Doctor.\n\n11\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.400\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.535\n&gt;&gt; So, we're going to begin.\n\n13\n00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:33.600\nWhat type of metrics\nare really important and\n\n14\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.810\nwhat should we be using to make sure\nwe're being effective in our processes?\n\n15\n00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, I think one of\nthe things that's really important\n\n16\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.230\nabout this section is this is probably of\n\n17\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.400\nall lean six sigma program's the part\nthat is the most complicated for people.\n\n18\n00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.980\nNow my company teaches something\ncalled leaner six sigma.\n\n19\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.273\nSo I'm going to teach you the concepts\nin a much easier way than you might get\n\n20\n00:00:58.273 --> 00:00:59.919\nthem from another program.\n\n21\n00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.093\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like the sound of that.\n\n22\n00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.000\n[LAUGH] I don't object at all.\n\n23\n00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n24\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.960\nBut I want to point out,\n\n25\n00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.410\nlike in your student package that you\nwill have kind of the longer way.\n\n26\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.060\nMy theory is that if you\nunderstand the concept and\n\n27\n00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.340\nit's certainly on the lean\nsix sigma exams as well.\n\n28\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.520\nThen the formulas and all that other\nstuff will make a little bit more sense.\n\n29\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.220\nSo this session is gonna be more\nconceptual than anything else.\n\n30\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.440\nAnd then if you need more information,\ngo to your student package and\n\n31\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.940\nyou'll see the actual formulas and\nstatistics behind things.\n\n32\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And if you really wanna square things\n\n33\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.975\nand minus them by one and\nthen times them by the fourth power.\n\n34\n00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:35.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're going\n\n35\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.420\nto have the materials to do that.\n\n36\n00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.200\nWe've already talked about\nreturn on investment.\n\n37\n00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.800\nBut I just want to briefly\nremind you of that because\n\n38\n00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.410\nit will make the other\nstatistics seem a lot simpler.\n\n39\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.210\nBut we're gonna look at Sigma,\nwe're gonna look at cost of poor quality,\n\n40\n00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.400\nwe're gonna look at DPUs, DPMOs, Cpks,\n\n41\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.700\nCp, Cycle Time and measures of central\ntendency which is Mean, Mode and Median.\n\n42\n00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.720\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nthat looks like a menu of alphabet soup.\n\n43\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and the thing is this\n\n44\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.800\nis the hardest, when people get to\nthis section, they kind of freak.\n\n45\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.910\nBut at SSD Global where we\nteach leaner six sigma,\n\n46\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.020\nI'm gonna show you the easy way to\ndo all of this stuff, so no worries.\n\n47\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.820\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n48\n00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so as a reminder,\n\n49\n00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.530\none unit of measurement was\nreturn on investment, right?\n\n50\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.610\nNow the reason why we even care is because\nin order to show a process improvement,\n\n51\n00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.020\nwe have to have a baseline.\n\n52\n00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.990\nWe have to be able to say,\nhey, this is where we started.\n\n53\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.570\nA good place to start is\nreturn on investment.\n\n54\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.890\nHowever, a lot of times we don't\nhave a return on investment figure.\n\n55\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.300\nSo we have to use other measurements.\n\n56\n00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.150\nSo the first thing I want you to think\nabout is all these other measurements\n\n57\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.950\nwe're looking at, it's nothing more\nthan if you chose return on investment.\n\n58\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.607\nSo for example, as the reminder for\nthe formula, we're looking at (Net\n\n59\n00:02:56.607 --> 00:03:03.010\nProfit / Cost of Investment) and then we\nmultiply that by 100 to get a percentage.\n\n60\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.665\nAnd the example that we used in the other\nsession is if you bought a car for\n\n61\n00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:12.040\n$1,200 and you sold it for\n$1,800 your net profit was $600 and so\n\n62\n00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.790\nyour return on investment\nwould be calculated like this.\n\n63\n00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.418\nInvestment $1,200, net profit $600, and\n\n64\n00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:21.510\nagain this is kind of a reminder to\nkinda get back in the swing of this.\n\n65\n00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.390\nSo if I did the formula I had\na 50% return on investment, right?\n\n66\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.910\nSo on the flip side,\nif I sold my stock for $1,200 but\n\n67\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.260\nI purchased it for $2,000 then I have\na negative return on investment.\n\n68\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.560\nBecause I'm still using that same formula,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.510\nSo now I have a negative.\n\n70\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.630\nSo, once again we're not doing\nanything more than that.\n\n71\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.700\nI wanna show you the current picture,\nthis is what we're making now.\n\n72\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.880\nI wanna show you the picture after\nI made my process improvement.\n\n73\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.580\nNow, this is what we're making\non return on investment.\n\n74\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.300\nIt's just there's other\nways to look at that.\n\n75\n00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460\nKeep in mind that lean six\nsigma return on investment.\n\n76\n00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.090\nWe wanna make things better, faster,\n\n77\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.680\nmore cost-effective and\nthat it's still about cost-effectiveness.\n\n78\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.800\nSo, at some point, even if you\nuse one of these other tools and\n\n79\n00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.690\nthis is really important,\nto get your current picture,\n\n80\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.810\nthat that's the measurement for\nyour current picture?\n\n81\n00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.800\nIt's still gonna come back to\nreturn on investment at some point.\n\n82\n00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.090\nThat's why that keeps coming up.\n\n83\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because no matter what\n\n84\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.500\nI use to measure something-\n&gt;&gt; Imagine that.\n\n85\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm still gonna come back to,\nwhat did you make me-\n\n86\n00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.710\n&gt;&gt; It all boils down to money.\n\n87\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.395\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n88\n00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:29.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What did you make save, or\n\n89\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.510\navoid me spending?\n\n90\n00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.410\nThis is a reminder that if you're\ntaking the Six Sigma Exam,\n\n91\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.520\nyou also need to know the formulas\nof the things that I'm showing you.\n\n92\n00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.420\nAnd those formulas are gonna\nbe in your student package.\n\n93\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.140\nLean, not as much, there's one or two.\n\n94\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.610\nWe have those starred in your\nstudent package, like if you're\n\n95\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.100\njust taking the Lean Exam, here's\nthe formulas that you need to memorize.\n\n96\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.130\nLean Six Sigma, remember the concept\nis more important than the metric\n\n97\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.280\nbecause we're saying that\nthe software does the heavy lifting.\n\n98\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.100\nExcel is so good and is another reminder,\nthe reason why Six Sigma and\n\n99\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.690\nLean are so statistically, they lean so\n\n100\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.520\nmuch towards statistics is a lot of these\nprograms were developed in the 1980s and\n\n101\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.870\nthere just wasn't the statistical\nsoftware that we have now.\n\n102\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.870\nAnd you had to know this.\n\n103\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.191\nIn fact, some of the very first versions\nof Minitab, a very popular statistical\n\n104\n00:05:22.191 --> 00:05:26.381\nprogram, you had to do this thing at\nthe dot prompt, so if you didn't know your\n\n105\n00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.887\nstatistics, you wouldn't be able to-\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n106\n00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:30.770\nthat's what I was going to ask you also.\n\n107\n00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.700\nA lot of IT vendors, when you go and sit\nin the booth to take the certification,\n\n108\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.340\nthey lock the computer down, and\nyou're not allowed to use a calculator.\n\n109\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.560\nDo we need to be aware of that,\n\n110\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.620\nor will we be allowed to be using\na calculator for these exams?\n\n111\n00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so for most six sigma exams,\nthey let you bring in a calculator.\n\n112\n00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Most Lean exams don't, we don't care.\n\n113\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.670\nWell, I shouldn't say all\nLean Six Sigma vendors don't care.\n\n114\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.130\nOur tests are all online, so\nyou can use all of your study materials.\n\n115\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.430\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So any resources that you have\n\n116\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.280\navailable.\n\n117\n00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.730\nNow however, the test that you take\nthrough our company SSD Global Solution\n\n118\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.620\nis a timed test, so that's the only\nthing that you have to worry about.\n\n119\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.260\nBut yeah, on the six sigma ones where\nyou're supposed to know the formulas,\n\n120\n00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.000\nyou usually can bring your calculators.\n\n121\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n122\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.679\n&gt;&gt; Most vendors.\n\n123\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.830\nOkay, the other thing I want you to be\naware of and this is another conceptual\n\n124\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.350\nthing, is that some things in lean six\nsigma look like math but they're not.\n\n125\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.110\nNow we're gonna be looking at this\nformula of sorts a little bit later, but\n\n126\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.180\nI just want to point out the y=f(x)\nformula looks like math.\n\n127\n00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.340\nBut in this case the y means\nyou wore an ultimate output.\n\n128\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.440\nThis is the activity I want to make\nbetter, faster, more cost-effective.\n\n129\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.600\nThe x is your input so\nwhat do I need to do that?\n\n130\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.180\nSo if I were baking a cake,\nI wanted to make the perfect birthday cake\n\n131\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.550\nwhat are some of the in\nputs I'd have to have?\n\n132\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.075\n&gt;&gt; Sugar, flour, eggs, milk.\n\n133\n00:06:54.075 --> 00:06:57.410\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect and then we take it\n\n134\n00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.490\none step further and we say, well how\nwould those things have to function?\n\n135\n00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.100\nSo I'm looking at my eggs.\n\n136\n00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.020\nDo my eggs have to be a certain size?\n\n137\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.114\nDo they have to be a certain freshness,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:07.114 --> 00:07:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo when you look at this,\n\n139\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.025\nit looks like math but\nreally it's just a [CROSSTALK].\n\n140\n00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:12.195\n&gt;&gt; Plug and chug?\n\n141\n00:07:12.195 --> 00:07:13.014\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n142\n00:07:13.014 --> 00:07:15.610\n[LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n143\n00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.720\nAll right, so kind of keep that in mind.\n\n144\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.353\nAnd I said this already,\nif you get confused, just think,\n\n145\n00:07:21.353 --> 00:07:25.060\nif you were measuring what's\nthe return on investment now,\n\n146\n00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.839\nbefore I rolled out my\nprocess improvement.\n\n147\n00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.706\nAnd my process improvement might be\ntraining, it might be a bigger facility,\n\n148\n00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:33.970\nit might be a new piece of equipment,\nright.\n\n149\n00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.380\nAnd then I'm gonna go back and\n\n150\n00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.032\nsay, okay, what is my return\non investment now, right?\n\n151\n00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And these are just different ways of\n\n152\n00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.479\nlooking at that.\n\n153\n00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.588\nSo in my current picture, if I don't\nhave a lot of information in my current\n\n154\n00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:50.920\npicture, I can always, always fall\nback on something the Likert Scale.\n\n155\n00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.070\nAnd Dr. Likert, incidentally,\nis still alive.\n\n156\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.450\nI think that's really cool.\n\n157\n00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.515\nBut you see these scales on\nscale from 1 to 5, right?\n\n158\n00:07:57.515 --> 00:08:00.267\nNow a lot of times we don't\nsee a scale from 1 to 5.\n\n159\n00:08:00.267 --> 00:08:03.225\nWe'll see a scale that goes like,\nI never get this right.\n\n160\n00:08:03.225 --> 00:08:08.374\nPoor Average, okay, fair, good.\n\n161\n00:08:08.374 --> 00:08:10.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n162\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.844\n&gt;&gt; But those five factors can be\ntranslated into one two three four\n\n163\n00:08:13.844 --> 00:08:14.990\nfive, right?\n\n164\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.210\nSo let's say I have absolutely no\ninformation for current state.\n\n165\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.780\nI could have people come into\nthe room that were now filming and\n\n166\n00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.150\nI could say on a scale from one to five.\n\n167\n00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.180\nHow do you feel about the room?\n\n168\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.430\n&gt;&gt; So just a brief survey?\n\n169\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a brief survey.\n\n170\n00:08:28.518 --> 00:08:30.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so lets say they say,\n\n171\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.380\nthey give us a three.\n\n172\n00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.050\nAnd then I make my process improvement.\n\n173\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.500\nI jazz it up even more than it's already\njazzed up and I bring everyone back and\n\n174\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.200\nsay hey, now on a scale from one to five.\n\n175\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.870\nSo that's my future state and\nthey're going to say 4.5.\n\n176\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.420\n&gt;&gt; So that's 1.5 increase.\n\n177\n00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n178\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.170\nSo you can always,\nalways in Lean Six Sigma fall\n\n179\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.100\nback on a Likert scale if you\ndon't have any information.\n\n180\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.620\nYou don't have a return on investment.\n\n181\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.460\nYou don't have any of these other\ntools that we're looking at.\n\n182\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.420\nRemember, that's kind of a trick,\nyou can always fall back on that.\n\n183\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:00.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n184\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Because it is an estimate,\neveryone knows it's an estimate.\n\n185\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you see so many companies\nusing these surveys, restaurants,\n\n186\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.060\ndepartment stores, it's very popular.\n\n187\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.782\n&gt;&gt; Because yeah, and it's leaner.\n\n188\n00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:10.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n189\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Which is-\n\n190\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.760\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n191\n00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.950\n&gt;&gt; Well it is, okay.\n\n192\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.360\nNow we could use Sigma.\n\n193\n00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.160\nYou would probably use Sigma if that\ncompany was using Sigma, because a lot of\n\n194\n00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.070\npeople have trouble translating Sigma\ninto return on investment, right?\n\n195\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.100\nSo, but we're gonna talk about Sigma\nbecause that's part of the name.\n\n196\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.050\nNow all goes back and\nthese slides are gonna go very quickly,\n\n197\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.700\nbut remember in your student\npack we've got some.\n\n198\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.120\nIn our Leaner Program,\nwe have some graphs that\n\n199\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.470\nput all of this together on one piece\nof paper, so it makes perfect sense.\n\n200\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.340\nBut I just wanna go\nthrough this very quickly.\n\n201\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.452\nWhen we're thinking about Sigma, it goes\nback to normal distribution and most of\n\n202\n00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:52.462\nyou, the bell curve became very popular\nwhen we were talking about education.\n\n203\n00:09:52.462 --> 00:09:55.130\nAnd 40 years later,\nwe're still talking about it.\n\n204\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.050\nBut on typical distribution,\nyou're looking at three Sigmas.\n\n205\n00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.130\nSo when you're getting into the fourth,\nfifth and\n\n206\n00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.370\nsixth Sigma, those are the flat\nlines on the sides of the bell.\n\n207\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.310\nSo if you kept going out from\nthat three Sigma on both sides,\n\n208\n00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.230\nthe flat lines would be four,\nfive and six.\n\n209\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.020\nSo let's say we're looking\nat the learning curve.\n\n210\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.890\nThe mean, that is the thing in the middle.\n\n211\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.500\nNow in Six Sigma,\n\n212\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.450\nwe're always trying to get things\nas close to the mean as possible.\n\n213\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.230\nAnd that's just another way of saying\nwe're trying to standardize things.\n\n214\n00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.020\nNow on this one you'll see\nthere's a lower specification and\n\n215\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.850\nan upper specification limit.\n\n216\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.566\nAnd it falls in that Six Sigma,\nyou see where it\n\n217\n00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:40.234\nis counting out more like six than three\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n218\n00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:45.857\n&gt;&gt; Okay, now depending on what you are\nworking on like if you are in medical and\n\n219\n00:10:45.857 --> 00:10:48.790\nyou are working in a hospital.\n\n220\n00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.904\nYou want people to be more at that Six\nSigma level if they're operating on your\n\n221\n00:10:52.904 --> 00:10:55.011\nheart, than at the three Sigma level.\n\n222\n00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:58.440\n&gt;&gt; Sure, having that stability,\na little bit of predictability.\n\n223\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.001\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nAnd so\n\n224\n00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:03.673\nyou'll see on this one where it says\ncustomer specifications and it only has\n\n225\n00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:08.570\nit one side, it says anything that acts\noutside that is considered the defect.\n\n226\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.130\nNow, I want you to kind of\nthink the Six Sigma concept.\n\n227\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.150\nLike if you keep looking at this normal\ndistribution, the car has to fit\n\n228\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.460\ninside those parameters and those lower\nand upper specification limits, right?\n\n229\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.640\nSo in this case, if the car is bigger\nit goes out into the defect area.\n\n230\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.680\nNow where it gets confusing is that\nwhen most people talk about Six Sigma,\n\n231\n00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.870\nthey're looking at a schedule that\nI'm going to show you in a second\n\n232\n00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.900\nwhich means at One Sigma,\nI've got a certain amount of process and\n\n233\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.110\nat Two Sigma, a certain amount, etc.,\n\n234\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.820\netc., which will make more sense\nwhen you look at the next slide.\n\n235\n00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.390\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n236\n00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.960\nSo if I were working at Three Sigma, and\nI'll just go ahead and pull these up.\n\n237\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.600\nBecause remember, normal distribution is\nshowing you at like Three Sigma, right?\n\n238\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.880\nSo 3.8 Sigma's still\nhigher than Three Sigma.\n\n239\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.744\nBut if I were working at Three Sigma,\nwhich is 99% good, four,\n\n240\n00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:10.800\nfive, and\nsix is like moving towards perfection.\n\n241\n00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.770\nSo I could have 20,000 articles\nof mail lost per hour,\n\n242\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:20.320\nunsafe drinking water, 5,000 incorrect\nsurgical operations per week,\n\n243\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.510\n2 short or\nlong landings at major airports.\n\n244\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.420\nSo in some cases.\n\n245\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.625\n&gt;&gt; I can definitely relate.\n\n246\n00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:28.830\n[LAUGH] Here in IT we\ncall them the five nines.\n\n247\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.720\nAnd just those small\ndifferences in percentage\n\n248\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.280\nreally add up from an annual perspective.\n\n249\n00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.150\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n250\n00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.740\nAbsolutely.\n\n251\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.700\nAnd even most companies are really\nfunctioning between three and four.\n\n252\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.194\nSo, the other thing about Sigma you wanna\nthink about, Six Sigma, is it's that old\n\n253\n00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:47.590\nadage, shoot for the moon and\nyou'll land in the stars type of thing.\n\n254\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.625\n&gt;&gt; That's our goal, but\nit's a little lofty.\n\n255\n00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n256\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.880\nI know that those of you watching this\nshow can look at the slide and see this.\n\n257\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.800\nBut just look at the first one,\n20,000 articles of mail lost per hour,\n\n258\n00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.720\nas opposed to 7 articles of mail.\n\n259\n00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.400\n&gt;&gt; That's huge, yeah.\n\n260\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.253\n&gt;&gt; And so there's just, it just depends,\n\n261\n00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:08.148\n68 wrong drug prescriptions\nas opposed to 200,000.\n\n262\n00:13:08.148 --> 00:13:10.770\nAnd this is the world we live in.\n\n263\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.650\nThis is happening all the time.\n\n264\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:17.600\nSo if you look at the levels of Six Sigma,\none of the things that we're\n\n265\n00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.580\ngonna talk about in just a second is\ndefects per million opportunities.\n\n266\n00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.230\nSo how many times can I make\n\n267\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.290\na defect per million of opportunities\nas it matches to the Sigma level?\n\n268\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.370\nSo the deal is, based on a million,\nand you'll be happy to know that\n\n269\n00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.200\nthe student package gives\nyou a Sigma calculator.\n\n270\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.540\nSo if you're not working in millions,\nwhich most of us aren't,\n\n271\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.600\nit will figure it out.\n\n272\n00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.580\n&gt;&gt; Break it down for you, cool.\n\n273\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.950\n&gt;&gt; Break it down.\n\n274\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.740\nSo you don't have to be\nworking in a million,\n\n275\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.290\nit's just that the statistic\nis based on that.\n\n276\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:54.280\nSo a million times, I have the opportunity\nto do something correctly,\n\n277\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.250\nI mess up 3.4 times.\n\n278\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.950\nThat's considered Six Sigma and\nthat's pretty close to perfection.\n\n279\n00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.380\nIt's not zero defects but\nit's pretty darn close.\n\n280\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.430\nIf you do something a million times and\nyou only mess up 3.4 times.\n\n281\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.030\nThat's pretty awesome.\n\n282\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.895\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome.\n\n283\n00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:08.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n284\n00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.800\nBut you saw that, in that last example,\n\n285\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.650\nthat it really can still make a difference\nwhen you're working with volume, right?\n\n286\n00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.700\nOkay so then we go down to say, look at\nthe 2, and the 1 isn't even on this one,\n\n287\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.820\nit'll be on the next one.\n\n288\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.730\nOut of a million times\nthat I do something,\n\n289\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.620\nif I mess up 308,537 times\nI'm working at Two Sigma.\n\n290\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.120\nOkay.\nAnd,again,\n\n291\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.590\nSigma has a lot to do\nwith the environment.\n\n292\n00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.935\nI want my heart surgeon to be Six Sigma.\n\n293\n00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:41.360\n[LAUGH] I want the people that that\nland my airplane to be at Six Sigma.\n\n294\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nOr even athletes in the NBA, going for\n\n295\n00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:46.294\nthat free shot at the end.\n\n296\n00:14:46.294 --> 00:14:48.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nThey want that as Six Sigma.\n\n297\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.390\nBut as far as my airline hostess for\n\n298\n00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.650\nexample, or\nthe person that's delivering my pizza.\n\n299\n00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.990\nI might be okay with 99% accuracy,\nI mean I might be okay with that.\n\n300\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.800\n&gt;&gt; What kind of pizza are we talking?\n\n301\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n302\n00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.220\n&gt;&gt; So, here is the scale that breaks it\n\n303\n00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.680\ndown a little bit more.\n\n304\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.240\nI think this one's\na little easier to digest.\n\n305\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.820\nI just wanted you to see the perfection\nversus the non-perfection.\n\n306\n00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.450\nAnd so we'll look at Four Sigma,\nand Four Sigma says that I could\n\n307\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.800\nmake 6,210 mistakes per million\nopportunities to do it right, and\n\n308\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.940\nI would be working a defective items\nthat shows you the percentage as well.\n\n309\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.590\nSo, these are all just different\nways to measure, and people say,\n\n310\n00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.720\nwell how do I know which one?\n\n311\n00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.590\nGo with what the company goes with.\n\n312\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And if they don't have Sigma, or\n\n313\n00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.190\nDPMO's, or something like that in place,\nremember the Likert Scale, and\n\n314\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.769\nreturn on investment's always a good one.\n\n315\n00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.020\nSo the companies that\nlike to work in Sigma,\n\n316\n00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.590\nthen you know that's what you would use.\n\n317\n00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.535\nOkay, so another thing, and\nthis is almost the flip side,\n\n318\n00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.092\nis something called Cost of Poor Quality.\n\n319\n00:15:56.092 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd basically all that means, and\n\n320\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:02.267\nthis is another one of these things that\nI think the industry over complicates,\n\n321\n00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:05.630\nwhat it means is, how much would\nit cost if we didn't do that?\n\n322\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.669\nRight?\n\n323\n00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:10.529\nAnd so in order to do that we have to\nthink of where would we look, okay?\n\n324\n00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:14.821\nAnd if you look at the schematic,\nyou'll see on the left-hand side places we\n\n325\n00:16:14.821 --> 00:16:18.290\ncould look, prevention,\nappraisal, prediction audits.\n\n326\n00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.630\nWe could look at appraisal detection,\nfailure,\n\n327\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.310\ninternal and external failures.\n\n328\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.450\nNow on the right side you see that Cost of\nAttaining Quality, Cost of Poor Quality.\n\n329\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.400\nEven though it says Cost of\nAttaining Quality it's still\n\n330\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.990\npart of that cost of quality argument.\n\n331\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.940\nThese are just places you can look,\nif you're trying to figure out\n\n332\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.850\nwhere should I look to figure\nout what I need to do.\n\n333\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.450\nHow much is it gonna cost not to do it?\n\n334\n00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.180\nAnd I think that's probably the best\nthing that you wanna remember.\n\n335\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.840\nSo another thing that,\nlike the basic components,\n\n336\n00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.680\nif you're in compliance, conformance\nmeans you're doing everything right.\n\n337\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.450\nAnd so how much would it cost if\nyou were doing everything right?\n\n338\n00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.410\nOr how much would it not cost, right?\n\n339\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what would our fines look like?\n\n340\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n341\n00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.650\nAnd then on the non-conformance side,\n\n342\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:08.190\nhow much would it cost if we\njust didn't do this, right?\n\n343\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.390\nSo you could look at, I don't know, it's\njust another way to kind of look at it.\n\n344\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:15.310\nBut if you keep holding on to what\nI'm basically trying to tell you,\n\n345\n00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.160\nis that if we don't do this particular\nthing, it's gonna cost us money.\n\n346\n00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.510\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and from an IT perspective,\nwe have this concept of risk analysis.\n\n347\n00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:26.550\nAnd from a security perspective,\nwe can say look,\n\n348\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:31.440\nour vulnerability is the security control,\nis x amount of dollars.\n\n349\n00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.320\nYou kind of weigh it out to determine\nwhat would be the difference.\n\n350\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's it, the perfect.\n\n351\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.200\nYeah, exactly.\n\n352\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.590\nIt's the same thing.\n\n353\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.090\nSo the other thing that you\nwanna think about with cost and\n\n354\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:45.780\nquality is what it might cost now or\nlater, because some things you leave them.\n\n355\n00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:51.120\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times when we're talking about\nsolutions, we say give three solutions.\n\n356\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.310\nAnd especially in the Demate model, which\nwe'll be covering in depth, we wanna give\n\n357\n00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.960\nwhoever we're working for three solutions\nso they feel like they have a choice.\n\n358\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.410\nAnd one of the things that we often\nforget is one solution is to do nothing.\n\n359\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.030\nIt's just, it's okay,\neverything's okay as it is.\n\n360\n00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.160\nSo on conformance, and when you're looking\nat cost of poor quality sometimes,\n\n361\n00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.548\nyou have to look at over time.\n\n362\n00:18:13.548 --> 00:18:17.040\nYeah, right now it's not costing us\nanything, but if we don't do something,\n\n363\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.160\nit's gonna cost us a lot later.\n\n364\n00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160\nSo that's something that\nyou want to put in.\n\n365\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.978\nAnd again, the slide's saying\nthe same thing, compliance,\n\n366\n00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:28.370\nit's a really big deal\nin compliance issues.\n\n367\n00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.660\nNow so that's another way of measuring,\nright?\n\n368\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.290\nWe said you could measure,\nthere's tons of ways but\n\n369\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.424\nthe popular ways in\nLean Six Sigma Likert scales,\n\n370\n00:18:36.424 --> 00:18:41.470\nreturn on investment,\ncost of poor quality, sigma levels.\n\n371\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:46.190\nEven another one would\nbe DPUs versus DPMO.\n\n372\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.000\nNow we've already talked about DPMO.\n\n373\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.304\nWe said that DPMO is defects\nper million opportunities.\n\n374\n00:18:53.304 --> 00:18:58.047\nAnd what I always like to say about that\nis defects per million opportunities to do\n\n375\n00:18:58.047 --> 00:19:01.210\nit right because that\nmakes more sense to me.\n\n376\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.140\nAnd the only difference between the DPMO,\nalthough like I said,\n\n377\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.330\nthis is one of these things the industry\nhas a tendency to overcomplicate, the only\n\n378\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:16.490\nreal difference between DPMOs and DPUs is\nI am looking for the defects per unit.\n\n379\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.520\nOkay, so I have a bunch of units and\nI'm looking,\n\n380\n00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.120\nhow many defects per unit as opposed\nto million times to do it correctly.\n\n381\n00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.136\n&gt;&gt; So would a unit be defined\nas an individual widget or\n\n382\n00:19:27.136 --> 00:19:29.461\ncould you group ten widgets together?\n\n383\n00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:33.919\n&gt;&gt; Right, and again that kind of depends\non what you're working with, but\n\n384\n00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.160\nmy unit could be ten lightbulbs.\n\n385\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That could just be the way\n\n386\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.830\nit comes from the manufacturer,\nalways get ten lightbulbs.\n\n387\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.910\n&gt;&gt; A pack of ten or\nsomething, perfect, okay.\n\n388\n00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.461\n&gt;&gt; So another measurement still\nis something called capability,\n\n389\n00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:50.188\nthe capability measure.\n\n390\n00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:56.128\nIt's very similar to Six Sigma,\nit only has this popular and\n\n391\n00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:59.622\nmanufacturing but it only has two,\n\n392\n00:19:59.622 --> 00:20:04.328\none to two numbers as\nopposed to six numbers.\n\n393\n00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.060\nBut I wanna point out\nbefore I move forward,\n\n394\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.410\nif I'm trying to measure capability,\none awesome tool is just to go observe it.\n\n395\n00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.150\nJust go and\nsee how's it working now, right?\n\n396\n00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.960\nSo but another way is that I\ncould use something called Cpk.\n\n397\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.180\nWhenever you see the k italics,\nit usually means it's a schedule.\n\n398\n00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.460\nAnd just like Sigma has six components,\nCPK has two components.\n\n399\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.132\nSo the numbers are always gonna\nbe somewhere between one and two.\n\n400\n00:20:31.132 --> 00:20:35.000\nAnd it's just a different\nway of measuring, right?\n\n401\n00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.770\nSo that's kind of what you wanna think,\nit's just a different way of measuring.\n\n402\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.200\nNow a lot of people say that they\nbelieve Cpk is a little bit more\n\n403\n00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.120\naccurate than Sigma, because Sigma\nis part of probability theory.\n\n404\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.430\nAnd Sigma factors in a 1.5 shift\nover a period of infinite time,\n\n405\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.080\nso it gets kind of crazy.\n\n406\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.100\nIf you remember the schedule on Six Sigma,\nthe different levels,\n\n407\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.190\nthe delta seemed really strange.\n\n408\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.339\nIt just all of a sudden jumps, where Cpk\nis looking more like at a point in time.\n\n409\n00:21:03.339 --> 00:21:08.260\nSo it's not really factoring in\nall those probability things.\n\n410\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.690\nSo is the process capable?\n\n411\n00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.900\nAnd like I said, you can use\na capability index to determine that or\n\n412\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.890\nyou can just go look.\n\n413\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:21.240\nAnd here's just a quick kind of idea,\nwhat is process capability?\n\n414\n00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.680\nNow a lot of times,\nwe determine a process is not capable.\n\n415\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.280\nAnd the reason why we care about\nthe process not being capable is that you\n\n416\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.280\ncould be asking me to do something\nthat the process simply can't do.\n\n417\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.360\nSo in the beginning of a project,\n\n418\n00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.350\nif there's a request being made,\nOne of the things you wanna\n\n419\n00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:45.150\nmake sure of is the process capable in\nthe first place.Can it really do that?\n\n420\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.880\nBecause if it can't,\nyou need to stop and discuss that.\n\n421\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.840\nNow there are ways to make\nyour process capable.\n\n422\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.460\nHire more staff, get a bigger facility,\nget better equipment.\n\n423\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.885\nSo just because you find out the process\nisn't capable does not mean that\n\n424\n00:21:57.885 --> 00:22:01.662\nyou can't do the project, it just means\nthat you've gotta tackle that first.\n\n425\n00:22:01.662 --> 00:22:06.990\nSo this is just another\nschematic on process capability.\n\n426\n00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.160\nAnd the idea is that if you were\nlooking at a control chart, and\n\n427\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.040\nwe'll be looking at charts and\ngraphs a little bit later.\n\n428\n00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.350\nBut just right now if you look\nat the left-hand side and\n\n429\n00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.550\nyou see the control chart,\nthe process is capable because it's\n\n430\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.300\nfunctioning between the upper and\nlower control limits.\n\n431\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:27.780\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and a histogram right\nnext to that, same thing.\n\n432\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.290\nIt's functioning within those parameters.\n\n433\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:36.690\nNow process capability\nuses the same scale, 1:2.\n\n434\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.442\nBut when I'm looking at process,\nI just wanna see,\n\n435\n00:22:39.442 --> 00:22:42.206\nis my process working up\nto the maximum capability?\n\n436\n00:22:42.206 --> 00:22:47.291\nSo process is never gonna be\nbigger than capability, right?\n\n437\n00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:54.740\nAnd so let's go back to, okay, let me\nkinda go backwards here for a second.\n\n438\n00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.371\nThis process control chart,\n\n439\n00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:59.904\nthis is where it's showing you\nthat one thing is out of control.\n\n440\n00:22:59.904 --> 00:23:00.902\n&gt;&gt; Out of control [LAUGH].\n\n441\n00:23:00.902 --> 00:23:05.338\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I said this is Ppk.\n\n442\n00:23:05.338 --> 00:23:07.416\nRemember the k stands for index.\n\n443\n00:23:07.416 --> 00:23:11.970\nThe Ppk and the Cpk use the same numbers.\n\n444\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.895\nBut capability is what is\nit capable of doing and\n\n445\n00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:22.486\nperformance capability is more about,\nis it acting up to its true capability?\n\n446\n00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:23.148\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n447\n00:23:23.148 --> 00:23:26.340\n&gt;&gt; And so this is gonna bring us back\nto where I was thinking I was going,\n\n448\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.940\nis back to parking my car in the garage,\nright?\n\n449\n00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.910\nSo I have a certain amount of capability\n\n450\n00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:34.450\nof getting that car into the garage,\nright?\n\n451\n00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.270\nIf the car is too big then it's gonna\nbe defective, it's not gonna fit in\n\n452\n00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.930\nthe garage so my challenge is am\nI using the maximum capability?\n\n453\n00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.530\nSo if you look at that car\njust in this silly picture,\n\n454\n00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.160\nyou'll see it looks like I could\nhave a sightly bigger car, right?\n\n455\n00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.690\nSo my performance is good right now.\n\n456\n00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.267\nIt's fitting in there,\nit looks very centered, right?\n\n457\n00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.210\nIt's living up to its capability.\n\n458\n00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:00.060\nBut there might be some things I\ncan do to stretch that process.\n\n459\n00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:05.581\nHowever, if someone came and asked me to\nput a car twice that size in that garage.\n\n460\n00:24:05.581 --> 00:24:08.999\nIt doesn't really matter how\nwell I know my statistical tool,\n\n461\n00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:10.980\nit's just not gonna happen.\n\n462\n00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.600\nSo just kind of think, there's\ncapability and there's performance.\n\n463\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.335\nCapability is always the parameters,\nthat's as far as you can go.\n\n464\n00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:23.240\nAnd performance, you're just trying to\nsee, am I performing up to my capability,\n\n465\n00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.320\nbecause there's some room there for\nprocess improvement.\n\n466\n00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.683\nThere might not be room,\nthat car might be so close to the edges,\n\n467\n00:24:29.683 --> 00:24:32.250\nit might just be performing\nthe very best it can.\n\n468\n00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:32.820\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\nAnd\n\n469\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.520\nI think depending on what you're really\nreferencing, it's not necessarily, and\n\n470\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.230\nthis, correct me if I'm wrong here.\n\n471\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.610\nBut in certain situations it might be\na little risky to push those edges.\n\n472\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:48.120\nWhereas other situations it may\nbe beneficial to make use of\n\n473\n00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.930\nyour resources fully.\n\n474\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.040\n&gt;&gt; And what's so cool about that,\n\n475\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.040\nCherokee, is this is the difference\nbetween Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma.\n\n476\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.347\nAnd I'm not trying to make\nSix Sigma seem silly but\n\n477\n00:24:58.347 --> 00:25:00.876\nin Six Sigma it's about the numbers.\n\n478\n00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:04.363\nIn Lean Six Sigma it's about thinking\nabout the numbers, absolutely,\n\n479\n00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:09.000\nand that's still primary, but it's also\nthinking about all those other things.\n\n480\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.509\nThat you have to factor it, it gives\nyou that human component and all those\n\n481\n00:25:12.509 --> 00:25:16.653\ndifference, you know, okay, statistically\nthis works but does it really, right?\n\n482\n00:25:16.653 --> 00:25:18.601\nSo here is another thing that just, and\n\n483\n00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:21.740\nagain all I'm trying to show you\nis it's just a way to measure.\n\n484\n00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.705\nSo when you get in to this section in your\nstudy materials, if you can just cycle\n\n485\n00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:31.089\nback to the idea that this is just\na way to measure so I can get a number.\n\n486\n00:25:31.089 --> 00:25:33.562\nSo that after I roll out\nmy process improvement,\n\n487\n00:25:33.562 --> 00:25:35.450\nI go back to the same schedule.\n\n488\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.650\nAnd to get another number and\n\n489\n00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.360\nit statistically shows that\nI've improved the process.\n\n490\n00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.490\nNot all processes are gonna be,\nare you gonna be able to apply math to.\n\n491\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.740\nSome of them you just aren't.\n\n492\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.630\nAnd so that's when you might wanna\ngo back to that Likert scale.\n\n493\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.930\nSo here's where we're aligning the, on\nthe last or one of the schematics I showed\n\n494\n00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:58.220\nyou, we showed you how\nDPMO mapped to Sigma.\n\n495\n00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.864\nAnd here's just one that shows\nyou how the CP index maps to\n\n496\n00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:02.374\n&gt;&gt; For comparison.\n\n497\n00:26:02.374 --> 00:26:05.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, just to kinda get an idea.\n\n498\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.011\nNow because we support, at my company,\nLeaner Six Sigma you'll be happy\n\n499\n00:26:10.011 --> 00:26:14.953\nto know that in your student package\nthere is actually a schematic that has\n\n500\n00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:18.882\nall of this on the same piece of paper and\nit has a scenario.\n\n501\n00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:22.107\nSo you can go back and\nforth on that piece of paper and\n\n502\n00:26:22.107 --> 00:26:27.100\nsay, how does CP relate to DP Mo's\nrelates to Sigma relates to all of these.\n\n503\n00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.269\n&gt;&gt; So\nyour one table has all of these different.\n\n504\n00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.943\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n505\n00:26:29.943 --> 00:26:33.563\n&gt;&gt; And the only reason we're talking about\nthem separately in this section is that,\n\n506\n00:26:33.563 --> 00:26:35.298\nthey are covered separately on exams.\n\n507\n00:26:35.298 --> 00:26:36.649\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n508\n00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:40.126\n&gt;&gt; So,\nthe next thing we're gonna talk about and\n\n509\n00:26:40.126 --> 00:26:44.060\nthis is pretty brief is\nCycle Time versus Takt Time.\n\n510\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.560\nAnd again in your Six Sigma Exam you're\ngonna wanna know these formulas which\n\n511\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.579\nare part of your student package.\n\n512\n00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:55.765\nFor LEAN Six Sigma you just wanna have\na basic idea of how cycle time and\n\n513\n00:26:55.765 --> 00:26:56.770\ntakt works.\n\n514\n00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:01.330\nAnd the easiest way for me to explain this\nis cycle time, I mean it's so intuitive,\n\n515\n00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.320\ncycle time is the period required to\ncomplete one cycle of an operation, or\n\n516\n00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.720\na task from start to finish.\n\n517\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.738\nThat's your cycle time,\nhow much is my cycle time?\n\n518\n00:27:10.738 --> 00:27:15.752\nAnd your takt time on the other hand\nis how fast does your customer need it?\n\n519\n00:27:15.752 --> 00:27:16.255\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n520\n00:27:16.255 --> 00:27:22.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if your customer wants you\nto do, well, let's say, for training.\n\n521\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:28.150\nIf your customer wants you to do\neight classes every year, right?\n\n522\n00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.280\nSo they want you to do\neight classes every year.\n\n523\n00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.330\nYou have to go back and look at your\ntime to figure out how much, and\n\n524\n00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.887\nlet's they are unique classes.\n\n525\n00:27:34.887 --> 00:27:37.596\nYou have to go back and\nthink about development time, and\n\n526\n00:27:37.596 --> 00:27:40.640\nputting everything together,\nand the delivery system.\n\n527\n00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.750\nSo that would be your cycle time.\n\n528\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.700\nNow your takt time was that they\nwant eight classes a year, so\n\n529\n00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.390\nyou have to look at you schedule.\n\n530\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.950\nAnd divide it up to their time,\nif that makes sense.\n\n531\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.480\nSo the difference would be, cycle time is\nhow long does it takes start to finish.\n\n532\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.867\nTakt time would be how\nfast do they need it.\n\n533\n00:27:57.867 --> 00:27:58.821\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now again,\n\n534\n00:27:58.821 --> 00:28:01.060\nI'm just going to show you one formula.\n\n535\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.040\nSo you get kind of the idea, for\n\n536\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.770\nthose of you that are just going\nto take the Six Sigma exam.\n\n537\n00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.795\nThese are the types of formulas that\nyou would see on that student packet.\n\n538\n00:28:09.795 --> 00:28:12.230\nTakt time and\njust like return on investment, right?\n\n539\n00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.610\nI mean they're just formulas.\n\n540\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:19.354\nUnfortunately on the six sigma exam is\nprobably best there's a few formulas it's\n\n541\n00:28:19.354 --> 00:28:24.863\njust best to memorize as opposed to using\nExcel to do it for you automatically.\n\n542\n00:28:24.863 --> 00:28:26.550\nAnd so this Takt Time.\n\n543\n00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.520\nAnd it kinda makes sense.\n\n544\n00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:33.978\nAvailable working time per day\ndivided by customer demand rate.\n\n545\n00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:34.914\nAnd then finally,\n\n546\n00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:39.560\nwe're gonna wrap up with something that is\ncalled the Measures of Central Tendency.\n\n547\n00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.730\nNow, there is all kinds of other\nstatistics and math that you might need,\n\n548\n00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.890\nbut this is the things that\nwe covered in this session.\n\n549\n00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.600\nWere the most popular.\n\n550\n00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.180\nMany many statistics are based on\nthe measures of central tendency.\n\n551\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.090\nSo, I'm still convinced if you get this\ndown that if you decide to go on and\n\n552\n00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:00.460\nstudy higher level statistics it's\ngonna make your life so much easier.\n\n553\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.340\nSo mean is really what we're\nfamiliar with, all the time.\n\n554\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.981\nWhen you were in school your teacher\nprobably said the average grade in class,\n\n555\n00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:13.709\nso mean, mean average, and average all\nmean the same thing, no pun intended.\n\n556\n00:29:13.709 --> 00:29:16.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But so let's say I gave an exam,\n\n557\n00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:21.047\nthere's 30 exams, I added up the 30 exams.\n\n558\n00:29:21.047 --> 00:29:24.797\nI divided by 30 and\nit came up with an average and I tell you,\n\n559\n00:29:24.797 --> 00:29:27.385\nokay the average of the class was 85%.\n\n560\n00:29:27.385 --> 00:29:31.730\nSo what that buys me is I know did\nI perform above or below average.\n\n561\n00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.907\n&gt;&gt; Are we dropping the lowest score?\n\n562\n00:29:32.907 --> 00:29:34.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n563\n00:29:34.176 --> 00:29:36.262\n&gt;&gt; And you know that's a good point\n\n564\n00:29:36.262 --> 00:29:40.973\nbecause sometimes when we get mega data\nwe have to drop on both ends just to\n\n565\n00:29:40.973 --> 00:29:43.460\nkind of get that middle data.\n\n566\n00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.684\nSo a mode on the other hand is the number\nthat happens the most frequently.\n\n567\n00:29:47.684 --> 00:29:53.600\nSo in our 30 grades let's say\nthe most common test score was 82.\n\n568\n00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.138\nSo I'm gonna say the mode was\n82 well the average was 85, but\n\n569\n00:29:58.138 --> 00:30:02.610\nthe mode, the number that people\nmade the most often was 82.\n\n570\n00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.630\nAnd then the median,\nthat's the number in the middle.\n\n571\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.505\nSo I want you to visualize, and\nI know a lot of you already know this,\n\n572\n00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:09.761\nwe learned it-\n&gt;&gt; Elementary school.\n\n573\n00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:12.146\n&gt;&gt; Some of us learned in third grade,\nsome of us learned it in fifth grade.\n\n574\n00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:12.909\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n575\n00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:15.782\nwe don't use it so\nthat's why sometimes we have to have\n\n576\n00:30:15.782 --> 00:30:17.389\na brief reminder so-\n&gt;&gt; Refresher.\n\n577\n00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:18.117\n&gt;&gt; So [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n578\n00:30:18.117 --> 00:30:19.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So median,\n\n579\n00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:25.571\nIf I were looking at those 30 test grades,\nkind of visualize 30 pieces of paper and\n\n580\n00:30:25.571 --> 00:30:29.320\nI lay all 30 pieces of paper out,\nside by side.\n\n581\n00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.130\nThe first thing I would do is put them\nin sequential order because as I'm\n\n582\n00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.980\ngrading them, it's probably not\nlikely that they came in that order.\n\n583\n00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.850\nSo the first thing I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna align them.\n\n584\n00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:43.860\nSo I'm gonna do 65, 65, 75, 82, 82,\ncuz we said that was our mode, right?\n\n585\n00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.400\nAnd so forth and so forth.\n\n586\n00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.390\nAnd I'm gonna take the one in the middle.\n\n587\n00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.180\nNow because we have an even number\nin this example, I can't take.\n\n588\n00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.467\nIf I had an odd number like 29 middle,\nI'm done.\n\n589\n00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:56.903\nBut because I have an even number,\n\n590\n00:30:56.903 --> 00:31:01.700\nwhat I'd wanna do is in the middle\nof that take those two in average.\n\n591\n00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.690\n&gt;&gt; So 15 and 16 and\nthen find the average for those two exams.\n\n592\n00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.130\n&gt;&gt; And that would be the median.\n\n593\n00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.781\nNow, so why do we care and\nwhy is it important?\n\n594\n00:31:09.781 --> 00:31:13.028\nThe big deal is in Six Sigma we're\ntrying to get to the average,\n\n595\n00:31:13.028 --> 00:31:15.860\nwhich is just another\nway of saying standard.\n\n596\n00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:19.220\nAnd a lot of the statistical measurements,\nsuch as standard deviation and some of\n\n597\n00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:25.420\nthe other things that we'll see later,\nhave to do with being close to the middle.\n\n598\n00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.729\nHowever, sometimes the middle is distorted\nand you'll have to trust my math on this,\n\n599\n00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:31.097\nbut I can have 30 grades.\n\n600\n00:31:31.097 --> 00:31:36.530\nThe average could be 85, and yet\nI could have had five or six people fail.\n\n601\n00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.980\nAnd, just a number of people\nmake a really good grade.\n\n602\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.720\nSo it's, it's kind of\na distorted sense of the middle.\n\n603\n00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.660\nSo, if I'm going to use\nthe middle as my marker,\n\n604\n00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.980\nas my baseline, I want to test it\nagainst the mode and the median.\n\n605\n00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.397\nNow, if they're close, like in our\nexample, we said the mode was 82 and\n\n606\n00:31:53.397 --> 00:31:55.365\nthe average was 85, eh, pretty close.\n\n607\n00:31:55.365 --> 00:31:59.712\nBut what if the mode had been like 55,\nthen I'm really showing you\n\n608\n00:31:59.712 --> 00:32:04.449\na distorted thing of the middle and\nif my objective is to get to the middle.\n\n609\n00:32:04.449 --> 00:32:07.978\nI wanna be sure that I'm doing\na good picture of that middle,\n\n610\n00:32:07.978 --> 00:32:10.330\nso I wanna test my mean\nagainst my mode and\n\n611\n00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.790\nmy median and if they're pretty\ncross then, I'm gonna be okay.\n\n612\n00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.640\nBut if there really far part, I just might\nwanna use a different form of measurement,\n\n613\n00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.750\nlike SOPQ or return on investment.\n\n614\n00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.494\nI mean this is just another\nmeasurement that I can use.\n\n615\n00:32:24.494 --> 00:32:25.852\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I think,\n\n616\n00:32:25.852 --> 00:32:29.516\nthat pretty much covers\nthe most important ones.\n\n617\n00:32:29.516 --> 00:32:31.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's still some math and\n\n618\n00:32:31.138 --> 00:32:33.833\nthings that we'll be covering,\nas we move through the program, but\n\n619\n00:32:33.833 --> 00:32:36.120\nthese are the ones,\nthat the test pretty much focuses on.\n\n620\n00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.222\n&gt;&gt; We have covered quite a bit and\nI thank you for that because,\n\n621\n00:32:39.222 --> 00:32:42.832\nI really feel like you've been able\nto help us digest our alphabets.\n\n622\n00:32:42.832 --> 00:32:45.080\nSee, that was a lot there.\n\n623\n00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.480\nSo hopefully you guys are able to go ahead\nand look at what we've covered here with\n\n624\n00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.830\nour different metrics and understand that,\nby looking at the visuals as well.\n\n625\n00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.240\nSo thank you for tuning in, but we do\nhave some more, our Green Belt training\n\n626\n00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.280\nheaded this way for our Lean Six Sigma\nGreen Belt certification preparation.\n\n627\n00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:02.993\nI know it's a mouthful.\n\n628\n00:33:02.993 --> 00:33:05.654\nBut we're going to go ahead and\nwrap up for this episode.\n\n629\n00:33:05.654 --> 00:33:09.280\nI'm going to sign off as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n630\n00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.197\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.000\nWelcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation Series.\n\n7\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.370\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.810\nIn this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at our Lean Six Sigma Core Concepts\n\n9\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.750\nand Terms.\n\n10\n00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.630\nSo with us today to go ahead and\n\n11\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.070\ndefine those need-to-knows,\nwe have Dr Terra Stern in this studios.\n\n12\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.370\nThank you for joining us today, Dr Stern.\n\n13\n00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm happy to be here, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.580\n&gt;&gt; So where do we start,\nwhat are some of the core concepts,\n\n15\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.310\nsome of the basics that\nwe just can't get around?\n\n16\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd like to go ahead and\ngo to my slide deck, if that's okay.\n\n17\n00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n18\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.240\n&gt;&gt; And again it is core concepts.\n\n19\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.110\nKinda keep in mind that the strategy that\nmy company Leaner has, Leaner Six Sigma,\n\n20\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190\nis that if you get the basic idea of the\nconcept then the other things just kind of\n\n21\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.210\nare easier to understand so\nif you get the overall concept.\n\n22\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.730\nSo the concepts that are really\nbig in Lean Six Sigma are what is\n\n23\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.790\nthe difference between a methodology and\na tool?\n\n24\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.240\nWhat is the difference between\nwaterfall methodology as opposed to\n\n25\n00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.400\ncircular thinking methodolog?\n\n26\n00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.740\nAnd sometimes those\nare articulated in different ways,\n\n27\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.460\nwhich we'll talk about that.\n\n28\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.330\nWhat does structured brainstorming mean?\n\n29\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.190\nWhat are some of the core\nprinciples of Lean Six Sigma?\n\n30\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.040\nAnd then finally, what are some\npopular concepts in Lean Six Sigma?\n\n31\n00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.136\nAnd I think if you get this overview and\nyou understand these basics,\n\n32\n00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:36.888\nthat the test questions are going\nto be much easier to process.\n\n33\n00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:44.424\nNow, one of the things that you want to\nremember is that almost everything in\n\n34\n00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:46.350\nLean Six Sigma is called a tool.\n\n35\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.550\nSo if you get a question that says, name\na tool or pick all the tools, probably\n\n36\n00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.610\neverything is a tool because there is\njust a tendency to overuse that word.\n\n37\n00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.510\nEverything is tool, so right off the bat,\neverything is a tool, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.340\nHowever a methodology is something\nthat has to be done step by step.\n\n39\n00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.210\nSo, a tool might not necessarily\nhave to be used in a certain order.\n\n40\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.660\nIt might be a one time\nBand-Aid fix type thing.\n\n41\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.853\nBut if it's a methodology,\nyou do step one, then you do step two,\n\n42\n00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:18.500\nthen you do step three.\n\n43\n00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.874\nAnd that's why things like PDCA,\nwhich we covered in another session,\n\n44\n00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:25.900\nwhich we're gonna cover\nin this session as well.\n\n45\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.691\nPDCA has to be done in a certain order.\n\n46\n00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:33.720\nI have to plan, then I have to do, then\nI have to check, and then I have to act.\n\n47\n00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.736\nSo even though that is a methodology,\n\n48\n00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:40.040\nsome people refer to PDCAs as\na tool because everything's a tool.\n\n49\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.160\nIf you ever get stumped,\njust remember everything's a tool.\n\n50\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.700\nAnother thing to keep in mind,\n\n51\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.160\nsince Lean Six Sigma has a large\nproject management component,\n\n52\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.970\nbecause at some point your process\nimprovement is gonna become a project.\n\n53\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.623\nMost of your project management tools,\nby default, are also Lean Six Sigma tools.\n\n54\n00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:06.141\nExamples of tools would be graphs,\ncharts, and\n\n55\n00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:10.691\nsome of those that we're gonna\nbe looking at, like Pareto,\n\n56\n00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.620\nhistograms, scatter diagram,\nfishbone other types of tools.\n\n57\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.294\nAnd this where I think it's get a little\nbit trickier are things such as\n\n58\n00:03:19.294 --> 00:03:20.610\nhistorical documents.\n\n59\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.298\nNow if you were working for\na public company,\n\n60\n00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:27.610\nan example of historical document\nmight be their annual report.\n\n61\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.180\nHowever if you're just\nworking in a department,\n\n62\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.900\njust the way people put together forms,\nand their thinking, and\n\n63\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.950\nhow things are filed, and\nhow things are documented.\n\n64\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.278\nHow did the department come into being?\n\n65\n00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:45.252\nWhat need was there to\nform that department?\n\n66\n00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:46.583\nHaving that kind of knowledge,\n\n67\n00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:49.160\na lot of times, will help you\nwith your process improvement.\n\n68\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.610\nFinancial Reports, see Case Tools.\n\n69\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.540\nCase tools are kind of\nan interesting thing.\n\n70\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.970\nIn IT, the term was used a lot in\nthe 80s and 90s, not quite as much now.\n\n71\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.630\nBut case tools can apply to not just IT,\nbut to any kind of industry.\n\n72\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.930\nAnd the deal is case tools\nare specific to your subject.\n\n73\n00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.340\nSo you don't wanna forget that.\n\n74\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.942\nThat any tools like if\nyou're making a car,\n\n75\n00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:17.775\nthere's certain tools\nthat you're gonna need.\n\n76\n00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.455\nOr you're designing a car even, there's\ncertain tools that you're gonna use.\n\n77\n00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:24.740\nSo case tools, that means specific tools.\n\n78\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.899\nLean Six Sigma allows for\nyou to integrate those specific tools\n\n79\n00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.960\nat any given time, so\nagain basically anything that helps you.\n\n80\n00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.702\nTwo big tools are brainstorming and\naffinity diagrams and\n\n81\n00:04:38.702 --> 00:04:42.450\nso most of us are familiar\nwith brainstorming, right?\n\n82\n00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at least I think so.\n\n83\n00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.097\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:46.528\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think we often do\n\n85\n00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:47.899\nbrainstorming wrong.\n\n86\n00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:52.403\nIn a typical brainstorming exercise,\n\n87\n00:04:52.403 --> 00:04:56.850\nthe idea is that we just write down\neverything that everyone says.\n\n88\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.870\nAnd it doesn't really\nmatter if it's a repeat.\n\n89\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.990\nAnd usually the most\neffective brainstorming\n\n90\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.480\nsessions happen if the person\nhas no idea what's going on.\n\n91\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.310\nSomeone who's not the boss.\n\n92\n00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.290\nBecause sometimes what happens is we\nsay things that we think the boss\n\n93\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.910\nwants to hear.\n\n94\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.730\nIf you can grab someone from another\ndepartment that's not familiar with\n\n95\n00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.450\nwhat you're trying to brainstorm about,\nthen that's almost better.\n\n96\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.446\nSo at one point in our brainstorming,\nif there's too many things on the list,\n\n97\n00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:28.640\nwe move to something called\nan affinity diagram.\n\n98\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.252\nAnd that means we're just gonna take\nall of those brainstorming ideas and\n\n99\n00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:34.007\nput them into some kinda category.\n\n100\n00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:38.226\nAnd in some cases, maybe there is a lot\nof things that need to be done that week.\n\n101\n00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:42.226\nSo our categories could be Bob,\nCindy, Nancy, right?\n\n102\n00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:45.965\nOr maybe it is different departments or\nmaybe it is timelines,\n\n103\n00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:48.860\nso I get to decide what those buckets are.\n\n104\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.540\nIn Lean Six Sigma, there is a lot of times\nwhere we do something called structured\n\n105\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.700\nbrainstorming which just means the\naffinity diagram is made ahead of time.\n\n106\n00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.960\nI'm gonna give you something\nto brainstorm, but\n\n107\n00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.700\nI'm gonna give you buckets that\nI want you to brainstorm around.\n\n108\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.850\nAnd we'll be looking at some of\nthose examples in future sessions.\n\n109\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.390\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense,\n\n110\n00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.790\nI mean there are certain types of\nstudying methods, such as brain mapping.\n\n111\n00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.130\nThere's a book by Jamie Nass,\n\n112\n00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.610\nwhere they kind of logically separate off\ninto branches those brainstorming areas.\n\n113\n00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.510\nSo I could see how that\ncould be a very useful tool.\n\n114\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nit just kind of speeds things up.\n\n115\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.260\nAll right, so methodologies.\n\n116\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.600\nNow remember the difference\nbetween a methodology and\n\n117\n00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.470\na tool is that a methodology\nhas to be done in a certain.\n\n118\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.300\n&gt;&gt; Sequential order.\n\n119\n00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sequential order, perfect.\n\n120\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.100\nMethodologies, by default, are tools\nbecause everything is a tool, right?\n\n121\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.500\nOkay so, methodologies can be circular or\nthey can be waterfall.\n\n122\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.780\nAnd what you're seeing on the left-hand\nside of the screen is the model that we're\n\n123\n00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.840\ngonna be doing a lot of work with in\nfuture sessions, called the DMAIC model.\n\n124\n00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.860\nAnd I'm gonna begin explaining those\nphases of that model a little bit later.\n\n125\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.620\nHowever, now what I want you to\nthink of is that the DMAIC model\n\n126\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.630\ncould be handled either way.\n\n127\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.240\nIn Six Sigma environments,\nwhere it's just Six Sigma,\n\n128\n00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.660\nmost of the time the DMAIC model\nis handled in a waterfall fashion.\n\n129\n00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.235\nAnd what that means is phase one\nhas to be completely done before\n\n130\n00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:16.389\nyou go to phase two.\n\n131\n00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:20.063\nAnd phase two has to be completely\ndone before you go to phase three.\n\n132\n00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:21.744\nNow in the circular model,\n\n133\n00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:26.530\nit's the same model that Lean Six Sigma\nuses as far as the categories.\n\n134\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.740\nBut it's circular, because typically\nyou have a project manager\n\n135\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.450\nwho's looking at that\nprocess from cradle to grave.\n\n136\n00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.690\nSo they're sort of managing\nit from define until control.\n\n137\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.560\nSo if for example, they have to go back\na step, the world is not gonna fall apart,\n\n138\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.410\ncertainly not the idea.\n\n139\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.610\nI wanna finish define and go to measure.\n\n140\n00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.690\nBut if I had to back up and\ngo to define, it's no big deal.\n\n141\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.774\nWhereas in the waterfall method,\nthere could be different departments.\n\n142\n00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:55.775\nBecause remember we had mentioned\nin other sessions that Six Sigma\n\n143\n00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.567\nprojects are huge projects.\n\n144\n00:07:57.567 --> 00:08:02.172\nThe minimum 250,000 Of make save or\navoid spending,\n\n145\n00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:07.090\nsometimes the projects are two or\nthree years long, right?\n\n146\n00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.770\nSo the same department that\nworked on define might not\n\n147\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.570\nbe the same department\nthat worked on measure.\n\n148\n00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.540\nAnd so it's very,\nvery important that I wrap it up.\n\n149\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.260\nSo the leadership might be in define\nto decide what the problem is.\n\n150\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.430\nThen they might pass that off to someone\nlike auditors to go out and measure.\n\n151\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.390\nWhat's the true current as is\npicture of where we are today?\n\n152\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.826\n&gt;&gt; Or there could be an acquisition for\nyour company and the new owners, and\n\n153\n00:08:29.826 --> 00:08:33.000\nthe problems still exists even\nthough it's new management.\n\n154\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, so it's really,\nreally important that you do these steps,\n\n155\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.950\nbecause you might not even be\ninvolved in the next step.\n\n156\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.570\nAnd that's the purpose for waterfall,\nwhen you hear waterfall methodology.\n\n157\n00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.170\nA lot of compliance issues, like if you've\nbeen zinged for a compliance issue,\n\n158\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.310\nyou actually wanna see a waterfall method,\nthey wanna see what was your logic.\n\n159\n00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.050\nWhat did you do first step,\nwhat did you do second step,\n\n160\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.700\nwhat did you do third step.\n\n161\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.700\nIn Lean Six Sigma, because you're taking\nsmaller projects, the person in charge of\n\n162\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.370\nthe process improvement project is\ntypically in charge of the entire thing.\n\n163\n00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.660\nAnd that's why, like I said,\nit's okay if you have to move backwards.\n\n164\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.340\nYou don't want to, I mean,\nit's not the idea.\n\n165\n00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.330\nBut you certainly can do that without\nhurting the project in any way.\n\n166\n00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.690\nSo, if you remember the PDCA,\n\n167\n00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:28.070\nhere's an example of PDCA in\nthat waterfall method, right?\n\n168\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.106\nWe're gonna plan, we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna check if we achieved our goal.\n\n169\n00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:33.127\n&gt;&gt; We can continue.\n\n170\n00:09:33.127 --> 00:09:36.700\n&gt;&gt; We can continue and\nif we don't we go back up to plan, right?\n\n171\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.810\nSo that's just an example of Water Fall.\n\n172\n00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.140\nBut you hear that term a lot,\nespecially on exams.\n\n173\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.080\nSometimes it's just\nthrown into the question.\n\n174\n00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.610\nAnd when you're reading that question,\nif it's asking something,\n\n175\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.640\nyou wanna think, well they're\nthinking in a waterfall context or\n\n176\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.120\nthey're thinking in circular context.\n\n177\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.130\nSo it might make your answer\ndiffer on the test if you\n\n178\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.270\nkind of understand the example\nthat they're talking about.\n\n179\n00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:06.860\nSo here's Plan, Do, Check,\nAct as a circular model.\n\n180\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.690\nAnd Plan, Do, Check, Act actually,\nit's handled as a waterfall\n\n181\n00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.050\nmethod in a lot of companies, but\nI think it probably really was circular.\n\n182\n00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.719\nIt was probably ahead of its time.\n\n183\n00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:26.690\nAnd again, why it makes a difference is\nbecause I might not be the person that's\n\n184\n00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.546\nworking on each step of the model.\n\n185\n00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:31.897\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna make absolutely sure,\n\n186\n00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:34.810\nthat if I need to wrap things up.\n\n187\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.230\nNow in the DMAIC world, they actually\nhave things called toll gates.\n\n188\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.690\nAnd so in between those phases there might\nbe a toll gate review that says are you\n\n189\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.626\nsure you did everything that you said\nyou were gonna do in that phase?\n\n190\n00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:53.453\nAnd this being the steps are completed\nbefore you move to the next phase that\n\n191\n00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.080\nwould be an example of waterfall.\n\n192\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.396\nNow, when we're looking at,\n\n193\n00:10:58.396 --> 00:11:03.664\nthis is another concept in Lean Six Sigma,\nis value versus non value.\n\n194\n00:11:03.664 --> 00:11:07.020\nSo one big concept is\nstructured brainstorming.\n\n195\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.290\nAnd we said that's where they\nstart with the affinity diagram.\n\n196\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.030\nOne basic concept is am I going to handle\nthis project in a waterfall method or\n\n197\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.500\nin a circular method?\n\n198\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.770\nKeeping in mind that sometimes\nyou don't have a choice,\n\n199\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.820\nbecause if it's compliance, they might\nwanna see a waterfall method, right?\n\n200\n00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.610\nAnother big concept is this value\nadded versus non value added.\n\n201\n00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.938\nAnd unfortunately it's\na bit of a sticky wicket.\n\n202\n00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:34.871\nAnd the reason is because I'm saying\nsomething is non value added,\n\n203\n00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:39.080\neven though that is the words that\nwe're taught to use in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n204\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.945\nall it means is that particular\nactivity doesn't have anything to\n\n205\n00:11:42.945 --> 00:11:46.858\ndo with the process I'm working on,\nthat I'm trying to improve.\n\n206\n00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:49.167\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So it might be a nice to do thing,\n\n207\n00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.362\nthat could be a non-value thing.\n\n208\n00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:56.360\nIt might be something that's even\ncompliance, for example in this case.\n\n209\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.130\nIt could be anything that doesn't\ndirectly impact the project, product, or\n\n210\n00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.880\nservice going out the door.\n\n211\n00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.358\nSo a lot of times when you have\nvalue versus non-value discussions,\n\n212\n00:12:07.358 --> 00:12:11.270\nthe non-value added might\nbe someone's entire job.\n\n213\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.510\nBut it is necessary.\n\n214\n00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.280\nIt is important to the company,\n\n215\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.780\nit's just not important to the particular\nprocess that you're trying to improve.\n\n216\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.130\n&gt;&gt; So would you say if I were\nworking on a process and\n\n217\n00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.860\nperhaps were focusing more attention\nonto a certain department or process.\n\n218\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.370\nAnd I found something that hadn't\nbeen flagged or noticed before, but\n\n219\n00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.210\nneeded to be taken care of,\nwould that fall under that category?\n\n220\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.360\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and there are some\nthings that are really non-value added\n\n221\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.020\nperiod that you just wanna smite,\nyou just wanna get rid of them.\n\n222\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.710\nBut a lot of non-value added activities\n\n223\n00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.460\nare just ones that don't contribute\ndirectly to that process.\n\n224\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.370\nBut all of those would\nfall under that umbrella.\n\n225\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.955\nAnd I think that even\nmakes it more confusing,\n\n226\n00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:56.949\nbecause I'm looking at eliminating waste,\nright?\n\n227\n00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:59.420\nAnd sometimes waste is waste.\n\n228\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.070\nWe shouldn't even be doing it.\n\n229\n00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.400\nBut sometimes we're labeling\nit as non-value or waste,\n\n230\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.400\nwhich is the other word that they use.\n\n231\n00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.730\nBut all I'm saying is not for\nwhat I'm working on.\n\n232\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.836\nSo I'm just not gonna think about it.\n\n233\n00:13:11.836 --> 00:13:14.566\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it aligns with my company core\n\n234\n00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:18.619\nvalues, but it isn't monetarily\nassociated to this project.\n\n235\n00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:20.577\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, perfect.\n\n236\n00:13:20.577 --> 00:13:22.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, like I said,\n\n237\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.518\nit's a sticky wicket because\nsometimes one of the companies I\n\n238\n00:13:27.518 --> 00:13:32.227\nworked with labeled the HR Department\nas necessary waste.\n\n239\n00:13:32.227 --> 00:13:33.322\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:13:33.322 --> 00:13:34.566\n&gt;&gt; So it doesn't make you feel good.\n\n241\n00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:38.239\nSo once you get those value\nadded versus non-value added.\n\n242\n00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:40.954\nAnd so here's some other thoughts.\n\n243\n00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:44.590\nThis is another way,\njust another way to look at it, okay?\n\n244\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.080\nOn the value-added side, the customer's\nwilling to pay for it, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.070\nBecause, if I come up with a great idea\nbut my customer doesn't think it's.\n\n246\n00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.400\nAnd that's how we know if\nthe customer thinks it's a good idea,\n\n247\n00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.880\nif they're willing to fund it, right?\n\n248\n00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.038\nActually transforms a product or service.\n\n249\n00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:02.810\nSo a value-added, it makes that product or\nservice better, faster,\n\n250\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.800\nmore cost-effective, keeping in mind\none decision is not to do that.\n\n251\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.870\nSometimes it's too expensive to make\nsomething better or faster, right?\n\n252\n00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.070\nIt's not cost effective.\n\n253\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.460\nDone correctly the first time,\nnow that's a real value-added thing.\n\n254\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.090\nIf I can do something and I've built\nin enough control so that that activity\n\n255\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.090\nhappens and it's always happening\ncorrectly, definitely value-added.\n\n256\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.655\nAnd some other ideas of non value-added\nstuff, keeping in mind sometimes non\n\n257\n00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:35.024\nvalue-added only means that it's not\npertinent to what I'm working on.\n\n258\n00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:38.630\nIt consumes resources without\ncreating any kind of customer value.\n\n259\n00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.830\nSo I'm basically doing busy work and\nsometimes I don't even know it's busy work\n\n260\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.380\nand that's why it's important to\nalways be looking at that stuff.\n\n261\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.790\nIt might just be a report we've\nalways done on Friday and\n\n262\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.960\nno one's reading it, right?\n\n263\n00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.380\nLow percentage of the time work\nis complete with accuracy.\n\n264\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.790\nSo, kinda just the flip side of that.\n\n265\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.867\nSo just other ways of looking\nat value versus non value-added.\n\n266\n00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:07.120\nAnd it requires a lot of extra time, or\neffort, or resources, anything like that.\n\n267\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.800\nSo if you're seeing something in\nyour company where there's two or\n\n268\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.340\nthree people doing something\nthat one person could do.\n\n269\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.260\n&gt;&gt; Over checking.\n\n270\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.470\n&gt;&gt; Over checking is a perfect example.\n\n271\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.860\nI do wanna point out that in the old days,\nLean,\n\n272\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.810\nin the 1980s, got a bad rap for\neliminating people.\n\n273\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.700\nBecause Lean as one of their\ntools was automation, and\n\n274\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.210\nso some people did lose their jobs.\n\n275\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.850\nThe newer, Leaner Six Sigma is certainly\nwhat we promote at our company when we go\n\n276\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:40.930\ninto companies, is that you're not trying\nto eliminate resources, human resources.\n\n277\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.920\nWhat you're trying to do is make sure\nthey're working on meaningful work.\n\n278\n00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.465\nSo we tell people, even when they call us,\nthat Lean Six Sigma now means that you're\n\n279\n00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:52.837\njust gonna take that resource and put them\non more meaningful work as opposed to,\n\n280\n00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:53.562\n&gt;&gt; So it's the best use.\n\n281\n00:15:53.562 --> 00:15:55.358\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] and it is big.\n\n282\n00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:59.434\nI mean, Okay, so,\nlean's about removing waste, and so\n\n283\n00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:04.261\na way of looking at that, in another\nsession we talked about tact time\n\n284\n00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:10.070\nbeing the time of the customer needs\nthe product or the service, right?\n\n285\n00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.260\nI can look at something simple instead\nof making it complicated, and I can\n\n286\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.430\nsay this is where the request comes in,\nand this is where the delivery goes out.\n\n287\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.620\nWhat are the things\nthat happen in between?\n\n288\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.070\nAnd once again,\nback to that value versus non-value,\n\n289\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.280\nanything that happens in\nbetween the request and\n\n290\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.490\nthe deliverable, that doesn't stop- like,\nif I took that out of the picture,\n\n291\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.510\nit would still get delivered, then I'm\ngonna call that non-value added or waste.\n\n292\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.160\nBut I'm not getting rid of it,\nnecessarily.\n\n293\n00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.260\nSometimes, I am, a lot of times I am.\n\n294\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure it's customer-dependent,\nas well.\n\n295\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.530\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n296\n00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.240\nSo, now I wanna spend a little\nbit of time talking about\n\n297\n00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.370\nthe Lean Six Sigma Principles.\n\n298\n00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.060\nWhat are the reasons I think this is\na huge thing to talk about is, if you get\n\n299\n00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.630\nfamiliar with the principles, you'll be\nable to answer the questions on the exam.\n\n300\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.600\nBecause a lot of times, the exam,\nthey are asking you something.\n\n301\n00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.080\nAnd you go, well, I know one of the things\nthat's a principle in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n302\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.420\nand that goes against the principle,\nso that one's going to be false.\n\n303\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.333\nSo, getting to know the basic\nprinciples of Lean Six Sigma is huge.\n\n304\n00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.523\nThere is, even though I'm gonna\ngo through these very quickly,\n\n305\n00:17:18.523 --> 00:17:21.553\nthis is another one of those\nhandouts in your student packet.\n\n306\n00:17:21.553 --> 00:17:22.081\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n307\n00:17:22.081 --> 00:17:25.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and then it'll have\na little bit of explanation.\n\n308\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.010\nNow, the first one is really huge,\ncustomer focus.\n\n309\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.120\n&gt;&gt; I see, it's in red.\n\n310\n00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's in red.\n\n311\n00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.960\nIt's really, really important.\n\n312\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.430\nAnd both Lean and Six Sigma, as separate\nmethodologies, saw the value in that.\n\n313\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.250\nLean Six Sigma puts it at the top.\n\n314\n00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:47.430\nAnd the way I make sure that I've done\nmy job is that the customer's happy.\n\n315\n00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.731\nNow, this used to be, if you go back and\nlook at some of the 1950s shows,\n\n316\n00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:56.440\nLucy and 50 and 60's shows like Lucy,\nand Dick Van Dyke and\n\n317\n00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.220\nsome of those older television shows,\nthey were always saying that,\n\n318\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.370\nthe customers always right,\nthe customers always right.\n\n319\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.680\nBut we kind of lost that\nas we moved forward.\n\n320\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.637\nNow we're saying customer focus, but\n\n321\n00:18:06.637 --> 00:18:09.727\nit's just another way of saying\nthe customers always right.\n\n322\n00:18:09.727 --> 00:18:13.930\nSo, I wanna give you at least\nwhat you think you want, right?\n\n323\n00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.160\nAnd that's more important\nthan return on investment.\n\n324\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.590\nNow, this will keep a lot of CEOs awake.\n\n325\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.630\nAnd certainly, the assumption is that\nif I give the customer what they want,\n\n326\n00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.690\nthen I'm gonna make the money that I need.\n\n327\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.620\nBut Lean Six Sigma puts customer focus,\nand what the customer wants above return\n\n328\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.860\non investment, which means sometimes, I\nhave to give a little to keep my customer.\n\n329\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.570\nSo, data driven decisions,\n\n330\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:43.380\na data driven decision means I've got all\nthe facts before I make the decision.\n\n331\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.110\nNow, in Lean Six Sigma,\nI might have all the facts on paper, but\n\n332\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.610\nI just knows something about my\ncostumer that you don't know.\n\n333\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.250\nMaybe, I know they're going on vacation\nnext week, or something as silly as that.\n\n334\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.660\nSo, even though decisions are data driven,\nLean Six Sigma considers all the other\n\n335\n00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.338\nfactors as well, but-\n&gt;&gt; Taking the quantification analysis and\n\n336\n00:19:04.338 --> 00:19:07.770\nadding the [LAUGH] what's the other one?\n\n337\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.590\nThe quantification versus\nthe qualification?\n\n338\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and\nI mean, it's just, but\n\n339\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:18.200\nI think one of the things that we want to\nmake sure that we don't get away from,\n\n340\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.500\nis that a core principle is that I'm still\ngonna make my decisions on the data.\n\n341\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I want to consider all that other\n\n342\n00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.050\nstuff, because that's important,\nand we know it's important.\n\n343\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.640\nAnd in Six Sigma, it's just data.\n\n344\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.560\n[LAUGH] But in Lean Six Sigma,\nit's mostly data, there's not really a 50,\n\n345\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.620\n50 blend, it's still data,\nand then respect.\n\n346\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.690\nAnd this is what I love\nabout Lean Six Sigma is that\n\n347\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.370\nit goes of out its way to talk\nabout things like respect, and\n\n348\n00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.670\nappreciating people for their gifts and\nrespecting our company time.\n\n349\n00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.300\nIt's a very ethical methodology.\n\n350\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.230\nResults, and this is a big one,\nbecause a lot of times,\n\n351\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:01.010\nyou'll hear people say things like\nespecially in Lean environments.\n\n352\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.700\nIt's more about the process, and it's not.\n\n353\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.180\nLean Six Sigma is about the results,\nwhat I ended up with.\n\n354\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.570\nAnd unfortunately, the best way to,\nI shouldn't say unfortunately, but\n\n355\n00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:15.625\nthe way that we save results is by\ntalking about return on investment.\n\n356\n00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:18.860\nWhat did you make me, save me or\navoid me spending, right?\n\n357\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.010\nBut results are very important, but you\nwill hear people in some of the people in\n\n358\n00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.800\nLean environments, it's about the process.\n\n359\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:29.510\nIt is, but if the process doesn't lead to\nresults, then it doesn't really matter.\n\n360\n00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.040\nAccountability, and\nthat's another huge one is that lots of\n\n361\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.560\nthe tools in Lean Six Sigma have you\nsigning off, because what we found\n\n362\n00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.530\nout in a psychological sense,\nis that when we sign contracts,\n\n363\n00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.880\nwhen we check the lists,\nwe're just a lot more committed.\n\n364\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.300\nAnd when my name is on a a metric,\nso it says, a matrix rather,\n\n365\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.300\nthat says I'm responsible for this task,\nprobably more likely to do it.\n\n366\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.120\nSo, a lot of accountability.\n\n367\n00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.760\nWe spent about two decades in a society\nwhere we were, okay, this is confidential.\n\n368\n00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.840\nLean's going the other way.\n\n369\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.750\nWe should have things out in the open.\n\n370\n00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.700\nIf we have too many confidential things,\npeople don't have accountability.\n\n371\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.110\nPeople get confused, cuz they think\nall kinds of things are going on.\n\n372\n00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.670\nSo, Lean Six Sigma's on\nthe other side of the continuum.\n\n373\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.980\nNo, we will need to know.\n\n374\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:23.620\nWe need to take personal accountability,\ndepartment accountability, customer, and\n\n375\n00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.620\nthat might even morph over into\nsocial responsibility-type things.\n\n376\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.130\nAnd then, excellence.\n\n377\n00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.550\nAnd what I love about that is,\nexcellence is so\n\n378\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.480\nmuch different than, I'm gonna do a good\njob, I'm gonna do what's expected of me.\n\n379\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.480\nLean Six Sigma really promotes\nthat you go one step beyond, and\n\n380\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.730\nthat one step beyond is often\nreferred to as a delighter.\n\n381\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:48.560\nAnd I love that word, that it's this\ntechnical program, and that, delighters.\n\n382\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.380\nWe want to provide delighters.\n\n383\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.091\nAnd what delighters mean is that we kind\nof go above what we were told that we had\n\n384\n00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:56.766\nto do to make it excellent.\n\n385\n00:21:58.428 --> 00:22:03.700\nSo, principle one, customer focus,\nwe'll go through these fairly quickly.\n\n386\n00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.800\nIt's, kind of keep in mind,\nand this one says cheaper,\n\n387\n00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.950\nthat's another way that sometimes we\nsay that cost effectiveness is cheaper,\n\n388\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.010\njust because it's faster to say.\n\n389\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.053\nI have a tendency to say cost\neffectiveness, but remember,\n\n390\n00:22:17.053 --> 00:22:20.166\non some of the exams,\nit might be better, faster, cheaper.\n\n391\n00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:23.750\nI kinda think better, faster,\nmore cost effective, because sometimes,\n\n392\n00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.928\ncheaper isn't better.\n\n393\n00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:25.572\n&gt;&gt; Fancy word.\n\n394\n00:22:25.572 --> 00:22:27.780\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n395\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.840\nwhen people say what is customer focus?\n\n396\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:35.910\nIn fact, I can tell you,\nwhen I was an executive HR for\n\n397\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.550\nmany, many years, and\nwhen I used to do interviewing,\n\n398\n00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:42.970\nwe had this question, where they\nwould say they were a team player.\n\n399\n00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.770\nAnd we would say to them, well,\nwhat does that mean to you?\n\n400\n00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.020\nAnd people would just freeze,\n\n401\n00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.025\nbecause I don't know what it\nmeans to be a team player.\n\n402\n00:22:49.025 --> 00:22:50.320\n[LAUGH] Well, it's the same thing.\n\n403\n00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.710\nIf you're saying, what is customer focus?\n\n404\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.310\nYou want to be able to\nbreak that down an an exam.\n\n405\n00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.830\nIf you see,\nit might not say customer focus.\n\n406\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.660\nIt might say something like, what is\nrelated to being timely, and accurate?\n\n407\n00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.310\nSo, you wanna kind of get very familiar,\nwhat does customer focus really mean?\n\n408\n00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.470\nWell, it means giving accurate,\ntimely, accessible, treatment,\n\n409\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.760\neffective, cost all of\nthose kinds of things.\n\n410\n00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.495\nSo, when you're thinking about\nthese principles, you want to\n\n411\n00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:18.445\ntake kind of the baby step back and\nsay, well, what does that mean, really?\n\n412\n00:23:18.445 --> 00:23:20.965\nAnd that's gonna help you answer\nsome of those exam questions.\n\n413\n00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:24.518\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, just, if you're thinking\nof that term, cheaper, we're not talking\n\n414\n00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:27.898\nabout creating a cheap, or junky product,\nbut a more cost-effective product.\n\n415\n00:23:27.898 --> 00:23:30.425\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n416\n00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:33.475\nOkay, and so that principal to\ndata-driven decisions, and remember,\n\n417\n00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:38.500\nwe just said that Lean Six Sigma looks\nat the data and all those other factors.\n\n418\n00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.100\nBut still, our decision should mostly\nbe driven by the data that we gather.\n\n419\n00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.010\nAnd some of that data could\nbe the human factors, right?\n\n420\n00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.076\nSo, if someone were to ask\nyou in an interview, well,\n\n421\n00:23:49.076 --> 00:23:51.156\nwhat is a data driven decision mean?\n\n422\n00:23:51.156 --> 00:23:55.667\nWell, these are some things that you can\nuse to validate, what is data driven?\n\n423\n00:23:55.667 --> 00:24:00.621\nA lot of times we just throw out these\nwords like team building or teams or\n\n424\n00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:02.120\nchange management.\n\n425\n00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.100\nAnd, really, if we had to define them\nwe just don't know what they are.\n\n426\n00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.170\nSo, data driven.\n\n427\n00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.180\n&gt;&gt; Like synergy.\n\n428\n00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:07.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, synergy.\n\n429\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.110\nThat's another good one.\n\n430\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.930\nSo, you can just kind of take\na look at these bullets.\n\n431\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.710\nAgain, this is start of your\nstudent packet, that principles.\n\n432\n00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.020\nWhen you get your student packet it kind\nof breaks out each one of these principles\n\n433\n00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.320\nand talks a little.\n\n434\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think earlier I had misspoke.\n\n435\n00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.330\nBut it was quantitative versus\nqualitative that I was trying to get out.\n\n436\n00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.940\n&gt;&gt; I thought you did a good job.\n\n437\n00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew what you were talking about.\n\n438\n00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.933\n&gt;&gt; The thought was there.\n\n439\n00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nPrincipal three, like I said,\n\n440\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.030\nI love this who thing with respect.\n\n441\n00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.300\nAnd Deming, I am bringing up\nDeming right now because he's one\n\n442\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.900\nof the founders of what became TQM.\n\n443\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.530\nTotal quality management.\n\n444\n00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.660\nDeming died in his 90's,\nwhen he was in his 90's so\n\n445\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.580\nwe actually have YouTube tapes and\nthings of Deming speaking.\n\n446\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.960\nHe was a great pioneer but\nhe was very, very big on respect but\n\n447\n00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.487\nI love this quote, a bad process\nwill beat a good person every time.\n\n448\n00:25:02.487 --> 00:25:06.280\n[LAUGH] When I was working in\nHR I used to have people come to\n\n449\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.640\nme all the time saying,\nyou know the people are broken.\n\n450\n00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.320\nAnd what I found it wasn't the people,\nit was just the processes.\n\n451\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n452\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.190\n&gt;&gt; And so I think respect is huge and\n\n453\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.420\nis one of the things I really\nlove about Lean Six Sigma.\n\n454\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.690\nOkay so back to results, when we're\ntalking about results Lean Six Sma\n\n455\n00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.040\nfalls back on that old smart goals, right?\n\n456\n00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.250\nAnd even those smart goals was not a part\nof Lean by itself or Six Sigma by itself,\n\n457\n00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.630\nit has been adopted by Lean Six Sigma and\nit often shows up in exams\n\n458\n00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.460\nespecially in the Lean only exams, but\ncertainly in the Lean Six Sigma exams.\n\n459\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.080\nAnd so just as a reminder, SMART was\njust an acronym that says Specific,\n\n460\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.010\nMeasurable, Attainable,\nRelevant and Time Bound.\n\n461\n00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.660\nRight?\n\n462\n00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.460\nAnd then this is just kind of an example.\n\n463\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.040\nAgain, this is part of your student pack.\n\n464\n00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.170\nSo I won't spend too much time there.\n\n465\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.260\nAccountability, when\nwe say accountability,\n\n466\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.385\nwhat does that exactly mean?\n\n467\n00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:04.530\nAnd on the right hand side\nof the screen you'll see\n\n468\n00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.070\njust an example of a matrix\nof things that need, and this\n\n469\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.420\nyou could also kind of look at this as\na little bit of a swim lane kind of chart.\n\n470\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.180\nBut think and act in a manner\nneeded to achieve results, right?\n\n471\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.950\nHold others responsible,\ncommunicate, capture learning and\n\n472\n00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:25.410\nagain, I just think it's important that\nwe say, hey, these are the principles but\n\n473\n00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.590\nto understand what those principles mean.\n\n474\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.610\nSo excellence, and we talked a little\nbit about my favorite part of\n\n475\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.910\nexcellence is that you know when you can,\nyou wanna provide the lighters.\n\n476\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.330\nBut this is just a little schematic\nto kind of drive that home.\n\n477\n00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.221\nI mean, excellence is more of an intuitive\nword than some of the other ones.\n\n478\n00:26:43.897 --> 00:26:46.720\nSo Lean Concepts and Tools.\n\n479\n00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.580\nOne of them we've already talked about,\nbut we will talk about a little bit more\n\n480\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.920\nwhen we talk about models and\nthat's PDCA, Plan Do Check Act.\n\n481\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.290\nAnother concept is Standard Work,\nanother concept's Visual Management,\n\n482\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.310\nanother concept's Kaizen.\n\n483\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.050\nAnd so, I just want to briefly,\nbecause we do talk about these later, but\n\n484\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:13.790\nI think if you get kind of a bigger view\nof this, it makes it a lot more simple.\n\n485\n00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.730\nSo, Standard Work, and\nthis is one that's very\n\n486\n00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.480\ncomplicated if you're in a manufacturing\nenvironment because of the forms.\n\n487\n00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.820\nBut all Standard Work is, is sort of\nlike a best practice for your job.\n\n488\n00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.370\nSo best practices would be bigger things,\nlike things that you did for\n\n489\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.900\nyour company, kind of lofty things.\n\n490\n00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.370\nWhen you're thinking about standards,\nyour kind of thinking about projects.\n\n491\n00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.880\nBut if you were just, basically,\nall you're doing is documenting your work.\n\n492\n00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.380\nWhen they say Standard Work, I'm just\nsaying this is the way I do stuff, so\n\n493\n00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.830\nthese are the six steps I take.\n\n494\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.100\nSo if a temporary came in that day and\n\n495\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.440\nhad to do your job,\nthere would be a kind of a manual.\n\n496\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.480\nSo it's a really simple concept\nthat's been again, over complicated.\n\n497\n00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.030\nAnd certain rules apply to it.\n\n498\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.750\nBut Standard Work is just a documentation\nof kinda your daily stuff.\n\n499\n00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.830\nAnd if you find a better way to do it\nthen you rewrite the Standard Work.\n\n500\n00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.210\nSo that's how we're gonna keep doing it.\n\n501\n00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:09.910\nVisual Management, Visual Management\ncould be a stop sign, trash goes here.\n\n502\n00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.120\nAnything like that.\n\n503\n00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:16.300\nSo Visual Management it's just doing\na process improvement by putting signs up.\n\n504\n00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.937\nOkay?\nNow,\n\n505\n00:28:16.937 --> 00:28:19.882\nyou can take a whole course\nin Visual Management, and\n\n506\n00:28:19.882 --> 00:28:24.269\nI'm not trying to discount that, I'm just\nsaying that if you go back to the pure\n\n507\n00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:28.336\neasy concepts which we're talking about,\nit's not that complicated.\n\n508\n00:28:28.336 --> 00:28:31.145\nSo Kaizen which is another\nconcept we're gonna address.\n\n509\n00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:34.455\nRight now, I just want you\nto think about Kaizen Event\n\n510\n00:28:34.455 --> 00:28:36.275\nit's just a rapid improvement event.\n\n511\n00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:40.195\nNow, the deal is rapid improvements\non the manufacturing floor,\n\n512\n00:28:40.195 --> 00:28:42.225\ncan happen in real time.\n\n513\n00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.280\nI can go and\n\n514\n00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.800\nrealign a form on a particular piece\nof equipment and everything's better.\n\n515\n00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.480\nRight?\n\n516\n00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.930\nRapid improvement events in the service\narea are, what I'm trying to do is I'm\n\n517\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.870\ntrying to use a model and come up with\na really super good project plan.\n\n518\n00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:05.160\nSo that we can hire a project manager in\nor use someone internally to do that plan.\n\n519\n00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.130\nSo rapid improvement event\nin the service side or\n\n520\n00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.060\ntransaction side,\nanything non-manufacturing.\n\n521\n00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.520\nI'm getting a group of people together.\n\n522\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.860\nI'm saying, hey, we have this problem,\nwe gotta fix it right away.\n\n523\n00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.864\nWho's gonna do what?\n\n524\n00:29:15.864 --> 00:29:17.303\nAnd who's gonna commit what dollars?\n\n525\n00:29:17.303 --> 00:29:19.070\nAnd who's gonna commit what resources?\n\n526\n00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.790\nSo if you kinda think\nof Kaizen in that term.\n\n527\n00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.530\nSo some other popular concepts\nin Lean Six Sigma is that.\n\n528\n00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.970\nLean takes standard work super seriously,\nlike I said to the point that it kind of\n\n529\n00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:33.490\novercomplicates it sometimes because\nthere's forms that people fill out.\n\n530\n00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.030\nAnd I think the form does confuse people,\nI think a narrative\n\n531\n00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:40.130\nwould make better Standard Work, but\nI don't get to make that decision.\n\n532\n00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:45.310\nSo if you're asked on an exam [LAUGH],\nStandard Work a lot of times you\n\n533\n00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.040\nwould say it's a methodology for\na particular activity.\n\n534\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.150\nIt's the best way we're\ndoing things right now,\n\n535\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.440\nI'm trying to standardize\nto make it a repeatable.\n\n536\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.770\nSo my best thing still is,\nif you were hiring someone for\n\n537\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.080\nthe day to do your job,\nthere would be a manual.\n\n538\n00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.450\n&gt;&gt; To be able to replicate\nyour day to day functions.\n\n539\n00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n540\n00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:06.830\nAnd that seems so logical to me,\nbut it has a lot of forms.\n\n541\n00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.570\nAnd then Visual Management\nis just a reminder.\n\n542\n00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.350\nIt's just a picture's worth 1000 words,\nright?\n\n543\n00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.360\nAnd the sign should be\nclear to the reader.\n\n544\n00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.630\nSo for example, these kind of\nsigns aren't particularly clear.\n\n545\n00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.630\nIt says surgery parking,\nonly five minutes limit.\n\n546\n00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.590\nProbably gonna be in surgery\nlonger than five minutes.\n\n547\n00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then.\n\n548\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.090\n&gt;&gt; I saw one the other day\nit was crossing a street.\n\n549\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.050\nAnd it said, cross at your own risk.\n\n550\n00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I just thought to myself,\n\n551\n00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.190\nwell every time you cross the street\naren't you crossing at your own.\n\n552\n00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.040\n&gt;&gt; Crossing at your own risk.\n\n553\n00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.650\nAnd that's perfect.\n\n554\n00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.840\nThat's another good example.\n\n555\n00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.790\nYou don't want to make signs redundant,\nright?\n\n556\n00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.220\nYou don't want to do that.\n\n557\n00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.660\nYou wanna make sure that your\nmessage isn't overshadowed.\n\n558\n00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.805\nAnd this example it says caution\nthis sign has sharp edges.\n\n559\n00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:49.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And, but\n\n560\n00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.850\nthere's some interesting stuff down there.\n\n561\n00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.580\nIt's telling you not to smoke,\nand not to do different,\n\n562\n00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.220\nI mean it's just\novershadowing the message.\n\n563\n00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.330\nAnd then you wanna make sure it's\ntimely because that's a big thing.\n\n564\n00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.590\nAnd this one says caution\nplayground equipment might be hot.\n\n565\n00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.140\nProbably not in the snow.\n\n566\n00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:07.220\n&gt;&gt; Covered in snow right.\n\n567\n00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:12.950\n&gt;&gt; And so there is, cuz I don't want to\ndiscount Visual Management, it's huge.\n\n568\n00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:17.910\nVisual Managements huge, but\nyou just wanna make sure\n\n569\n00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.040\nthat your sensible about it and\nthat you make signs that make sense.\n\n570\n00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.730\nYou don't wanna make them confusing,\nlike that first one's kinda confusing, or\n\n571\n00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.540\nat least it's confusing for me.\n\n572\n00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.810\nAnd then, to your point,\nyou don't wanna make them redundant.\n\n573\n00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.860\nI probably am gonna stop and\nnot hit the wall.\n\n574\n00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Did you Photoshop that or\nwas that real?\n\n575\n00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is real,\nthese are real ones my students send me.\n\n576\n00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.160\nI love funny signs and so\nmy and you guys can do that too.\n\n577\n00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.855\nI love funny signs and so\nthey send me this stuff.\n\n578\n00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:44.078\nThere's just the latest ones.\n\n579\n00:31:44.078 --> 00:31:45.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n580\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.052\nthis is why you can end up taking you\nknow a long class in Visual Management.\n\n581\n00:31:50.052 --> 00:31:53.176\nWhy Visual Management such\na big deal in Lean Six Sigma?\n\n582\n00:31:53.176 --> 00:31:57.615\nIs that in a project, I do the project and\nthen the project's done.\n\n583\n00:31:57.615 --> 00:32:02.307\nAnd a process improvement project,\ntypically I make the process improvement,\n\n584\n00:32:02.307 --> 00:32:06.080\nbut I add an element of\nsomething called sustainability.\n\n585\n00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.820\nAnd that means that after I've done\nthis awesome process improvement,\n\n586\n00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.300\nI wanna keep it in place.\n\n587\n00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.660\nA project a lot of times starts, ends,\nit's over, I go on to another project.\n\n588\n00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.790\nBut process improvement projects, I wanna\nmake sure that, after I did all this work,\n\n589\n00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.710\nthis improvement stays in place.\n\n590\n00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.190\nWell, a great way to do that\nis visual management, right?\n\n591\n00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:24.730\nAgain, trash goes here.\n\n592\n00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.010\nGo through this store.\n\n593\n00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.360\nExit here, right?\n\n594\n00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:35.020\nSo Lean Six Sigma projects\nhave areas of focus and\n\n595\n00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.340\nobviously, cuz we've been saying this,\nbetter faster more cost effective.\n\n596\n00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.640\nCost reduction.\n\n597\n00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.350\nThis is just another way of saying them.\n\n598\n00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.230\nBut on the exam, it might say stuff,\n\n599\n00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.690\nit might use words instead of cost\nreduction, it might use overhead.\n\n600\n00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.490\nIt might use scrap or rework.\n\n601\n00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.981\nSo, even though the idea is to make\nsomething more cost effective.\n\n602\n00:32:56.981 --> 00:32:59.915\nOn these types of exams,\nyou'll wanna watch for\n\n603\n00:32:59.915 --> 00:33:04.064\nthose other kinds of words that\nbecause if they say better, faster,\n\n604\n00:33:04.064 --> 00:33:06.043\nmore cost effective-\n&gt;&gt; Key words.\n\n605\n00:33:06.043 --> 00:33:07.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, keywords.\n\n606\n00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.080\nAnd rework is gonna cost you money, right?\n\n607\n00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.110\nSo just kind of, cost avoidance,\nwhen we're thinking cost avoidance.\n\n608\n00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.620\nThink about regulatory expenses,\ncapital equipment needs,\n\n609\n00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.800\nthose kind of things, capacity increase.\n\n610\n00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.830\nThese are just words that, sometimes\nquestions on these type of exams,\n\n611\n00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.510\nwill use a scenario instead of the word\nbetter, faster, more cost-effective.\n\n612\n00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.990\nThey're gonna use other words.\n\n613\n00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.630\nSo, you just kinda wanna\nkeep that in mind.\n\n614\n00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.957\nAnd like even customer satisfaction,\n\n615\n00:33:37.957 --> 00:33:41.790\nthey might be talking about\non-time delivery or pricing.\n\n616\n00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.139\nAnd health and safety, they might be\ntalking about ergonomics, right, and\n\n617\n00:33:45.139 --> 00:33:47.160\nthey might not use the word health and\nsafety.\n\n618\n00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.960\nSo just kinda keep that in mind.\n\n619\n00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.620\nAnd finally, and\n\n620\n00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.690\nI'm not sure you guys can see that\ncuz it's at the bottom of the slide.\n\n621\n00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.870\nFlow is a big deal and it's covered\na lot in the Yellow Belt training.\n\n622\n00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.620\nAnd that's process speed,\ntravel distance, on time delivery.\n\n623\n00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:05.730\nSo I think the biggest point that I\nwanna make on that is, it is better,\n\n624\n00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.870\nfaster, and more cost effective.\n\n625\n00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:11.560\nAnd now, we're adding a lot of times,\nhealth and safety.\n\n626\n00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.050\nSo it's better, faster and\nmore cost effective plus be safe.\n\n627\n00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.680\nBe healthy,\na lot of companies are adding that on.\n\n628\n00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.200\nBut and if they use those words, it\nwould be so much leaner, but they don't.\n\n629\n00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.070\nI mean a lot of times instead\nof saying something like,\n\n630\n00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:28.950\nI wanna make something faster,\nI want to improve cycle time, right?\n\n631\n00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.410\nSo just be listening for different\nways of capturing that information.\n\n632\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.960\nSo, this schematic is also\nincluded in your student pack.\n\n633\n00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.020\nIt's a little bit more in depth than\nthe one you're seeing here on the screen.\n\n634\n00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.790\nAnd this is just, this is really more\nto help people that are Lean Six Sigma,\n\n635\n00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.360\nbut they're going into a lean environment.\n\n636\n00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.180\nSo it's kind of a,\nit's actually kind of bonus material.\n\n637\n00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.170\nSo I'm certified as a Lean Six Sigma\nperson, but I'm gonna go and\n\n638\n00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.070\nwork in an environment\nthat's primary Lean.\n\n639\n00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.300\nOr I'm certified as\na Lean Six Sigma person,\n\n640\n00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.070\nbut I'm gonna go into\nan environment that's Six Sigma.\n\n641\n00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.979\nThis is happening all the time\nthroughout our nation because,\n\n642\n00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.680\npeople are seeing the value of\nLean Six Sigma certification, but\n\n643\n00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.900\ntheir company might be just Six Sigma or\nLean.\n\n644\n00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.370\nAnd if you read ads in the newspaper\nright now, that dates me, right?\n\n645\n00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:24.740\nIf you read ads on the internet,\nif you read electronic ads right now,\n\n646\n00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.790\neven if they're asking for\na Lean person or a Six Sigma person,\n\n647\n00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:31.080\nsomewhere in there they're saying\nmust be familiar with the other one.\n\n648\n00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.110\nSo, it's not uncommon that as\na Lean Six Sigma person they may have\n\n649\n00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:40.110\nbeen attracted to you,\nbecause you have the other side of that.\n\n650\n00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.710\nSo there's things like that,\nthey're just sort of bonus material.\n\n651\n00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:48.310\nAnother term that's used quite\noften is something called Kaizen.\n\n652\n00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.920\nAnd a lot of times,\nthat refers to a rapid improvement event.\n\n653\n00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.660\nSo they might say Kaizen,\nor rapid improvement event.\n\n654\n00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.470\nAnd what that is, is they're\ndoing a process improvement, but\n\n655\n00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:03.430\nit needs to be done quickly\njust like the name implies.\n\n656\n00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.390\nAnd they still have to use\na model to do that, so\n\n657\n00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.380\nwhat are the models that we've\ntalked about already a lot is PDCA.\n\n658\n00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.130\nAnd PDCA is, especially if the problem's\nnot too difficult to solve,\n\n659\n00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.820\nA PDCA following that\nmethodology is really good.\n\n660\n00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.740\nThey can also use DMAIC which we're\ngonna be covering in other sessions.\n\n661\n00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.140\nIf the problem's kind of complicated and\n\n662\n00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.400\nthen there's a separate model called\nSCORE which we'll be covering on the next\n\n663\n00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:33.248\nsession, that's designed just for\nrapid improvement events.\n\n664\n00:36:33.248 --> 00:36:40.910\nSo, a popular term in Lean Six Sigma is\nKaizen event or rapid improvement event.\n\n665\n00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.620\nAnd all that means is that in\na very finite period of time,\n\n666\n00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.840\nwe have to finish up something, right?\n\n667\n00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.810\nOn manufacturing, you can do it in\nreal time on the manufacturing floor.\n\n668\n00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.690\nWhen you're looking at service or\n\n669\n00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.780\ntransaction, basically anything that's\nnon-manufacturing, when you're doing\n\n670\n00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:02.210\na rapid improvement event, you're trying\nto come up with a super good project plan.\n\n671\n00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.680\nSo that you can hire some women or\n\n672\n00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.620\nget someone else in the company\nto evoke the plan, right?\n\n673\n00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.710\nSo all the people are coming together and\nthey're saying, well,\n\n674\n00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.690\nthis is the resources I'll dedicate,\nthis is the time.\n\n675\n00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.060\nI'm giving you pre-approval so if you\ncome into the rapid improvement event,\n\n676\n00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:18.610\nyou're not running around going,\nis this okay?\n\n677\n00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n678\n00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:24.660\n&gt;&gt; So the last thing that we're gonna\ncover is some popular facilitation tools.\n\n679\n00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.857\nSo any other models\nthat you're working on,\n\n680\n00:37:26.857 --> 00:37:29.940\nyou're gonna still have to work\nwith people no matter what.\n\n681\n00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.855\nNow, you might be the only\nperson on your team.\n\n682\n00:37:33.855 --> 00:37:35.891\nBut you're gonna have to reach out and\nget information.\n\n683\n00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:38.769\nThe more information that you get,\nthe better, right?\n\n684\n00:37:38.769 --> 00:37:42.911\nAnd so, a lot times the ways you can do\nthat is by using facilitation tools and\n\n685\n00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:47.025\nremember, Lean Six Sigma\nover-uses that word, tools, right?\n\n686\n00:37:47.025 --> 00:37:49.895\nSo, some popular ones are brainstorming,\nand\n\n687\n00:37:49.895 --> 00:37:53.700\nthat's one of the things that we talked\nabout earlier with the affinity diagram.\n\n688\n00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.170\nAnd just as a reminder, because again,\n\n689\n00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.930\nthis is something that's hit a lot\non the exams about brainstorming.\n\n690\n00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.050\nAnd so there's some bullets there.\n\n691\n00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.190\nBut you wanna ask open ended questions.\n\n692\n00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.670\nMy suggestion earlier, if you can get\nsomeone to be the person that's writing on\n\n693\n00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.320\nthe flip chart, that if you can\nget someone who knows nothing\n\n694\n00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.670\nabout what you're doing, then they're\nless likely to put judgment in it.\n\n695\n00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.650\nBecause typically, you're supposed\nto just put anything on the board.\n\n696\n00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.610\nYou wanna focus.\n\n697\n00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:22.614\nYou wanna stay loose.\n\n698\n00:38:22.614 --> 00:38:25.286\nYou wanna put, later,\nyou can combine things.\n\n699\n00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:28.360\nSo if somebody says something that's\nrepetitive, you just wanna go with it.\n\n700\n00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:34.920\nSo multi-voting is another one\nthat's very, very popular.\n\n701\n00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.950\nYou always, no matter what model you're\nworking on ultimately you wanna give\n\n702\n00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.500\nyour go-to person three solutions.\n\n703\n00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.424\nAnd the reason you wanna do that is\nbecause that gets their buy-in and\n\n704\n00:38:45.424 --> 00:38:47.620\nthey're picking the solution, right?\n\n705\n00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.010\nBut sometimes you get into\na situation where there are a ton\n\n706\n00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.410\nof decisions that could be made.\n\n707\n00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.590\nInstead of just having one or\ntwo and struggling for\n\n708\n00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.510\nthat third one,\nyou just have a lot of things going on.\n\n709\n00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.410\nSo you can use a system\ncalled multi-voting.\n\n710\n00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:06.115\nAnd what would happen there is,\nlet's say the scenario would be,\n\n711\n00:39:06.115 --> 00:39:10.065\nyou have eight directions you\ncould go in for your department.\n\n712\n00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:12.435\nAnd you're trying to get an idea\non what we should work on first.\n\n713\n00:39:12.435 --> 00:39:15.585\nThere's eight things we really wanna do\nand they're all very, very important.\n\n714\n00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:17.925\nBut what should we be working on first?\n\n715\n00:39:17.925 --> 00:39:21.460\nSo let's say I have 25\npeople in my department.\n\n716\n00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.280\nAnd I wanna get that consensus,\nI wanna get that buy-in.\n\n717\n00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:30.740\nSo first time around with my eight themes,\nI might say you have three votes, right?\n\n718\n00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:35.360\nNow I'm hoping if you have three votes,\nsome of that stuff's gonna fall off.\n\n719\n00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.080\nEven if it has only one vote, you have\nto stop and ask the person to explain,\n\n720\n00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.490\nbecause they might be giving you\ninformation that no one considers.\n\n721\n00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.870\n&gt;&gt; Insight, yeah, but only if they have-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but\n\n722\n00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:50.180\nif no one chooses that one,\nyou can just cross that one off the list.\n\n723\n00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.812\nIt's still nice to say, is it okay\nif I take this off the list, right?\n\n724\n00:39:53.812 --> 00:39:55.263\nSo then the next time around,\n\n725\n00:39:55.263 --> 00:39:58.295\nthe theory is that you'd have\nsmaller things to choose from.\n\n726\n00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:00.526\nAnd so now, everyone has two votes, right?\n\n727\n00:40:00.526 --> 00:40:03.140\nAnd it just keeps going until\nyou get down to the one vote.\n\n728\n00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.010\nAnd there's no really specific formula.\n\n729\n00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.870\nIt's just a way for, especially if you\nhave a mixed group of supervisors and\n\n730\n00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.960\nemployees together.\n\n731\n00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.510\nAnd people are kind of voting on the side\nof maybe their superior or their coworker.\n\n732\n00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.020\nIt's a way everybody gets a voice.\n\n733\n00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:22.510\nSo multivoting,\nit's a very simple way to get consensus.\n\n734\n00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.010\nUsually before you start\na multivoting exercise,\n\n735\n00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.885\nyou wanna remind people that\nwe're a democratic society, and\n\n736\n00:40:30.885 --> 00:40:34.940\nwill everyone agree that whoever\ngets the most votes, wins.\n\n737\n00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.625\nAnd you get that buy-in first,\nand it's kind of fun.\n\n738\n00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:40.100\nMultivoting's a kind of fun way to do it.\n\n739\n00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.030\nNow, nominal group technique is kind\nof the same thing as multivoting.\n\n740\n00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:45.930\nIt's just secret.\n\n741\n00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.390\nAnd, in the old days,\nwe used to sit around in a room and\n\n742\n00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.720\neverybody would write\ntheir choice on a sticky.\n\n743\n00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.605\nAnd then we'd gather it up and\nwe'd put the sticky's on the board, right?\n\n744\n00:40:54.605 --> 00:40:58.270\nBut now, a lot of times, it's just an\nemail that goes out to everyone that just\n\n745\n00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:01.480\nsays, look, this is gonna be an aggregate.\n\n746\n00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.490\nWe're not gonna say who voted for what.\n\n747\n00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.748\nBut it's the same kind of thing,\nlike if you had two or three choices,\n\n748\n00:41:06.748 --> 00:41:07.919\nwhat would you vote for?\n\n749\n00:41:10.102 --> 00:41:11.970\nAnd these are just kind of the rules.\n\n750\n00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:13.990\nThis is another thing that's\nin your student packet.\n\n751\n00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:17.593\nYou have a flyer that says,\npopular facilitation tools,\n\n752\n00:41:17.593 --> 00:41:20.324\nand it gives you the step-by-step rules.\n\n753\n00:41:20.324 --> 00:41:23.200\nSo you'll notice that some\nof this seems kind of long.\n\n754\n00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.519\nWell, no one expects you to memorize this,\nbut what you would want to know for\n\n755\n00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:32.037\nthe exam is what's the difference between\nbrainstorming, nominal group, and\n\n756\n00:41:32.037 --> 00:41:32.914\nmultivoting.\n\n757\n00:41:32.914 --> 00:41:34.440\nThat's what you would wanna know.\n\n758\n00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.510\nBut then if you actually wanted to do it,\nagain,\n\n759\n00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.610\nyou're sort of getting bonus\nmaterial in your student pack.\n\n760\n00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:41.911\nBecause if you're in a situation and\nyou wanna try it,\n\n761\n00:41:41.911 --> 00:41:44.122\nyou're gonna have\nstep-by-step instructions.\n\n762\n00:41:46.387 --> 00:41:49.074\nAnd I think that leads me to the end.\n\n763\n00:41:49.074 --> 00:41:51.460\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nthat was a lot of information we saw.\n\n764\n00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.740\nWe were able to look at\ndifferent methodologies and\n\n765\n00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.710\ndetermine if we should choose\na waterfall or a circular.\n\n766\n00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:01.360\nWe looked at structured brainstorming,\nsuch as our affinity diagram.\n\n767\n00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.960\nWe were able to look at\nour six core principles.\n\n768\n00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:04.860\nWhat else?\n\n769\n00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.970\nOur popular concepts,\nsuch as visual management.\n\n770\n00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.250\nAnd then lastly,\nwe looked at popular facilitation tools,\n\n771\n00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.000\nour favorite word her so far.\n\n772\n00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.620\nSo, definitely go back and re-watch this.\n\n773\n00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.980\nI know we covered a lot, but\nwe have some really great information, and\n\n774\n00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.020\nwe have more headed your way.\n\n775\n00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.090\nSo don't go anywhere, get comfortable.\n\n776\n00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.950\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular episode, and\n\n777\n00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.250\nI'll sign off as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n778\n00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:32.092\n&gt;&gt; And I am Dr. Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n779\n00:42:32.092 --> 00:42:36.204\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n780\n00:42:36.204 --> 00:42:41.944\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:05.846\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:08.203\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:12.268\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:17.790\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification Preparation show.\n\n7\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.980\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.960\nIn this episode we'll be taking a look\nat models and methodologies, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.940\nwe are not talking about Bella and\nGigi Hadid.\n\n10\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.610\nWe are actually going to be looking at\ndifferent approaches that we can take to\n\n11\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.740\nsolve a problem.\n\n12\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.350\nWith us to help us today is Dr.\nTerra Stern.\n\n13\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.270\nThank you for\njoining us in the studio today.\n\n14\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.440\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\nThank you for having me.\n\n15\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.480\n&gt;&gt; So Dr. Stern, when we look at these\nare there any types of models that really\n\n16\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.740\nstand out as more popular than others,\nor where should we just kind of begin?\n\n17\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.300\n&gt;&gt; Well I'd like to go over to my\nslide deck if that's okay, and\n\n18\n00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.000\ntalk about those models and methodologies.\n\n19\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.880\nAnd pretty much what I wanna do to make\n\n20\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.250\na little more sense is just talk about\nhow we normally solve problems, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.810\nthen I'll map it over to the models\nthat are used in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n22\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.370\nWhich are the DMAIC, PDCA,\nthe design for six sigma is touched on,\n\n23\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.660\nand Kaizen which is rapid\nimprovement events.\n\n24\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.620\nNow we're going to be going in depth\nin the DMAIC model and looking at each\n\n25\n00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.758\none of those phases, because that's\nwhat probably 40% of the exam is.\n\n26\n00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:31.430\nOver things that are related\nto the DMAIC not the dollars\n\n27\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.051\n&gt;&gt; That's a huge percentage there, so\n\n28\n00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:37.540\nall right, pay attention [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay so, models and\n\n29\n00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.850\nmethodology sometimes are called\nthings like problem solving models.\n\n30\n00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.169\nSometimes they're called\ncritical thinking models.\n\n31\n00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.180\nSometimes they're called business models,\nso it just don't let that get you\n\n32\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.516\nconfused, especially if you're\nreading a test question.\n\n33\n00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:55.990\nSo lots of other names for models and\nmethodologies will have qualifiers.\n\n34\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.450\nCritical thinking, business,\nthat type of stuff, so keep that in mind.\n\n35\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.920\nAnd moving forward, like I said,\n\n36\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.628\nI wanna talk to you a little bit about\nthe steps in typical problem solving.\n\n37\n00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:12.605\nI also wanna point out that it depends on,\nif you are in a physics environment as\n\n38\n00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:17.050\nsupposed to the mathematical environment,\nas supposed to psychology environment.\n\n39\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.990\nThis typical problem solving model may\nbe called something else like normal\n\n40\n00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.810\nproblem solving, structured\nproblem solving is a popular term.\n\n41\n00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.960\nThey are the same steps.\n\n42\n00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.300\nIt's the way we normally as\nhumans solve business problems.\n\n43\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.880\nBut I think is we understand that first,\n\n44\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.750\nyou can understand how\nthose other models deviate.\n\n45\n00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.330\nAnd again the models that\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n46\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.900\nsometimes are called critical thinking.\n\n47\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.910\nSometimes they're just called business\nmodels, those types of things.\n\n48\n00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.930\nSo the steps in typical problem solving\nis that first we identify the problem and\n\n49\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.670\nwe come up with a problem statement.\n\n50\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.752\nWe say this is what's wrong, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:55.752 --> 00:03:02.071\nAnd then the second thing we do, is we go\nimmediately to brainstorming the solution.\n\n52\n00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:05.569\nAnd then after we brainstorm the solution\nwe pick one, and we say hey,\n\n53\n00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.829\nthat's the one that we wanna go with and\neven when we're trying to\n\n54\n00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.550\nsolve problems in our own brain and\nwe don't have a group of people.\n\n55\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.490\nOkay well, here's all the things I\ncould do, I'm gonna pick this one.\n\n56\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.610\nThen the next step in typical problem\nsolving is that we go ahead and do it,\n\n57\n00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.080\nwe execute, we implement, right?\n\n58\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.980\nAnd then the final step,\nwhich we miss a lot,\n\n59\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.180\nI mean a lot of times we don't even\nfollow through with this last step,\n\n60\n00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.940\neven though it's technically part of\nthe model, is evaluate and correct.\n\n61\n00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.461\nIn fact sometimes we even evaluate,\nwe send out surveys.\n\n62\n00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.558\nBut then we never go back and, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I analyze, and\n\n63\n00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:43.630\nI may even tend to over-analyze at times,\nbut you're right.\n\n64\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.953\nIf correct is considered part of that\nstep, I might not always go back and\n\n65\n00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:47.996\ncorrect my mistakes.\n\n66\n00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:49.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n67\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.540\nAnd so, this is the way, and\nthis has been used for years, right?\n\n68\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.160\nIn all different kinds of environments.\n\n69\n00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.890\nSo if we were gonna compare that.\n\n70\n00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.170\nSo the difference in the DMAIC model, and\n\n71\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.020\nfirst I wanna point out, in Lean Six\nSigma, we're looking at the DMAIC model as\n\n72\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.720\na circular model whereas in Six Sigma,\nthey're looking at it as Waterfall, right?\n\n73\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.680\nAnd just as a reminder,\n\n74\n00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.490\ncircular means if I do have to go\nback I'm managing the whole process.\n\n75\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.950\nAnd if I have to step back a step\nIt's not a really big deal.\n\n76\n00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.700\nIn Waterfall methods you always\nfinish one step before the next.\n\n77\n00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.500\nBut the dynamics in Six Sigma and\nLean Six Sigma are exactly the same.\n\n78\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.500\nSo in define, which is the first\nstep in normal problem solving or\n\n79\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.940\ntypical problem solving.\n\n80\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.860\nWe just say the problem and we're done.\n\n81\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.940\nIn the DMAIC model, in define we spend a\nsignificant amount of time trying to make\n\n82\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.980\nsure is that really the problem\nthat we wanna work on?\n\n83\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.800\nWe don't just say it and\nwe're not reactive.\n\n84\n00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.802\nWe don't make a statement and\nthen all of a sudden try to go out and\n\n85\n00:04:49.802 --> 00:04:52.145\nfigure out how can we solve this problem,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:55.758\nSo the first step is that we spend a lot\nof time making sure everyone understand\n\n87\n00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:56.437\nthe problem.\n\n88\n00:04:56.437 --> 00:05:01.025\nThey don't necessarily have to agree,\nbut we wanna make sure that everyone has\n\n89\n00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:06.260\na high level idea of what it is we're\nworking on including ourselves, right?\n\n90\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.894\nThen the next step and this is not\nsomething we do in typical problem\n\n91\n00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:15.218\nsolving is we get a clear as idea\nof what's going on right now.\n\n92\n00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:19.177\nNow in typical problem solving we go\nstraight to brainstorming, we say, okay,\n\n93\n00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:21.625\nhere's the problem and\nthese are all the things,\n\n94\n00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.504\nthese are all of our options to fix it.\n\n95\n00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:27.807\nIn the DMAIC model once we\ndetermine what the real problem is,\n\n96\n00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:31.100\nthen we say, okay what's going on now?\n\n97\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.670\nBecause the assumption is,\n\n98\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.820\nif I know what's going on now I can\ngo to the next step and analyze.\n\n99\n00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.120\nSo in analyze what I'm doing is I'm trying\nto figure out well why is it going on\n\n100\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.160\nthat way?\n\n101\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.830\nWhat can I do to make that difference,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.150\nSo after I define,\nI measure, and I analyze.\n\n103\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.640\nI then come up with my\nbrainstorm list of solutions.\n\n104\n00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.850\nSo whereas in typical problem solving,\nthat's right off the bat.\n\n105\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.120\nThis is the problem,\nthis is what I'm gonna do.\n\n106\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.420\nI define, I measure and I analyze.\n\n107\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.200\nAnd what that buys me is, I don't have\nanyone in the back of the room saying,\n\n108\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.980\nwe tried that last year and\nit didn't work.\n\n109\n00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.430\nBecause I defined, I measured and\nI analyzed, I'm gonna know that.\n\n110\n00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.550\nAnd if I wanna try it again I'm gonna\nhave some kind of verbiage, right?\n\n111\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.660\nI'm not gonna have someone say,\nwe don't have the money,\n\n112\n00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.910\nwe don't have the resources,\nwe don't have the intellectual capital,\n\n113\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.510\nbecause I know that because I defined,\nmeasured and analyzed.\n\n114\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.500\nSo the solutions I come up\nwith on my brainstorm list\n\n115\n00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.170\nare gonna all be pretty good.\n\n116\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.230\nThere's not gonna be any one offs there,\nbecause they're totally researched, right?\n\n117\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.870\nSo then when I move into improve\nthe other thing that happens that doesn't\n\n118\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.390\ntypically happen in normal problem\nsolving is that I try it out.\n\n119\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.420\nI get consensus.\n\n120\n00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.440\nI try out my idea.\n\n121\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.760\nI pilot it before I even\nmake the project plan.\n\n122\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.820\nAnd once I roll out the project plan,\nonce I can show an improvement.\n\n123\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.250\nAnd the improvement, I look at the improve\nand I say, when I look at measure and\n\n124\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.850\nthat's my current picture, in improve,\nthen did I really improve something?\n\n125\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.240\nAnd then I can go to that last phase,\nand this is never,\n\n126\n00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.630\nwell this is rarely appreciated\nin typical problem solving.\n\n127\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.750\nWhich is control, sustainability.\n\n128\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.480\nHow am I going to make this\nthing stay in place, right?\n\n129\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.670\nSo the DMAIC problem solving model\n\n130\n00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.870\nis just sort of capitalizes on\ntypical problem solving, but\n\n131\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.660\nit says hey, let's make sure we've really\ngot the problem that we're working on.\n\n132\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.520\nLet's make sure we know what's going\non now, so we don't have any surprises.\n\n133\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.750\nLet's analyze, let's take a step back and\nsay, well, why is that happening?\n\n134\n00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.140\nBecause if I know why it's happening,\n\n135\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.500\nI may be able to come up with three\nto five solutions and then improve.\n\n136\n00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.360\nI'm piloting my idea, I'm testing\nit out before I roll it out and\n\n137\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.440\nmake a big mistake.\n\n138\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.260\nI'm doing my project plan and WBS,\nand work breakdown structure.\n\n139\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.166\nAnd then I'm doing the control piece.\n\n140\n00:07:55.166 --> 00:08:00.830\nThe reason why this is huge is,\nbecause the DMAIC model can be used.\n\n141\n00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.865\nAnd as a thinking model as well.\n\n142\n00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:07.228\nSo in Lean Six Sigma to get certified, at\nleast through my organization because you\n\n143\n00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:11.338\nare required to do a report, it's an\nactual report where you write up, this is\n\n144\n00:08:11.338 --> 00:08:15.940\nwhat I did in define, this is what I did\nin measure, this is what I did in analyze.\n\n145\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.590\nBut as you get more and\nmore used to using this model,\n\n146\n00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.620\nyou can just go through those\nphases as a thinking model, right?\n\n147\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.660\nSo, smaller problems you\ncan run through the model.\n\n148\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:31.500\nSo, remember we've looked at the PDCA,\nthis is another popular model.\n\n149\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.540\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\nDMAIC is always the best model.\n\n150\n00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.660\nIf we could use the DMAIC,\nthen that's what we wanna do.\n\n151\n00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.811\nBut there's a lot of times where\nwe might use a PDCA instead.\n\n152\n00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:48.200\nNow, in the Lean Six Sigma class in\norder to get certified, typically and\n\n153\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.890\ncertainly in my organization you\nhave to do the report in DMAIC\n\n154\n00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.660\nbecause that's the industry standard.\n\n155\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:09:00.070\nBut in real life as a Lean Six Sigma\nperson you might use PDCA all the time.\n\n156\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.400\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why you\nmight wanna use PDCA instead of DMAIC.\n\n157\n00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.890\nOne is your boss's that has to be done\non Monday, and there's just too many,\n\n158\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.107\nit's just flat,\nyou don't have time, right.\n\n159\n00:09:10.107 --> 00:09:14.023\nSo, at least using PDCA\nyou've got that methodology,\n\n160\n00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:17.740\nyou've got a formal path for\nyou to follow.\n\n161\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.300\nThe other thing that's\nkinda cool about DMAIC and\n\n162\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.770\nPDCA is that that make a nice\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n163\n00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.680\nI can go one is P, two is execute or\n\n164\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.200\ndo, three is check, four is act,\nabandon, or adopt, right?\n\n165\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.390\nAnd then I can categorize\nthings underneath that.\n\n166\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.670\nAnother reason you might use\nof the PDCA in real life\n\n167\n00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.190\nis that the problem is really simple,\nright?\n\n168\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.520\nAnd you don't need something\ncomplicated like the DMAIC.\n\n169\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.840\nBecause you wanna be lean, you wanna\nfix the problem as soon as you can.\n\n170\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.780\nAnd if it's a fairly\neasy problem to solve,\n\n171\n00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.250\nwhy use a really sophisticated model?\n\n172\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n173\n00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.390\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes within the DMAIC model,\nlet's say you're doing a very complicated\n\n174\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.980\nprocess improvement, you might do\na PDCA within one of those phases.\n\n175\n00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.160\nSo lots of reasons you might use that.\n\n176\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.090\nRemember we looked at the model before\nwhen we were talking about lean studying,\n\n177\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:15.000\nand we'll discuss this model\na little bit later as how\n\n178\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.250\nit actually maps to the DMAIC,\nkind of closer to the end of the session.\n\n179\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.450\nBut, just as a reminder,\nif I was doing plan,\n\n180\n00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.550\nI might come up with my timeline,\nwe covered this in another session, but\n\n181\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.950\nmy timeline, I might break it into four,\nexecute, that's where I'm gonna do it.\n\n182\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.200\nChecking did it work?\n\n183\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.600\nDid it not work?\n\n184\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.640\nDo I need a new plan?\n\n185\n00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.960\nAnd then I get to decide if I\nmove forward or not, right?\n\n186\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.691\nBut I think, and\nthis is just a plan-do-check act or\n\n187\n00:10:43.691 --> 00:10:46.070\nstudy model in the circular form.\n\n188\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.540\nAnd again, this is if I'm looking\nat in a more linear fashion.\n\n189\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.494\n&gt;&gt; Like a flow chart almost.\n\n190\n00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:53.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly.\n\n191\n00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.199\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n192\n00:10:55.199 --> 00:11:00.697\nthe primary model is the DMAIC model,\nthen I can use a PDCA in real life,\n\n193\n00:11:00.697 --> 00:11:04.547\nthey're sometimes I would\nprefer to use a PDCA and\n\n194\n00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:10.450\nsome companies that have full\nLean Six Sigma or Six Sigma departments.\n\n195\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.970\nAnd you go to that department for\nthem to solve your problem.\n\n196\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.410\nAs a criteria,\nthey may have you go through\n\n197\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.810\na hypothetical PDCA to prove that you\ncouldn't solve the problem on your own.\n\n198\n00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.320\nSo, sometimes it's a prequalifier.\n\n199\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.130\nAnd even for yourself it's not a bad idea\nif you just think through the problem PDCA\n\n200\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.585\nand you go, well I just, I can't.\n\n201\n00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:35.270\n[CROSSTALK] So then that kinda can be\n\n202\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.290\nyour trigger that maybe I need\nto move on to the DMAIC model.\n\n203\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.787\nNow, another approach is a DMADV.\n\n204\n00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:49.621\nAnd the last two, let's see if that\ntells us here, the last two stand for\n\n205\n00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.490\ndesign and verify.\n\n206\n00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:57.910\nThis is an example of a design for Six\nSigma model, and this get a tag confusing.\n\n207\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.060\nThe DMADV, now,\n\n208\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.150\nwe said DMAIC but technically\netiquette why is the Lean Six Sigma\n\n209\n00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.330\nif it is anything other than DMAIC\nyou have to say all the letters.\n\n210\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.990\nIt's kind of silly etiquette thing.\n\n211\n00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.940\nBut the DMADV model is so popular,\nthat a lot of people don't\n\n212\n00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.320\nrealize that it's not the only design for\nSix Sigma model.\n\n213\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.740\nIt's just the one most people use.\n\n214\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.296\nNow, what's kind of cool about that for\nus in this class is, that if you got into\n\n215\n00:12:24.296 --> 00:12:28.784\nan environment where you had to build\na process from scratch because design for\n\n216\n00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:30.565\nSix Sigma is sort of opposite.\n\n217\n00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:33.104\nDMAIC assumes there's already\na process in place and\n\n218\n00:12:33.104 --> 00:12:37.200\nyou're just trying to make it better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n219\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.440\nThe DMADV which is\nan example of the design for\n\n220\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.220\nSix Sigma model says your\nbuilding a process from scratch.\n\n221\n00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.160\nSo, there's a couple of phases\nthat have to be different.\n\n222\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.180\nYou have to design it,\nif you're building something from scratch,\n\n223\n00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.890\nyou have to make it, right?\n\n224\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.530\nAnd then you wanna go back and\nyou wanna make sure that it's okay.\n\n225\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.160\nNow you'll notice in the DMADV model\n\n226\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.370\nthat there's no sustainability\nphase because this is mostly for\n\n227\n00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.470\ndesign engineers, and they're gonna\ngo design something else, right?\n\n228\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.175\nThey're gonna go to the next project.\n\n229\n00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:10.540\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly.\n\n230\n00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.752\nBut the design for\nSix Sigma is an umbrella term\n\n231\n00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:18.540\nthat covers a lot of other design models.\n\n232\n00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.096\nAnd the reason why there are so\nmany models in design is because theory of\n\n233\n00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:25.414\ndesign is different,\nin some environments I'm gonna design it,\n\n234\n00:13:25.414 --> 00:13:28.800\nI'm gonna optimize it, and\nthen I'm gonna roll it out.\n\n235\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.250\nIn other areas, I might design it,\n\n236\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.550\nroll it out, and get complaints,\nand then optimize it, right?\n\n237\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.210\nThere's just different design theories.\n\n238\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.390\nHowever, since most people use DMADV,\nthe nice thing for\n\n239\n00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.670\nLean Six Sigma people is if you recognize\na project really as a design for\n\n240\n00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.070\nSix Sigma project and not your\ntypical DMAIC, and you use the DMADV,\n\n241\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.860\nthe first three phases of the model\nare exactly the same as the DMAIC.\n\n242\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.680\nSo you're trained to do that.\n\n243\n00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.620\nAnd then yeah you might have\nto outsource the design and\n\n244\n00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.180\nthe verification of that model, but you'd\nstill be kind of in charge of the project.\n\n245\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.780\nAnd sometimes when they\nbring people in design for\n\n246\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.755\nSix Sigma products, they still aren't the\nones that actually designed the product,\n\n247\n00:14:14.755 --> 00:14:17.435\nthey still outsource even\nnow even design engineers.\n\n248\n00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:21.065\n&gt;&gt; So that might be the role of the\nproject manager to oversee the project and\n\n249\n00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:24.160\nthen you bring those subject\nmatter expert send to go ahead and\n\n250\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.428\nhandle specific tasks.\n\n251\n00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:27.875\n&gt;&gt; Exactly but\nyou're still kind of in charge of.\n\n252\n00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:32.061\nSo I think the thing is that so cool\nabout it is if you get into situation and\n\n253\n00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:35.355\nyou figure out there is no process there,\ndon't panic,\n\n254\n00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:39.016\nbecause there is a model very\nsimilar to the one you're using.\n\n255\n00:14:39.016 --> 00:14:41.886\nThat yeah, the velocity phases\nof the model you're probably\n\n256\n00:14:41.886 --> 00:14:45.437\ngonna have to get some help but\nit's not like you can't do it, right.\n\n257\n00:14:45.437 --> 00:14:45.937\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n258\n00:14:47.848 --> 00:14:52.430\n&gt;&gt; So, if you were looking at\nthe difference between DMAIC and\n\n259\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:58.659\nDMADV stressing, again, that even though\nDMADV is just an example of design for\n\n260\n00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:02.870\nSix Sigma and\nthere's hundreds of other examples.\n\n261\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.500\nThis is what most people use.\n\n262\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.605\nThey don't even realize\nthere are other models.\n\n263\n00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:07.286\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So if you\n\n264\n00:15:07.286 --> 00:15:10.990\nwere doing a comparison\nbetween these two things.\n\n265\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.220\nIn the DMAIC, we're defining a business\nprocess, we're measuring the current\n\n266\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.380\nprocess, we're trying to figure out what's\nthe root cause and we're trying to figure\n\n267\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.030\nout what kind of improvements can be\ndone to reduce the defects, right.\n\n268\n00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:29.330\nBut on the DMADV side, we're doing\nthe design measure and analyze but\n\n269\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.970\nthen we're getting to the bottom and\nwe're saying hey, we have to design this.\n\n270\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.210\nAnd then after we design it, we have to\nfigure out how are we gonna test this,\n\n271\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.080\nhow are we gonna verify it.\n\n272\n00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.520\nNow, a lot of companies do have their\nown design for Six Sigma models.\n\n273\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.282\nSo they're proprietary,\nthey belong to that company, and\n\n274\n00:15:48.282 --> 00:15:52.118\nthe fact that they don't have\nsustainability in that model,\n\n275\n00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:56.415\nthey don't really care about how to\nkeep the process end to control.\n\n276\n00:15:56.415 --> 00:16:00.405\nSometimes Lean Six Sigma people come\nin at the back end of a design for\n\n277\n00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:02.250\nSix Sigma project.\n\n278\n00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.471\nTo maintain that quality control or, okay.\n\n279\n00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:06.039\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and to write that all up.\n\n280\n00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:11.629\nThis just says what I said\nabout design for Six Sigma,\n\n281\n00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:13.400\nthere's lots of other models out there.\n\n282\n00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.290\nAgain, this is just another comparison.\n\n283\n00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.190\nYou'll see one of the things that you\nget in your student pack is a comparison\n\n284\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.830\nbetween DMAIC and\nthe DMADV model because the tests and\n\n285\n00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:31.360\nthe exams are always comparing DMAIC like\nthe Six Sigma exam, not the Lean exam.\n\n286\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.880\nBut if you're just doing\nthe Six Sigma exam,\n\n287\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.720\nthere's a lot of comparisons\nbetween DMAIC and the DMADV.\n\n288\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.040\nAll I want you to know in\nLean Six Sigma is that there is\n\n289\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.990\nanother path called Design for Six Sigma.\n\n290\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.970\nBut since there's a lot of questions\nthat's why this is included.\n\n291\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.790\nThere are a lot of questions that\ncompare the two models and they kinda\n\n292\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.320\nleave out that well, this is just one\nof the Design for Six Sigma models.\n\n293\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.440\nAnd here again,\njust another way to look at it.\n\n294\n00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.630\nSometimes, if you're having trouble\nstudying or grasping a concept,\n\n295\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.969\nlook at different kinds of graphs.\n\n296\n00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:08.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure just looking at that the\nfirst thing that pops into my head is to\n\n297\n00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:11.498\ndevelop some kind of mnemonic for\nthat DMADV.\n\n298\n00:17:11.498 --> 00:17:12.587\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n299\n00:17:12.587 --> 00:17:13.154\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n300\n00:17:13.154 --> 00:17:14.977\n&gt;&gt; In IT we have a lot of acronyms, so\n\n301\n00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:18.180\npeople come up with some pretty\ncolorful ones sometimes.\n\n302\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.700\nSo, whatever works for\nyou stick with it and run with it.\n\n303\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I know it's a good study too\nif you don't understand something go and\n\n304\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.150\nlook at different ways that it's written.\n\n305\n00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.024\nIn my PhD program,\nthe very first comp class that I took,\n\n306\n00:17:33.024 --> 00:17:35.458\nI read a paragraph like 50 times.\n\n307\n00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:38.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just kept reading the same paragraph\n\n308\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:39.630\nover and over again and\n\n309\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.950\nI'm like, I'm never gonna be able\nto finish the speech D program.\n\n310\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.686\nThe line of the next paragraph said, most\npeople don't understand this concept and\n\n311\n00:17:46.686 --> 00:17:47.590\nthen explained it.\n\n312\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.086\n&gt;&gt; In a different way, interesting.\n\n313\n00:17:50.086 --> 00:17:53.240\n&gt;&gt; So just kinda keep in mind\nif any of these concepts seem\n\n314\n00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.000\nkind of strange the student pack will help\nyou because we've got a lot more graphics\n\n315\n00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.720\nthan in that.\n\n316\n00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Visual aides.\n\n317\n00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.350\n&gt;&gt; And also just looking things up,\nthe DMAIC model and\n\n318\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.620\nthe DMADV model are so popular.\n\n319\n00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.234\nThere's all kinds of free stuff on\nthe Internet repackage this stuff.\n\n320\n00:18:09.234 --> 00:18:15.320\nAnd this is just another way I'm going to\ndefine and measure and analyze and design.\n\n321\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.130\nJust another way to look at\nthe DMADV model, and it's,\n\n322\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.880\nagain, part of your student pack.\n\n323\n00:18:23.957 --> 00:18:28.369\nSo the next thing we're gonna\ntalk about is Kaizen models, and\n\n324\n00:18:28.369 --> 00:18:32.960\nthat's used to quickly improve\nan existing process or service.\n\n325\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.950\nAnd first I have to still figure\nout what it is I wanna improve.\n\n326\n00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.690\nWhat is it that I'm trying to make better,\nfaster, more cost-effective?\n\n327\n00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.210\nRight, that's the first\nthing I have to do.\n\n328\n00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:51.010\nAnd I still have to work within the\nconstruct of whatever process improvement\n\n329\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.360\nprogram that company has.\n\n330\n00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.446\nSo if that company has ISO or\nCMM if they're just a Lean company,\n\n331\n00:18:56.446 --> 00:18:59.770\nif they're just a Six Sigma company.\n\n332\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.730\nA lot of times Lean Six Sigma,\nbecause it's one of the only\n\n333\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.200\nmethodologies that's a grassroots, so\nI can just Lean Six Sigma myself and\n\n334\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.820\nI don't have to,\nit doesn't have to be top down.\n\n335\n00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.490\nAll these other programs, the CEO,\nlike if I just woke up one day and\n\n336\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.580\nI said I wanted to be an ISO\ncompany I couldn't do that.\n\n337\n00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.850\nThe CEO would have to make that decision,\nor whoever was in charge of my department.\n\n338\n00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.340\nSame thing with just Lean by\nitself vs Sigma by itself.\n\n339\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.300\nThe only process improvement program\nwhere I can Lean Six Sigma myself\n\n340\n00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.520\neven if no one else in my company\nLean Six Sigmas I can do it and\n\n341\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.000\nit's just a different way of\napproaching my work, right.\n\n342\n00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.610\nBut I do wanna remember if I'm\ndoing a rapid improvement event,\n\n343\n00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.430\nif there's some sort of\numbrella methodology out there,\n\n344\n00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.340\nI wanna pay attention to that, so I don't\nviolate anything within those constructs.\n\n345\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.610\nAnd this is just a reminder,\nwe covered this in another session.\n\n346\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:59.870\nBut ISO, best practices,\nCMM looks at improving by levels.\n\n347\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.910\nLean reduces waste,\nSix Sigma reduces mistakes.\n\n348\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.440\nLean Six Sigma says, hey,\nwhy not all of the above?\n\n349\n00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.890\nSo, another thing that we wanna\nthink about before we move into\n\n350\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.780\nlooking at rapid improving events and\nimproving the process really quickly\n\n351\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.220\nis just kind of the difference between\nTraditional thinking and Lean thinking.\n\n352\n00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.060\nAnd so, on the Traditional side,\nit's management by cost.\n\n353\n00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.340\nBut on the Lean side it's leading by\ndelivering value and less errors.\n\n354\n00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.436\nAnd I know that you guys\ncan read the schematic, but\n\n355\n00:20:31.436 --> 00:20:35.329\nthe one that's my favorite is\nblames people vs blames process.\n\n356\n00:20:35.329 --> 00:20:36.188\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n[LAUGH]\n\n357\n00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:37.888\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and company focused,\n\n358\n00:20:37.888 --> 00:20:41.360\nclient focused,\nhierchial in traditional environments.\n\n359\n00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.500\nAnd you may be working in\ntraditional environment.\n\n360\n00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.287\nHierchial just means that,\nmaybe there's only\n\n361\n00:20:48.287 --> 00:20:53.550\n500 people in the company and\n75 of them are VPs.\n\n362\n00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.460\nAnd then there's a senior VP.\n\n363\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.100\nI worked at a company once\nwhere we had a VP of HR and\n\n364\n00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.008\nthen they hired a global\nVP of HR over her.\n\n365\n00:21:03.008 --> 00:21:09.201\n[CROSSTALK] They just couldn't\ncome up with another term, right?\n\n366\n00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.500\nSo back to Kaizen.\n\n367\n00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.120\nSo those are things to\nkind of keep in mind.\n\n368\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:16.180\nI'm doing a rapid improvement event,\nI need to think about the culture.\n\n369\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.000\nAm I working with a traditional company?\n\n370\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.460\nAm I working with a company\nthat leans more towards Lean?\n\n371\n00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.830\nAre they using a particular\nprocess improvement program?\n\n372\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.690\nI need to think about all of those\nthings before I start doing my rapid\n\n373\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.360\nimprovement event.\n\n374\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.430\nThat should all be part of my puzzle.\n\n375\n00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:36.647\nSo the word Kaizen just means change for\nthe good, and I love the little symbols.\n\n376\n00:21:36.647 --> 00:21:38.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really breaks it down and\n\n377\n00:21:38.176 --> 00:21:40.400\nhelps you understand where\nthat term comes from.\n\n378\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it.\n\n379\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.110\nOkay, and so the biggest thing that\nI think is the challenge with Kaizen\n\n380\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.180\nis which approach am I gonna take?\n\n381\n00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:53.450\nI could do a Kaizen event with a PDCA or\na DMAIC, and then there's a special one\n\n382\n00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.690\nthat's a more traditional model for Kaizen\nthat we're kind of moving away from.\n\n383\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.040\nBut it still shows up on some\nof the more traditional tests.\n\n384\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.900\nIn our Lean Six Sigma exam,\npretty much, we say a Kaizen\n\n385\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.130\napproach is a PDCA or DMAIC, but\nI want you to be a little aware of score,\n\n386\n00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.090\nbecause on the older, more traditional\ntests, it comes up from time to time.\n\n387\n00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.323\nNow again the idea of Kaizen is\ninstead of taking three or six months,\n\n388\n00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:22.730\nbecause a typical Lean Six Sigma project\nwe're looking at three to six months,\n\n389\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.700\nI'm gonna try to solve\nthis problem in a week.\n\n390\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.134\nSo on the manufacturing floor\nsometimes I can do it because I'm just\n\n391\n00:22:29.134 --> 00:22:33.062\nliterally moving something, or\ntaking something away or buying the piece-\n\n392\n00:22:33.062 --> 00:22:34.110\n&gt;&gt; Swapping a different component.\n\n393\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's that simple.\n\n394\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.630\nBut in the non-manfucaturing environments,\n\n395\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.490\nI'm spending that week trying to\nfigure out a good project plan.\n\n396\n00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.120\nSo if I take my group, all the players\nthat would be impacted, and\n\n397\n00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.950\nI run them as a facilitator, I run them\nthrough a PDCA, or a DMAIC, then I'm still\n\n398\n00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.450\ncollecting all the information,\nI'm just collecting it a lot faster.\n\n399\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.576\nWe now have things called\nMini Kaizen events.\n\n400\n00:22:57.576 --> 00:23:01.909\nA Kaizen event used to be five days\ntypically for non-manufacturing, and\n\n401\n00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:05.960\nnow we're doing Mini Kaizen events\nwhich are two and a half days.\n\n402\n00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.440\nBut it's still basically the idea is that\nI have a model that I'm working through.\n\n403\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.120\nSo that helps me work through\nthis event faster, right?\n\n404\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.890\nAnd so remember the PDCA,\nright, the Plan-Do-Check.\n\n405\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:20.418\nAnd then,\n\n406\n00:23:20.418 --> 00:23:24.415\nremember the DMAIC which we're gonna spend\na lot of time on in our next sessions.\n\n407\n00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:29.530\nAnd that the DMAIC model in\nLean is a circular model.\n\n408\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.260\nSo those are all things to remember.\n\n409\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.370\nSo here's the final one that I\nwanted to show you and like I said,\n\n410\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.830\nthis is just because it shows\nup a lot in traditional,\n\n411\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.820\nthe newer exams are not paying\nquite as much attention to it.\n\n412\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.998\nSo SCORE stands for Select,\nClarify, Organize, Run the event,\n\n413\n00:23:45.998 --> 00:23:48.040\nand Evaluate the results.\n\n414\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:52.560\nIt maps fairly closely to\nthe DMAIC model in my mind.\n\n415\n00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.540\nThe timing of SCORE is a little\ndifferent because we're told\n\n416\n00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.920\nrapid improvement events are supposed\nto happen in a week now.\n\n417\n00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.460\nSo on the old models,\nthis was still considered pretty fast.\n\n418\n00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.710\nI select one day to one week,\nI clarify one day to one week.\n\n419\n00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:13.020\nI organize, I run three to five days,\nI evaluate.\n\n420\n00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.700\nBut if you add all of\nthat stuff up it's not\n\n421\n00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.470\nwhat we're calling rapid\nimprovement events anymore.\n\n422\n00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.869\nIt's a kind of a little\nbit longer process.\n\n423\n00:24:20.869 --> 00:24:24.492\nBut if you have more time to do your,\nthis sounds kind of silly, but\n\n424\n00:24:24.492 --> 00:24:27.599\nif you have more time to do\nyour rapid improvement event,\n\n425\n00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:31.710\nthis is a pretty good calendar,\nit's still pretty fast.\n\n426\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.220\nBut a lot of times now people are\nexpecting to solve the problem in two and\n\n427\n00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.860\na half to five days.\n\n428\n00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.900\nNow, again if you're looking\nat score against DMAIC,\n\n429\n00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:48.374\nThe only part that I would say\ndoesn't map super well is that\n\n430\n00:24:48.374 --> 00:24:52.100\nlast one cuz it talks about evaluate.\n\n431\n00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.880\nBut, in the DMAIC model,\n\n432\n00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.550\nthere's really that sustainability\npiece that SCORE doesn't have.\n\n433\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.320\nSo that's pretty much the basic\nmodels in Lean Six Sigma and\n\n434\n00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.640\nagain, just kinda keep in mind the DMAIC\nis king and I might need to use a PDCA,\n\n435\n00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.340\ncuz it's a simple problem or, I-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well for\n\n436\n00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.690\nsure, you answered the question that\nI had at the beginning of the show.\n\n437\n00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.080\nIs there one we should\nreally focus more on?\n\n438\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.500\nDefinitely with DMAIC covering\nabout 40% of that exam,\n\n439\n00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.075\nI definitely wanna focus my efforts there,\nbut they're all important as well.\n\n440\n00:25:25.075 --> 00:25:28.355\nSo thank you for taking the time to cover\neach one individually of those different\n\n441\n00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:30.405\nmethodologies or models.\n\n442\n00:25:30.405 --> 00:25:35.307\nBut stay tuned, we do have some more green\nbelt information headed your way, so\n\n443\n00:25:35.307 --> 00:25:37.575\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n444\n00:25:37.575 --> 00:25:40.861\nAs you show host, I am Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I am Dr.\n\n445\n00:25:40.861 --> 00:25:44.247\nTara Vanzant Stern\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n446\n00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:51.600\n[MUSIC]\n\n447\n00:25:51.600

[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:12.058\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:17.530\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n7\n00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.210\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.180\nIn this episode, we will be taking\na look at our seven tools of quality.\n\n9\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.028\nAnd to help us explain this topic today,\nwe have Dr.\n\n10\n00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:28.980\nTara VanZandt-Stern in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.580\nThank you for joining us today, Doctor.\n\n12\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.280\n&gt;&gt; It's my pleasure, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.690\n&gt;&gt; So these tools are not\nreally industry specific, but\n\n14\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.010\nhow do they really relate\nto Lean Six Sigma?\n\n15\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.575\n&gt;&gt; I'd like to go to my\nslide deck to explain that.\n\n16\n00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.322\nAnd first,\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to bring\n\n17\n00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:50.960\nup a number of tools just so\nthat you can see the actual visual.\n\n18\n00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.380\nBecause many times seeing this visual,\n\n19\n00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.500\nyou'll realize, I've worked with that, I\njust maybe didn't know what it was called.\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.060\nThe second thing I'd like to point out is\nthat these are called in your ASQ exam and\n\n21\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.575\nin your Lean exams, these are referred\nto as the seven tools of quality.\n\n22\n00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:11.630\nIn the Lean Six Sigma exams,\nthese might be referred to\n\n23\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.710\nas a number of different things,\nbut it's always gonna say seven.\n\n24\n00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.660\nSo it's gonna say the seven tools\nof process improvement, and\n\n25\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.840\nthis is just different vendors.\n\n26\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.410\nWe have a tendency at SSD Global,\nif you take our tests,\n\n27\n00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.680\nwe kind of use the most accepted words,\nwhich is seven tools of quality.\n\n28\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.480\nBut on other Lean Six Sigma exams,\n\n29\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.880\nthey may refer to these are the seven\ntools of process improvement,\n\n30\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.395\nthe seven tools of critical thinking,\nthe seven tools of optimization.\n\n31\n00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:39.390\n&gt;&gt; But we have seven tools?\n\n32\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.165\n&gt;&gt; You have seven.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:41.792\n&gt;&gt; So if you see that number seven.\n\n34\n00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:45.987\nAnd then the only exception to that is\nthat sometimes they are called this,\n\n35\n00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:50.584\nthe seven tools of management, but there\nare actually a different set of the seven\n\n36\n00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:54.005\ntools of management, so\nthere's only that one exception.\n\n37\n00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:55.900\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So if someone says seven tools of\n\n38\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.015\nmanagement, it has more to do\nwith business process mapping.\n\n39\n00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:05.735\nAnd they have a different set of tools\nthat work okay in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n40\n00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:08.910\ncuz remember,\nwe take advantage of everything, right?\n\n41\n00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.248\nBut, generally speaking,\nif you see the seven tools,\n\n42\n00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:12.806\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n43\n00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:16.710\nAnd the one that you just\nsaw is the control chart.\n\n44\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.370\nOkay, so the seven tools are pretty\nmuch known by these names.\n\n45\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.470\nI do wanna point out a couple of\nthings that are sort of interesting.\n\n46\n00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.885\nIf you're taking just the Six Sigma exam,\nthere's a tendency to call\n\n47\n00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:37.410\nthe fishbone a cause-and-effect matrix or\ndiagram.\n\n48\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.297\nIf you're taking the Lean exam,\nwhat happens in Lean\n\n49\n00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:44.029\nis a lot of times they give the credit\nto the person who made the chart.\n\n50\n00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.440\nSo this would be called\nan Ishikawa Diagram.\n\n51\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.200\n&gt;&gt; Ishikawa.\n\n52\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Ishikawa, absolutely, and so\nif you're just studying for the Lean exam,\n\n53\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.570\nsomething that you want to keep in mind\nis that Lean has a real committment to\n\n54\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.360\nnaming the tool after whoever popularized\nthe tool, or whoever created the tool.\n\n55\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.680\nSo sometimes it makes studying a little\nbit difficult, but in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n56\n00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.745\nit's another one of those\nlike go Lean Six Sigma,\n\n57\n00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:14.608\ncuz Lean Six Sigma says hey,\nlet's just call it a fishbone, right.\n\n58\n00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:16.320\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, and so\n\n59\n00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.390\nthe other one is a flowchart.\n\n60\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.580\nAnd when you're looking at the seven tools\nof quality, this is another one that\n\n61\n00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.190\nyou wanna watch for,\nbecause in quality we call it a flowchart.\n\n62\n00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.744\nIn some environments it will be called\na process map or value stream map.\n\n63\n00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:35.869\nBut flowcharts can be used for\na number of different things so\n\n64\n00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.607\nwe say the tool is actually the flowchart\nand the flowcharting symbols,\n\n65\n00:03:39.607 --> 00:03:41.540\nthat's what we're saying.\n\n66\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.800\nBut in other exams sometimes they\nmight list it as the process map.\n\n67\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which is\n\n68\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.270\nusing flowchart symbols, right?\n\n69\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.370\nThe other ones are okay, everyone calls\na Pareto a Pareto, everyone calls\n\n70\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.130\na histogram, a scatter diagram, and\na control chart the same thing.\n\n71\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.530\nHowever, occasionally, when they're\ntalking about scatter diagrams,\n\n72\n00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.910\nthey'll, in parentheses,\nput correlation diagram.\n\n73\n00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.950\nI'm a little uncomfortable with that\nbecause technically, a scatter diagram can\n\n74\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.830\nbe used to show intersection points or\nregression analysis.\n\n75\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.730\nSo again-\n&gt;&gt; You're just kind of limiting yourself\n\n76\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.589\nwhen you use that term.\n\n77\n00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nYeah, exactly.\n\n78\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.930\nSo when you're saying\nthe scatter diagram is\n\n79\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.870\nequivalent to a correlation chart,\nit can be used for that, but\n\n80\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.800\nit can be used for lots of other things,\nand so we'll kind of look at that today.\n\n81\n00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n82\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.940\n&gt;&gt; So the first one I want to look at is\ncalled a fishbone, and like I said, it\n\n83\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.760\ncould be referred to as a cause-and-effect\ndiagram, or an Ishikawa diagram.\n\n84\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.600\nAnd it's actually a very simple,\nunderutilized tool.\n\n85\n00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.152\nNow in this session, these seven\ntools are really, really important,\n\n86\n00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:51.177\nand they pop up on the exam a lot.\n\n87\n00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:58.498\nAnd they will pop up in comparison with\ndifferent phases with the models, right.\n\n88\n00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.849\nSo we're going to briefly\ngo over each tool, but\n\n89\n00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.873\nin our Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt\ntraining,\n\n90\n00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:10.350\nthere is a section that's on tools that\nwill go a little bit more in depth.\n\n91\n00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.280\nThe reason why we're just kind of glancing\nover these tools and looking at some\n\n92\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.130\nexamples is a lot of people in IT\nhave already used these tools.\n\n93\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.900\nAgain they just might not know that\nthat's the name that it was called.\n\n94\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.030\nBut I would encourage you as we go\nthrough these tools, if there's one or\n\n95\n00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.510\ntwo that you go, well I'm not that\nfamiliar with that tool, to look at\n\n96\n00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.870\nthe study notes in your student packet\nthat you will have available to you.\n\n97\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.780\nAnd or go back and watch that Lean Six\nSigma Yellow Belt section on the tools.\n\n98\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.470\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n99\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so the fishbone\ndiagram, what I think's kind of\n\n100\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.600\ninteresting about fishbones is that\nthey're terribly underutilized.\n\n101\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.270\nAnd a lot of people,\nthey're simple tools, a lot of people\n\n102\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.150\nhave mistakenly thought that the fishbone\ndiagram's supposed to solve the problem.\n\n103\n00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.070\nThe fishbone diagram is used to\nidentify the root cause of the problem.\n\n104\n00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.520\nAnd why do you think it's so\nimportant to identify the root cause?\n\n105\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.370\n&gt;&gt; If I had to assume,\nI would think to really\n\n106\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.490\nfocus my efforts on the root cause so I'm\nnot just out in left field, working and\n\n107\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.540\nspending my time on something that\nisn't directly related to that problem.\n\n108\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's perfect.\n\n109\n00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.705\nAnd if we took a simple example like,\nlet's say someone came to you and\n\n110\n00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:25.994\nthey said, my closet's a mess, right,\nmy closet's just really messed up.\n\n111\n00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:27.404\n&gt;&gt; How did you know?\n\n112\n00:06:27.404 --> 00:06:27.952\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n113\n00:06:27.952 --> 00:06:31.450\nI put that in the head of the fish and\nI said, my closet's a mess, right.\n\n114\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.647\nI might be trying,\nlet's say I look at that,\n\n115\n00:06:34.647 --> 00:06:40.130\nmy advice to you might be something such\nas, I have a great closet organizer.\n\n116\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.500\nHave you been to the container store?\n\n117\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.960\nI have a diagram of,\nI know someone that builds closets,\n\n118\n00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.423\nright, because I'm focusing on that.\n\n119\n00:06:48.423 --> 00:06:52.888\nBut what are some other reasons, Cherokee,\nthat you can think of that your closet\n\n120\n00:06:52.888 --> 00:06:56.900\nmight be a mess that doesn't have\nanything to do with the organization?\n\n121\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Perhaps you're\nan online shopper like me and\n\n122\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.035\nmaybe you have a bit of a problem.\n\n123\n00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:04.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's perfect, right?\n\n124\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.960\nSo if the root cause of the problem is,\nI'm an online shopper and I'm overbuying,\n\n125\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.300\nwe should be tackling that.\n\n126\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But if you just said to me,\n\n127\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.260\nmy closet's a mess, I might be giving\nyou advice just to fix that and\n\n128\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.015\nnot fix the online shopping,\nwhich I'm also a fan of.\n\n129\n00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:21.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So in the head of the fish,\n\n130\n00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:23.770\nI'm putting the problem.\n\n131\n00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.760\nThe big bones of the fish are the major\ncontributors to that problem.\n\n132\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.580\nThe smaller bones play into the bigger\nbones, and actually, I wanna take those\n\n133\n00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.540\nsmaller bones out as far as I can because\nthat's where the likely root cause is.\n\n134\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.771\nSo, when you're in a situation where\nyou're trying to gather information\n\n135\n00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:45.622\nquickly, this is a wonderful\nfacilitation tool.\n\n136\n00:07:45.622 --> 00:07:48.756\nBecause you can put the problem\nin the head of the fish and\n\n137\n00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:52.637\nyou can ask the people in the room\nwhether you have 3 or 20, right?\n\n138\n00:07:52.637 --> 00:07:56.330\nYou can say, what do you think\nare the major contributors?\n\n139\n00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.186\nTo this problem.\n\n140\n00:07:57.186 --> 00:08:01.957\nAnd sometimes, just people saying their\nperception of what is contributing to this\n\n141\n00:08:01.957 --> 00:08:06.890\nproblem, opens up the door to all kinds\nof other really cool things to look at.\n\n142\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.240\nBut sometimes the big bone\nreally is the root cause.\n\n143\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.200\nBut generally speaking, the big bones are\njust, and they might be things that you\n\n144\n00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.050\nwanna work on, but generally speaking,\nit's gonna be something smaller off\n\n145\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.750\nthe big borne that contributes to that\nthat's gonna be the actual problem.\n\n146\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.820\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou are really initiating that discussion.\n\n147\n00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:30.110\nThis is a basically a really focused brain\nstorming session is what it sounds like.\n\n148\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes absolutely.\n\n149\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.920\nAnd it's,\nnow you can do a fish bone on your own.\n\n150\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.960\nIt's just that if you only have\na little bit of time, you can gather so\n\n151\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.520\nmuch information by just drawing\nthe head of a fish on a whiteboard and\n\n152\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.340\njust asking people to help you.\n\n153\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.980\nThe other thing that's so cool about it\nis, let's say you're really strapped for\n\n154\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.130\ntime, and you have a real big\nproblem in your department.\n\n155\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.310\nYou can actually get\nthe major contributors, and\n\n156\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.420\nthen hand off the bones to other people\nand say, hey, why don't you take\n\n157\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.700\nthis bone and work on it, and you take\nthat, and we'll meet for coffee tomorrow?\n\n158\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.710\nSo it really is just a great lean tool.\n\n159\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.090\nNow here's an example of one\nthat's completely fleshed out.\n\n160\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.820\nAnd in this case, they're using names\nto help you with your brainstorming.\n\n161\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.910\nWe covered in another session that this\nis called structured brainstorming,\n\n162\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.400\nwhen I give you the topics\nto brainstorm around.\n\n163\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.810\nSo in typical brainstorming,\n\n164\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.830\nas a reminder,\nI'm just writing every single thing down.\n\n165\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.020\nAnd If I have a whole bunch\nof things on my white chart,\n\n166\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.340\nI mean on my flip chart, sorry.\n\n167\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.560\nIf I have a whole bunch of\nstuff on my flip chart,\n\n168\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.570\nthen at some point I might want to put\nthem in some kind of category, right?\n\n169\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's called an affinity diagram.\n\n170\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.990\nWell, Lean Six Sigma has a tendency to\ndo a lot of things that starts with\n\n171\n00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.660\nthe affinity diagram just to\nhelp your brain storming.\n\n172\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.968\nSo in the same situation,\nlets say you bring people into a room, and\n\n173\n00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:50.896\nI told you you don't have a lot of time.\n\n174\n00:09:50.896 --> 00:09:52.097\nYou can assign bones out.\n\n175\n00:09:52.097 --> 00:09:53.908\nAnother way you could approach that,\n\n176\n00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:56.270\nif you don't have a lot\nof time with your group.\n\n177\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.780\nOr you're wrapping up an all-day meeting,\n\n178\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.710\nyou just wanna get some quick information,\nis to go ahead and name the bones.\n\n179\n00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.700\nSo in this case,\nthey named the bones after six Ms.\n\n180\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.230\nAnd that's just design there\nto kinda help you remember.\n\n181\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.310\nOkay well I'm gonna call this one Machine,\nand that's gonna be computers and\n\n182\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.310\nthings like that.\n\n183\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.506\nI'm gonna call one Mother Nature,\nwhich is environment, etc, etc.\n\n184\n00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:24.110\nAnd that kind of makes people even focus\nmore on the bones, so the idea of that.\n\n185\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.290\nAnd we're gonna look at that\nparticular thing in just a second.\n\n186\n00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.260\nSo I want people to,\n\n187\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.360\neven though you're gonna have access\nto some really beautiful templates.\n\n188\n00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.118\nSo if you're using your fish\nbone in a presentation,\n\n189\n00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:40.908\nyou can make it look super pretty.\n\n190\n00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:45.199\nI want people to remember that\nthese tools, again, are for you.\n\n191\n00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:48.200\nAnd sometimes you're not gonna\nuse them in a presentation.\n\n192\n00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.220\nA lot of time the Lean Six Sigma\ntools are designed to\n\n193\n00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.460\njust write out in a meeting, right?\n\n194\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.030\nAnd so just kinda keep in mind,\n\n195\n00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.320\nyou can get a bunch of information that\nyou're never really gonna present.\n\n196\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.310\nSo, in that case, it's not lean to use a\ntemplate and try to make it into the head\n\n197\n00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.540\nof the fish and try to make it fit into\nthe bones, cuz it gets kinda tricky.\n\n198\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.030\nSometimes you're just drawing it out,\nright?\n\n199\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.610\nAnd I think that one of the things\nthat we've lost with the seven tools,\n\n200\n00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.320\nis that we forgot these tools\nwere created before computers.\n\n201\n00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.890\nAnd so they were meant to be paper and\npencil tools, and\n\n202\n00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.110\nthey are meant to aid in\nour critical thinking.\n\n203\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.308\nSo, we, after having said that,\nwe do have some very clever templates.\n\n204\n00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:30.905\n&gt;&gt; That one is really nice.\n\n205\n00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:32.990\n&gt;&gt; So if you do have a presentation,\n\n206\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:37.754\nI think the thing that I want the takeaway\nfrom this session is that if you're\n\n207\n00:11:37.754 --> 00:11:42.369\ngoing to use the tools to help your\nstory in a presentation, by all means,\n\n208\n00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:47.550\nuse the prettiest templates you can,\nanything that's gonna be eye-catching.\n\n209\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.930\nBut don't get away from the fact that\nthese are tools that are helping\n\n210\n00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.830\nyou think.\n\n211\n00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.260\nYou may never show them to anyone.\n\n212\n00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't stray from the way\nof the lean thinking, and\n\n213\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.170\nyou're just trying to get\nsomething functional and fast.\n\n214\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.510\nSo then when its kinda, I guess,\n\n215\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:08.100\nthe design is counteracting your purpose,\nthen it's not useful.\n\n216\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it's really funny because,\nthese graphic packages are so\n\n217\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.810\nfun to work with.\n\n218\n00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.710\nYou can find yourself\nworking on a package and\n\n219\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.003\nnot really moving forward-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n220\n00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:18.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With your message.\n\n221\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.090\nBut that's an example.\n\n222\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.520\nOkay, so that is the fish bone.\n\n223\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.750\nAnd one of the things that I mentioned is\nthat if you're gonna do some brainstorming\n\n224\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.220\naround the fish bone,\nthere's a couple of things you can do.\n\n225\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.310\nAnd those will probably pop\nup a little bit later, but\n\n226\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.230\nI just wanna introduce them right now.\n\n227\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.680\nThe six Ms, and\nyou saw some of the six Ms, Man, Machine.\n\n228\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.250\nThat's just to kind of help you think,\nwell if I have to quickly name the bones.\n\n229\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.560\nAnother method that you can use\nthat's even simpler is People,\n\n230\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.470\nProcess, Product, and\nyou wanna say Product/Service, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.390\nTo keep the three Ps.\n\n232\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.120\nSo you're like in a super-barn, cuz I\nkeep saying you have less and less and\n\n233\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.810\nless time in this example.\n\n234\n00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.970\nSo you really don't have\ntime to do anything.\n\n235\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.550\nIf you make the bones People,\nProcess, Product/Service and\n\n236\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.190\njust kind of brainstorm around them,\nespecially if you're just doing it\n\n237\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.750\nyourself, you're going to\ncapture most of that thinking.\n\n238\n00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n239\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.550\nSo the next topic that we're gonna talk\nabout of the seven tools of quality,\n\n240\n00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.820\nwhich are also the seven tools\nof critical thinking and\n\n241\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.470\nthe seven tools of data analysis.\n\n242\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.100\nIt's just amazing, these tools\nare that important, is flowcharts.\n\n243\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.470\nAnd as I mentioned in\nthe beginning of this presentation,\n\n244\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:32.180\nsometimes flowcharts\nare referred to as process maps.\n\n245\n00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.390\nBut the thing about flowcharts, I want you\nto have a bigger concept of flowcharts,\n\n246\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.660\nbecause there's all kinds of\nthings a flowchart can do.\n\n247\n00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.790\nTypically in Lean Six Sigma,\nyou are doing a process map.\n\n248\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.760\nHowever, because one of the rules in\nLean Six Sigma is that you have to have at\n\n249\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.960\nleast a high level knowledge of what's\ngoing on now to fix the problem.\n\n250\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.860\nSo, I mean, I'm sure you've been in\nsituations where people just go try\n\n251\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.924\nto fix something, and\nthey have no clue what's going on.\n\n252\n00:13:58.924 --> 00:14:00.054\n&gt;&gt; Yes, actually.\n\n253\n00:14:00.054 --> 00:14:06.229\n[LAUGH] For my project that I submitted\nto your organization, to SSD global, for\n\n254\n00:14:06.229 --> 00:14:12.331\nthe Green Belt certification, I had to\nuse these tools that you had taught us.\n\n255\n00:14:12.331 --> 00:14:15.810\nI was very naive when I\nentered into this program.\n\n256\n00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.390\nI thought people developed\nthese processes, and\n\n257\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.500\nthe employees adhere to them.\n\n258\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500\nI couldn't have been more wrong.\n\n259\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.980\nI found various reasons as to why someone\nwould deviate from a preexisting process.\n\n260\n00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:33.260\nI mean, everything from thinking, I have\na better way, a faster way to do this.\n\n261\n00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.755\nHowever, they were, that individual may\nhave been unaware of check somes that were\n\n262\n00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:41.062\nin place that they were also\nbypassing with their shortcuts.\n\n263\n00:14:41.062 --> 00:14:45.117\nThings even personal monetary\ngain to bypass some.\n\n264\n00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.700\nAnd there's just so many reasons.\n\n265\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.552\nAnd by laying it all out and\ncreating a process map, I could see those\n\n266\n00:14:51.552 --> 00:14:56.980\ndeviations and it was a lot more\ndetailed than I had ever imagined.\n\n267\n00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.290\nI will say this though.\n\n268\n00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.110\nThe program that I used was\nMicrosoft Visio, and that was life saver,\n\n269\n00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:08.240\nbecause going back and reworking the flow\nchart, even with improvements, whenever\n\n270\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.770\nI created like a before and after,\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh\n\n271\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.623\n&gt;&gt; It was so easy to use that program.\n\n272\n00:15:12.623 --> 00:15:15.140\nOtherwise, if I had been\nusing something like Paint or\n\n273\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.245\nmore basic piece of software,\nit would have been a huge headache.\n\n274\n00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:22.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it takes, yeah,\nan absolutely long time.\n\n275\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.100\nBut the, yeah, and the more you\nknow about the process, the better.\n\n276\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.180\nAnd one thing I would like to\nthrow out there is that there\n\n277\n00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.780\nare Lean Six Sigma certified\npeople that this is all they do.\n\n278\n00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.400\nThey go in to companies and\ndo process mapping, that's all they do.\n\n279\n00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.235\nNow they are walking the process, which\nwe're gonna talk about here in a second.\n\n280\n00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:42.669\nBut that's their soul thing is\njust to make sure companies\n\n281\n00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:44.852\nunderstand what's happening now.\n\n282\n00:15:44.852 --> 00:15:48.884\nSometimes your process chart can be\nlike really messy like this and,\n\n283\n00:15:48.884 --> 00:15:53.611\nonce again, the reason why I'm bringing\nup this example is that Flowcharting,\n\n284\n00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:57.156\nif you're gonna use it in a presentation,\nlike Cherokee did\n\n285\n00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:01.940\nin her Lean Six Sigma green belt report,\nyou want something pretty, right?\n\n286\n00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:07.100\nBut if you're sitting around at a meeting,\ndon't worry as much about the symbols and\n\n287\n00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.020\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n288\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.600\nIf you're just sitting,\ntrying to think things out.\n\n289\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.370\nFor some reason, drawing them out and\nmoving them around, it's good for\n\n290\n00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.510\nour critical thinking, and then it\nhelps people come up with better ideas.\n\n291\n00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.700\nNow this is kind of what you're used\nto seeing, a process map flowchart.\n\n292\n00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.855\nStep one, step two, step three.\n\n293\n00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:28.405\nThere's a tendency in\nthe Lean Six Sigma world\n\n294\n00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:32.585\nto now try to get your flowcharts,\nyour high level flowchart,\n\n295\n00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:36.285\na detailed flowchart is gonna\nhave even more information.\n\n296\n00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:40.935\nBut to try to get your\nhigh level flowcharts and\n\n297\n00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.945\nprocess maps in these types of\nthings on one piece of paper.\n\n298\n00:16:43.945 --> 00:16:46.287\nSo even if you have to turn it sideways.\n\n299\n00:16:46.287 --> 00:16:50.278\nIn the old days, in fact, if you went and\nlooked and you researched some things from\n\n300\n00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:53.997\nwhen we did flowcharts before, there\nwere just pages and pages, and pages.\n\n301\n00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:56.173\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mine ended up being a couple of pages.\n\n302\n00:16:56.173 --> 00:16:59.542\nIt was very, very hard, and I figured,\nI can't really make that font any smaller,\n\n303\n00:16:59.542 --> 00:17:01.453\notherwise you're not\ngonna be able to read it.\n\n304\n00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:02.940\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n305\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.764\nIt's not gonna be effective.\n\n306\n00:17:03.764 --> 00:17:04.571\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n307\n00:17:04.571 --> 00:17:06.130\nyou have to kind of think about that.\n\n308\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.300\nBut it used to be that they\nwere a little bit more linear,\n\n309\n00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.720\nis the only way I can explain it.\n\n310\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.887\nWhere if the bottom of the page,\nit would go to the top of page two,\n\n311\n00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:15.107\ngo to the top of page two.\n\n312\n00:17:15.107 --> 00:17:18.661\nAnd they got kinda confusing, but\nyour flowcharts looked great, so.\n\n313\n00:17:18.661 --> 00:17:19.724\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n314\n00:17:19.724 --> 00:17:25.340\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nthis is just another kind of example.\n\n315\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.990\nAnd wanted to point out some of\nthe symbols we use all the time, but\n\n316\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.440\na lot of times in flowcharts you're not\neven using anything more than rectangles.\n\n317\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.410\nThe other one that you're gonna\nuse a lot is the decision symbol.\n\n318\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.320\nSo there's different types\nof process flowcharts.\n\n319\n00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.790\nTop-down and that just\n\n320\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:51.190\nthat's another one of those words that you\ngotta watch out for in the ASQ Six Sigma.\n\n321\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.640\nAnd then the Lean, the SME Lean exams and\nsometimes even in Lean Six Sigma exams,\n\n322\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.680\nis that they might refer to the word,\nhigh level or top down.\n\n323\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.235\nSo kind of watch,\nkind of be cognizant of those words.\n\n324\n00:18:04.235 --> 00:18:06.380\nTop-down means the major steps.\n\n325\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.770\nI have a tendency to call that\na high level process map.\n\n326\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.495\nDeployment, a deployment process map or\nflowchart rather,\n\n327\n00:18:13.495 --> 00:18:17.873\nwould be explaining different\npeople's rolls and responsibilities.\n\n328\n00:18:17.873 --> 00:18:21.801\nYou could have just the work flow and\nyou could extrapolate that, and\n\n329\n00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:25.186\njust have a flowchart on just\nthe things that people touch,\n\n330\n00:18:25.186 --> 00:18:27.434\njust the things that materials touch.\n\n331\n00:18:27.434 --> 00:18:31.786\nJust the time that things are being\ntransferred electronically from one\n\n332\n00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:36.723\ncomputer to another one, and sometimes\nthat's referred to as stratification.\n\n333\n00:18:36.723 --> 00:18:39.287\nAnd in system maps,\nlike how does the system work.\n\n334\n00:18:39.287 --> 00:18:43.163\nSo, what I want you to take away from the\nsession more that anything else is that\n\n335\n00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.105\nflowchart absolutely process maps and\n\n336\n00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:48.841\nabsolutely that's where you're mostly\ngonna use them in LEAN Six Sigma.\n\n337\n00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:51.500\nBut don't discount that\nyou can use flowchart and\n\n338\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.164\nflowcharting symbols in\na number of other areas.\n\n339\n00:18:56.647 --> 00:18:59.350\nSo here's an example of the top down one,\nand\n\n340\n00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.780\nif you see, it says step one,\nstep two, step three, step four.\n\n341\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.550\nIn my mind,\nthat would be your high level chart and\n\n342\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.300\nthen where it says,\nunder step one where it has A, B and C.\n\n343\n00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.510\nThat's more of your detailed process maps.\n\n344\n00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.670\nI'm using this to show you what would\nbe the difference if someone said,\n\n345\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.385\nhigh level versus detailed.\n\n346\n00:19:19.385 --> 00:19:22.955\nMy high level would be that step one,\nstep two, step three, step four.\n\n347\n00:19:22.955 --> 00:19:24.327\n&gt;&gt; So your high-level steps.\n\n348\n00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:28.219\nThose were going to be steps that\nthe process could not live without.\n\n349\n00:19:28.219 --> 00:19:34.701\nAnd then the smaller, or then alpha\ncharacters would be the little details.\n\n350\n00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:35.231\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n351\n00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:36.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, just to make sure.\n\n352\n00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.556\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'm gonna want that\nif I'm managing the project,\n\n353\n00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:41.440\nI'm gonna want those details.\n\n354\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.700\nThe more details I have, the better\nI am able to be better, faster and\n\n355\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.530\nmore cost effective.\n\n356\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.130\nHowever, if I give this flowchart to,\nlet's say, my boss or\n\n357\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.640\nmy superior or my client, they're probably\nnot gonna care about all those details.\n\n358\n00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.772\nI care, they probably don't.\n\n359\n00:19:58.772 --> 00:20:00.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in this day and age,\n\n360\n00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.933\neven you see ideas such as creating\none-word sentences to send out.\n\n361\n00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:07.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n362\n00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.160\n&gt;&gt; People don't like,\nwe see Twitter with the 144 characters.\n\n363\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.100\nWe don't like to really read and\nspend a lot of time on things anymore.\n\n364\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.950\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n365\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.250\nSee, that's true.\n\n366\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.910\nOkay, and so here's one.\n\n367\n00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.920\nThis is an example of a flowchart\nused in a deployment way.\n\n368\n00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.790\nAnd in some cases,\nyou'll hear this term, swim lane chart.\n\n369\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.200\nWe're gonna look at some other swim\nlane charts in other sessions.\n\n370\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.120\nBut the idea is that I'm doing a flowchart\nand I'm seeing, kind of imagine A, B,\n\n371\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.070\nand C as being people's names.\n\n372\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.870\nOr plants, or\nparticular pieces of equipment, right?\n\n373\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.600\nAnd this is where they're kind\nof overlapping and, or who takes\n\n374\n00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.520\nresponsibility for the first task, how\ndo they hand it off to the second task.\n\n375\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.350\nSo a lot of times when we put\na deployment flowchart together,\n\n376\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.340\nwe can start identifying\nthings like bottlenecks.\n\n377\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.673\nAnd where, technically if there's\nan area that has more responsibility or\n\n378\n00:20:58.673 --> 00:21:02.746\nmore boxes in their area,\nthen that's probably where our problem is.\n\n379\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.210\nAnd this is a flowchart on\nhow to make a flowchart.\n\n380\n00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.780\nI just thought this was so clever, and\nso I'm just gonna leave that up for\n\n381\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.440\njust a second.\n\n382\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.990\nAnd let you kind of digest that.\n\n383\n00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.940\nYou'll see it, there's a start,\nit uses again not a lot of symbols.\n\n384\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.080\nIt's using the start and the ending\nsymbol, it's using one decision.\n\n385\n00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.380\nBut the rest of the things\nare pretty simple.\n\n386\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.733\nBut I just love this example.\n\n387\n00:21:27.733 --> 00:21:29.572\nA flow chart on how to make a flowchart.\n\n388\n00:21:29.572 --> 00:21:30.188\n&gt;&gt; Flowchart complete.\n\n389\n00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:32.262\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:21:32.262 --> 00:21:32.950\n&gt;&gt; I like it, too.\n\n391\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.476\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nwhen you're building a flowchart,\n\n392\n00:21:37.476 --> 00:21:40.266\nsome of the things are,\nand actually I want you to\n\n393\n00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:43.962\nkind of morph over to thinking more\non the terms of a process map.\n\n394\n00:21:43.962 --> 00:21:46.620\nOne of the things that people\nforget to do on a process map,\n\n395\n00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.289\nand keep in mind some people\ndo this actually for a living.\n\n396\n00:21:49.289 --> 00:21:52.826\nSo this is a really big thing,\njust like the fish bone that gets\n\n397\n00:21:52.826 --> 00:21:57.318\na little discounted, like it's, that\nshould be used on a more common basis,\n\n398\n00:21:57.318 --> 00:22:00.350\nflow charting, process mapping, it's huge.\n\n399\n00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.990\nSo, some of the things that you want to\ndo when you're creating your process map,\n\n400\n00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.860\nespecially if there's not\nsomething already in place,\n\n401\n00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.620\nis you wanna make sure you've\ngot the right people involved.\n\n402\n00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.020\nYou wanna make sure that you've\nbrainstormed all the decisions.\n\n403\n00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.492\nIf you're going to make\na formal flow chart,\n\n404\n00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:18.160\nthat's when you're gonna switch over and\nsay,\n\n405\n00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.600\nam I using universally accepted symbols,\nwhich we'll look at here in a second.\n\n406\n00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.609\nAnd I wanna describe the process steps.\n\n407\n00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:27.562\nSo it's actually pretty,\nit's something that you wanna think,\n\n408\n00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:29.990\nI don't wanna leave anything out, right?\n\n409\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay, pretty detailed.\n\n410\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo if I think people, what are the steps?\n\n411\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.980\nWhat are the major activities?\n\n412\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.815\nBecause sometimes the activities\ndon't really even have steps.\n\n413\n00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:40.142\nIt's just something that we do.\n\n414\n00:22:40.142 --> 00:22:46.500\nSo, the next thing I'm gonna\ndo when I'm building my chart.\n\n415\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.590\nLike first, people, activity, steps, and\nthen I'm gonna get that all mapped out.\n\n416\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.370\nAnd then after I get those pieces and\n\n417\n00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.900\nI like to put these pieces on sticky notes\nbefore I even start drawing things out.\n\n418\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.625\nThen I wanna make sure that\nI've sequenced it right.\n\n419\n00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:05.911\nI wanna make sure that if I'm using\nterminology on the flowchart,\n\n420\n00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:09.842\nbecause remember, the whole concept of\nthe flowchart or our process map is so,\n\n421\n00:23:09.842 --> 00:23:13.384\nI'm gonna hand it to you and\nyou don't have to understand my industry.\n\n422\n00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:14.904\nYou don't have to\nunderstand my department.\n\n423\n00:23:14.904 --> 00:23:15.750\n&gt;&gt; You can follow it.\n\n424\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.430\n&gt;&gt; You can just follow it, right?\n\n425\n00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.910\nAnd so I wanna make sure.\n\n426\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.010\nAnd a lot a times that's what\nhappens on our flowchart.\n\n427\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.010\nSomeone will discount\nour entire flow chart,\n\n428\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.410\nbecause we've put some acronym on there.\n\n429\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.050\nAnd there's like they don't get that and\nso it stops the flow, right?\n\n430\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.300\nAnd then you want to identify\nany predefined steps.\n\n431\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.296\nSo, what I mean by that is\nthat if your activity that\n\n432\n00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:43.768\nyou're flowcharting,\npicks up from something else.\n\n433\n00:23:43.768 --> 00:23:49.092\nIf it's dependent on that, at some point\nyou wanna say, after this happens.\n\n434\n00:23:49.092 --> 00:23:49.701\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n435\n00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.880\nThen you wanna test it.\n\n436\n00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.260\nAnd one way that you can test\nit is that you can walk around.\n\n437\n00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.690\nWe're gonna talk about Gemba Walks\nhere in a second, I think.\n\n438\n00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.530\nYou wanna make sure that you've\nused the correct symbols if\n\n439\n00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.770\nyou're [INAUDIBLE] that.\n\n440\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.910\nLike I said, a lot of flowcharts\njust use rectangles and arrows.\n\n441\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.000\n&gt;&gt; So employee training would\nhelp in this process right here?\n\n442\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n443\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.440\nAnd then,\nwhen you're looking specifically for\n\n444\n00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.710\nprocess improvements on your flowchart.\n\n445\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.170\nBecause sometimes what happens is that,\njust by doing a flowchart, you identify\n\n446\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.160\nthe problem, you don't need any of\nthese models that we're talking about.\n\n447\n00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.430\nThat's how powerful flowcharts can be.\n\n448\n00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.817\nJust by putting it on paper I go,\nwow, I can just fix the problem.\n\n449\n00:24:33.817 --> 00:24:34.552\nI see that, right?\n\n450\n00:24:34.552 --> 00:24:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a gap in my process.\n\n451\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:36.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n452\n00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:37.519\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I put a check sum or\n\n453\n00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:41.621\nsome kind of toll gate right here, then I\ncould eliminate the potential for errors\n\n454\n00:24:41.621 --> 00:24:45.681\nor something that may be costing your\ncompany thousands or millions of dollars.\n\n455\n00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:47.416\n&gt;&gt; And when you think about it,\nthat's really lean.\n\n456\n00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:50.710\nIf I can pick up a tool, I mean,\nin order to get certified,\n\n457\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.490\nyou do have to go through\nthe reporting process.\n\n458\n00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.240\nYou do have to do some\npre-requisites that.\n\n459\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.571\nIf i'm in my real, live everyday company,\n\n460\n00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:04.181\nif I can solve the problem by putting the\nprocess map together, that's huge, right?\n\n461\n00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:08.268\nSo when I'm looking for improvements,\none of the things I wanna look for\n\n462\n00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:10.480\nis if I did it in that swim lane fashion.\n\n463\n00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.280\nIf there's a bunch of activities in one\narea, that could denote a bottleneck,\n\n464\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.120\nright?\n\n465\n00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.404\nThe other thing I wanna do is I\nwanna look at all the paths, and\n\n466\n00:25:19.404 --> 00:25:21.282\nthat brings us back to our slides.\n\n467\n00:25:21.282 --> 00:25:25.972\nAt that bottom bullet, I wanna make sure\nthat all paths have some sort of close or\n\n468\n00:25:25.972 --> 00:25:26.749\nterminate.\n\n469\n00:25:26.749 --> 00:25:30.428\nBecause what happens a lot of times\nis that when we put a process map or\n\n470\n00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:35.013\na flowchart together, we'll see some item\nthat's just sort of out there in Never,\n\n471\n00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:36.895\nNeverland that-\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't make sense.\n\n472\n00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:39.816\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n473\n00:25:39.816 --> 00:25:42.410\nSo here's some flowcharting symbols.\n\n474\n00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.650\nAnd I just want you to look at that for\n\n475\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.259\na second because the ones that\nyou need to know are these.\n\n476\n00:25:48.259 --> 00:25:52.880\nIf you memorize these symbols and\nthis particular handout is in your\n\n477\n00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.272\nstudent packet, so\nyou don't have to memorize them right now.\n\n478\n00:25:57.272 --> 00:25:59.176\nBut if you memorize these symbols,\n\n479\n00:25:59.176 --> 00:26:02.100\nyou're fine as far as any\nof the exams are concerned.\n\n480\n00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.280\nAnd that would go for\nsix sigma only, lean only and\n\n481\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.390\nhopefully the one that makes the most\nsense, lean six sigma that combines it.\n\n482\n00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:14.390\nNow the reason why these are the core\nsymbols are these are universally\n\n483\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.370\naccepted symbols.\n\n484\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.870\nSo if you're working in\na global environment,\n\n485\n00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.760\neveryone agrees on these symbols.\n\n486\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.940\nOn some of the other symbols,\nI think one of the things,\n\n487\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.540\ncuz you mentioned Visio,\nVisio UK and Visio Australia.\n\n488\n00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.500\nAnd I don't if there's a Canadian version,\nbut\n\n489\n00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.800\nthe UK version and the Australian version,\neven though all three of us speak English,\n\n490\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.870\nhave some slightly different\nsymbols in the UK and Australia.\n\n491\n00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.180\nBut everyone agrees on these symbols.\n\n492\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.050\nAnd really, if you use these symbols,\nyou're gonna be fine.\n\n493\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.270\nNow most of them are intuitive,\nstart and stop obviously, operation.\n\n494\n00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.620\nAnd here in the States we have a tendency\nto make most of our operation symbols\n\n495\n00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.990\nrectangles, but internationally,\nsometimes you'll see those as circles.\n\n496\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.680\nDecision, you know that one, input,\nwhatever goes into the system.\n\n497\n00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.490\nAnd notice it only has kind of a slight\ndeviation, it kind of leans, right?\n\n498\n00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.840\nSometimes you'll see people do\nthe output symbol the other way, but\n\n499\n00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.530\na lot of times they'll use that symbol for\ninput or output.\n\n500\n00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.510\nSo flow kinda puts them together.\n\n501\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.550\nNow one that isn't as intuitive is\nthe difference between transportation and\n\n502\n00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.350\ntransmission.\n\n503\n00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.820\nAnd notice there's just\nthat little wiggle, right?\n\n504\n00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.517\nAnd the difference is transportation is\nany kind of movement at all, motorized,\n\n505\n00:27:27.517 --> 00:27:30.202\nmanual movement, any physical-\n&gt;&gt; Physical movement.\n\n506\n00:27:30.202 --> 00:27:34.057\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and transmission, on the other\nhand, is anything that we're doing\n\n507\n00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:36.862\nelectronic, so anything-\n&gt;&gt; Intellectual property transporting.\n\n508\n00:27:36.862 --> 00:27:39.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n509\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.440\nYeah, things going from one computer,\nabsolutely.\n\n510\n00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.770\nOkay, measurement is where I have to stop,\nand this one isn't as intuitive,\n\n511\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.550\nmeasurement would be any time\nI need to stop to do a check.\n\n512\n00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.370\nBecause measurement in a DMAIC\nmodel means a little different.\n\n513\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:58.732\nSo kinda think, I'm putting\nthe measurement is a place that I kinda\n\n514\n00:27:58.732 --> 00:28:01.035\ncheck myself, it's more of that.\n\n515\n00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:03.270\nAnd keep in mind,\neveryone doesn't know these symbols.\n\n516\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.073\nSo sometimes you're gonna see a flowchart\nwhere they're misusing the symbols, right?\n\n517\n00:28:07.073 --> 00:28:08.965\nBut you just don't wanna misuse them.\n\n518\n00:28:08.965 --> 00:28:13.690\nAll right, so delay, it means exactly\nwhat it says, I'm gonna stop.\n\n519\n00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:16.510\nThere's some kind of a reasoning there.\n\n520\n00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.950\nIn the old project management books,\nthey would always use the thing that\n\n521\n00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.340\nyou paint the door with primer and\nthen that dries.\n\n522\n00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.870\nAnd then you go and\npaint the door with the real paint.\n\n523\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.210\nBut now that we have primer in our paint,\nwe can't use that.\n\n524\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.777\nBut sometimes you could have a delay\ncuz you're waiting for a signature, or\n\n525\n00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:35.000\nsome validation, or some testing.\n\n526\n00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.195\nI mean, can you think of, what are some\nother reasons things might be delayed?\n\n527\n00:28:38.195 --> 00:28:39.671\n&gt;&gt; Installing software.\n\n528\n00:28:39.671 --> 00:28:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; In IT,\n\n529\n00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.583\nwe spend a lot of time\nwaiting on things to happen.\n\n530\n00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.143\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and\n\n531\n00:28:44.143 --> 00:28:48.057\nso if you're trying to get a high level\nidea of how long it's gonna take or\n\n532\n00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:51.540\nhow much it's gonna cost,\nthose delays are really important.\n\n533\n00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.330\nAnd then finally, storage, and\nthat is exactly what it says.\n\n534\n00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.110\nBut that one's a misused\nsymbol all the time, but\n\n535\n00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.980\nstorage technically means this is where\nI'm gonna stop and collect information.\n\n536\n00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.828\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So now,\n\n537\n00:29:03.828 --> 00:29:07.592\nI think when you're thinking\nabout these symbols,\n\n538\n00:29:07.592 --> 00:29:12.818\nit's a lot easier to say to yourself,\nbecause this is just some of them.\n\n539\n00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:14.753\nAs you know on that Vizio,\nthere were just tons and tons of these.\n\n540\n00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.936\n&gt;&gt; They have individual packages for\nspecific industries as well.\n\n541\n00:29:17.936 --> 00:29:23.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so there's tons and\nnobody expects you to memorize these.\n\n542\n00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.830\nBut if you do memorize this core group,\nyou're fine and\n\n543\n00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.290\nyou can build any flowchart.\n\n544\n00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.600\nAnd you can communicate\nglobally with anyone else.\n\n545\n00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:35.640\nSo again, these are just some examples.\n\n546\n00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.790\nIt's kinda reminder, high level,\nright, and then the detailed one.\n\n547\n00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.468\nSo, what I'd like to wrap up this session\nwith is Value Stream Mapping because\n\n548\n00:29:48.468 --> 00:29:52.128\nvalue stream mapping is so\nclosely related to flowcharts.\n\n549\n00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:55.392\nNow the biggest difference\nin value stream mapping, and\n\n550\n00:29:55.392 --> 00:29:59.481\nthis is a another one of those topics\nthat tends to be overcomplicated.\n\n551\n00:29:59.481 --> 00:30:03.234\nWhat I want you to kind of think\nof is that on a process map,\n\n552\n00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:08.580\nI am truly trying to put every single\nthing I can think of on my process map.\n\n553\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:13.100\nOn a value stream map, all I'm trying\nto do is put the core activities.\n\n554\n00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.850\nIf we didn't do this,\nthe absolutely essential activities, and\n\n555\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.265\nthat goes back to a discussion\nthat we had in a previous\n\n556\n00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:26.980\nsession about value versus non-value.\n\n557\n00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.700\nSo, what I'm trying to do, I'm looking at\nthe flowchart and I'm seeing if I took\n\n558\n00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.530\nthat box off, that project, product,\nor service would not go out the door.\n\n559\n00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.010\nAnd what I'm left with is\njust the essential functions.\n\n560\n00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.940\nNow the purpose behind that is if I'm\ngonna try to make things better, faster,\n\n561\n00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.780\nand more cost effective, I want to\nconcentrate on those core things.\n\n562\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.340\nSo, value stream mapping, this is the big\nthing, they have its own set of symbols.\n\n563\n00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.560\nSo it's not using the same\nsymbols as flowcharting.\n\n564\n00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.900\nHowever, I maintain if you wanted to\nuse flowchart symbols, I just don't\n\n565\n00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.900\nthink there's a value stream management\npolice that are gonna come out there.\n\n566\n00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.620\nSo it uses its own set.\n\n567\n00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.920\nIt tracks only the essential steps,\n\n568\n00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.220\nwhich we just said, and then we might\ndo something called a Gemba Walk.\n\n569\n00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.210\nAnd typically, Gemba Walks are becoming\nvery, very popular in hospitals.\n\n570\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.960\nAnd typically,\nI have some sort of process map in hand.\n\n571\n00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.250\nSome kind of high level idea at least\nof how the process is supposed to work.\n\n572\n00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.600\nSo I go walk the process, but\nin that walk, I take people with me.\n\n573\n00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.466\nWhy do you think I would take\npeople with me to walk the process?\n\n574\n00:31:33.466 --> 00:31:35.851\n&gt;&gt; So, if you were the person\nwho created that process,\n\n575\n00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:38.087\nyou probably think it's\na really great process.\n\n576\n00:31:38.087 --> 00:31:40.942\nBut for example in IT,\nif I were someone who designed,\n\n577\n00:31:40.942 --> 00:31:42.556\nif I were a network engineer and\n\n578\n00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:46.282\nI designed my network and I implemented\nall these security controls and\n\n579\n00:31:46.282 --> 00:31:50.564\nI thought no one can break into my network\nI normally would hire a third party person\n\n580\n00:31:50.564 --> 00:31:54.630\nto a perform penetration test because\nit's really just another set of eyes.\n\n581\n00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.186\nAnd another, I guess, angle or opinion,\n\n582\n00:31:57.186 --> 00:32:00.630\nto point something out that\nyou may not have recognized?\n\n583\n00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely, absolutely.\n\n584\n00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.514\nAnd again, just like we said that there\nare people, Lean 6 Sigma certified,\n\n585\n00:32:07.514 --> 00:32:11.250\ngreen and black belts, that go in and\nall they do is process map.\n\n586\n00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.551\nThere's a whole group of\npeople now that as a business,\n\n587\n00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:18.126\nas a consulting business,\njust do Gemba Walks.\n\n588\n00:32:18.126 --> 00:32:23.690\nBecause the thinking is, I have no bias,\nI have no idea what's going on.\n\n589\n00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.894\nAnd I'm gonna come up with those steps.\n\n590\n00:32:25.894 --> 00:32:30.450\nNow in a Gemba Walk what happens is after\nthe walk has taken place, typically you\n\n591\n00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.466\ncome back to something, we call it\na war room in a lot of environments.\n\n592\n00:32:34.466 --> 00:32:36.385\nBut you come back to a conference room and\n\n593\n00:32:36.385 --> 00:32:40.080\nyou put your sticky notes up on all\nthe different steps that you took.\n\n594\n00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.240\nAnd then what you're doing\nis you're trying to say,\n\n595\n00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.875\nhow long did it take from step one to two?\n\n596\n00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:45.284\nHow much did it cost?\n\n597\n00:32:45.284 --> 00:32:46.614\nWhat were the resources?\n\n598\n00:32:46.614 --> 00:32:50.575\nSo the other thing about value\nstream mapping you wanna remember,\n\n599\n00:32:50.575 --> 00:32:53.770\nis that there's a a current and\na future map.\n\n600\n00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:58.525\nNow in process mapping, sometimes\nyou'll see an as is process map and\n\n601\n00:32:58.525 --> 00:32:59.822\na 2B process map.\n\n602\n00:32:59.822 --> 00:33:02.598\nThat's where want we move to, but\n\n603\n00:33:02.598 --> 00:33:07.150\nalways in value streams we\nhave a current and a future.\n\n604\n00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.535\nAnd the current, again, is the one that\njust includes those essential steps.\n\n605\n00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:15.446\nBecause we're saying if we don't do these,\nthe process isn't gonna work.\n\n606\n00:33:15.446 --> 00:33:18.798\nSo we have to work around\nthose particular processes.\n\n607\n00:33:18.798 --> 00:33:21.708\nSo here's some general icons.\n\n608\n00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:25.754\nSome of the icons make perfect\nsense like go see, I love that one.\n\n609\n00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:29.917\nAnd there's a lot more,\nyou'll see kind of cartoon icons.\n\n610\n00:33:29.917 --> 00:33:34.692\nBut now we've morphed into having\nsome very sophisticated ones like\n\n611\n00:33:34.692 --> 00:33:39.900\nthe eye glasses, are real eye glass,\nor real glasses that you might wear.\n\n612\n00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.168\nBut some of them kind of makes sense.\n\n613\n00:33:44.168 --> 00:33:49.303\nMaterial flow icons, if you're not\nfamiliar with manufacturing environments,\n\n614\n00:33:49.303 --> 00:33:52.256\nsome of these icons will\nnot make as much sense.\n\n615\n00:33:52.256 --> 00:33:57.366\nIn Visio, the default and\nin a lot of graphic packages,\n\n616\n00:33:57.366 --> 00:34:00.209\nnot just the Microsoft Visio.\n\n617\n00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:01.578\nBut that's one we mentioned.\n\n618\n00:34:01.578 --> 00:34:07.150\nSo in a lot of graphic packages\nthe default's gonna be the flow chart.\n\n619\n00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.649\nBut there's gonna be a tab that\nsays value string mapping symbols.\n\n620\n00:34:10.649 --> 00:34:11.685\nAnd it works the same way.\n\n621\n00:34:11.685 --> 00:34:14.455\nIf you hover over the symbol it's\ngonna tell you what the symbol is.\n\n622\n00:34:14.455 --> 00:34:19.305\nNow some people don't like the symbols\nbecause they think it makes it too much\n\n623\n00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:20.582\nlike a story board.\n\n624\n00:34:20.582 --> 00:34:24.088\nSo I still wanna say that if you don't\nuse the symbols I think you can still\n\n625\n00:34:24.088 --> 00:34:25.776\ndo the theory of the value stream.\n\n626\n00:34:25.776 --> 00:34:27.424\n&gt;&gt; Convey your message.\n\n627\n00:34:27.424 --> 00:34:28.379\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n628\n00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:29.646\nAnd so here's information flow icons.\n\n629\n00:34:29.646 --> 00:34:32.703\nAnd like I said,\nif you just kinda take a quick look,\n\n630\n00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:36.817\nsome of these make perfect sense,\nsome of them you'd have to look up.\n\n631\n00:34:36.817 --> 00:34:40.630\n&gt;&gt; Now will we need to know these for\nthe exam?\n\n632\n00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.206\nWould we see it?\n&gt;&gt; What a great question.\n\n633\n00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:43.860\nWhat you need to know for\n\n634\n00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.831\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam is that there's\nanother way to do a process map.\n\n635\n00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:50.770\nThat you can do a value stream map.\n\n636\n00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.214\nAnd that value stream maps\nhave their own symbols.\n\n637\n00:34:53.214 --> 00:34:56.029\nIf you are taking the Lean exam.\n\n638\n00:34:56.029 --> 00:35:01.370\nBecause right now the Lean exam is very\nheavily oriented to our manufacturing.\n\n639\n00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:06.083\nYou want to take a moment to at least\nmemorize some of the manufacturing.\n\n640\n00:35:06.083 --> 00:35:10.079\nOn the student package,\nyou're gonna have a sheet that has all of\n\n641\n00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:13.990\nthe value stream mapping tools\nthe most the popular ones.\n\n642\n00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.226\nAnd it will have right underneath,\nthat's what this is.\n\n643\n00:35:16.226 --> 00:35:18.636\nSo if you're taking a Lean exam,\ndefinitely.\n\n644\n00:35:18.636 --> 00:35:22.542\nSix Sigma, again,\nsame thing as the Lean Six Sigma exam,\n\n645\n00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:27.140\nif you know the concept of\nthe value stream map, you're fine.\n\n646\n00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.968\nSo great question.\n\n647\n00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:32.190\nIf you are taking the Lean only\nexam you wanna know these symbols.\n\n648\n00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.886\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n649\n00:35:32.886 --> 00:35:34.530\n&gt;&gt; So perfect question, thank you.\n\n650\n00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:40.580\nAll right, and Gemba walk, just like\nwhat we said, it's just to access or\n\n651\n00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.480\ncreate your value stream.\n\n652\n00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:47.333\nAnd your value stream is,\nthe things that absolutely have to happen,\n\n653\n00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:50.631\nto make your product or\nproject go out the door.\n\n654\n00:35:50.631 --> 00:35:53.990\nSo I think we're gonna cover the other\nseven tools in our next session.\n\n655\n00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah we got to two\nof the seven, so that's not bad.\n\n656\n00:35:57.085 --> 00:36:00.590\nWe went into a really a lot of\ndetail by looking at examples and\n\n657\n00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:05.020\nlooking at the variations of these\ndifferent tools available to us.\n\n658\n00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.754\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap it up for this particular episode.\n\n659\n00:36:07.754 --> 00:36:10.545\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have a lot more information for\n\n660\n00:36:10.545 --> 00:36:12.930\nour seven quality tools headed your way.\n\n661\n00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.249\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n662\n00:36:17.249 --> 00:36:19.821\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Tara VanZant-Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n663\n00:36:19.821 --> 00:36:22.019\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n664\n00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:29.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n665\n00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.585\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.020\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.940\nThis is actually a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.630\nIn the previous episode we were\nlooking at our seven quality tools.\n\n8\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.160\nWe only got through a couple so\n\n9\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.930\nwe're gonna spend some more time focusing\non the remainder of those tools.\n\n10\n00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.480\nWith us in studio today is Dr.\nTara Van Zant Stern.\n\n11\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.340\nThank you for joining us today Dr. Tara.\n\n12\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.820\n&gt;&gt; So at the end of the episode we\nwere mentioning, again, the lock.\n\n14\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.870\nAnd we really didn't go\ninto extreme detail, and\n\n15\n00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.180\nI just wanted to make sure I\nfully understood that concept.\n\n16\n00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.820\nSo in IT we have this term,\nit's called the sneaker net.\n\n17\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.270\nAnd it's kind of a joke, but it really\nmeans getting up out of your chair and\n\n18\n00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.650\nwalking over to a situation\nto try to solve the problem.\n\n19\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.800\nIs that similar, am I on track here?\n\n20\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n21\n00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.000\nSo what I'm doing is I'm just\nbasically walking the process.\n\n22\n00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.010\nAnd if I can go to one in my slides,\n\n23\n00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.120\nI'll show you the end result\nlooks something like this.\n\n24\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.450\nSo as I walk through the process,\nI record my steps.\n\n25\n00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.280\nAnd this is just one method of doing it.\n\n26\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.440\nSome people do different methods.\n\n27\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.568\nBut one method is I would walk, and step\none, step two and I'd put my stickies out.\n\n28\n00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:31.540\nAnd in between the stickies what I'm\nlooking at is how long did that take?\n\n29\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.660\nHow much did it cost, how many resources?\n\n30\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.610\n&gt;&gt; It looks like you have some sort\nkind of color coding going on here.\n\n31\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.250\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n32\n00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.190\nand this is all kind of up to the group\nof people that you're working with.\n\n33\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.560\nA lot of times, as a Lean Six Sigma\nperson, you're facilitating the exercise.\n\n34\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.770\nAnd you might not really know,\nthe topic that they're researching.\n\n35\n00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.650\nSo, I look for a lot of input,\nhere's another example.\n\n36\n00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.530\nI look for a lot of input from them\nabout what do we wanna call this?\n\n37\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.810\nHow do we wanna color code it?\n\n38\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.770\nHow do we wanna do these different things.\n\n39\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.150\nSo the good news,\nas far as that's concerned,\n\n40\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.450\nis that the gemba walk process itself,\na little messy, but easy to do.\n\n41\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.450\nNow when you take that same\ngemba walk thing and you put it\n\n42\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.480\non a flowchart, that's when you go back to\nusing those symbols and things like that.\n\n43\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.970\nSo, on our last session\nwe were talking about,\n\n44\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.670\nI'm just move up a few slides, we were\ntalking about fishbone, flowchart and\n\n45\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.260\nas Cherokee said we're gonna move on to\nthose other areas, the seven tools and\n\n46\n00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.490\nI'm just gonna advance here quickly and\nget us where we need to be.\n\n47\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.070\nOne of the things that we were\ntalking about on during our break.\n\n48\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.820\nThe seven tools are so important that\nif you were a Lean Six Sigma person\n\n49\n00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.800\ngoing in to an environment that's never\nhad a process improvement specialist,\n\n50\n00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.090\na lot of times the screening questions\nare gonna be around the seven tools.\n\n51\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030\nBecause that's what's\npromoted out on the Internet.\n\n52\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.900\nSo let's say you're an HR person and\n\n53\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.720\nyou're trying to screen a process\nimprovement person for the IT department.\n\n54\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.760\nYou're probably going to\nhave the IT person there\n\n55\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.030\nthat's able to ask you the IT\nrelated questions, but\n\n56\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.500\nthe HR person might be the only one that's\nasking anything to do with Lean Six Sigma.\n\n57\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.710\nAnd if they're not familiar with it,\nThere is a tendency or\n\n58\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.710\na trend for them to ask you questions\n[LAUGH] related to these seven tools.\n\n59\n00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.490\nNow, even though on the exam,\nwell the tools do,\n\n60\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.670\nI would say pick up\na big part of the exam.\n\n61\n00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.300\nBut most of the exam has to do with\nthe models and the methodology and\n\n62\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.820\nthe concepts But\nin interviewing situations\n\n63\n00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.250\nthere is a tendency to rely\non knowledge of your tools.\n\n64\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.990\nThese seven tools,\nas we mentioned in the session before.\n\n65\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.780\nAlso, called the seven\ntools of critical thinking,\n\n66\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.320\nthe seven tools of data analysis.\n\n67\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.020\nSome times they're called the seven\nbusiness processing tools,\n\n68\n00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.770\njust they go by lots of different names.\n\n69\n00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.980\nSo, very important tools.\n\n70\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.530\nOne of the things I think is interesting\n\n71\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.680\nis that one of the seven tools\nis just called a check sheet.\n\n72\n00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.730\nAnd we use check sheets all the time,\nwe call them to do lists, right.\n\n73\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.640\nAnd it's interesting that a check sheet\nwould make it on the seven tools,\n\n74\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.240\nsomething that simple.\n\n75\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.850\nBut there's been a lot of\nresearch over the past decades.\n\n76\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.400\nAnd so for\n\n77\n00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.480\nsome reason when we write something down\nIt's like a contract with ourselves and\n\n78\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.100\nwe're much more likely to remember and\nmuch more likely to actually do it.\n\n79\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure.\nLike you even mentioned before,\n\n80\n00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.860\nif you have to even add a signature line,\n\n81\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.790\nyou're kind of giving your word that you,\nin fact, accomplished this task so\n\n82\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.300\nit makes it even a little, you know,\nyou're just adding that accountability.\n\n83\n00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so some other examples of\ncheck sheets would be something like this.\n\n84\n00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.350\nLike, number of minutes spent\nstudying math facts, right?\n\n85\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.217\nAnd we use this.\n\n86\n00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:47.514\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n87\n00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:48.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n88\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.480\nAnd this is kind of something that\na lot of elementary school teachers\n\n89\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.290\nuse to explain to their students.\n\n90\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.990\nThe more that you study,\nthe better you're going to do on test.\n\n91\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.130\nBuy I'm just doing a check\nsheet at this point.\n\n92\n00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.870\nYou'll notice on typical check sheets.\n\n93\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.240\nBut a to do list is a check sheet right?\n\n94\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.340\nOn check sheets where I'm\ngathering information,\n\n95\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.380\nwe are encouraged to put a tick mark okay?\n\n96\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.110\nSo for example when we're doing\nbrainstorming, and we go around and\n\n97\n00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.290\nwe ask how many other people think this\nis valuable, for trying to get that idea.\n\n98\n00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.350\nIf we're trying to multi voting, which\nwe covered under the facilitation tools,\n\n99\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.969\nthe tick mark is really important\nbecause that says my vote counted.\n\n100\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.550\nSo, a to do list is a good example.\n\n101\n00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.220\nA toll gate which we mentioned\nin a session before,\n\n102\n00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.210\nin some companies especially those six\nsigma companies where there's a very\n\n103\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.180\ncomplicated process that they're\ntrying to improve sometimes after each\n\n104\n00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.110\nphase in the model that they're using,\nthere'll be something called a toll gate.\n\n105\n00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.970\nAnd basically,\nthat's a check sheet that says,\n\n106\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.140\ndid I really do everything I was\nsupposed to do in that phase?\n\n107\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.030\nIn some industries that are heavy\nin compliance, sometimes\n\n108\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.810\nthere's compliance related things to that\nphase that people just want to make sure.\n\n109\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.040\nOr they could be SOPs,\nstandard operating procedures.\n\n110\n00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.350\nSo those are kinds of things\nthat make toll gates.\n\n111\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.980\nBecause a lot of times, people will say,\n\n112\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.530\nwell, you know what you're\nsupposed to do in that phase.\n\n113\n00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.820\nAbsolutely, but if you're in\na particular industry, there could be\n\n114\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.870\nextra things that have to be done before-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n115\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.730\nAnd what really kind of\nresonates with me is,\n\n116\n00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.660\nin my family I have people who\nwork in the power industry.\n\n117\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.210\nSo if they're working on large turbines or\nsomething,\n\n118\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.190\nmaybe they've never worked on that piece\nof equipment, but someone else has.\n\n119\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Documented the process, so\n\n120\n00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.660\nnow they're just saying hey,\n\n121\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.099\nmake sure you [LAUGH] put all\nthe pieces back together here.\n\n122\n00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And in some of those industries,\n\n123\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.690\nthere's actually toll gate reviewers.\n\n124\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.792\nThey're like compliance people [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; The quality assurance, and\n\n125\n00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:45.319\nthat's their only function.\n\n126\n00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.030\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.\n\n127\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.280\nIt's not a good job if you\n\n128\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.470\ndon't like being criticized because people\nare always like, no the compliance person.\n\n129\n00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.990\nBut it's a job, right?\n\n130\n00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.770\nAnother way that we can use check\nsheets is to gather information for\n\n131\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.770\na pareto chart or a histogram informally.\n\n132\n00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.920\nSo, sometimes we're just trying to\nfigure out Is there actually a problem.\n\n133\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.810\nAnd we're not really trying\nto do a big scientific study.\n\n134\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.580\nWe're just trying to gather enough\ninformation to see should I've been\n\n135\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.790\nlooking in that particular direction.\n\n136\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.120\nAnd then sometimes,\n\n137\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.579\nthere's a listed things that we\nhave to do before we get started.\n\n138\n00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.340\nI've always loved, when I talk about\ncheck sheets I always love some\n\n139\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.950\nof the old Steve Covey material that says\nwhat they're gonna do is a not to do list.\n\n140\n00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.270\nI'm gonna write down all of\nthe things I'm never gonna do again.\n\n141\n00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.480\nAnd I'm gonna carry that\naround in my purse or wallet.\n\n142\n00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.760\nSo here's another easy example\n\n143\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.199\nof a check sheet where they're\nlooking at telephone interruptions.\n\n144\n00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.946\nSo check sheet's very simple.\n\n145\n00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:54.458\nBut again, just like the Fishbone,\njust like the process mount,\n\n146\n00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:58.912\nsimple tools that sometimes we don't pay\nattention to, that are just mammoth as far\n\n147\n00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:02.069\nas Making things better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n148\n00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:07.470\nWhich is of course the whole\nconcept of process improvement.\n\n149\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.100\nAnd here's another check sheet.\n\n150\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.840\nThe reason I included this one is that\ncheck sheets can get sophisticated.\n\n151\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.910\nSo in this particular example,\nwhat we're looking is at the diameter of\n\n152\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.560\na pin that's supposed to fit\ninto another piece of equipment.\n\n153\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.920\nSomeone can come in and say,\nwe've got a lot of scrap on the floor.\n\n154\n00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.530\nWe have a lot of pins that\nare either too big or too little.\n\n155\n00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.070\nAnd when the manufacturer comes\nto buy them, if that's the case,\n\n156\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.250\nthey might not buy our lots and\nmaterial, right?\n\n157\n00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.290\nSo, in this case, I put an upper and\nlower control limit on the check sheet,\n\n158\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.690\nand physically,\njust have someone go out and count.\n\n159\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.670\n&gt;&gt; And measure them.\n\n160\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.580\n&gt;&gt; And measure them.\n\n161\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.540\nNow, in this case we are pretty lucky,\n\n162\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.080\nbecause what this shows is something\ncalled normal distribution.\n\n163\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.030\nSo, sometimes histograms are used to show.\n\n164\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.080\nAs long as it looks like a bell,\nand it fits between the upper and\n\n165\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.240\nlower control limits, you are pretty safe.\n\n166\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.570\nSo someone who's run in and\nsaid there's a lot of scrap on the floor.\n\n167\n00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.030\nThere's a lot of pins that\nwe're just throwing away.\n\n168\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.380\nI could do a simple check\nsheet to see if that's true.\n\n169\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.690\nNow you might still\nwanna keep an eye on it.\n\n170\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.240\nRight?\n\n171\n00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.150\nBut in this case I haven't gone\ninto full resolution mode,\n\n172\n00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.420\nhow are we gonna solve this problem?\n\n173\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.130\nBecause I need information, I need to\nmake sure that that's really a problem.\n\n174\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.610\nAnd this particular check sheet\nwould indicate not probably.\n\n175\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.970\n&gt;&gt; It's an acceptable\namount of defects or-\n\n176\n00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.710\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n177\n00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.700\nbecause you're gonna have some defects,\nright?\n\n178\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.030\nSo check sheets can be a little\nbit more sophisticated.\n\n179\n00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.040\nThe next tool we're going to talk about,\nCherokee, is histograms.\n\n180\n00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.760\nOne thing that I want to point out with\nhistograms is on the Six Sigma exam only,\n\n181\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.330\nthere's a lot more questions\nabout histograms than on\n\n182\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.799\nthe Lean Six Sigma test.\n\n183\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.192\nAnd actually the lean,\nor Lean Six Sigma test.\n\n184\n00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:59.984\nI'm gonna give you\nthe information that you need for\n\n185\n00:09:59.984 --> 00:10:01.960\nthose exams in your student packet.\n\n186\n00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.390\nThey are going to be talking\nto you about histograms.\n\n187\n00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.210\nBecause there is a statistical\nformula to make this graph appear.\n\n188\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.910\nIn Lean Six Sigma, as well as lean.\n\n189\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.930\nThe fact that you can make the graph.\n\n190\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.190\nIs good enough, right?\n\n191\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.070\nAnd we let Excel make the graph.\n\n192\n00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.940\nBut in the Six Sigma programs,\n\n193\n00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.610\na lot of times they want to know, all of\nthese graphs have statistics behind them.\n\n194\n00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:29.210\nSo when I see any kind of\ngraph other than like say,\n\n195\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.470\na flow chart and a fish bone.\n\n196\n00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.304\nIf I see a graph such as a histogram,\na Pareto chart,\n\n197\n00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:37.827\na scatter diagram, there's actually math.\n\n198\n00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:38.530\n&gt;&gt; They wanna see the work.\n\n199\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.760\n&gt;&gt; Behind that and\nthey wanna see the math, okay?\n\n200\n00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.570\nSo I will point that out.\n\n201\n00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.140\nThe other thing that I wanna point\nout is that, in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n202\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.150\nyou pretty much are using histograms\nto track the history of an event.\n\n203\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.540\nSo that makes it easy\nto remember on an exam.\n\n204\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.080\nThere are other ways, and\n\n205\n00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.460\nwe'll look at a couple of those ways\nthat you might use a histogram.\n\n206\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.140\nOne of them was the one we just looked at.\n\n207\n00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.610\nI might use a histogram to\ndetermine distribution.\n\n208\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.130\nSo, I'm gathering information and\nwhen I put my chart together,\n\n209\n00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.000\nas long as it's a nice, pretty bell and\nit fits between my upper and\n\n210\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.430\nlower control limits,\nI can say that process is stable.\n\n211\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.420\nSo that's one way a histogram is used.\n\n212\n00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.440\nAnother way a histogram can be used\nis to collect buckets of information.\n\n213\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.660\nHow many people made an A?\n\n214\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.900\nHow many people made a B?\n\n215\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.340\nHow many people made a C in that class?\n\n216\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.900\nHowever typically in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n217\n00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:34.090\nhistograms are used just like it says,\nto track the history of events.\n\n218\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:35.515\nHow many broken light bulbs?\n\n219\n00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:40.150\nHow many people came to\nthe library during a week?\n\n220\n00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.780\n&gt;&gt; How many shows we record in a week?\n\n221\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.430\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that type of thing.\n\n222\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.140\nSo that's, I think, kind of a fun thing,\n\n223\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.720\nis just to remember that\nit is just the history.\n\n224\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.760\nSo it's not a big thing to remember.\n\n225\n00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.020\nOkay, so what you're looking at right now,\n\n226\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.760\nI wanna point out the simple concept\nof how a histogram is constructed.\n\n227\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.220\nOn the left hand side of the screen\nyou're looking at very non-sophisticated\n\n228\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.230\nexample of a frequency diagram.\n\n229\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.540\nSo in statistics this is\nknown as frequency diagram.\n\n230\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.270\nAnd we're seeing blue shows up 5 times,\nyellow shows up two times.\n\n231\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.120\nBack in the day when we\ntaught basic statistics,\n\n232\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.980\nwe used to have these blue and\nred pegs, and yellow pegs.\n\n233\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.410\nAnd we mix them all together,\nand we do things.\n\n234\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.910\nLike, this is how you do sampling,\nand stuff like that.\n\n235\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.940\nAnd we would use it to demonstrate things,\nsuch as frequency diagrams.\n\n236\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.490\nAnd then there was the period of\ntime that all of us were using M&amp;Ms.\n\n237\n00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.710\nBecause M&amp;M were not standard, if you\nopened the pack you might have a different\n\n238\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.610\namount of red than you had of yellow,\nbut that started getting standard and so\n\n239\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.440\nwe went back to the peg system\nto look at sampling and\n\n240\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.920\nfrequency diagrams plus people were eating\nthe M&amp;M are getting sick after they touch\n\n241\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.680\nso, frequency diagram.\n\n242\n00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.912\nThis is statistics 101, right?\n\n243\n00:12:56.912 --> 00:13:00.135\nSo, all I'm really doing is I'm\ntaking my frequency diagram and\n\n244\n00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:03.370\nthen making a graphic out of it,\nthat's all I'm doing, right?\n\n245\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.230\nNow, what I'm looking at in this\nhistogram is I'm looking at travel time,\n\n246\n00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.920\nand so if you look at the y,\nif you look at the y axis, and\n\n247\n00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.220\nthe y is always,\nthis is where we just say a third grade,\n\n248\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:23.180\nthe y is this right, so\nyou would remember it's along the side.\n\n249\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.020\nWe're looking at thousands of\npeople per minute intervals.\n\n250\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.970\nAnd then if we were looking at the x axis,\nwhich is along the bottom,\n\n251\n00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.870\nwhat we're looking at is travel time\nper minute, travel time in minutes,\n\n252\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.170\nI should say, right?\n\n253\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.020\nSo how do you see this\nhistogram helping anyone?\n\n254\n00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.440\n&gt;&gt; I can just quickly and\nvisually look at this diagram.\n\n255\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:52.425\nAnd perhaps determine where I can\nreconfigure my itinerary, or something.\n\n256\n00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:53.425\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; To help, yeah,\n\n257\n00:13:53.425 --> 00:13:55.825\njust make that travel\nprocess go a little smoother.\n\n258\n00:13:55.825 --> 00:13:57.155\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n259\n00:13:57.155 --> 00:14:00.235\nAnd on these charts on purpose,\nwe don't have a whole lot of detail,\n\n260\n00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:02.025\ncuz we're trying to make them generic.\n\n261\n00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:06.655\nBut if you were in charge of this type\nof thing, like say you were a train,\n\n262\n00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:09.965\nor airplanes, or something like that,\nyou would know all kinds of things,\n\n263\n00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:11.085\nlike how much staff?\n\n264\n00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:12.560\nWhen's our busy time?\n\n265\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.070\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n266\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.490\nand you could find any kind\nof correlations there.\n\n267\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.800\nAnother question I did wanna ask you\nthough, in the slide before the one we\n\n268\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.190\nwere just looking at,\nthere was a space in between your columns.\n\n269\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.850\nAnd in the second one they\nwere just pushed together.\n\n270\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.270\nIs there a standard,\nthe one with the red, one more forward.\n\n271\n00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.540\nYes, that one right there.\n\n272\n00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.778\nSo there's a gap.\n\n273\n00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:39.110\nIs it basically going to be by the book\nthat those columns have to be touching?\n\n274\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.320\nOr are gaps acceptable?\n\n275\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.860\n&gt;&gt; Gaps are acceptable.\n\n276\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.350\nAnd a lot of it has to do with\nthe graphics program that you're using.\n\n277\n00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.310\nThe cool thing about histograms is\nthat you don't really even need\n\n278\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:50.270\na graphics program.\n\n279\n00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.190\nSo if you're in Excel,\nyou could put red, blue, yellow,\n\n280\n00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.750\norange on the top line on line one.\n\n281\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.870\nAnd underneath that you could go ahead and\njust put your numbers, highlight it,\n\n282\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.070\npress F11 cuz that's your default key,\nand then these are gonna come up.\n\n283\n00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.880\nAnd they'll look,\nthey'll have gaps between them.\n\n284\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.870\nIn some statistical software programs,\n\n285\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.460\nit's just the default is\nthat they're touching.\n\n286\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.720\nBut you can always go into the default and\nchange it.\n\n287\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.950\nBut to answer your question,\n\n288\n00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.990\nit has more to do with what\nthe x-axis is trying to indicate.\n\n289\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.289\nSo if you have thing,\nlet's say you were looking at things\n\n290\n00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:30.898\ntypically that cost $1, $2, $3, $4.\n\n291\n00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:35.781\nSo obviously you're gonna have things\nthat are maybe in the $1.75 or\n\n292\n00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.482\nsomething like that, so\nthat's where on the x-axis,\n\n293\n00:15:39.482 --> 00:15:44.870\nit might be kind of right between\n$1.75 and let's say $1.76 in cents.\n\n294\n00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.740\nSo what you're really looking for\nis that x-axis.\n\n295\n00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.060\nHow does that relate.\n\n296\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.790\nSo you could do it either way.\n\n297\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.481\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n298\n00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:56.499\n&gt;&gt; There is a tendency when\nyou make graphs in Excel for\n\n299\n00:15:56.499 --> 00:16:00.998\nthem to kinda make it prettier for\nyou and easier to read.\n\n300\n00:16:00.998 --> 00:16:02.288\nBut you can change that.\n\n301\n00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.885\nGood question.\n\n302\n00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:09.313\nOkay, so here's a histogram of testing.\n\n303\n00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:14.320\nAnd this is when we're using this\nto do buckets of information.\n\n304\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.780\nBecause remember,\n\n305\n00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.840\nin Lean Six Sigma we're typically\ntracking the history of the event.\n\n306\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.842\nBut this is just an example of how it\nwould look if we used a histogram in\n\n307\n00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:24.467\nthis way.\n\n308\n00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:29.570\nAnd here's kind of just a fun one.\n\n309\n00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.320\nThis is another one of those\nbuckets of information.\n\n310\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.420\nAnd if you'll see\nthe counter participants,\n\n311\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.280\nflavor of ice cream, male versus female,\nbut just having this information if\n\n312\n00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.230\nI really were an ice cream\nshop might be kind of cool.\n\n313\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it doesn't take much time\n\n314\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.120\nto understand what you're\ntrying to convey here.\n\n315\n00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.860\nYou can just look at it,\n\n316\n00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.360\nthe colors are directly relating,\nthat's pretty easy to understand.\n\n317\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.900\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this also goes\nback to the discussion we had in\n\n318\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.679\nthe first session on the seven tools.\n\n319\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.780\nKinda keep in mind,\nif I wanna show this as a presentation,\n\n320\n00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.530\nthis is really pretty, right?\n\n321\n00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.700\nIf I'm just doing it for\n\n322\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.630\nmy critical thinking,\nI wanna just go do it quickly in Excel.\n\n323\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:15.272\nTop line, line one, list whatever\nit is I'm counting, the topics,\n\n324\n00:17:15.272 --> 00:17:20.390\nthe subjects, and in line two,\nthe amounts highlight, press F11.\n\n325\n00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.820\nSo just as a reminder,\nit is kinda quick and dirty.\n\n326\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.870\nIt might not be as pretty\nbecause the default is\n\n327\n00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.700\nnot gonna have all the graphics\nstuff that I can put into it.\n\n328\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.850\nBut if I'm just quickly trying\nto reason through something,\n\n329\n00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.290\nI don't need it to make it look pretty.\n\n330\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.040\nThis is just a reminder that you can also\nuse a histogram to determine distribution.\n\n331\n00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.464\nThis is normal distribution.\n\n332\n00:17:44.464 --> 00:17:48.353\nAnother word for normal distribution is\nthat the process is stable and kinda keep\n\n333\n00:17:48.353 --> 00:17:52.356\nin mind what you're always looking for is\nlike the pretty bell between the upper and\n\n334\n00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:55.700\nlower control, and this histogram\ncan definitely be used for that.\n\n335\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.690\nOkay, so the next one we're\ngonna talk about is Pareto.\n\n336\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:04.020\nNow, whereas a histogram talks\nabout the history of an event,\n\n337\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.530\nthe Pareto chart talks\nabout the type of event.\n\n338\n00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.488\nSo let's say you were getting\na lot of calls here at ITProTV.\n\n339\n00:18:11.488 --> 00:18:13.066\nYou're getting tons of calls.\n\n340\n00:18:13.066 --> 00:18:19.150\nAnd so the person managing the incoming\ncalls say I have a ton of calls, right.\n\n341\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.416\nSo you do a histogram and\n\n342\n00:18:20.416 --> 00:18:25.260\nyou find out on the histogram that most\nof those calls are coming in on Thursday.\n\n343\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.160\nSo your job is to try to fix that problem.\n\n344\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.161\nAnd maybe what they would like you\nto do is to hire an extra person to\n\n345\n00:18:33.161 --> 00:18:34.844\nhandle the calls, right?\n\n346\n00:18:34.844 --> 00:18:38.340\nAnd that might be what you do, but\nyou're looking for other solutions.\n\n347\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.300\nYou do a histogram.\n\n348\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.070\nYou ask them every time a call comes\nin on Monday, do a tick mark, Tuesday,\n\n349\n00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.320\nWednesday, Thursday.\n\n350\n00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.330\nAnd then maybe after three weeks,\nyou average them together, and\n\n351\n00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.990\nyou find out Thursday has the most calls.\n\n352\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.990\nSo what are some other solutions\njust based on a simple histogram?\n\n353\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:59.490\n&gt;&gt; Maybe if you hired someone specifically\nfor Thursday and not a full-time employee.\n\n354\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.240\nHelp relieve that load.\n\n355\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\nthere's one alternative.\n\n356\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.840\nSo they've already offered you one,\nlet's hire someone.\n\n357\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.903\nOne of your solutions is let's\nhire someone on Thursday.\n\n358\n00:19:09.903 --> 00:19:12.410\nAnd then if we wanted\na third solution cuz we only\n\n359\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.922\nhave to come up with three solutions,\nis that maybe on Thursdays,\n\n360\n00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:19.202\nI'll get someone else in\nthe department to help out, right?\n\n361\n00:19:19.202 --> 00:19:22.570\nSo let's say we feel like we have\na good handle on the problem.\n\n362\n00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.810\nWe know it's busy on Thursdays, so\nheck, we've solved the problem.\n\n363\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.922\nBut let's say the person answering\nthe phone says something such as,\n\n364\n00:19:31.922 --> 00:19:34.890\nguess what,\nI have too many calls everyday?\n\n365\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:35.750\nYou are right.\n\n366\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:40.170\nOn Thursdays,\nit's worse than any other day, right?\n\n367\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.006\nSo I might tackle it\nfrom another standpoint.\n\n368\n00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:45.940\nI might say, well, could we get\na handle on the types of calls,\n\n369\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.780\nwhat kinds of calls are you getting?\n\n370\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.354\nSo if you were at\nthe front desk of ITProTV,\n\n371\n00:19:50.354 --> 00:19:52.437\nwhat kind of calls do you guys get?\n\n372\n00:19:52.437 --> 00:19:54.954\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't work\nin customer service, but\n\n373\n00:19:54.954 --> 00:19:57.479\nI have worked in almost\na help desk capacity.\n\n374\n00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:02.783\nAnd you do see a lot of repetitive\ntypes of tickets that would come into\n\n375\n00:20:02.783 --> 00:20:08.271\na help desk, things like, I forgot\nmy password, you need to reset it,\n\n376\n00:20:08.271 --> 00:20:13.050\nor I've run out of disk space\non my system, things like that.\n\n377\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n378\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:19.837\nAnd if I were at the front of ITProTV, I\nmight just get, let's just say for example\n\n379\n00:20:19.837 --> 00:20:24.140\npurposes, a lot of calls on directions\nbecause you have a new location, right?\n\n380\n00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.803\nSo I might get a bunch of those calls.\n\n381\n00:20:25.803 --> 00:20:27.974\nSo let's say I get all of\nthese different calls.\n\n382\n00:20:27.974 --> 00:20:29.493\nI get a lot of calls for IT and\n\n383\n00:20:29.493 --> 00:20:33.760\nI get a lot of IT questions cuz I'm\nthe first person answering the phone.\n\n384\n00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.880\nSo I'm gonna have to transfer you.\n\n385\n00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.010\nSo another thing is that\nI get a lot of calls for\n\n386\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.650\nIT and I have to transfer you,\nget a lot of calls for directions, right?\n\n387\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.970\nWell, now I have a piece of\nthe puzzle that I didn't have before.\n\n388\n00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.030\nSo now that I know, and\njust for this example,\n\n389\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.450\nwe're gonna say I get just\na ton of calls for location.\n\n390\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.337\nSo one of the things I could do is what?\n\n391\n00:20:53.337 --> 00:20:56.473\nMaybe-\n&gt;&gt; Have an automated prompt and say,\n\n392\n00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:58.410\npress two for directions.\n\n393\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that, yeah.\n\n394\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.437\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nbecause I want three solutions,\n\n395\n00:21:02.437 --> 00:21:07.100\nso my second solution might be I give\nbetter directions on the website, right?\n\n396\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.439\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, the cool thing, and\n\n397\n00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:10.185\nthis is what I love about Lean Six Sigma.\n\n398\n00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:13.342\nThey say give three solutions,\nbut if number one and\n\n399\n00:21:13.342 --> 00:21:18.400\nnumber two are not mutually exclusive,\nmy third solution is, I'm gonna do both.\n\n400\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.002\nSo I won.\nIt almost feels like cheating, right?\n\n401\n00:21:21.002 --> 00:21:23.330\n&gt;&gt; But also don't forget,\nyou had the other option, right,\n\n402\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.780\nof not doing anything else.\n\n403\n00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.248\nSo technically,\nyou're giving them a report.\n\n404\n00:21:26.248 --> 00:21:28.572\n&gt;&gt; You are, and we can always add that.\n\n405\n00:21:28.572 --> 00:21:32.438\nAnd I think that's such a big deal, is\nthat we often forget one of our solutions\n\n406\n00:21:32.438 --> 00:21:35.510\nis, you know what,\nmaybe we need to leave it alone.\n\n407\n00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:42.540\nAbsolutely, so the types of\nquestions that I see most frequently\n\n408\n00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.210\non exams, now keep in mind,\nat SSD Global Solution,\n\n409\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.200\nwe have a bank of 1,500 questions,\nand you're gonna get 200 of them.\n\n410\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.050\nSo it's hard to just study\nevery single question.\n\n411\n00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.570\nBut the ones that I see most often through\nmy own company and through other companies\n\n412\n00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.540\nis a lot of comparisons between what's\nthe difference between a Pareto chart and\n\n413\n00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.510\na histogram.\n\n414\n00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.940\nAnd we already know before we look at\nPareto charts, the biggest difference\n\n415\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.807\nis that the histogram typically\ntracks the history of events,\n\n416\n00:22:12.807 --> 00:22:17.050\nwhereas the Pareto chart\ntracks the types of events.\n\n417\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.670\nAnd then the only other extra thing we\nhave to remember is that histograms\n\n418\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.910\ncan be used for other things.\n\n419\n00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.850\nI can use it to collect buckets of\ninformation, which in statistics,\n\n420\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.070\nare called bins of information.\n\n421\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.318\nI can use it to look at\ndistribution models.\n\n422\n00:22:31.318 --> 00:22:34.932\nSo whereas histograms have\nsome other applications,\n\n423\n00:22:34.932 --> 00:22:38.000\nPareto charts are pretty\nmuch Pareto charts.\n\n424\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.954\nSo a Pareto chart is gonna track\nthe type of the event, and\n\n425\n00:22:42.954 --> 00:22:45.750\nhere is just sort of an example.\n\n426\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.094\nI'll let you look at that.\n\n427\n00:22:48.094 --> 00:22:52.296\n&gt;&gt; And the name of these types of charts\nactually has a really cool back story,\n\n428\n00:22:52.296 --> 00:22:53.640\nif you wouldn't mind.\n\n429\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.681\nI remember in our class you did\ngive a bit of a back story.\n\n430\n00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:56.812\nI thought it was interesting.\n\n431\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.820\n&gt;&gt; It was designed by Villo,\nI can never remember.\n\n432\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.430\n&gt;&gt; Vilfredo?\n\n433\n00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Vilfredo Pareto.\n\n434\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.769\n&gt;&gt; Or Wilfredo, it's something like that.\n\n435\n00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:10.288\n&gt;&gt; Right, Pareto, and remember again,\na lot of times in Lean,\n\n436\n00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:12.940\nthey use the person who\npopularized the tool.\n\n437\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.722\nAnd the reason why he's so\npopular or why this is so\n\n438\n00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:17.985\npopular is that whole 80/20 rule.\n\n439\n00:23:17.985 --> 00:23:18.501\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n440\n00:23:18.501 --> 00:23:21.720\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe 80/20 rule says we should be focusing.\n\n441\n00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.910\nWe should laser focus.\n\n442\n00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.740\nSo this Pareto chart kind\n\n443\n00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.980\nwas birthed out of the whole concept\nof let's focus on the important 80%.\n\n444\n00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it was something that\nwas developed a long time ago.\n\n445\n00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:33.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I think, what was it?\n\n446\n00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:37.709\nHe had seen 80% of\nthe citizens in his village or\n\n447\n00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:41.523\n20% of the citizens owned 80% of the land.\n\n448\n00:23:41.523 --> 00:23:44.136\nBut even every day,\nthis rule still applies, so\n\n449\n00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:46.254\nthat's why it's such a cool concept.\n\n450\n00:23:46.254 --> 00:23:47.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, too.\n\n451\n00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:53.909\nOne of the other things that you\nwanna remember about Pareto charts is\n\n452\n00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:57.044\nthat in a histogram, because I'm\ntracking the history of events,\n\n453\n00:23:57.044 --> 00:24:00.361\nI really do wanna know what happened\non Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\n454\n00:24:00.361 --> 00:24:02.488\nI wanna know what happened\nin plant one plant two.\n\n455\n00:24:02.488 --> 00:24:04.520\nLibrary one library two.\n\n456\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.370\nDifferent groceries stores, right.\n\n457\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.610\nI want to know that in\norder of a time sequence.\n\n458\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.620\nIn a Pareto chart, I'm going to put my my\nbiggest thing first, and then go down.\n\n459\n00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n460\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.290\nwhat ever I collect the most\ninformation on, and\n\n461\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.320\nour example was we were getting the most\ncalls on where are you located.\n\n462\n00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.010\nSo that would represent that-\n&gt;&gt; Lower hanging fruit, I guess.\n\n463\n00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nExactly.\n\n464\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.090\nAnd so we wanna arrange\nthese kind of sequentially.\n\n465\n00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.230\nLike what's the most?\n\n466\n00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.410\nWhat's the second?\n\n467\n00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.720\nNow there's a general thing in statistics\nthat some of you may have already\n\n468\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.300\nbeen aware of,\nthat the examples are pretty dismal.\n\n469\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.522\nFor example, if they're trying to explain\nsomething like probability theory, they'll\n\n470\n00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:53.219\nsay something like the rabid dog bit\nperson A, but didn't bite person B, right?\n\n471\n00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:56.205\nAnd what are the likelihood\nof person B getting rabies?\n\n472\n00:24:56.205 --> 00:25:02.500\nOr they love using cancer examples,\nlike false positives and false negatives.\n\n473\n00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.540\nSo what I want you to keep in mind is\nthat even though most statistic books\n\n474\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.320\nare packaged in that way, this bar could\nrepresent your biggest opportunity too.\n\n475\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.238\nSo if you were looking at what\nsells in my store, right, And\n\n476\n00:25:16.238 --> 00:25:20.700\nthere's one that sells over the other\nitems, well, that's an opportunity, right?\n\n477\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.590\n&gt;&gt; We want a way to identify that.\n\n478\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nSo\n\n479\n00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.340\nit doesn't always have to\nbe your biggest problem,\n\n480\n00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.759\nbut that's pretty much the way\nit's packaged on your exams.\n\n481\n00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.040\nIf you where trying to find your biggest\nproblem, what chart would you use?\n\n482\n00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.710\nAnd you would say Pareto chart, right?\n\n483\n00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.740\nBut I just wanted everyone to know\nthat it does not have to be a problem,\n\n484\n00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.980\nit can be something positive.\n\n485\n00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.970\n&gt;&gt; But if you think about it, if\neverything is going great within a company\n\n486\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.990\nor organization, they might not see\na need to hire an external professional.\n\n487\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:49.740\nBut when things start to get rough,\nthen they look for help right so.\n\n488\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, perfect example.\n\n489\n00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.590\nOkay, so on this one,\nwe're looking at causes of poor quality\n\n490\n00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.260\non this particular slide that\nyou're looking at right now.\n\n491\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.119\nAnd you'll see it's saying\nthe biggest problem is what?\n\n492\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.430\n&gt;&gt; Your poor design.\n\n493\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.640\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nthe idea is if I tackle that poor design,\n\n494\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.530\nI've set aside a lot of the issues.\n\n495\n00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.610\nSo on some Pareto charts what happens is\nif you'll notice there at the bottom,\n\n496\n00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.170\nthey'll put a line to kind of\nhelp you make that decision.\n\n497\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:23.249\nSo in this particular example,\n\n498\n00:26:23.249 --> 00:26:28.408\nthat first line if you looked all the way\nacross it, starts at the top of the bar,\n\n499\n00:26:28.408 --> 00:26:32.490\nand I don't know if you can see\nthe little number one on the bar.\n\n500\n00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:37.960\nBut it starts at the top, and if I we're\nto just go in a lateral way across,\n\n501\n00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.440\nit would say that if I\ntook care of problem A,\n\n502\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.120\nI would probably solve about what,\nmaybe 50, 52% of my problems.\n\n503\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n504\n00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.260\n&gt;&gt; And so, we're gonna look at something\nthat makes it make a little bit\n\n505\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.130\nmore sense.\n\n506\n00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.880\nSo, here again, if I looked at the top\nthat first blue bar on the left\n\n507\n00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.010\nall the way across,\nI would have percentages.\n\n508\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.930\nI don't have them written in right now,\nbut if I had a percentage,\n\n509\n00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.130\nthen I could say to you,\nI know that if we solved this problem,\n\n510\n00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.740\nwe would solve\n&gt;&gt; We would only be left with this\n\n511\n00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.870\npercentage of issues.\n\n512\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.180\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n513\n00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.840\nSo let's put the percentages in now.\n\n514\n00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n515\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.580\n&gt;&gt; It makes it even more easier.\n\n516\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.300\nI just kind of want to lead you up to\nyou're gonna have to come up with that\n\n517\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.140\nOn the other side.\n\n518\n00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.590\nSo, in this case,\nwe're looking at just problems,\n\n519\n00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:28.370\nand this looks like problems\nin an IT department.\n\n520\n00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.270\nLooks like it to me.\n\n521\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.418\nAnd the first one is-\n&gt;&gt; Sorry,\n\n522\n00:27:30.418 --> 00:27:32.840\nI'm trying to like squint here,\nI'm like, what does that say?\n\n523\n00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.492\n&gt;&gt; So it says, unable to download.\n\n524\n00:27:34.492 --> 00:27:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n525\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:41.340\n&gt;&gt; So that's my problem, and you'll see\nthat my little dot is right in that bar.\n\n526\n00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.992\nSo, if I looked across.\n\n527\n00:27:42.992 --> 00:27:44.100\n&gt;&gt; Almost [INAUDIBLE].\n\n528\n00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd that's huge, because if I go in and\n\n529\n00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:53.480\nI tell you, If we take care of this one\nthing, look at how far ahead we are.\n\n530\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.140\nNow, some people have to look at this.\n\n531\n00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.390\nHere's unsatisfactory customer service.\n\n532\n00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.330\nSo, I get a lot of questions, like,\ndoes it matter where we put this stuff?\n\n533\n00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:06.280\nYou wanna put it wherever it makes sense,\nas long as the largest bar is first, and\n\n534\n00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.410\nthen it goes down.\n\n535\n00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.970\nNow, if you get a flat, little tiny skinny\nbar, then what you're gonna, probably,\n\n536\n00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.590\ndo is discount that.\n\n537\n00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.730\nAnd, if you're in a statistical program\nthat's making your Pareto chart,\n\n538\n00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.750\nit's gonna ask you, do you want us\nto get rid of the one off bars?\n\n539\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.670\nNow if you're doing this in Excel,\nremember in Excel, that the way we build\n\n540\n00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:32.840\na histogram, a quick and dirty histogram,\nis that on line one, we put the topics.\n\n541\n00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.650\nOn line two, we put the numerical\ninformation that we gathered.\n\n542\n00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.550\nHighlight, press F11.\n\n543\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.190\nWell, Pareto chart's pretty\nmuch the same thing.\n\n544\n00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.280\nAnd the only thing that's different is\nthat you're gonna have to manually move\n\n545\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.200\nthose columns around before you hit F11,\nbecause you want to make sure.\n\n546\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.915\nYou might be collecting the information,\nand the things in column 5-\n\n547\n00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:54.765\n&gt;&gt; But, they are in the descending order.\n\n548\n00:28:54.765 --> 00:28:57.855\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so that's the only thing you\nare doing is that you are manually moving\n\n549\n00:28:57.855 --> 00:28:58.955\nthose things around.\n\n550\n00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:02.025\nSo sometimes you really don't need\na statistical package to build something\n\n551\n00:29:02.025 --> 00:29:06.085\nlike this, and especially if it's just\nsomething that you are using for yourself,\n\n552\n00:29:06.085 --> 00:29:08.125\na paper and pencil tool.\n\n553\n00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:09.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so.\n\n554\n00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:12.850\nHere's just another example.\n\n555\n00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.250\nI think we're about to wrap\nup on our histograms and\n\n556\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.470\nPareto charts, but\nhere's just another example.\n\n557\n00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.531\nIt says Pareto chart of late\narrivals by reported cause, right?\n\n558\n00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:31.280\nAnd the next one we're gonna be\ndiscussing in session, in part three.\n\n559\n00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:31.800\n&gt;&gt; Part three.\n\n560\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.110\nI think we made it to part three.\n\n561\n00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.070\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n&gt;&gt; We have what left?\n\n562\n00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.960\nWe have scattered diagrams and\ncontrol charts.\n\n563\n00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.000\nAnd there's really a lot of information\nthat we don't want to short change you on.\n\n564\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.050\nSo let's just go ahead and\nwrap up for this particular episode.\n\n565\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.800\nBut we do have these other topics and\ntools to cover.\n\n566\n00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.110\nSo please don't go anywhere.\n\n567\n00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.680\nStay tuned.\n\n568\n00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.510\nWe have a lot more headed your way.\n\n569\n00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.630\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n570\n00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:57.240\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Tara Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n571\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.099\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next\ntime here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n572\n00:30:00.858 --> 00:30:06.702\n[MUSIC]\n\n573\n00:30:06.702 --> 00:30:10.040\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.120\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.790\nThis is actually a part three,\n\n7\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.180\nwe made it all the way to a part\nthree of our seven quality tools.\n\n8\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.220\nHere we have Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern\nin studios to go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.820\nwrap up those last couple of\ntools that we had lingering.\n\n10\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.993\nThank you for being with us today.\n\n11\n00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.490\nAnd I think, I'd like to just remind\npeople, if we can go to my slide deck.\n\n13\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.570\nThat there are a number of the tools\nthat we have already covered.\n\n14\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.360\nSo the ones that are in red,\nwe've actually talked about.\n\n15\n00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.576\nAnd just briefly as we move into those\nlast two tools I just want to do kind of\n\n16\n00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:57.122\na quick synopsis of those tools\nthat we've already covered.\n\n17\n00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:57.659\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n18\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.114\nThe first one of course was\nthe Fishbone Diagram and\n\n19\n00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:07.369\nthis is just an example of what that would\nlook like and this is using that 6M's.\n\n20\n00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.641\nWe said in the other session that\nyou could also use the 3P's or\n\n21\n00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:17.270\nyou could just use whatever you wanted for\nthose major contributors.\n\n22\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.180\nAnd then we looked at flowcharts and\nwe said that really,\n\n23\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.580\nthe big thing about flowcharting.\n\n24\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.750\nWhich a lot of times in Lean Six Sigma,\nmeans we're doing a process map.\n\n25\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.780\nThat is if we stick to these symbols and\nwe memorize these symbols.\n\n26\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.003\nWe're pretty okay on any test.\n\n27\n00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.841\nThen we talked a little\nbit about histogram.\n\n28\n00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.956\nAnd one of the things that I wanted to\nremind you of is the frequency diagram.\n\n29\n00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:40.867\nIf you are taking the Six Sigma test,\n\n30\n00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.060\nthere's questions related\nto frequency diagrams.\n\n31\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.970\nIf you kinda cycled back to,\nit's really a simple concept.\n\n32\n00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.570\nIt's just a lot of times frequency\ndiagrams have a lot of huge numbers and so\n\n33\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.010\nit seems kind of complicated.\n\n34\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.700\nBut all I'm trying to do is say,\nhow often does blue show up, right?\n\n35\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320\nSo I think if you kind of concentrate\non that in the lean six sigma exams and\n\n36\n00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.820\ncertainly the ones through SSD Global.\n\n37\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.750\nWhat we're wanting you to know is that\na histogram typically, in lean six sigma,\n\n38\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.070\nis used to track the history of events.\n\n39\n00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.217\nAnd here's an example of that,\nthat we saw on one of the other sessions.\n\n40\n00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.205\nAnd then we went on to Pareto Charts and\n\n41\n00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:23.423\nwe said there are a lot of questions on\nthe exam that on all of it, all exams.\n\n42\n00:02:23.423 --> 00:02:27.615\nLeaning Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma about\nthe differences between Pareto Charts and\n\n43\n00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:28.274\nHistogram.\n\n44\n00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:31.450\nSo you're gonna at least probably see\none or two of those kind of questions.\n\n45\n00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.430\nAnd we said that a Pareto chart basically\ntracks the type of events, right?\n\n46\n00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.190\nAs opposed to the history of those events.\n\n47\n00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.012\nWe did also talk about check sheets.\n\n48\n00:02:41.012 --> 00:02:43.067\nEven though I didn't show you.\n\n49\n00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:43.994\n&gt;&gt; It's a to do list [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:45.000\n&gt;&gt; A to do list, right.\n\n51\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.019\nSo we talked about that.\n\n52\n00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.691\nAnd then when we left up when we finished\nin our previous session we were just about\n\n53\n00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.627\nto talk about scatter diagrams.\n\n54\n00:02:55.994 --> 00:03:00.949\nSo the first thing I want you to know\nabout scatter diagrams is that a lot of\n\n55\n00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.148\npeople, when they do the seven tools\nof quality, instead of saying scatter\n\n56\n00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:11.690\ndiagram, they'll say a correlation\nanalysis or a correlation chart.\n\n57\n00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.744\nHowever scatter diagrams can be used for\na number of different things.\n\n58\n00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:20.222\nNow again in lean six sigma I'm\nmostly using it for correlation.\n\n59\n00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:26.463\nNow a lot of you from stat 101 remember\nthat correlation and causation.\n\n60\n00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:31.337\nCorrelation doesn't necessarily mean\ncausation they make you memorize\n\n61\n00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:36.790\nthat backwards and forwards, In Six Sigma,\nthat's correct, and in Lean.\n\n62\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.620\nIn Lean Six Sigma it's really not so\n\n63\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.940\nmuch the correlation that we're\nlooking for, is the triggers.\n\n64\n00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.910\nSo we're almost saying,\ncorrelation is kind of causation,\n\n65\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.300\neven though technically that's\nnot correct in statistical terms.\n\n66\n00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.624\nSo if you look at the patterns,\nthe one that I see most often when I do\n\n67\n00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:59.426\na correlation study or an analysis is\nthat when this says no correlation.\n\n68\n00:03:59.426 --> 00:04:03.173\nAnd I'm always so excited if I\nsee the data points moving up or\n\n69\n00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.935\ndown that demonstrates positive or\nnegative correlation.\n\n70\n00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:12.304\nSo an example of that, a popular example\nI use is that let's say the boss\n\n71\n00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:17.062\nsays every time it rains or\nsnows people are late to work I mean.\n\n72\n00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:20.530\nAnd so you do a correlation study, and you\nsit there and you use your check sheet.\n\n73\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.260\nYou just start watching,\nrainy day, who's late, right?\n\n74\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.720\nAnd then you put it together\nin a correlation diagram, and\n\n75\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.300\nmaybe you come up with no correlation.\n\n76\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.500\nIt's that there's a perceived correlation.\n\n77\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.750\nSo one way that you would be using\ncorrelation diagrams in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n78\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.460\nis kind of a funny way\nto disprove something.\n\n79\n00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.020\nSo if you have a solution,\nand the person says,\n\n80\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.080\nwell, every single time we do that,\nthis happens.\n\n81\n00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.637\nYou might do a correlation analysis,\nand find out.\n\n82\n00:04:48.637 --> 00:04:49.376\n&gt;&gt; To verify of that's true.\n\n83\n00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n84\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.750\nAnd there's one tip that we\nalways use in Lean Six Sigma,\n\n85\n00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.900\nif the data that you have to\ndeliver in the chart is negative,\n\n86\n00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.570\nor contradictory to what\nyour boss is saying.\n\n87\n00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.450\nSo, it's either negative data or\nyour boss is wrong.\n\n88\n00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.600\nYou wanna make sure that you\nput the data on the screen and\n\n89\n00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.015\nthen, step away from the data and\nsay the data reflex, as oppose.\n\n90\n00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:14.875\nBecause it really is still\nas Lean Six Sigma person,\n\n91\n00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:18.255\nyou're doing a lot of problem solving and\nit really is easy for\n\n92\n00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.184\npeople to get into that kill\nthe messenger syndrome.\n\n93\n00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:24.996\n&gt;&gt; Right, you're not trying to point\nthe blame on anyone, you just wanna convey\n\n94\n00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:27.968\nthat message or letting the data\nconvey the message for you.\n\n95\n00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:30.510\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n96\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.400\nSo you'll see that, back to the diagram,\n\n97\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.580\nyou'll see that positive correlation\nthe data points are moving up.\n\n98\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.990\nNow in the set, look at the very\nfirst one on the left-hand side.\n\n99\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.154\nNow, if you look at the second one,\nthe data points are moving together, but\n\n100\n00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:49.579\nthey're not real tight.\n\n101\n00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:50.836\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so\n\n102\n00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:53.480\nthere could be positive correlation.\n\n103\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.240\nNow, in the Six Sigma exams,\n\n104\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.880\nkeep in mind that they're going to want\nto know the formulas behind these graphs.\n\n105\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.610\nWe've build these graphs in Excel,\n\n106\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.840\nand all the statistical data is just\nbeing prepared in the background for us.\n\n107\n00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.850\nWe don't see it.\n\n108\n00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.720\nOn the Six Sigma exams you wanna be aware\nof the numbers involved with correlation.\n\n109\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.620\nSo correlation has a schedule similar to\nthe Sigma schedule and the CPK schedule.\n\n110\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.081\nAnd I'll remind you on the Sigma\nschedule there's six Sigmas, so\n\n111\n00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:29.540\none through six, so there's no seven.\n\n112\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.205\nOn the CPK schedule,\nthe number index is one to two.\n\n113\n00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:38.564\nSo on six sigma you're not going to have a\nzero, you're not going to have a 6.5, you\n\n114\n00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:43.030\ncan only have a number one to six, you're\nnot going to have any negative numbers.\n\n115\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.476\nOkay on the CPK scale you\nhave a number one to two.\n\n116\n00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:52.720\nSo CPK is gonna fall somewhere 1.1,\n1.2, all.\n\n117\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.590\nIt can't get any higher than two or\nany lower than one.\n\n118\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.860\nOn a correlation schedule, what I'm\nlooking at is if my correlation is a 0.8.\n\n119\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.190\nOr higher that indicates\npositive correlations.\n\n120\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.415\nAnd that's because on the correlation\nscale the index is plus one,\n\n121\n00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:16.880\nis minus one, through plus one, okay.\n\n122\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.600\nSo, those are the kinda things in the six\nsigma world that you wanna be just\n\n123\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.310\ncognizant of.\n\n124\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.720\nThat's gonna be in your student package\nif you're studying for those exams.\n\n125\n00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.010\nWe are so used to, like I said,\npunching some buttons and\n\n126\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.240\ngetting the scattered diagram.\n\n127\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.450\nBut they're really is some math and\nscience behind that.\n\n128\n00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.290\nNow, here's just another\nkind of fun example.\n\n129\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.540\nI think it's a little easier to read.\n\n130\n00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.520\nSo you're gonna have your Y-axis,\nand your X-axis, and\n\n131\n00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.620\nthen you're gonna have your\ndegrees of correlation.\n\n132\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.830\nThe tighter they are together,\nthe more they are positive or negative.\n\n133\n00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.348\nSo you're looking for that tightness.\n\n134\n00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:57.893\nNow, when we're looking\nat correlation analysis,\n\n135\n00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:02.946\nwe're looking at how the Y And\nthe xs relate to one another.\n\n136\n00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:06.556\nWhen we're looking at\na regression analysis,\n\n137\n00:08:06.556 --> 00:08:12.370\nwe're looking at how does the inputs,\nwhich are the xs, impact the ys.\n\n138\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.510\nThat's the difference.\n\n139\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.435\nSo we can use that for our thing as well.\n\n140\n00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:22.361\nOkay, so on a scatter diagram,\nnow this scatter diagram is collecting\n\n141\n00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:26.950\ninformation about water consumption\nbased on the temperature.\n\n142\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.340\nAnd what does this one indicate?\n\n143\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, the higher the temperature,\nthe more the consumption.\n\n144\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.020\nLet's see here, on the left hand side,\nwhat are we reflecting by?\n\n145\n00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.530\nOunces.\n\n146\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.880\nOkay, so\n[LAUGH] I feel like turning my head here.\n\n147\n00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.580\nSo, almost 50 ounces as the temperatures\nare topping 100 degrees.\n\n148\n00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and the thing is, is that\nwhat I want everyone to kind of remember,\n\n149\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.990\nis that it's nothing more than this.\n\n150\n00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.000\nAgain, some of these tools\ncan be overcomplicated.\n\n151\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.920\nOn a scatter diagram, it's just that you\nhave a ton more information than this,\n\n152\n00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.700\nbut all you're really doing is trying\nto see when the temperature goes up,\n\n153\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.290\ndo we consume more water.\n\n154\n00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.070\nNow, that could be one\nof those assumptions.\n\n155\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.290\nI could have done this study and found\nout that there was no correlation, right?\n\n156\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.630\nBut if I'm running a soup kitchen and\nI need to know,\n\n157\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.000\ndo I make more soup on snowy days?\n\n158\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.780\nI might assume that, wow, more people are\ngonna eat chili and soup on cold days, but\n\n159\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.671\nI do my correlation study and\nI find out that I'm wrong, right?\n\n160\n00:09:30.782 --> 00:09:34.950\nSo, here's another one I just wanna\ngive you a chance to look at it.\n\n161\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.050\nThis is-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.390\n&gt;&gt; Marks in general,\n\n163\n00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.026\nI'm turning my head, too.\n\n164\n00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:40.930\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] too, yeah!\n[LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.548\n&gt;&gt; Marks in general knowledge test and IQ.\n\n166\n00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:49.557\nSo a general knowledge test is\na separate test than an IQ test.\n\n167\n00:09:49.557 --> 00:09:54.575\nAnd I have had several students tell\nthat me they were taking an IQ test and\n\n168\n00:09:54.575 --> 00:09:56.972\ntheir IQs are like off the charts.\n\n169\n00:09:56.972 --> 00:10:01.407\nSo, I would take like maybe, because\nI think it is possible that all of my\n\n170\n00:10:01.407 --> 00:10:06.141\nstudents are incredibly brilliant but\nthere's one test everyone comes back\n\n171\n00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:09.737\nlike is 160 or\nsomething you don't wanna look around.\n\n172\n00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:14.261\nBut general knowledge and IQ,\nit's looking at do they relate and\n\n173\n00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:19.210\nwhat does the chart indicate that\nthere is some positive correlation.\n\n174\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.100\nNow is, if all of these x's were really,\n\n175\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.300\nreally tight then it would say\nthat they're definitely is.\n\n176\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.090\nAlthough still a theory because remember\neven though the charts are as positive\n\n177\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:36.080\ncorrelation, it doesn't necessarily 100%\nmean that there's positive correlation.\n\n178\n00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.346\nIt just means that\nthere's a good chance and\n\n179\n00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:41.480\nthat's another thing that we\nneed to bring up about charts.\n\n180\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.380\nIn 6 sigma and in lean, there's\na tendency to go by what the chart says.\n\n181\n00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.760\nHowever, in Lean Six Sigma, we say\nit's the chart, and some other things.\n\n182\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.030\nThe chart is certainly the basis,\nthe data and\n\n183\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.135\nthe stuff that we collect, that certainly\nthe most important thing about the chart.\n\n184\n00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:01.590\nBut we might know some extra\nthings about the chart.\n\n185\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Right and like you had said before\nusing a bit of that human intuition it's\n\n186\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.290\nkind of ironic that you\nuse a knowledge test for\n\n187\n00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:12.770\nyour chart because on a lot of those IQ\ntests they have you identify patterns and\n\n188\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.210\nhere you're using that data to\nidentify a particular pattern.\n\n189\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\nSo here's just another example\n\n190\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.690\nof a Scatter Diagram and this one, the\nreason why I'm showing you this is that,\n\n191\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.540\nI could have looked at this information\nand put it on a different chart.\n\n192\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.410\nIn this case,\nI put it on a Scatter Diagram but\n\n193\n00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.790\nI could have also put this\ninformation on the histogram.\n\n194\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:43.990\nBecause what this is indicating is\nthe history of the eruptions, right?\n\n195\n00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.650\nI just chose to put it\non a scatter diagram.\n\n196\n00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.560\nNow how do you know?\n\n197\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.800\nI think, again, keeping in mind that\nif you're just doing it for yourself,\n\n198\n00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.860\nit doesn't really make any difference.\n\n199\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.400\nIf you're doing it for an audience, for\npart of your presentation, a lot of times\n\n200\n00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.680\nwhat I do is I go ahead and put the graph\ntogether and I go ask other people,\n\n201\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.400\ndoes this graph make more sense to you or\ndoes this one make more sense?\n\n202\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.030\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n203\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but so there's a lot of things\nthat you can put on one graph and\n\n204\n00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.380\nit doesn't really portray the stuff\nthat you're trying to tell.\n\n205\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.400\nSo you just put it on a different graph.\n\n206\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.490\nAnd this is an example of that.\n\n207\n00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.310\nOkay, so the next thing that we're gonna\ntalk about is actually control charts.\n\n208\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.850\nBut I'm gonna start sort of what I\nthink of as the control chart family.\n\n209\n00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.470\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n210\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.100\n&gt;&gt; So in the control chart family,\n\n211\n00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.280\nkeeping in mind all of these\ncould be used independently.\n\n212\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.160\nI could actually use a line chart and\nnever grow up to be a control chart.\n\n213\n00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.970\nI could just be a line chart.\n\n214\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.350\nAnd in the line chart you'll notice\nit talks about stock value, right?\n\n215\n00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.310\nIf I saw a line chart that said stock\nvalue and my stock was looking like this,\n\n216\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.680\nwould I be pretty happy?\n\n217\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.160\n&gt;&gt; I would be, wait what are the years?\n\n218\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.090\nYeah, it's the top on [LAUGH] It looks\nlike if it's going in that order.\n\n219\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it looks like it's\npretty positive picture.\n\n220\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I don't really have a lot of\n\n221\n00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.120\ninformation and that's what's so\ncool about a line chart.\n\n222\n00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.320\nWhen I'm doing a line chart,\nit could just be an anomaly or\n\n223\n00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.580\nsomething that I've noticed or\nsomething like, you know what?\n\n224\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.930\nI'm gonna start keeping track of that.\n\n225\n00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's a great way to also\nidentify trends, you could prepare for\n\n226\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.890\nthem and not be sideswiped.\n\n227\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so\nline charts are just super simple.\n\n228\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.350\nI figure out what I wanna put\non my y-axis, on my x-axis.\n\n229\n00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.220\nI could be tracking\nsomething as simple as,\n\n230\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.572\nhow many times is someone\nlate to work again right?\n\n231\n00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:27.551\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Don't tell me.\n\n232\n00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:30.511\n&gt;&gt; Okay and there's like I can\ndo something simple like that.\n\n233\n00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.897\nIt's just a condition, I don't necessarily\nneed to know all of the pieces,\n\n234\n00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.241\nI just think I'd like to\ncollect this information and\n\n235\n00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:40.600\nsometimes I stop right there, sometimes\nthe information isn't even interesting\n\n236\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.910\n&gt;&gt; So on the other one,\n\n237\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.190\non the right hand side,\nnow I'm checking my mistakes.\n\n238\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.522\nI'm not even telling you what my mistakes\nare but am I happy with this picture?\n\n239\n00:13:49.522 --> 00:13:50.414\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH].\n\n240\n00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:54.690\n&gt;&gt; I am not happy with this picture cuz\nit looks like my mistakes are increasing.\n\n241\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.188\nIncreasing, right?\n\n242\n00:13:56.188 --> 00:13:59.280\nSo sometimes just a simple line chart\nwill give you everything that you need.\n\n243\n00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.690\nSo the next chart in the family,\n\n244\n00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.435\nwell actually here's an example\nwith some data put to it, right?\n\n245\n00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:09.688\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is average time in\n\n246\n00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:10.680\nthe waiting room.\n\n247\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.195\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the only one who has to wait.\n\n248\n00:14:12.195 --> 00:14:14.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah exactly, so.\n\n249\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.720\nSo, this is just an example\nfilled in a little bit more.\n\n250\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.667\nIn that previous example,\nI just wanted you to know,\n\n251\n00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:25.510\nyou don't really even have to have your\ny and x-axis completely thought out yet.\n\n252\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.410\nIf you're just gonna start\ncollecting information.\n\n253\n00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.895\nBut, and this is all I needed to know.\n\n254\n00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:34.640\nIf I were the hospital administrator, for\nexample, this might be a myth of a picture\n\n255\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.410\nI don't, if I'm trying to give\nyou snapshot of what's happening.\n\n256\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.600\n&gt;&gt; So, looking at the weeks there,\nlooking at 15 weeks,\n\n257\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.980\nwould I have a more accurate\noutput if I had sample for longer,\n\n258\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.190\nmaybe an entire year, per se, or\nmaybe quarterly, or whatever?\n\n259\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.580\n&gt;&gt; Excellent question, Cherokee,\n\n260\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.110\nbecause the deal is,\nis that range is very important.\n\n261\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.180\nAnd the range or\nthe timeline that I'm looking at,\n\n262\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.910\nwhen you're looking at histograms, parados\ncharts, any of those types of things.\n\n263\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.550\nAbsolutely.\n\n264\n00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.300\nAnd sometimes the process is\ngonna straighten itself out\n\n265\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.200\nafter a period of time.\n\n266\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.630\nAnd sometimes maybe that period that you\nwere looking at there were some special\n\n267\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.880\nconditions, like in this example\nmaybe the weeks where they're waiting\n\n268\n00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.630\nlonger period of minutes could have\nbeen a holiday week or something, right?\n\n269\n00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.180\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And so all of that stuff is very,\n\n270\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.750\nvery important.\n\n271\n00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.490\nSo the next step or the next\n\n272\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.930\nthing that I call in the control chart\nfamily is something called a Run Chart.\n\n273\n00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.770\nNow, a Run Chart takes all\nthe information from a line chart, and\n\n274\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.850\ndivides it by the number of data\npoints to get that middle line.\n\n275\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.980\nSo let's go back to our other example.\n\n276\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.060\nAverage Time in the waiting room.\n\n277\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.594\nIf I took each one of those data points,\nand I added them up,\n\n278\n00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:53.279\nthen I divided by the number of data\npoints, that would give me my middle line.\n\n279\n00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.637\nNow what I wanna do is,\n\n280\n00:15:54.637 --> 00:15:58.864\nI wanna track those individual data\npoints against that middle line.\n\n281\n00:15:58.864 --> 00:16:04.600\nBecause now what I'm looking for is, I'm\nlooking for how far away From the average.\n\n282\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.131\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, from the average, and\n\n283\n00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.626\na lot of times when they're talking\nabout standard deviation, and\n\n284\n00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:13.810\nit's not quite there, but a lot of times\nthey'll say an average of the average.\n\n285\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.570\nSo, in standard deviation,\n\n286\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.180\nwhat I'm trying to do is on an average how\nfar these data points from the middle.\n\n287\n00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.650\nAnd remember, in Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma\nand Lean, the middle is a really,\n\n288\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.510\nreally big deal, because a lot of times\nwe're saying the middle is the standard.\n\n289\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.740\nSo how far away?\n\n290\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.990\nNow, the only thing that we have to be\ncareful about run charts is most of\n\n291\n00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:38.310\nthe time, that middle line is an average,\nbut sometimes it could be a median.\n\n292\n00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.780\nThat's kind of up to you.\n\n293\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.667\nAnd those of you that are subscribers\nto the Wall street Journal or\n\n294\n00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:47.836\nthe New York Times or watch CNN,\nthey love the same median car prices,\n\n295\n00:16:47.836 --> 00:16:50.468\nmedian house prices as opposed to average.\n\n296\n00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:55.439\nIt's just a preference but\nusually that line is the middle line and\n\n297\n00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:59.190\nremember the middle line is an average.\n\n298\n00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.100\nBut remember what I mean, a median is,\n\n299\n00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.040\nis that I would look at those\nsame date appoints, right?\n\n300\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.290\nI would lay them out as single data points\nand I'd pick the one in the middle, right?\n\n301\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.890\nSo, just something to keep in mind when\nyou're constructing a run chart, you're\n\n302\n00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.320\nusually okay if you make that little line-\n&gt;&gt; And you should probably specify\n\n303\n00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.030\nif you're deviating from the-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n304\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.420\n&gt;&gt; Average-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n305\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.630\nyou know that's such a good\npoint not everybody.\n\n306\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.510\nEveryone knows the chart etiquette,\nbut really, if it's gonna be anything\n\n307\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.020\nother than a mean, at the bottom you\nshould say equals, the equal sign median.\n\n308\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of control chart\n\n309\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.230\netiquette, although a lot of people don't\nuse it, because of that way you just know.\n\n310\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.340\nSo, that's a run chart.\n\n311\n00:17:42.432 --> 00:17:44.820\nAnd here's just another\nexample of a run chart.\n\n312\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.730\nAnd we're back to length of stay,\nso it's another hospital example.\n\n313\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.450\nBut what had happened to\ncome up with this run chart,\n\n314\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.510\nis they would have added\nup all the data points.\n\n315\n00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.830\nSo I'm keeping a line chart,\nI'm just doing my line chart thing, and\n\n316\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.120\nat some point, let's say it's at the end\nof the quarter, I decide you know what?\n\n317\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.977\nI really wanna get more information.\n\n318\n00:18:03.977 --> 00:18:06.330\nAnd so\nI add up the data points that I have,\n\n319\n00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.840\nI divide by the number of data points,\nI get that middle line.\n\n320\n00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.381\nBut then I go back and\n\n321\n00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:15.844\nI plot each individual data\npoint to see how far away it is.\n\n322\n00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:21.150\nThis is just back to the line chart again.\n\n323\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.205\nA lot of the questions you're gonna get\nis a lot of questions on the exam or\n\n324\n00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:29.463\nthey'll have some questions related to\nthis section say is, when would you\n\n325\n00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:34.209\nuse a line chart, when would you use a run\nchart, when would you use a control chart?\n\n326\n00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:38.610\nSo, when you're studying these types\nof charts, kind of think of that too.\n\n327\n00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.330\nIt also goes for\nthe other charts that we've looked at,\n\n328\n00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.180\nthey might give you a scenario and\nsay which chart, right?\n\n329\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n330\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.220\n&gt;&gt; So this is just another\nthing of the line chart.\n\n331\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.580\nNow if I wanted to make this line\nchart a run chart, what would I do?\n\n332\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.590\nI would first count my data points.\n\n333\n00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.325\n&gt;&gt; Find my average.\n\n334\n00:18:57.325 --> 00:18:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And plot that as well.\n\n335\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.510\n&gt;&gt; Right, perfect, and\nthen here's a run chart without the lines.\n\n336\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.819\nSo just ignore that one.\n\n337\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.672\nThere is a line.\n\n338\n00:19:08.672 --> 00:19:11.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So again,\n\n339\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.020\nit's just trying to give you, again\nit's one of these tools, line charts and\n\n340\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:21.260\nrun charts are again tools that are just\nnot used to their full capacity.\n\n341\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.870\nI mean they're amazing tools and sometimes\nthis is all you need, right, period.\n\n342\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.774\n&gt;&gt; Because if you even with just a run\nchart, you can tell, even though you have\n\n343\n00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:33.619\nnot established things that we're\ngonna establish in our control chart,\n\n344\n00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:37.828\nyou can tell what weeks are not doing\nwell, which data points aren't doing well,\n\n345\n00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:41.763\nwhich hours are not doing well, by just\nhow much they deviate from them all.\n\n346\n00:19:43.628 --> 00:19:45.990\nOkay, so now we're all grown up.\n\n347\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.784\n&gt;&gt; Advanced, okay.\n\n348\n00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:47.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're all grown up and\n\n349\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.030\nwe are now a control chart.\n\n350\n00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.210\nAnd here's an example of a control chart.\n\n351\n00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.100\nNow the difference,\n\n352\n00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.630\nthere's a lot of differences in control\ncharts that are kind of important.\n\n353\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.740\nIf you are taking the Six Sigma exam,\npart of your student package is going to\n\n354\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:09.060\nexplain the difference between a p-chart,\nan mp-chart, an x chart.\n\n355\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.510\nIn the Six Sigma exams,\n\n356\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.830\nknowing the different types of\ncharts are really important.\n\n357\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:20.050\nIn the Lean Six Sigma, and Lean exams,\nwell, actually I should take that back.\n\n358\n00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:26.220\nIn the Lean exam and the Six Sigma exams,\nknowing the charts are really important.\n\n359\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.720\nIn the Lean Six Sigma exam,\n\n360\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.080\nwe're gonna cover what you need\nto know next in just a second.\n\n361\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In the Six Sigma and Lean environments,\n\n362\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.340\nthe reason why all these charts\nhave different names is because\n\n363\n00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.990\nsome are looking at whole things,\nand some are looking at percentages.\n\n364\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.650\nSo those are different ways of\napproaching gathering information for\n\n365\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.830\nthe control chart.\n\n366\n00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.020\nSo in some cases,\n\n367\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:55.540\nI'm looking at a percentage of\ndefects within a particular unit.\n\n368\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.270\nAnd that's a different control\nchart than if I'm just looking\n\n369\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.910\nat certain data points.\n\n370\n00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:04.260\nSo a good example of that would be,\nlet's say I was tracking\n\n371\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.050\npatient falls at a hospital or\nmistakes in IT department.\n\n372\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.460\nThe same person could fall twice,\n\n373\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.180\nthe same person could call\nthe help desk twice, right?\n\n374\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:15.810\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n375\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.660\nI'm looking at incidents versus multiple\nincidents from the same person.\n\n376\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.990\nSo each one of those have a different\nstrategy of gaining information and\n\n377\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.800\nin the Lean and Six Sigma tests, they're\npretty married to the fact that you need\n\n378\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.640\nto know the strategy to put\nthe control chart together.\n\n379\n00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.550\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\nbecause the output of that control chart.\n\n380\n00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.120\nIt doesn't really matter if\nit's an mp-chart, a p-chart,\n\n381\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.390\nan x chart, all those charts that are in\nyour student package that explain this.\n\n382\n00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.110\nIt doesn't really matter,\nthe output's gonna look the same.\n\n383\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.140\nSo in Lean Six Sigma, we say, okay, well,\nthere's gonna be an upper control limit.\n\n384\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.080\nThere's gonna be a lower control limit.\n\n385\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.640\nAnd you're gonna have a middle line that\nyou're kind of judging against, right?\n\n386\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So even though there's all these\n\n387\n00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.640\ndifferent types of charts,\nit's more about the strategy on how to\n\n388\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.280\nbuild that chart and collect information\nthan what the chart actually looks like.\n\n389\n00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Lean Six Sigma has a tendency to\n\n390\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.350\nuse simple control charts as opposed\nto the more complicated ones.\n\n391\n00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.090\nNow there's a lot of statistical packages\nthat help you with control charts.\n\n392\n00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.480\nBut the trend,\neven in statistical packages these days,\n\n393\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.640\nis that you highlight the information\non your Excel spreadsheet.\n\n394\n00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.600\nYou press a button and\nit gives you multiple control charts, and\n\n395\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.860\nyou pick the one that you want.\n\n396\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.545\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, that's why it's not as big a deal.\n\n397\n00:22:29.545 --> 00:22:32.170\nAgain,there's all kinds of math and\n\n398\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.500\nstatistics behind developing\nall these different things.\n\n399\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.170\nSo if I'm looking at the percentage of\ndefects within a particular unit, there's\n\n400\n00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.600\na kind of mathematical formula that I'm\nlooking at to create the control chart.\n\n401\n00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:50.370\nIn Lean Six Sigma, the cool thing is that,\nwe just care about the chart.\n\n402\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.550\nIt's just the chart, and we're saying,\nokay, there's an upper and\n\n403\n00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.210\nlower control limit, or upper and\nlower specification limit.\n\n404\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.670\nSometimes there's an upper and lower\ntolerance limit for a piece of equipment,\n\n405\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:07.290\nand we're just gonna track the activity\ninside that upper and lower control limit.\n\n406\n00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.770\nNow when we're talking about\nthe difference between a run chart and\n\n407\n00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.700\na control chart you'll notice that\nthe control chart also has a middle line.\n\n408\n00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.670\nSo if we can go back and\n\n409\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:21.590\nlook at my slide, you'll notice that\nthe control chart has a middle line.\n\n410\n00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.420\nThe big thing is that in a run chart\nit's almost always an average and\n\n411\n00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.810\nit could be a median, right.\n\n412\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.610\nIn a control chart that little line\ncan represent a myriad of things.\n\n413\n00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.930\nFortunately, it's usually an average.\n\n414\n00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:35.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n415\n00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:41.660\n&gt;&gt; However, it could be a mean, it could\nbe a mode, it could be a benchmark.\n\n416\n00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.190\n&gt;&gt; A goal.\n\n417\n00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:47.020\n&gt;&gt; It could be a goal, it could be a line\nthat the customer came up with that has\n\n418\n00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.220\nabsolutely no science at all,\nthis is what I want, right?\n\n419\n00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.649\nSo, kind of keep in mind that you want to\nknow what that middle line means, right.\n\n420\n00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:59.407\nNow, when you're working on\na statistical package, and\n\n421\n00:23:59.407 --> 00:24:04.318\nyou have the statistical package create\nthe control chart for you, The stat\n\n422\n00:24:04.318 --> 00:24:09.613\npackage is automatically gonna set that\nupper and lower control limit, upper and\n\n423\n00:24:09.613 --> 00:24:15.550\nlower specification limit, or upper and\nlower tolerance limit at three sigma.\n\n424\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.000\nSo what I want you to think of is,\n\n425\n00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.590\na control chart is nothing more than\ndistribution turned on its side.\n\n426\n00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:27.370\nSo if you looked at a distribution model,\nand remember we talked a lot about\n\n427\n00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.440\nhow we've got a pretty little bell between\nthe upper and lower control limits.\n\n428\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.730\nThen our process is in control.\n\n429\n00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.040\nWell, so,\nif you take those distribution models and\n\n430\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.620\nyou flip them on their side,\nvoila, you have a control chart.\n\n431\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.409\nIt's just easier to look at\nmore specific data that way.\n\n432\n00:24:43.409 --> 00:24:43.909\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n433\n00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.660\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nwe used to believe that the way, and\n\n434\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.810\nI'm just gonna leave this up as\nI'm speaking, this next chart.\n\n435\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:58.590\nWe used to believe that as long as the\ndata points behaved within the upper and\n\n436\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.990\nlower control limit,\nthen our process was in control.\n\n437\n00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.700\nAnd statistical process\ncontrol is an entire science\n\n438\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:10.420\nof how the data points behave in\nthe upper and lower control limits.\n\n439\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.870\nIn the lean test only,\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n440\n00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.190\nIn the six sigma test, lots and\n\n441\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.020\nlots of questions about how the data\npoints behave within the upper and\n\n442\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:24.390\nlower control limits, and the math that\ngoes behind how those data points behave.\n\n443\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.710\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\nwe're pretty much looking for patterns.\n\n444\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.050\nWe're saying you know what?\n\n445\n00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.780\nWe know that just because the data\npoints are within the upper and\n\n446\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.610\nlower control limit, doesn't necessarily\nmean we're out of the woods.\n\n447\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.710\nFor example, if I had a bunch of data\npoints moving, say, from the lower control\n\n448\n00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:47.110\nlimit up to the, well,\nthis one doesn't show that, okay.\n\n449\n00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.825\nWell, nevermind.\n\n450\n00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:50.990\nYou're just gonna have to\nvisualize this with me.\n\n451\n00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.180\nIf I had a data point that was starting\nat the lower control limit and\n\n452\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.070\nslowly moving to the upper control limit,\nwhat is that indicating?\n\n453\n00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.650\n&gt;&gt; Some kind of rise, a trend.\n\n454\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:02.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n455\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.923\n&gt;&gt; I'm running out of, like I said,\nwith my help desk calls,\n\n456\n00:26:05.923 --> 00:26:09.317\nI'm slowly running out of\nstorage space in my system, so.\n\n457\n00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:12.222\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nlooking at a trend is huge,\n\n458\n00:26:12.222 --> 00:26:16.622\nbecause that next data point\nmight go over your upper control.\n\n459\n00:26:16.622 --> 00:26:20.887\nBut up to this point,\nif you remember our PIN example,\n\n460\n00:26:20.887 --> 00:26:24.688\nwhere the PINs could be\na little bit too small, or\n\n461\n00:26:24.688 --> 00:26:28.780\na little bit too big, but\nthey would still fit.\n\n462\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.410\nBut if they were too big or too little,\nthey were actually gonna fit.\n\n463\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.740\nSo lets say we were looking at that, and\ninstead of seeing that pretty bell that\n\n464\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.860\nindicated we're doing pretty well, if we\nturned it on side and started tracking\n\n465\n00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.750\nit and notice, you know what, the next\ndata point is gonna go out of control.\n\n466\n00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.300\nSo everything I'm working on that month,\nmaybe the manufacturer isn't going to buy.\n\n467\n00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:55.170\nNow, there's a lot of reasons that\ncompanies go under and go bankrupt.\n\n468\n00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.220\nBut a lot of times, it's because their\nprocess is slowly going out of control,\n\n469\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.800\nand they don't know it, because they're\nstill functioning within that upper and\n\n470\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.750\nlower control limit.\n\n471\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.220\nSo they think they're fine.\n\n472\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.190\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're talking not just a one time deal.\n\n473\n00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.675\nThis is something you probably wanna\ncontinually monitor and maintain if,\n\n474\n00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:12.696\nwell, you don't wanna go out of business.\n\n475\n00:27:12.696 --> 00:27:14.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n476\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.940\nAnd the thing is,\n\n477\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.220\nis that there are other patterns\ntoo that you need to watch out for.\n\n478\n00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.870\nKeep in mind, in Six Sigma, statistical\nprocess control is a whole science\n\n479\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.570\naround how those data points behave, and\nyou wanna get very familiar with that.\n\n480\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.000\nWe're gonna give you some really good\nguidance in your student packet.\n\n481\n00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.770\nSome kind of learning tips,\nif you're taking the Six Sigma test only.\n\n482\n00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:42.180\nBut in Lean Six Sigma,\nthe only thing we really care about is\n\n483\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.320\nthat they stay inside those limits,\nand then how those data points react.\n\n484\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.920\nSo a trend would be a perfect example\nof something we wouldn't want.\n\n485\n00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.937\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; However, another thing that's touching\n\n486\n00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:57.570\nthe upper and lower control limits,\nwhat if it looks like a shark's tooth.\n\n487\n00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.920\nLike it went to the top, then it went\nto the bottom, then it went to the top,\n\n488\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.540\nand then went to the bottom.\n\n489\n00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.920\nTechnically, I'm still within my upper and\nlower control limits,\n\n490\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.480\nso I need the condition that\nmy processes is in control.\n\n491\n00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.720\nBut, what could that be telling us?\n\n492\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.346\n&gt;&gt; A piece of equipment\nisn't calibrated correctly.\n\n493\n00:28:13.346 --> 00:28:14.289\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\nPerfect.\n\n494\n00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:16.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, just because our data points,\n\n495\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.830\nand that's what I want you to\nremember from Lean Six Sigma,\n\n496\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.380\nthe whole lesson that we're getting\nfrom statistical process control\n\n497\n00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.490\nthat's a little bit more\ncomplicated on the Six Sigma side.\n\n498\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.040\nIn Lean Six Sigma,\nwe wanna look at the pattern of the data\n\n499\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.139\nas much as we look at-\n&gt;&gt; Where it falls.\n\n500\n00:28:34.139 --> 00:28:36.100\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Where it falls, absolutely.\n\n501\n00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.868\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And then, another thing is what you\n\n502\n00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:43.550\nbrought up, Cherokee, earlier,\nis that I wanna look at a range.\n\n503\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:50.910\nSo let's say I look at my control chart,\nand it looks shark toothish,\n\n504\n00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:56.270\nand it's actually called the shark tooth\npattern, a data point's at the top,\n\n505\n00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.790\nit's at the bottom, it's at the top,\nit's at the bottom.\n\n506\n00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.860\nThat'd be a perfect example where\nI might wanna look at a range,\n\n507\n00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:07.028\nbecause maybe it evens itself out\na little bit longer, as I move forward.\n\n508\n00:29:07.028 --> 00:29:09.923\nMaybe [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] replaced a part, and\n\n509\n00:29:09.923 --> 00:29:13.284\nit needs to, yeah, work itself out or\nsomething like that.\n\n510\n00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:13.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n511\n00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.540\n&gt;&gt; Wear it down a little bit.\n\n512\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.460\n&gt;&gt; And when you're looking\nthe concept behind control charts,\n\n513\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.900\nis that if I don't do anything positive or\n\n514\n00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.700\nnegative to that process, I can predict\nwhat's gonna happen next month.\n\n515\n00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.270\nSo I'm looking at my control chart,\nlooking for process improvement areas,\n\n516\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:30.780\nand I'm saying,\n\n517\n00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.370\nif I get a good handle on what's\nhappening now, I do nothing positive or\n\n518\n00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:39.420\nnegative, it's probably gonna look pretty\nclose to the same thing the next month.\n\n519\n00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.870\nThe other thing that I'm looking for\nin control charts is,\n\n520\n00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:46.050\nI want to look at the data points\nnaturally falling close to the middle.\n\n521\n00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.920\nAnd we call that a random pattern.\n\n522\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.760\nNow, if they're falling too close to\nthe middle, that's another red flag.\n\n523\n00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.440\nBecause I either don't have my\ncontrols properly calibrated or\n\n524\n00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.000\nI don't have my upper and\nlower controls in a good place.\n\n525\n00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.303\nOr someone's maybe making up the data.\n\n526\n00:30:02.303 --> 00:30:02.988\n&gt;&gt; Fudging it, yeah.\n\n527\n00:30:02.988 --> 00:30:03.975\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n528\n00:30:03.975 --> 00:30:08.030\nSo, you know, when I'm looking at\na control chart, if I really wanna\n\n529\n00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:12.040\nsay a process is in control, I'm looking\nat that kind of random pattern, but\n\n530\n00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.820\neverything's kind of falling close to that\nmiddle line, then that's when I'm safe.\n\n531\n00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.120\nAnd then the last thing I wanna\nsay about control charts,\n\n532\n00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.886\nkeeping in mind that people do them wrong\nall the time, so they might not be aware.\n\n533\n00:30:24.886 --> 00:30:26.232\nWell, actually, I've two things.\n\n534\n00:30:26.232 --> 00:30:30.139\nOne thing is, that in some cases\nyou can have a control chart and\n\n535\n00:30:30.139 --> 00:30:32.810\nhave no upper limit or lower limit.\n\n536\n00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.020\nSo, for example, of having no lower limit,\n\n537\n00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.900\nif I'm tracking accidents in my warehouse,\nif I have no injuries, that's fine.\n\n538\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.070\nI'm not gonna have a lower limit.\n\n539\n00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.740\nBut I would have an upper limit,\nbecause if I have more accidents\n\n540\n00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.790\nthan prescribed, my insurance could go up,\nand people could be getting hurt.\n\n541\n00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.620\n&gt;&gt; Then you need to look\nat your environment.\n\n542\n00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:55.200\n&gt;&gt; RIght.\nAnd\n\n543\n00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.670\nif I were doing a controlled chart on\nmy stocks, like our first example, I'm\n\n544\n00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.760\nprobably not gonna have an upper control\nlimit on how much money I make, right?\n\n545\n00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.670\nSo I wanted to say that.\n\n546\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.580\nAnd then this is the part I'd like\nto finish with, is that controls and\n\n547\n00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:12.880\nspecifications, cuz you're gonna\nsee upper control limits, CUL,\n\n548\n00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.660\nlower control limit, LCL.\n\n549\n00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.420\n&gt;&gt; For their acronyms.\n\n550\n00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.140\n&gt;&gt; For acronyms, right.\n\n551\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.400\nBut sometimes you're gonna see lower\nspecification and upper specification.\n\n552\n00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.990\nSo specifications generally\ncome from the industry.\n\n553\n00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.140\nThey're telling you.\n\n554\n00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.720\nControls come from within.\n\n555\n00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.820\nI'm saying, my controls.\n\n556\n00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.730\nSo my controls can be better\nthan my specifications,\n\n557\n00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.800\nbut not less,\nbecause people aren't gonna by my product.\n\n558\n00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so like in IT,\nif I'm creating some cabling,\n\n559\n00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:52.030\nsome wiring, and I have the IETF, and they\nsay, it has to fall within this diameter,\n\n560\n00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.030\nand I just wanna have it really,\nreally tight and perfect internally.\n\n561\n00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:00.980\nThat would be my controls from the\nindustry, that would be my specification.\n\n562\n00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.830\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; All right, good to go.\n\n563\n00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n564\n00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:06.110\n&gt;&gt; So I think that about wraps it up for\nthis particular episode.\n\n565\n00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.012\nWe looked at our different\ntypes of control charts,\n\n566\n00:32:08.012 --> 00:32:12.360\nat our different scatter diagrams and\nwhen we should in fact be using them.\n\n567\n00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.750\nSo stay tuned.\n\n568\n00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.160\nWe do have some more\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt certification\n\n569\n00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.380\npreparation information headed your way.\n\n570\n00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.170\nWe gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n571\n00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.320\nAnd I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n572\n00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.650\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:17.178\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma:\nGreen Belt Certification series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:18.940\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.490\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at our areas of waste,\n\n8\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.701\nwe'll be looking at our voices,\nand our CTQs.\n\n9\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.220\nWith us today in studios, we have Dr.\nTerra Vanzant-Stern.\n\n10\n00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.690\nThank you for joining us, Doctor.\n\n11\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.667\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:36.380\n&gt;&gt; So, where do we start?\n\n13\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.885\nWhat are we gonna be looking at first?\n\n14\n00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:43.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'd like to go over to my slide\ndeck, and before we even get started,\n\n15\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.360\nkind of explain the concept of waste and\nmistakes.\n\n16\n00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.830\nOn the Six Sigma side,\nwe're mostly talking about reducing or\n\n17\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.610\neliminating mistakes.\n\n18\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.610\nOn the Lean side, we're talking\nabout reducing or eliminating waste.\n\n19\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.589\nAnd waste is kind of a subjective thing.\n\n20\n00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.788\nSo for example, if there's a mistake,\nlike you walk into a room and\n\n21\n00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:10.104\nthe table's on fire, everyone's gonna\nagree, you know what, that's a mistake.\n\n22\n00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:14.470\nAnd you're not gonna spend a whole lot of\ntime talking about, is it mistake really?\n\n23\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.910\nRight, everyone's just gonna agree.\n\n24\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.530\nSo you'll notice that when we're\ntrying to uncover mistakes,\n\n25\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.040\nthere's not as many tools as there are for\nwhen we try to uncover waste,\n\n26\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.780\nbecause waste is subjective.\n\n27\n00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.550\nSo for example, if I'm standing in line\nat a Big Box store, I'm [LAUGH] wasting\n\n28\n00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.420\nmy time, especially if I have a lot\nof other things I need to do, right?\n\n29\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.370\nTo me, standing in line to try to pay for\n\n30\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.110\nitems just seems like a big waste,\ndoesn't it?\n\n31\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n32\n00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.620\n&gt;&gt; But to the store owner,\n\n33\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.440\nthey've already done tons of studies\non how long you might stand in line.\n\n34\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.845\nAnd they set up all these items that you\ncan buy while you're standing there.\n\n35\n00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:55.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it might not wasteful for them.\n\n36\n00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:59.710\nBecause as I'm standing there,\nI might say, you know what, I need gum,\n\n37\n00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.689\nI need Chapstick.\n\n38\n00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.963\nI need that movie magazine, right?\n\n39\n00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:04.408\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's not wasteful to them.\n\n40\n00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:08.481\nSo just the fact the waste is subjective\nmakes the argument of reducing or\n\n41\n00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.844\neliminating waste a little bit\nmore difficult to discern.\n\n42\n00:02:11.844 --> 00:02:14.860\nSo we're gonna talk about\nthe areas of waste.\n\n43\n00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.170\nWe're also gonna talk about\nvarious voices in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n44\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.480\nBecause Lean Six Sigma has a tendency\nto think from a voice standpoint.\n\n45\n00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.670\nAnd sometimes those voices are human and\n\n46\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.410\nsometimes those voices\nare inanimate objects.\n\n47\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.110\nSo for example,\nif I were trying to process and\n\n48\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.990\nprove this table,\nfrom the table's standpoint of view.\n\n49\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.440\nWhat would make me better?\n\n50\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.630\nWhat would make me faster?\n\n51\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.660\nWhat would make me more cost efficient?\n\n52\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.983\nSo if the table could speak, for example.\n\n53\n00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:43.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n54\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.902\nSo that's the idea of the voices.\n\n55\n00:02:44.902 --> 00:02:48.360\nAnd then CTQ's are critical to quality.\n\n56\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.243\nCritical to success.\n\n57\n00:02:49.243 --> 00:02:50.783\nCritical to satisfaction.\n\n58\n00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:54.620\nAnd the deal is that we're really\ngood at figuring out our own CTQs.\n\n59\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.490\nWhat I want.\n\n60\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.770\nWhat I need.\n\n61\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.020\nAnd the idea to maximize our success for\nprocess improvement is that we\n\n62\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.720\nhave to start thinking about what do the\nother people want, what are their CTQs?\n\n63\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.840\nSo with that,\nI guess we'll go ahead and get started.\n\n64\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.380\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n65\n00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.823\n&gt;&gt; And on my slide deck we're gonna\ntalk about the eight areas of waste.\n\n66\n00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:16.786\nThat's kind of a Lean concept.\n\n67\n00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:20.170\nWe're gonna approach that from\na couple of different standpoints.\n\n68\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.130\nWe're gonna talk about CTQs from\nthe Six Sigma side and the Lean side, and\n\n69\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.600\nagain, the voices.\n\n70\n00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.905\nOkay, there's a lot of different acronyms.\n\n71\n00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.785\nOne acronym for\nwaste is something called DOWN TIME, and\n\n72\n00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.054\nyou'll see that it's just a-\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n73\n00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:39.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's just a way to kind\nof remember the eight areas of waste.\n\n74\n00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.067\nAnd in this case, DOWN TIME stands for\nDefects, Overproduction, Waiting,\n\n75\n00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:51.181\nNon-utilized talent, Transportation,\nInventory, Motion, and Extra Processing.\n\n76\n00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:56.000\nNow, there's always that little bit of\ntrouble sometimes when we use a word or\n\n77\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.811\nan acronym.\n\n78\n00:03:56.811 --> 00:04:00.130\nWe get down to the bottom and\nit's like, what are we gonna call e?\n\n79\n00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.950\nSo it says, Extra Processing.\n\n80\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:02.720\nIn some models,\n\n81\n00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.280\nthe models that Lean happens to use\nmore often called Tim Woods, which we'll\n\n82\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.930\nalso be looking at, that extra processing\nis just referred to as overprocessing.\n\n83\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n84\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.800\n&gt;&gt; So,\none of the things that Lean Six Sigma\n\n85\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.660\nreally likes to do is to use acronyms\nbecause if I'm in a meeting and\n\n86\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.820\nI need to quickly remember what the eight\nareas of wastes are, I might more\n\n87\n00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.520\nlikely remember DOWN TIME or TIM WOODS,\nwhich is another one we're gonna look at.\n\n88\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.050\nAs opposed to what are those eight areas.\n\n89\n00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.418\nAnd the same thing is that smart goals.\n\n90\n00:04:35.418 --> 00:04:37.980\nWhen we're setting goals,\nif we remember smart,\n\n91\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.954\nthen it's just easier to set the goal.\n\n92\n00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:44.560\nSo Lean Six Sigma's filled\nwith these kinds of things.\n\n93\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.100\nSo when we're looking at waste or\n\n94\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.020\ndefects, the effort involved in\ninspecting and fixing the defect.\n\n95\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.600\nSo defects,\n\n96\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.420\nbecause we said in Six Sigma what we're\nreally looking at is mistakes and defects.\n\n97\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.920\nMistakes if it's service,\ndefects if it's manufacturing.\n\n98\n00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.810\nSo, right off the bat, we're looking,\nwe said this is a Lean model, and\n\n99\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.720\nwe're looking at defects.\n\n100\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.290\nHowever, in this model,\nwe're looking more at the rework.\n\n101\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.770\nHow much would it cost to do that again?\n\n102\n00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.044\nSo, our next one, and this is waste.\n\n103\n00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:22.697\n[LAUGH] Example of waste.\n\n104\n00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.730\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n105\n00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.338\n&gt;&gt; And another example of waste.\n\n106\n00:05:26.338 --> 00:05:27.127\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n107\n00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.921\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n108\n00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:33.384\nwaste can be things like repeating things,\nright?\n\n109\n00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right lean must right left?\n\n110\n00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:38.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now waste, and\n\n111\n00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.550\nI love this overproduction,\nthe old Lucy thing, I just love it.\n\n112\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.490\nBut Lucy and\nEthel are fighting this losing battle.\n\n113\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.680\nSo producing more products or service,\nthat would be overproduction, right?\n\n114\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like 500 in the office.\n\n115\n00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.262\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n116\n00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:02.175\nSo waiting,\nwhen we're talking about waiting,\n\n117\n00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:06.990\nthat can be people, parts,\nsystems, any kind of wait, right?\n\n118\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.871\nJust waiting, and\n\n119\n00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:11.685\nwaiting's very wasteful and I could be\ndoing something else while I'm waiting.\n\n120\n00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.460\n&gt;&gt; So actually when I just\nmentioned that with the cups, so\n\n121\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.885\nwhat happened was we had ordered a lot\nof cups for our grand opening and\n\n122\n00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:20.801\nthere was some kind of\nmiscommunication here at ITProTV.\n\n123\n00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:23.540\nThey didn't arrive in time for\nour grand opening.\n\n124\n00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.040\nSo here at ITProTV, they're going to\nrepurpose them for other promos and\n\n125\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.470\nthings like that.\n\n126\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.698\nAnd I had watched on this show,\n\n127\n00:06:30.698 --> 00:06:33.971\nI don't know if you're familiar with\nUndercover Boss, have you ever seen that?\n\n128\n00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:34.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that show, yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:34.768 --> 00:06:35.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good one.\n\n130\n00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.706\nAnd at this one gym,\nthey were selling smoothies and\n\n131\n00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:41.147\nthe girl had got the order wrong,\nthey said,\n\n132\n00:06:41.147 --> 00:06:45.015\nlook, why don't you just pour it into\nsample cups and sample them out.\n\n133\n00:06:45.015 --> 00:06:49.140\nSo is there a specific term or\nsomething that we could use there?\n\n134\n00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\nI like what you said about repurposing.\n\n135\n00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.797\nThat's one way that we can cure\noverproduction is by stepping back and\n\n136\n00:06:56.797 --> 00:06:59.139\nsaying, what else can I do there?\n\n137\n00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.060\nThe only difference is in Lean,\n\n138\n00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.127\nwe're trying to think about\nit before it happens.\n\n139\n00:07:04.127 --> 00:07:04.989\n&gt;&gt; There you go, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:06.820\n&gt;&gt; So before it happens, what can we do?\n\n141\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.339\n&gt;&gt; Like training them on how to properly\nmake that shake so there isn't waste.\n\n142\n00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.493\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n143\n00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:11.116\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n144\n00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so it turns out that waiting\nsometimes can be as much as it says it is.\n\n145\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.890\nBut I can say as much as 90% of process\ntime is just kind of waiting for\n\n146\n00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.420\nthings to happen.\n\n147\n00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.520\nAnd the goal in Lean Six Sigma\nis to have smooth and\n\n148\n00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.090\ncontinuous flow between activities and\nnot to have a lot of waiting.\n\n149\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.350\nBut like I said, it's kind of subjective.\n\n150\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.845\nSo all these people are waiting.\n\n151\n00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:40.430\nNon-utilized talent,\nwhich I think is kind of interesting.\n\n152\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.520\nYou hire someone to do something,\nthey're doing something else.\n\n153\n00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.145\nOr you're hiring someone because of\nmaybe their education experience or\n\n154\n00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:49.893\ntheir subject matter expertise\nin a particular area but\n\n155\n00:07:49.893 --> 00:07:51.894\nyou're using them in a different area.\n\n156\n00:07:51.894 --> 00:07:53.811\nOr you're not using people.\n\n157\n00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:57.666\nSometimes I think one of the things\nI'm always telling people\n\n158\n00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:01.597\nabout joining associations\nespecially trade associations,\n\n159\n00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:05.893\nis it's kind of fun because you get\na chance to try out a position, and\n\n160\n00:08:05.893 --> 00:08:10.814\nsince you're a volunteer you get to try\nout that position and see how it feels.\n\n161\n00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:15.540\nSo that will be an example of\nutilizing talent that you might not\n\n162\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.603\neven think about, right?\n\n163\n00:08:17.603 --> 00:08:22.690\nSo not utilizing talent\ncould be a myriad of things.\n\n164\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.060\nMaybe you didn't cross train.\n\n165\n00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.312\nMaybe you're just having\ntalent sit on the bench.\n\n166\n00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:33.840\nIn a lot of environments where,\nemergency environments, they do.\n\n167\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.099\nThey pay people to just to kinda hang out.\n\n168\n00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:39.486\nAnd so, Lean is saying anytime that\nyou've got people just hanging out or\n\n169\n00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:42.010\ndoing something,\nthat's probably not a good thing.\n\n170\n00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.288\nThen the next one is transportation and\nthat means without adding value.\n\n171\n00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.589\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when you think about transportation,\n\n172\n00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:53.818\nproducts, equipment, materials, people.\n\n173\n00:08:53.818 --> 00:08:56.690\n&gt;&gt; So just kind of haphazardly\ndriving around in circles.\n\n174\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.381\nThat's what I think of when I\nsee without adding a value.\n\n175\n00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n176\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n177\n00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.140\nRight, and sometimes like your GPS will\ntake you in the opposite direction and\n\n178\n00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.409\nthat didn't really help you, right?\n\n179\n00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:11.212\nOr it says you've arrived and you haven't.\n\n180\n00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:12.510\nAnd you're like what, no.\n\n181\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So any\n\n182\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.250\nkind of transportation that doesn't have\na value, didn't get you from place A to B.\n\n183\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.350\nNow, and it's different,\n\n184\n00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.180\nlike obviously if you wanna go sightseeing\nthat's a whole different ball game.\n\n185\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.940\nBut if you're trying to get\nproduct from one place to another,\n\n186\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.832\nif you're trying to get things internally\nto work, that whole sneaker net thing.\n\n187\n00:09:33.832 --> 00:09:37.117\nIt doesn't really make sense to\nwalk up and down the stairs.\n\n188\n00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:41.288\nI worked at the company where the printer,\nthe color printer,\n\n189\n00:09:41.288 --> 00:09:44.170\nthe good color printer was upstairs.\n\n190\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.470\nThe people downstairs were\nthe people that used it the most,\n\n191\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.470\nhardly anyone used it upstairs, right?\n\n192\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.690\nSo they were constantly going back and\nforth.\n\n193\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.700\nAnd it caused a lot of waste in\ntransportation, because they'd get up\n\n194\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.440\nthere, and you know how that is when\nyou send something to a remote printer.\n\n195\n00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.060\nYou get up there and it's like,\nno, it's not centered correct.\n\n196\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.310\nSo, then you have to go back down,\nthen you have to go back up.\n\n197\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:07.972\nSo we're looking at that, I just\nthought that was a cute transportation.\n\n198\n00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:10.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n199\n00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.214\nAlmost looks like an Oompa-Loompa.\n\n200\n00:10:12.214 --> 00:10:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n201\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n202\n00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.817\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so inventory, and\nright now what I want you to think with\n\n203\n00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:21.857\ninventory is unnecessary\nstorage of materials.\n\n204\n00:10:21.857 --> 00:10:24.500\nAnd this is big on the lean side.\n\n205\n00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.660\nAnd on the lean side, testing will\ninclude a topic called just in time.\n\n206\n00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.580\nAnd just in time inventoring\nmeans just that.\n\n207\n00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:38.240\nSo, I'm only putting things in my\nwarehouse that I'm gonna need for\n\n208\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.300\nthat particular job or assignment.\n\n209\n00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.710\nSo, just the opposite of Amazon.\n\n210\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n211\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.170\n&gt;&gt; So I have the question.\n\n212\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.803\nIt's been a little while\nthat we covered this, but\n\n213\n00:10:47.803 --> 00:10:50.937\nwas that going to be called the can ban,\nfor manufacturing?\n\n214\n00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:56.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, the can ban was a system\nin just in time, that's correct.\n\n215\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.400\nSo can ban systems, you see them\nall the time at big box stores,\n\n216\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.090\nwhere a card will come up if\nthe product is almost out.\n\n217\n00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.970\nAnd then in the warehouse the same way.\n\n218\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:13.430\nNow the thing is with just in time\ninventory, I'm saying I'm gonna be saving.\n\n219\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.320\nIt's wasteful to be having things on\nthe shelf that I'm not gonna use.\n\n220\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.170\nSo on the other side of the continuum,\nyou have companies like Amazon,\n\n221\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.650\nthat have huge fixed system,\nevery single thing in the entire world.\n\n222\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.380\nAnd these distribution centers are huge,\nright?\n\n223\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But if I'm just a small company,\n\n224\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.764\ndo I really need that much stationery,\nfor example?\n\n225\n00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:36.520\nDo I really need them,\nthat many business cards?\n\n226\n00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.706\nAnd then in humid\nclimates like it is here,\n\n227\n00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:42.020\nhaving too many paper products can really-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, over time.\n\n228\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.895\n&gt;&gt; Work against you.\n\n229\n00:11:42.895 --> 00:11:46.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So unnecessary storage of materials.\n\n230\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.690\nFor example.\n\n231\n00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.760\nSo also, too, when you're looking at\ninventory, is it organized correctly?\n\n232\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.850\nIs it put away in a way\nthat you can find it?\n\n233\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.310\nSo motion, and\nmotion is the movement of people, and\n\n234\n00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.770\nso the difference between transportation\nand motion in this model and\n\n235\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.770\nthe one that we're gonna look at next\nIs that motion is anything physical.\n\n236\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.650\nI move from one station\nto the next station.\n\n237\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.526\nTransportation would be\nanything that's motorized.\n\n238\n00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:18.390\nAnd it doesn't really, this is\nan example of structured brainstorming.\n\n239\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.930\nWhen I'm sitting around trying to\nthink where are there areas of waste?\n\n240\n00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.180\nI can use Downtime or Tim Woods,\nthe one we're gonna look at next.\n\n241\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.699\nAnd I could just look at my\ndepartment from that stand point,\n\n242\n00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:33.431\nis there inventory issues,\nare there over production issues?\n\n243\n00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.500\nI can use this as a model to\njust kind of uncover waste.\n\n244\n00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.120\nSo it's something to kinda keep in mind.\n\n245\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.860\nWhoops I went backwards, sorry.\n\n246\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.920\nWell you got to see inventory again.\n\n247\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.428\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n248\n00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:47.795\n&gt;&gt; Slow motion.\n\n249\n00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:48.645\n[LAUGH].\n\n250\n00:12:48.645 --> 00:12:49.665\n&gt;&gt; That's a great picture.\n\n251\n00:12:49.665 --> 00:12:50.962\n[LAUGH].\n\n252\n00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:54.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\na Leaner Approach than down time.\n\n253\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.130\nAlthough I love the acronym down time,\na Leaner Approach is Tim Woods.\n\n254\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.660\nAnd the reason why it's Leaner is because\n\n255\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.890\nTim Woods has a tendency to put those\nboxes together a little more tightly.\n\n256\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n257\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.878\n&gt;&gt; So but if you like down time,\nyou can use that.\n\n258\n00:13:10.878 --> 00:13:12.909\nMost of the Lean test and\n\n259\n00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:17.850\nthe Lean Six Sigma test\nare going to refer to Tim Woods.\n\n260\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.780\nThe Six Sigma test will\nrefer to down time.\n\n261\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.868\nOkay, so a leaner approach, and remember,\nSSD Global, we teach Leaner Six Sigma,\n\n262\n00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:30.563\nwhich just means your certificate\nstill says Lean Six Sigma.\n\n263\n00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:33.540\nIt doesn't say that you're\na Green Belt in Leaner Six Sigma.\n\n264\n00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:37.910\nIt's just that Leaner Six Sigma\nteaches you concepts so\n\n265\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.710\nthat you can kind of accelerate\nyour own self learning.\n\n266\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.560\nSo, Tim Woods and I'm just gonna give\nyou a second to look at this slide but\n\n267\n00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.110\nwe'll go ahead and read them.\n\n268\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.130\nIt's still the same areas of waste.\n\n269\n00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.350\nIt's just a way of remembering\nthem easier that I'm Tim Woods.\n\n270\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:55.130\nSo transportation, inventory,\nmotion and then waiting and\n\n271\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.900\nthen over production,\nover processing, defects and skills.\n\n272\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.900\nNow I'd like to point out\nthat the different between,\n\n273\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.670\nbecause most of this is pretty intuitive.\n\n274\n00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.550\nThat's another thing that's kind of cool\nabout using this model, but one thing I\n\n275\n00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.870\nwanna point out is the difference between\nover production and over processing.\n\n276\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.220\nBecause we've already talked that\nthe difference between transportation and\n\n277\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.230\nmotion, transportation is motorized,\nmotion is anything physical.\n\n278\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.980\nSo the difference between\nover production and\n\n279\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.200\nover processing is that over\nproduction means I made too much,\n\n280\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.350\nover processing means I\ntouched it too many times.\n\n281\n00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:35.280\n&gt;&gt; So if we looked at that example,\nwhat was Lucy's friend's name?\n\n282\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.915\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Ethel.\n\n283\n00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:38.697\n&gt;&gt; Ethel, okay, eating the chocolates\nwould be over production.\n\n284\n00:14:38.697 --> 00:14:43.010\nOver processing would be if I hired you\nperform a spell-check on my work and\n\n285\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.722\nthen I also hired two other people perform\na spell-check on the same document?\n\n286\n00:14:46.722 --> 00:14:51.310\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and the thing that I think is\nkind of interesting on the over-processing\n\n287\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.920\npiece, Over processing can be,\na lot of times, just too many signatures.\n\n288\n00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.030\nWhen we do change orders in IT, or\nif you do a change order for the Food and\n\n289\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.310\nDrug Administration, a lot of times\nwhat they wanna see is a hierarchy of\n\n290\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.770\nsignatures, basically what you're saying\nis a bunch of people reviewed this.\n\n291\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:12.310\nBut what happens sometimes is other\npeople's names just don't fall off, and\n\n292\n00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.310\nsuddenly you have a change order and\nyou might even have something that's time\n\n293\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.050\nsensitive and\nits going through all these signatures.\n\n294\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.350\nAll these people are touching it when\nthat was never really the intent.\n\n295\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.820\nRight?\n\n296\n00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.640\nSo one of the things that\nhappens in over processing, is,\n\n297\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.830\non the Six Sigma side, sometimes there's\na tendency to over process things.\n\n298\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.670\nBecause Six Sigma is very very\nconcerned with getting it right.\n\n299\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.610\nOn the Lean Six Sigma site it's almost\nlike, it depends on certain things.\n\n300\n00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.410\nWe wanna make sure we get it right.\n\n301\n00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.480\nHeart surgery.\n\n302\n00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.274\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But delivering pizza,\n\n303\n00:15:46.274 --> 00:15:49.667\nmaybe we don't need to overprocess that,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:54.333\nSo Six Sigma has a tendency to by default\nover process just to make sure the facts\n\n305\n00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.820\nand figures and everything are correct.\n\n306\n00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.268\nThat's their goal is to make\nsure everything is correct.\n\n307\n00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:01.043\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that goal.\n\n308\n00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:05.203\nIt's just that Lean Six Sigma\nworks with smaller projects and\n\n309\n00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:07.780\nsmaller groups of information.\n\n310\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.000\nSo sometimes checking it once is okay.\n\n311\n00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so overprediction,\n\n312\n00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.800\nI've made too much.\n\n313\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.001\nOverprocessing, I've touched\nit too many times, or\n\n314\n00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:20.500\nI've looked at it too many times,\nor anything along those lines.\n\n315\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.020\nDefects, again it's the same\nthing as on the downtime model.\n\n316\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.820\nFrom defects,\n\n317\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.280\nwe're really looking from the perspective,\nwhat if I had to do it over, right?\n\n318\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.424\nIf I had to do it over,\nhow much time have I wasted?\n\n319\n00:16:34.424 --> 00:16:37.739\n&gt;&gt; So I actually worked in a manufacturing\nfacility that manufactured printed\n\n320\n00:16:37.739 --> 00:16:38.523\ncircuit boards.\n\n321\n00:16:38.523 --> 00:16:43.250\nAnd if a particular chip or component from\nthat board were in the wrong place or\n\n322\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.540\nwas not soldered properly,\nthey'd have to take that component off,\n\n323\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.956\nwhich took time, and then replace it.\n\n324\n00:16:49.956 --> 00:16:55.841\nSo you're looking at kind of,\ndoes my money equate to my time here?\n\n325\n00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:57.641\nAnd then you have to\nmake that judgment call.\n\n326\n00:16:57.641 --> 00:16:59.904\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, perfect example.\n\n327\n00:16:59.904 --> 00:17:03.837\nSo the slide that you're\nlooking at right now.\n\n328\n00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:07.200\nAnd maybe we should look at that\nfull screen just for a second.\n\n329\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.580\nThe slide that you're looking at right\nnow is part of your student package, and\n\n330\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:17.230\nwhat it does is it takes each thing and\nit kinda breaks it down a little bit.\n\n331\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.760\nSo if you hit brain rot and you're like\nI don't know what transportation is,\n\n332\n00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.890\nit kind of gives you some clues.\n\n333\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.760\nSo this is just a one-page handout.\n\n334\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.130\nIt's fairly intuitive.\n\n335\n00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.461\nWhat you wanna remember\nis that Tim Woods and\n\n336\n00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:32.450\ndowntime are an example of\nstructured brainstorming.\n\n337\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.370\nWhen you're doing\nstructured brainstorming,\n\n338\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.920\nyou can't really do it wrong.\n\n339\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.740\nIt's used to kinda kick off your brain.\n\n340\n00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.518\nSo for example, if I were in a department,\nI'm new, let's say to the department.\n\n341\n00:17:43.518 --> 00:17:47.235\nAnd they know I'm a process\nimprovement person and I'm looking for\n\n342\n00:17:47.235 --> 00:17:50.831\nprocess improvement opportunities,\nI might go down that list.\n\n343\n00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:53.289\nNow it's possible that if\nI were using Tim Woods,\n\n344\n00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:55.863\nthat the very first one I look at,\ntransportation,\n\n345\n00:17:55.863 --> 00:17:58.980\nthere are no transportation\nissues that hit that department.\n\n346\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.844\nWell, I can just skip that.\n\n347\n00:17:59.844 --> 00:18:04.755\nRemember Tim Woods is just a way so that\nI don't remember what to look at, right?\n\n348\n00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:11.692\nBut the idea behind Tim Woods is that if\nI look at each one of those categories,\n\n349\n00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:16.140\nI'm gonna probably come up with something.\n\n350\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.493\nWhich brings us back to\nthe fishbone diagram.\n\n351\n00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:22.540\nSo if I were using a fishbone diagram,\nwhich we said we put the root cause in\n\n352\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.279\nthe head of the fish and then we\nnamed those different bones things.\n\n353\n00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:31.450\nWe said the simple way we could name\nthe bones is people process/service.\n\n354\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:36.480\nThen there was a more extensive one\nwhere we could name the bones after\n\n355\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.291\nm things like man and\nmachine and Mother Nature.\n\n356\n00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:40.233\n&gt;&gt; I can see that.\n\n357\n00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:42.560\nSo I have this idea, and\ntell me if I'm wrong,\n\n358\n00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.752\nmaybe my problem was that\na particular task was being ignored.\n\n359\n00:18:45.752 --> 00:18:48.038\nAnd then I look at all my little bones and\n\n360\n00:18:48.038 --> 00:18:52.210\nI find that there was an email that\nhad been sent out to multiple people.\n\n361\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.238\nAnd I sent it out to so many people\nthat people were ignoring it or\n\n362\n00:18:56.238 --> 00:18:59.362\nthinking, someone else will look at that.\n\n363\n00:18:59.362 --> 00:19:01.534\nAnd then they were totally\nbypassing a check sum,\n\n364\n00:19:01.534 --> 00:19:04.130\nwould that still fall under\nthe overprocessing category?\n\n365\n00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n366\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.000\nAnd so if I were trying to\ncome up with like, say,\n\n367\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.290\nin the head of the fish,\nI'm looking at a particular problem.\n\n368\n00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.080\nAnother way I could approach that is\nby naming the bones after Tim Woods.\n\n369\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.210\nWhat kind of transportation\nissues play into that problem?\n\n370\n00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.880\nWhat kinds of inventory\nplay into that program?\n\n371\n00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.454\nAnother thing that I think Tim Woods is\nreally great on is if you're just trying\n\n372\n00:19:25.454 --> 00:19:26.384\nto solve a problem.\n\n373\n00:19:26.384 --> 00:19:29.798\nJust a simple problem, you're not\ntrying to run it through a big model.\n\n374\n00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.152\nAnd you say, well,\n\n375\n00:19:31.152 --> 00:19:35.230\nwhat kind of transportation\nissues impacted that problem?\n\n376\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.470\nWhat kind of inventory?\n\n377\n00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.760\nWhat kind of waiting?\n\n378\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.858\nAnd again, keep in mind that Tim Woods is\njust a way to collect the information,\n\n379\n00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:46.190\nbecause sometimes there's gonna be\ncategories you don't need, right?\n\n380\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.875\nNow another thing that I think is kind\nof fun about all of the Lean Six Sigma\n\n381\n00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:53.501\nproducts, is that you can, all of\nthe Lean Six Sigma tools, is that you\n\n382\n00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:57.553\ncan apply these things to your personal\nlife to make your personal life better,\n\n383\n00:19:57.553 --> 00:19:59.209\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n384\n00:19:59.209 --> 00:20:00.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Good.\n\n385\n00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:03.969\n&gt;&gt; So If I were trying to\nidentify waste in my home.\n\n386\n00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:08.453\nBecause the concept, remember,\nis that I can make things better,\n\n387\n00:20:08.453 --> 00:20:12.711\nfaster, and more cost effective,\nor one of the three, right?\n\n388\n00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:18.071\nIf I eliminate or reduce waste,\nthat's the lean kind of whole concept.\n\n389\n00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:22.690\nIf I can identify, and then after\nidentifying that, either eliminate or\n\n390\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.844\nreduce the waste, then I'll be better,\nfaster, more cost effective, right?\n\n391\n00:20:27.844 --> 00:20:32.164\nSo every single model that we do can be\napplied, but this one's an easy one, so\n\n392\n00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:34.508\nI thought we'd kinda just-\n&gt;&gt; Run through it?\n\n393\n00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:35.427\n&gt;&gt; Is that okay?\n\n394\n00:20:35.427 --> 00:20:36.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n395\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.167\n&gt;&gt; I'm excited,\nI'm a little nervous, though.\n\n396\n00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:40.322\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so Cherokee,\n\n397\n00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.504\nI want you to think about where you're\nliving right now, your home, and\n\n398\n00:20:43.504 --> 00:20:46.240\nI know you have two homes, but\nthink about your primary home.\n\n399\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.902\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n400\n00:20:46.902 --> 00:20:50.892\n&gt;&gt; And think that the concept is that what\nyou'd like to do is become better, faster,\n\n401\n00:20:50.892 --> 00:20:52.260\nmore cost effective.\n\n402\n00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.430\nThere's lots of ways you can do that, but\n\n403\n00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.918\none way is if you can identify and\nreduce waste.\n\n404\n00:20:56.918 --> 00:20:57.882\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; That's one way.\n\n405\n00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:02.281\nThere's other ways that we're gonna be\nable to make our home more efficient.\n\n406\n00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:04.824\nBut one strategy is to tackle waste.\n\n407\n00:21:04.824 --> 00:21:05.417\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n408\n00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:10.249\n&gt;&gt; So when you're thinking about\ntransportation in relationship to your\n\n409\n00:21:10.249 --> 00:21:12.267\nhome, what kinds of things.\n\n410\n00:21:12.267 --> 00:21:15.613\nAnd at this point you're not making\na judgment, you're just saying,\n\n411\n00:21:15.613 --> 00:21:18.180\nthis is just an identification model.\n\n412\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.870\nAll we're saying at this point are,\n\n413\n00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:24.000\nhere's some areas I'd like to look in\nbecause they represent potential waste.\n\n414\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n415\n00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.400\nwhat are some things in transportation?\n\n416\n00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.410\n&gt;&gt; That I may come across?\n\n417\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.629\nWell, if anyone's ever\nbeen to Gainesville,\n\n418\n00:21:30.629 --> 00:21:32.850\nthen they certainly know\ntraffic is horrible.\n\n419\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.013\nAnd I do not drive very far to work,\nbut I see people on bicycles and\n\n420\n00:21:37.013 --> 00:21:41.732\nwalking that are actually passing me\ndue to the large amounts of traffic.\n\n421\n00:21:41.732 --> 00:21:45.580\n[LAUGH] That's really the biggest\ncomplaint I have about my traffic.\n\n422\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.620\nMaybe that there are other drivers on\nthe road, that are bad drivers, and\n\n423\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.652\nthat causes a risk but-\n&gt;&gt; And I can think of a recent one for\n\n424\n00:21:51.652 --> 00:21:53.313\nyou about your daycare.\n\n425\n00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:54.724\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there we go.\n\n426\n00:21:54.724 --> 00:21:56.069\n&gt;&gt; That would tie into transportation and\n\n427\n00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:58.040\nwhy don't you explain a little\nbit about what happens?\n\n428\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.406\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you have kids then you\nmay be familiar with these concepts.\n\n429\n00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:06.598\nBut schools and daycares, they implement\nand impose time restrictions for when\n\n430\n00:22:06.598 --> 00:22:11.800\nparents can pick their kids up because\nthey don't wanna be there all night.\n\n431\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.000\nSo they charge an exorbitant fee on\na permanent basis if you're late.\n\n432\n00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.400\nSo I had something come up.\n\n433\n00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.044\nI was late the other day and\nwas slapped with a pretty hefty bill.\n\n434\n00:22:22.044 --> 00:22:24.060\nSo that would fall under\ntransportation then.\n\n435\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and this is the thing is\nthat you wanna starting thinking outside\n\n436\n00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.620\nthe confines of, outside the constructs\nof typical transportation.\n\n437\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.099\nWhat are all the things that\nrelate to transportation?\n\n438\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.005\nNow the other thing about structured\nbrainstorming, keeping in mind we're using\n\n439\n00:22:39.005 --> 00:22:43.551\nit to kick our brains off, to kind of\nwrap our minds around a particular area.\n\n440\n00:22:43.551 --> 00:22:46.490\nWe're looking at the area of waste.\n\n441\n00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.270\nBut the other thing to remember\nthat in structured brainstorming,\n\n442\n00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.405\nit's okay if you come up with repeats.\n\n443\n00:22:52.405 --> 00:22:56.370\nThe more repeats you have\njust helps you prioritize.\n\n444\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.960\nSo if something that, for example,\nthat you said about transportation also\n\n445\n00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.240\napplies to somewhere else in the model,\nthen it kinda gets an extra tick mark.\n\n446\n00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.120\nAnd it's like,\nmaybe I'll tackle that one, right?\n\n447\n00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.640\nSo inventory, that one didn't really,\n\n448\n00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.780\nthe two examples we had don't really\nfall inside the inventory bucket.\n\n449\n00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.940\nBut what I want you to think\nabout right now is, at your home,\n\n450\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.375\nwhat's anything that has to do with\nstuff that you think could be wasteful?\n\n451\n00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:27.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so we already,\nthis is like my confession time here.\n\n452\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.250\nBut we already talked about\noverspending with online purchases and\n\n453\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.270\nhaving that easy one-touch\nbutton to pay for things.\n\n454\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.580\nAnd then another thing that I'm sure a lot\nof you can relate to is wasting food.\n\n455\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.340\nI really try not to, but\nit seems like there's always\n\n456\n00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.055\nfresh items that go bad before\nmy family can consume them.\n\n457\n00:23:47.055 --> 00:23:50.989\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I'm sure a lot of you've\nbeen in situations where you save things\n\n458\n00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:54.235\nbut then it's just easier to go\nbuy it because you can't find it.\n\n459\n00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:56.239\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm saying,\n\n460\n00:23:56.239 --> 00:24:00.177\nI can't tell you how many tapes and\nlint rollers.\n\n461\n00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:02.648\nI mean, these repeatable items, so.\n\n462\n00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:06.418\nOkay, good, so motion, now what I\nwant you to think about is in your\n\n463\n00:24:06.418 --> 00:24:10.983\nhome when you are taking extra steps that\nyou dont want to take, because you know we\n\n464\n00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:14.780\nare all in to this fitness thing,\nI have my little fitness band on.\n\n465\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.125\n&gt;&gt; Me too.\n&gt;&gt; We are all, thank you.\n\n466\n00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:17.810\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we're all wanting\n\n467\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.900\nthose extra steps, but think of steps\nthat really aren't helping your goal,\n\n468\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.280\nthey're just things that you are doing or\nredoing Anything that you can think of?\n\n469\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.010\n&gt;&gt; Maybe taking the garbage out and\nthen walking the dog.\n\n470\n00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.950\nSo maybe if I did them both\ntogether that would be reducing my-\n\n471\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's that kind of thing.\n\n472\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.860\n&gt;&gt; My motion.\n\n473\n00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.330\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's that kind of thing.\n\n474\n00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.930\nAnything where I'm\nconstantly going back in\n\n475\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.090\nto turn off my curling iron-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was gonna say I forget things\n\n476\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.085\nall the time.\n\n477\n00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:49.690\n[LAUGH] Did I unplug the straightener?\n\n478\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.700\nOr did I grab my cellphone?\n\n479\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, okay so\nthose would make the list and\n\n480\n00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:58.710\nagain we're not necessarily saying for\nsure at this point that there are ways.\n\n481\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.020\nWe're just trying to come up with\na list of things to investigate.\n\n482\n00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And we're looking for\n\n483\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.500\nrepeats because if we see\na repeat then we know.\n\n484\n00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.672\nSo waiting, what are somethings\nat home that you have to do.\n\n485\n00:25:10.672 --> 00:25:14.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You had a really good example recently\n\n486\n00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.671\nwhere you were waiting for\nthe internet provider.\n\n487\n00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:17.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n488\n00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.230\nIf you ever have any kind of service\ntechnicians and they give you that window.\n\n489\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.920\nAnd the windows are pretty vague,\nso that's definitely one.\n\n490\n00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.345\nAnd then I do feel like I spend a lot\nof time waiting on my children.\n\n491\n00:25:31.345 --> 00:25:32.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I have a ten-year-old and\n\n492\n00:25:32.494 --> 00:25:33.060\na four-year-old.\n\n493\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.255\nAnd seems like they're pretty slow to\nget out there door in the morning.\n\n494\n00:25:36.255 --> 00:25:37.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But maybe when I go ahead and\n\n495\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.170\napply some kind of metric, to see in\nfact I was just being impatient or\n\n496\n00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.615\nif I really was having to wait.\n\n497\n00:25:42.615 --> 00:25:44.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, that's perfect.\n\n498\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.500\nOkay, so overproduction.\n\n499\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.710\nTry to think of a time,\n\n500\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:53.470\nand the audience as well, of a time\nwhere you're just making too much stuff.\n\n501\n00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:58.260\nNow, I'm from Texas, so\nwe make tons of stuff every time,\n\n502\n00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.140\nmy Colorado friends think it's hysterical\nbecause I have like a party for,\n\n503\n00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.000\nsay, ten people but\nI could feed a hundred.\n\n504\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat's exactly what I was thinking too.\n\n505\n00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.070\nSo, because it is around that time\nof year, I made some goodie bags for\n\n506\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.080\nsome co-workers, and\nI think I ordered more chocolate\n\n507\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.602\nthan I really needed to have\nlaying around my house.\n\n508\n00:26:16.602 --> 00:26:20.810\n[LAUGH] So perfect example right.\n\n509\n00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay so now think of\nsomething that we over process.\n\n510\n00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.540\nSomething at our homes where we're\njust touching it too many times,\n\n511\n00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.210\nwe're looking at it to many times.\n\n512\n00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.920\n&gt;&gt; The first thing that comes\nto mind is laundry, but\n\n513\n00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.680\nit's probably because I really don't want\nto do that, but it's probably necessary.\n\n514\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.680\n&gt;&gt; But you know it is kind of\ninteresting about laundry because.\n\n515\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.810\nThat's a perfect example, there used to\nbe a time in our history where you really\n\n516\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.660\ndid have to separate all your\nclothes because clothes bled.\n\n517\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.240\nAnd there's still some, like you know\nthose red dirt shirts and stuff,\n\n518\n00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.660\nyou have to be careful about.\n\n519\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.700\nBut there was a time in our history,\nin the 50s and 60s, that dye was so\n\n520\n00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.360\nheavy, that you really couldn't\nmix your colors with your whites.\n\n521\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.710\nAnd these days most of the time, you\nreally can, it's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n522\n00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.890\nSo You could be overprocessing by-\n&gt;&gt; Throwing them together and\n\n523\n00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.040\nthen having to resort?\n\n524\n00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n525\n00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.490\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You could be over processing,\n\n526\n00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.640\nwhat are some other areas where\nwe over process in our home?\n\n527\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.720\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe just picking up or\nsorting or organizing things.\n\n528\n00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n529\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.245\nI mean how many times to we have to\nkeep picking up those toys or whatever.\n\n530\n00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:29.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] For her children or\n\n531\n00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:29.970\ngrandchildren.\n\n532\n00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.250\nThat's just,\nI mean we're touching that too many times.\n\n533\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.580\nThere's got to be a place\nthat we can put that stuff.\n\n534\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.130\nRight?\n\n535\n00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.860\nThat's gonna be more efficient.\n\n536\n00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.550\nOkay, so then defects.\n\n537\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.140\nThink of things at your home\nthat you have to do over again.\n\n538\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.080\nThat are just wrong and\nso you have to redo them.\n\n539\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.420\n&gt;&gt; Maybe my son with his homework.\n\n540\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n541\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.895\n&gt;&gt; If some of those questions\naren't the right answers.\n\n542\n00:27:51.895 --> 00:27:56.080\nMm-hm, good question,\nlet me try to think of some other defects.\n\n543\n00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.620\nDinner, if it doesn't come out the way\nthat I think my family will eat.\n\n544\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.438\nSo I might have to redo that, or\njust call some Chinese in or something.\n\n545\n00:28:03.438 --> 00:28:05.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n546\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:10.610\nOne of the things that a friend gave\nme these things that heat up or they\n\n547\n00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:14.530\nget cold and you can put them on, cuz I'm\nalways doing different exercise programs.\n\n548\n00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.990\nI'm into Tai Chi right now.\n\n549\n00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.830\nSo I always have some\nanomaly ache somewhere.\n\n550\n00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.620\nSo these things you either heat up or\nyou put it in the refrigerator.\n\n551\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.025\nSo I'm constantly overheating my thing and\nit's having to wait.\n\n552\n00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:30.235\n[LAUGH] And then I can't use it.\n\n553\n00:28:30.235 --> 00:28:31.974\n[CROSSTALK] Too hot.\n\n554\n00:28:31.974 --> 00:28:34.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; So\nI have to put it back in.\n\n555\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.060\nSo you know I'm constantly trying\nto save steps by throwing the thing\n\n556\n00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.080\nin the microwave and\nmaking it hotter than it's supposed to be.\n\n557\n00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.860\nBut then when I get ready to use it,\nit's too hot.\n\n558\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.890\nYou know so I have to keep redoing it,\nand I'm gonna get better at that.\n\n559\n00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:51.130\nOkay, skills are were you have\nskills that are either being\n\n560\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.100\nunderutilized, or overutilized.\n\n561\n00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:59.600\nSo for example,\nif you think about things that,\n\n562\n00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.070\nlike for example house cleaning, right.\n\n563\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:06.110\nIf you look at your hourly rate, what\nyou would pay yourself to do something,\n\n564\n00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.780\nsometimes it really does make\nsense to have a housekeeper.\n\n565\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.280\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n566\n00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.250\nRight.\n\n567\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.180\nSo skills would be thing\nthat you're doing or\n\n568\n00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.290\nnot doing that could be\nwasteful at your home.\n\n569\n00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.890\nCan you think of any things other than\nhouse keeping graphs when they come to my\n\n570\n00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.885\nmind and\nthat how I justify house keepers [LAUGH]\n\n571\n00:29:22.885 --> 00:29:26.465\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah I really don't have anything\n\n572\n00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:30.907\ncoming to mind maybe So\n\n573\n00:29:30.907 --> 00:29:35.150\nmaybe I decide I'm gonna paint a room for\nexample.\n\n574\n00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.790\nIt's actually might be\nwasting more of my time\n\n575\n00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.360\nthan finding someone else to paint my room\nfor me because they have that expertise.\n\n576\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.440\nAnd so if I paint the room-\n&gt;&gt; So they can do it in a shorter period\n\n577\n00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.210\nof time versus-\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n578\n00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:51.520\nif I actually looked at\n&gt;&gt; Getting the magazine on how to paint my\n\n579\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.660\nroom, buying all of the supplies,\nallotting the time to do it.\n\n580\n00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.070\nIt might actually, at least I just\nwanted to do because that's different.\n\n581\n00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.120\nIf you have this sense, you wanna go\naccomplish something that you're home.\n\n582\n00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.100\nSomething it just feels\ngood to do something.\n\n583\n00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.150\nBut when you have a task at your home\nthat sometimes It's just gonna take\n\n584\n00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.180\nyou longer and it's gonna be more\neffort than bringing someone in.\n\n585\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Stuff like that.\n\n586\n00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.690\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n587\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that was just an example and\n\n588\n00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.980\nthere's lots of tools like this that you\ncan take and apply to your own life.\n\n589\n00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.100\nSo I think we're wrapping up right now,\nand we're gonna be talking about\n\n590\n00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.030\nhow to take CTQs and voices and\napply it to this model as well.\n\n591\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.580\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n592\n00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.630\nI'm excited.\n\n593\n00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:31.900\nSo, don't go anywhere.\n\n594\n00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.510\nStay tuned.\n\n595\n00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.960\nWe're gonna taking a look, like Dr.\nStern just mentioned, at our voices,\n\n596\n00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.670\nour different perspectives, and\nthen we'll also take a look at CTQ's.\n\n597\n00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.080\nBut, we are out of time for this episode.\n\n598\n00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.960\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and wrap up.\n\n599\n00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.588\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n600\n00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:50.800\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr. Tara Van Sanstern,\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n601\n00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.690\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time here IT\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV.\n\n602\n00:30:54.690 --> 00:31:00.358\n[MUSIC]\n\n603\n00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:02.360\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Well thank you, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.008\nAnd as Cherokee mentioned,\nwe're gonna talk about CTQs, but first,\n\n15\n00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.040\nwhat I'd like to do is go\nover to my slideshow, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.547\nremind you that we were talking about\nwhen we left off in the last section.\n\n17\n00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:01.718\nIf we,\nwe were talking about Tim Woods, and\n\n18\n00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:07.055\nthat was one model that we could use\nto determine the eight areas of waste.\n\n19\n00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.558\nThe other model was called downtime,\nright?\n\n20\n00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:14.640\nAnd so I'm gonna use this to kinda give\nyou a high level idea of what CTQs are.\n\n21\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.880\nSo CTQs are critical to quality,\ncritical to success.\n\n22\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.100\nNow, in the last session, we said Tim\nWoods, we could use it to identify waste.\n\n23\n00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.830\nThat's what it's most commonly used, as a\nway to remember the eight areas of waste.\n\n24\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940\nWe're not saying that solving the problem,\nwe're not even for\n\n25\n00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.390\nsure saying that it is waste.\n\n26\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.270\nWe're just using it as a-\n&gt;&gt; Try to identify it, right.\n\n27\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, another way that we\ncould use Tim Woods is we could go back,\n\n28\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.630\nand we could look at\ntransportation issues, right?\n\n29\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.520\nAnd say, for example,\nwhat is critical to the success,\n\n30\n00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.800\ncritical to satisfaction to make\nthose transportation issues work?\n\n31\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.460\nSo I could go back, and I could say, all\nright, we have a problem in inventory, or\n\n32\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.770\nwe have a problem in overproduction.\n\n33\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.930\nAnd if I wanna correct that,\nwhat's critical to quality,\n\n34\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.840\nwhat's critical to success?\n\n35\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.080\nNow, CTQs by customer requirements,\nwhat the customer wants.\n\n36\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.990\nBy default, are gonna be CTQs, so\ncustomer requirements are CTQs.\n\n37\n00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.250\nSo, if you were asked on a Lean Six Sigma,\nor Lean Six Sigma exam,\n\n38\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.600\ncritical to quality if it's a customer\nrequirement absolutely no question.\n\n39\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This is critical to quality,\n\n40\n00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.420\nwhere it gets kind of dicey is\nalmost in a Steve Covey sense of it.\n\n41\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.830\nIs that in order to be successful,\nwe have to find out\n\n42\n00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.490\nwhat make other people successful,\nwhat do they need for their satisfaction.\n\n43\n00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.764\nIf they play into our project,\n\n44\n00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:43.523\nwhich makes it a little bit more\nselfish than the Steve Covey work.\n\n45\n00:02:43.523 --> 00:02:46.860\nCuz the Steve Covey work\nis all about giving, right?\n\n46\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.050\nBut if you kind of think of it, and\n\n47\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.360\nthere's a lot of motivational\nspeakers that will tell you this.\n\n48\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.820\nIf you want to be successful,\n\n49\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.260\nthen anyone that's playing into your\nsuccess make sure they're successful too.\n\n50\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.300\nSo, kind of think of CTQs in that way.\n\n51\n00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.610\nSo, a CTQ, critical to quality, critical\nto success, critical to satisfaction,\n\n52\n00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.700\nthere was a small movement in the 80s\nto call it critical to price,\n\n53\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.820\ncritical to speed,\ncritical to being better, right?\n\n54\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.469\nBut now we just use CTQ as\nkind of the umbrella term.\n\n55\n00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.702\nAll right, so if I were looking\nat the Tim Woods' model, and\n\n56\n00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:29.097\nlet's say I identified an over processing\nissue, there might be some things\n\n57\n00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:33.998\nthat are critical to quality for\nit not to be an over processing issue.\n\n58\n00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:37.896\nSo, maybe that critical to quality that\nthese people need education that they\n\n59\n00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:42.170\nshouldn't, that everyone doesn't need\nto sign that change order, right?\n\n60\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.640\nSo, kind of think of it\nfrom that perspective.\n\n61\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.260\nSo CTQ, critical to quality.\n\n62\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.640\nThe big thing that you want to know for\n\n63\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.380\nthe exam,\ncustomer requirements are always CTQs.\n\n64\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.500\nNow, critical to quality, success,\nsatisfaction, speed, cost effectiveness.\n\n65\n00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.330\nKind of a reminder, a little early\nreminder, what I want you to do is,\n\n66\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.020\nI want you to think from the other side.\n\n67\n00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.210\nSo, for example,\nif I'm housekeeping at a hotel,\n\n68\n00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.290\nI want you to think of housekeeping\nas a voice, all right?\n\n69\n00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.022\nSo, housekeeping is a voice, and\n\n70\n00:04:14.022 --> 00:04:18.900\nthere's maybe, at the hotel I'm staying\nat, probably a dozen housekeepers.\n\n71\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.960\nBut I'm gonna think of them as a voice.\n\n72\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.886\nNow, if I'm the manager of that hotel,\nmy CTQs from the housekeeping,\n\n73\n00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:31.855\nI want rooms turned over fast,\nso I can get other patrons in.\n\n74\n00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.337\nI want them to be clean, right?\n\n75\n00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:36.130\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n\n76\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.360\n&gt;&gt; I think pretty much,\nI might have a couple of ancillary things,\n\n77\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.560\nI want to make sure that the air's not on,\nif there's no one is in the room.\n\n78\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.680\nStuff like that,\ncuz why should I be heating or\n\n79\n00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.780\nair conditioning a room if\nI don't even have a guest?\n\n80\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.770\nRight, so there might be some\nof those ancillary things.\n\n81\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.270\nBut if I were housekeeping,\nand housekeeping could speak,\n\n82\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.590\nwhat's critical to their success\nto make that happen for me?\n\n83\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.790\nWhat do they need from me?\n\n84\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.590\n&gt;&gt; The proper supplies,\nthe cleaning materials, proper,\n\n85\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.910\nI guess linens would kind of\nfall under that category.\n\n86\n00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.564\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; What else would they need?\n\n87\n00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:14.660\nMaybe any kind of training on the ways\nthat they want something performed.\n\n88\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and probably in the form\nof training, just an expectation list.\n\n89\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I stay at hotels fairly regularly, and\n\n90\n00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.070\nI can tell you the housekeepers\nthat have just a list.\n\n91\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.240\n[LAUGH] I mean, some are just better.\n\n92\n00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.260\nEven at the same hotel stay, I can come in\nand my room might not be as clean, right?\n\n93\n00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.410\nOkay, so the theory in\nLean Six Sigma is that it is my job.\n\n94\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.210\nIf I'm the manager of that hotel,\nand I want rooms turned over,\n\n95\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.420\nI want them turned over fast, I want them\nto be clean, I want everything to work,\n\n96\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.420\nthat yeah, it is my job to make sure that\nhousekeeping has everything they need.\n\n97\n00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.560\nNow, I don't have to physically have\nto go and get them their linens, or\n\n98\n00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.540\ntheir supplies, or even, I might have\nsomeone else make up a checklist that\n\n99\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.920\nhas more of a subject matter expertise.\n\n100\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.400\nBut bottom line,\nthe idea is that yeah, it is my job.\n\n101\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.540\nIf I wanna be successful,\nif I wanna make things better,\n\n102\n00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.670\nfaster, more cost effective, I can't\nwalk around going, well I did my part.\n\n103\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I said what I wanted.\n\n104\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.410\nOkay, so let's do another one.\n\n105\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.720\nRental car agency.\n\n106\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.535\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n107\n00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:22.720\nif I go to the rental car agency,\nwhat I want is a clean car.\n\n108\n00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.140\nI want to get it fast,\nI want it to have gas in it.\n\n109\n00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm sorry, I'm laughing.\n\n110\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.540\nI just have never had good\nexperiences with rental car agencies.\n\n111\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\nif you were the rental car agency,\n\n112\n00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.370\nif the rental car agency could speak,\nand you know what I want as a customer?\n\n113\n00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.350\nWhat's critical to quality\nif the rental agency?\n\n114\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Well, for sure on time,\n\n115\n00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.176\nthat's one of the main reason\nwhy you're getting a rental car.\n\n116\n00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.250\nI was stranded somewhere with my child for\n\n117\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.424\na very long time because they just,\nthey never showed up on time.\n\n118\n00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:54.050\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; That was a huge problem.\n\n119\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is, and so you're CTQ is\nyou're not gonna be stranded, right?\n\n120\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.427\nThat's a CTQ, but if you were thinking\nfrom the perspective of the rental\n\n121\n00:07:03.427 --> 00:07:08.291\ncar agency, so kinda think I am the,\nand I have a voice, I'm a person.\n\n122\n00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.550\nWhat do I need from you?\n\n123\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.470\n&gt;&gt; I wanna have decent vehicles.\n\n124\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, I want nice vehicles, perfect.\n\n125\n00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.300\nWhat's another here?\n\n126\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.981\n&gt;&gt; Clean vehicles.\n\n127\n00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:18.356\n&gt;&gt; I want them clean,\nthey need to be clean.\n\n128\n00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:19.047\n&gt;&gt; Insured.\n\n129\n00:07:19.047 --> 00:07:22.866\n&gt;&gt; Insured, and then what do I want\nspecifically from you as a customer?\n\n130\n00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:24.530\n&gt;&gt; Gas [LAUGH].\n\n131\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.900\n&gt;&gt; I wanna make sure there's\ngas on the property.\n\n132\n00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.990\nWhat do I need you as\na customer to tell me?\n\n133\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.300\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI know they always ask about the mileage.\n\n134\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.290\nIs that we're, [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n135\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.890\nSo I need to know those kinds of things.\n\n136\n00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.830\nAnd I need to know when you wanna pick\nthe car up, what kind of car you want.\n\n137\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.940\nThose types of things, right?\n\n138\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.620\n&gt;&gt; Accommodations.\n\n139\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.320\n&gt;&gt; Accommodations, okay, so\nwe're gonna do just two more.\n\n140\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; I'm a supermarket.\n\n141\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.636\nOkay, so I'm the patron,\nI go to the supermarket.\n\n142\n00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:51.566\nI really don't like going\nto the supermarket,\n\n143\n00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:53.476\nbut I just wanna get in and out.\n\n144\n00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:56.969\nI wanna be safe, I'm gonna wanna\npark in a nice, safe place.\n\n145\n00:07:56.969 --> 00:07:57.911\n&gt;&gt; Well-lit area.\n\n146\n00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.575\nI want to get checked out quickly.\n\n147\n00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:06.040\nI want variety but not so\nmuch variety that I'm overwhelmed.\n\n148\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.480\nBut if you were the supermarket and\nthe supermarket could speak,\n\n149\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.750\nwhat does it want from you as\na customer to be successful?\n\n150\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.670\n&gt;&gt; Your money?\n\n151\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.976\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I want your money, right?\n\n152\n00:08:17.976 --> 00:08:21.100\nSo I don't want bad checks, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.846\nI don't want, although hardly\nanybody writes checks anymore.\n\n154\n00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:23.539\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n155\n00:08:23.539 --> 00:08:25.013\n&gt;&gt; But I want your credit card.\n\n156\n00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:28.437\n&gt;&gt; Identification, if you're\npurchasing any kind of adult beverage.\n\n157\n00:08:28.437 --> 00:08:33.840\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, exactly, that kind\nof stuff, right, to be successful.\n\n158\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.960\nSo the idea behind Lean Six Sigma is that\nwhatever you're trying to make better,\n\n159\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.620\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n160\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.940\nIf I'm the manager of a supermarket and\n\n161\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.730\nI'm trying to make that supermarket\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n162\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.580\nThen I need to also think from\nthe voice of the supermarket.\n\n163\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.380\nIf I were the supermarket, what do I need?\n\n164\n00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.954\nAnd then I need to make sure\nthat those things are happening.\n\n165\n00:08:54.954 --> 00:08:55.674\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n166\n00:08:55.674 --> 00:08:59.530\nNow like I said, some obvious CTQs,\nlike what does the customer want.\n\n167\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.490\nIf the customer comes every day and\nsays you're out of, like in Texas,\n\n168\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.414\nwe have this drink called Big Red.\n\n169\n00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:09.630\nAnd you can get diet Big Red,\nit taste kind of like bubble gum.\n\n170\n00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.705\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; So if you keep going and asking for\n\n171\n00:09:11.705 --> 00:09:13.763\nthis product, that's a CTQ right.\n\n172\n00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:16.772\nIf you get enough people asking for\nsome offbeat product like,\n\n173\n00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:20.817\nwhy aren't you carrying this kind of\nbutter or, right, that's definitely a CTQ.\n\n174\n00:09:20.817 --> 00:09:25.414\nBut you wanna stretch your brain\na little bit past that and say,\n\n175\n00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:29.590\nif I were a supermarket and\nI could speak, what do I want?\n\n176\n00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.670\nWell, I want floors that aren't slippery.\n\n177\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n178\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.630\nAll those things, and\nyou'll be writing all of this stuff down.\n\n179\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.290\nNot that there aren't things\nyou're gonna take off your list.\n\n180\n00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.520\nThis is just a brainstorming, remember.\n\n181\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.540\nA structured brainstorming kind\nof way to critically think.\n\n182\n00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.640\nAnd then if there's something that\nkeeps coming up, then you know hey,\n\n183\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.580\nthat's a CTQ I need to pay attention to.\n\n184\n00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.030\nAll right, so we'll do one more,\nhospital emergency room.\n\n185\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.200\nSo certainly, if I cut my finger and\n\n186\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.070\nI go into the hospital emergency room,\nI want attention fast.\n\n187\n00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.870\nI don't wanna get [INAUDIBLE] infection.\n\n188\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.707\nThat's the infection that you get like\nyou didn't have it before you went into\n\n189\n00:10:08.707 --> 00:10:12.230\nthe hospital and\nsomebody with dirty hands touched you.\n\n190\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.418\n&gt;&gt; So cleanliness, proper triage.\n\n191\n00:10:13.418 --> 00:10:17.234\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Proper education from their staff for\n\n192\n00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:18.320\nsure.\n\n193\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.270\n&gt;&gt; And I want a place to park where\nI can not worry that my car's\n\n194\n00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.190\ngoing to get towed off while I'm in the\nemergency room getting my hand bandaged.\n\n195\n00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.238\nSo if I were the hospital emergency\nroom though and I could speak.\n\n196\n00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:37.333\nSo I'm all the staff, I'm the brick and\nmortar, I'm everything, and\n\n197\n00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:41.850\nI'm the hospital emergency room and\nI want to be successful, what would I say?\n\n198\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Low temperatures to reduce\nthe amount of bacterias,\n\n199\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.320\nit's always cold there, right?\n\n200\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.110\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n201\n00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.410\n&gt;&gt; A fully stocked, with their equipment.\n\n202\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.280\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n203\n00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, fully staffed.\n\n204\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.310\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n205\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Really just a clean environment.\n\n206\n00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n207\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.139\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if I'm managing\nthat hospital emergency room,\n\n208\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.820\nI can pretty much say I can put\nmyself in the place of the patient.\n\n209\n00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.801\nBecause maybe I'd be a patient\nmyself even though I'm the manager.\n\n210\n00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.464\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] experience, right.\n\n211\n00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:13.190\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I've got that down.\n\n212\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.444\nAnd all of those things are so important\ncuz I need to check those out if I'm\n\n213\n00:11:16.444 --> 00:11:19.370\ntrying to be better, faster,\nmore cost effective.\n\n214\n00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.580\nBut where I want to stretch as a Lean Six\nSigma person is I want to think well,\n\n215\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.180\nif a hospital emergency room\ncould speak what would it say?\n\n216\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.730\nAnd then I want to check\nthose things out too,\n\n217\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.660\nbecause there may be a possible\nprocess improvement.\n\n218\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.520\nThere may be something in that mix\nthat I can make better, faster,\n\n219\n00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.880\nmore cost effective.\n\n220\n00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.340\nAnd to Cherokee's point, there may be\nsome low-lying fruit that I'm just not\n\n221\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.140\nthinking about because I'm not\nthinking from that perspective.\n\n222\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.230\nThere might be some things\nthat I can knock out.\n\n223\n00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.790\nNow the advantage of knocking\nout the low-lying fruit, and\n\n224\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.380\nthat's stuff that you can fix right away.\n\n225\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.850\nYou don't have to do a project,\nyou just can go fix it.\n\n226\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.880\nIs that it increases your credibility\nas a process improvement person.\n\n227\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.070\nSo the more of those kinds\nof things you can do,\n\n228\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.860\nespecially the visual ones,\nthe better off, right.\n\n229\n00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.480\nOkay, so another way if you're\ntrying to think of what CTQs,\n\n230\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.780\nyou're trying to flesh it\nout a little bit more.\n\n231\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.991\nYou can use something called a CTQ Tree.\n\n232\n00:12:11.991 --> 00:12:16.360\nAnd I'm gonna put and example to this to\nmake it a little easier to understand.\n\n233\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.010\nBut right now,\n\n234\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.270\nI would put the need sort of like that at\nthe head of the fish, what is the problem.\n\n235\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.640\nIn this case, I would put,\nwhat is the need.\n\n236\n00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.730\nAnd then I would say,\nwhat drives that need.\n\n237\n00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.700\nAnd then from the drivers,\nwhat are the requirements.\n\n238\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.440\nAnd then those requirements\nwould become my CTQs.\n\n239\n00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.420\nSo if I'm trying to think it out, another\nway of processing CTQs would be like this.\n\n240\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.671\nSo for example, if where it says need,\n\n241\n00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:46.411\nif what I had was a better\ncoffee experience, all right.\n\n242\n00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.940\nI want a better coffee experience.\n\n243\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.800\nSo I have coffee every day,\nI want a better experience.\n\n244\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.020\nSo my drivers, let's see if we have any.\n\n245\n00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.110\nWhoops, we don't.\n\n246\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.900\nOkay, so we're just gonna have to\ncome up with these on our own.\n\n247\n00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.200\n[LAUGH] I think we'll do fine, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.470\nSo part of my better coffee experience\nis maybe I want a pretty place to\n\n249\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.290\nhave coffee.\n\n250\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.940\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so what would be another driver?\n\n251\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.695\n&gt;&gt; I can think of one.\n\n252\n00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:14.830\nHere off of, [LAUGH] Newberry,\nthe Starbucks is always, always passed.\n\n253\n00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.580\nI've even seen baristas in\ntheir aprons directing traffic.\n\n254\n00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.468\nSo, I wanna make sure that there's not\na 30 minute wait, because normally it's in\n\n255\n00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.494\nthe morning before work and\nI don't wanna be late to work, right?\n\n256\n00:13:25.494 --> 00:13:28.149\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so we've got two drivers.\n\n257\n00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:30.315\nI want a nice pretty\nplace to have my coffee,\n\n258\n00:13:30.315 --> 00:13:34.090\nI want a place that's not crowded\nthat I can get in and out, right?\n\n259\n00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.090\nAnd then another driver,\nalmost always, a driver and\n\n260\n00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.510\nyou might think of some other ones but\nalmost always a driver is price.\n\n261\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.680\nI want a reasonably priced cup of coffee..\n\n262\n00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.773\n&gt;&gt; I'm such a nerd,\nI was thinking enough bandwidth.\n\n263\n00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:49.410\nBecause most coffee offer free WiFi,\nright?\n\n264\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.138\n&gt;&gt; And that could be driver four.\n\n265\n00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:52.922\nWe only have three drivers\nin our diagram but\n\n266\n00:13:52.922 --> 00:13:56.370\nif you have more drivers,\nthat's okay, right?\n\n267\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.060\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n268\n00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.120\nwhat we're trying to get to is the CTQ,\n\n269\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.210\nthe critical to quality,\nwhat are the requirements.\n\n270\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.575\nSo first I say what is the need.\n\n271\n00:14:05.575 --> 00:14:06.570\nBetter coffee experience.\n\n272\n00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.900\nWell then, what are the drivers?\n\n273\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.140\nAnd then we said pretty, price,\nnot crowded, bandwidth, right?\n\n274\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.310\nSo then you take each one of those and\nyou would go what would facilitate that?\n\n275\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.980\nSo price is a little bit more solid,\nright?\n\n276\n00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:27.430\nSo the critical to quality requirement for\nprice, I could almost transfer over.\n\n277\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.190\nIt could almost be without\nhaving to think that extra step.\n\n278\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.920\nBut what are some things\nthat play into price?\n\n279\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Your competitors' prices.\n\n280\n00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.200\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, absolutely.\n\n281\n00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.830\nSo critical to quality is that I need\nto know my competitor's prices, right?\n\n282\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.515\nWhen I'm thinking about price,\nand I think we're all this way,\n\n283\n00:14:45.515 --> 00:14:49.941\nis that we don't really mind paying extra\nif we get something in quality back.\n\n284\n00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:51.927\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean there are some people out,\n\n285\n00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:55.550\nthat we're always looking for\nthe best deal or the cheapest deal.\n\n286\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.530\nBut I think as a rule, most of us\nare saying I just want to pay for\n\n287\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.230\nthe level of quality I get.\n\n288\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.760\nSo if I get a nice cup of coffee,\nand it's easy to win me over.\n\n289\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.650\nThey give me a napkin, or a,\nthey had stevia at our coffee shop.\n\n290\n00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.565\nThey've got a customer, right?\n\n291\n00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:16.155\nOkay, so let's say the driver\nis a little less tangible.\n\n292\n00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:18.043\nBecause pretty,\na pretty place to have coffee.\n\n293\n00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.269\n&gt;&gt; We might have different\nperspectives on that.\n\n294\n00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:20.439\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] what pretty is, right?\n\n295\n00:15:20.439 --> 00:15:24.740\nOkay, so sometimes when you're working\nwith things that are a little intangible\n\n296\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.183\nlike that,\nyou have to come up with more CTQs.\n\n297\n00:15:27.183 --> 00:15:30.580\nBecause it's not as definitive as price,\nright?\n\n298\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.590\nOkay, so, pretty, so\nwhat would be a driver of pretty?\n\n299\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.190\nWhat do you consider\npretty in a coffee place?\n\n300\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Maybe spacious, like an open\nfloor plan or something like that.\n\n301\n00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n302\n00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.850\nAnd then I might think of color.\n\n303\n00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.830\nI want a soft color or\nsomething like that.\n\n304\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.343\nSo, I mean,\nI think you kind of get the gist of this.\n\n305\n00:15:50.343 --> 00:15:52.388\nAnd this is just if you\ncan't think of the CTQ.\n\n306\n00:15:52.388 --> 00:15:55.892\nCuz sometimes you come right up,\nyou know what's critical to quality,\n\n307\n00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:57.392\nwhat's critical to success.\n\n308\n00:15:57.392 --> 00:16:01.626\nBut if you need a little help, one of the\nstrategies that you can use, is you can go\n\n309\n00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:06.073\nback to models like Tim Woods and say,\nokay, what's critical to transportation?\n\n310\n00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:07.610\nWhat's critical to inventory?\n\n311\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.400\nWhat's critical to motion?\n\n312\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.610\nAnother strategy that you can take is\nthinking from the voices standpoint.\n\n313\n00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.770\nIf I were housekeeping,\nif I were the emergency room.\n\n314\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.940\nAnd yet another way to come up with CTQs,\n\n315\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.710\nand keep in mind if you come up with them\nright away, you don't need these, right?\n\n316\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.130\nIt's leaner just to write them down.\n\n317\n00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:29.470\nBut if you're kind of in\na situation where you can't think,\n\n318\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.720\nanother thing that you could do is\na CTQ tree where you put the need.\n\n319\n00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.914\nAnd then you say well\nwhat drives that need.\n\n320\n00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:37.055\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] From the drivers.\n\n321\n00:16:37.055 --> 00:16:37.720\n&gt;&gt; Than the CTQ.\n\n322\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.250\nSo it's just a way to help\nyour critical thought.\n\n323\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.630\nBecause Lean Six Sigma believes\na lot of the answers are inside you,\n\n324\n00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.450\nyou just need some help structuring them.\n\n325\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n326\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.830\n&gt;&gt; So now that brings us to voices.\n\n327\n00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.440\nAnd we've already talked\na little bit about this.\n\n328\n00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.160\nLean Six Sigma for example, if I were\ntrying to improve a customer service form.\n\n329\n00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.261\nWhat are those forms that you\nsee when you go to fast food or\n\n330\n00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:06.090\nto a restaurant,\nthat says how can we do better?\n\n331\n00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.910\n&gt;&gt; Like a survey?\n\n332\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.831\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like a survey.\n\n333\n00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:08.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n334\n00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.610\nthey have something on the table\nwill you fill up this survey for us?\n\n335\n00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:17.230\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; Now Lean Six Sigma says the best way to\n\n336\n00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.240\nimprove that form is to kind of\nthink of yourself as the form.\n\n337\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.150\nIf I were a customer service form or\nsurvey, what do I need to be successful?\n\n338\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.040\nNow in my age group,\nthe print needs to be kinda bigger.\n\n339\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.870\nYou know when the print's really tiny\nI'm not gonna fill that out, right?\n\n340\n00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.490\nSo what is important to\nthe success of the form?\n\n341\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.830\nSo for me the font being large enough.\n\n342\n00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.980\nWhat are some other things that\nmight make your form successful?\n\n343\n00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.740\n&gt;&gt; Accessibility or trendiness,\nso if I have like a QR code and\n\n344\n00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.670\nI just scan it with my smartphone or\ngo to their website.\n\n345\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.040\nThen they could fill it out very easily.\n\n346\n00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so and that's thinking\nfrom the standpoint of the form.\n\n347\n00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.590\nIf I'm the form,\nwhat's gonna make me successful?\n\n348\n00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.330\nAnother example would be incentives.\n\n349\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.550\nMy father.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n350\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.590\n&gt;&gt; My father loves to go to Chili's.\n\n351\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.510\nAnd if the Chili's that he goes to in San\nAntonio, I don't know if they all do this,\n\n352\n00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.250\nbut the one he goes to, if you fill\nout that customer service form,\n\n353\n00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.140\nnext time you come back,\nyou get free nachos.\n\n354\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it's like, hey.\n\n355\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.552\n&gt;&gt; Who doesn't like free nachos?\n\n356\n00:18:20.552 --> 00:18:24.360\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so but the idea is,\nI'm thinking from this standpoint.\n\n357\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.310\nIf I were the form and the form could\nspeak, what do I need to be successful?\n\n358\n00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.310\nAnd if I'm trying to do\na process improvement, and\n\n359\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.940\nI want to make that form better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n360\n00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.980\nI know what I think should be on the form.\n\n361\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.070\nBut if I think from the form standpoint\nof view, I might be more successful.\n\n362\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.980\n&gt;&gt; A little more open minded maybe or\nthinking outside the box there.\n\n363\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n364\n00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.530\nSo, moving on from there.\n\n365\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.770\nThere are four primary voices,\nother than just thinking.\n\n366\n00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.530\nThis table has a voice.\n\n367\n00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.980\nThis book has a voice.\n\n368\n00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.665\nRight?\n\n369\n00:18:55.665 --> 00:18:59.685\nThere are four primary voices, and\n\n370\n00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:04.647\nthose voices are VOC, VOE, VOP, and VOB.\n\n371\n00:19:04.647 --> 00:19:06.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now VOC,\n\n372\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.610\nwhich is voice of the customer,\nis the one we hear all the time.\n\n373\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:16.700\nHowever there is a belief in Lean Six\nSigma that one of the reasons why we have\n\n374\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.330\nlost a little bit of ground is because\nwe forgot how important the customer is.\n\n375\n00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.430\nLean Six Sigma puts all of\nthe emphasis on the customer.\n\n376\n00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.210\nIf the customer doesn't get what they\nthink they want, then you have lost it.\n\n377\n00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.435\nYears ago the customer\nwas always right but now.\n\n378\n00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:36.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not so much.\n\n379\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n380\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.330\nIT has even a special challenge\nbecause sometimes a customer asks for\n\n381\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.150\nsomething and\nthey have no clue what they're asking for.\n\n382\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.105\nSo, or they don't realize how complicated\nit is because they watched a bunch of\n\n383\n00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:49.970\nsci-fi movies.\n\n384\n00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.290\nAnd they've come in and they said,\nwell, I just need this.\n\n385\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.700\n&gt;&gt; Or how unsecure it is,\nhow it defies your security policy, and.\n\n386\n00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.504\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n387\n00:19:57.504 --> 00:19:58.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All of those things.\n\n388\n00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:01.570\nSo, It is hard to recognize\nthe voice of the customer.\n\n389\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.120\nThe big thing about voice of the customer\n\n390\n00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.060\nthat's on all of the exams is that we\nhave internal and external customers.\n\n391\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.870\nAnd I think that's something\nwe've probably all heard, but\n\n392\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.590\njust to kinda stay cognizant your internal\ncustomers are anyone you have to keep\n\n393\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.160\nhappy inside the company.\n\n394\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.200\nThis is the fastest way to think about it.\n\n395\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.740\nExternal people are, customers\nare people that play into your company,\n\n396\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.350\nbuy your product, that type of thing.\n\n397\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n398\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.880\n&gt;&gt; So that's a big thing\nabout voice of the customer.\n\n399\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.050\nThe second one, VOE, stands for\nvoice of the employee.\n\n400\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:40.010\nNow the thing that Lean Six Sigma\ndoes differently than Lean by itself,\n\n401\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.590\nwell Lean by itself does\na little bit of this, but\n\n402\n00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:47.440\nSix Sigma doesn't really mention it\nas much, is voice of the employee.\n\n403\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.960\nAnd why the voice of the employee is so\nimportant to the success of the business.\n\n404\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.340\nCan you think of why do we really need\nto listen to the voice of the employee?\n\n405\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.150\n&gt;&gt; If the employee becomes disgruntled,\n\n406\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.830\nthey're not gonna put\nforth as much effort.\n\n407\n00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.430\nEspecially if you see any kind\nof external promotions and\n\n408\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.910\nthen hiring external rather than promoting\nthe people who've already been there that\n\n409\n00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.250\nhave tenure and they've been devoting\na lot of their time to that company.\n\n410\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, so And\nsometimes a voice of the employee might,\n\n411\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.210\nbecause they're touching\nthe process all the time,\n\n412\n00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.200\nthey might know-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n413\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.490\n&gt;&gt; Information that I don't have, right?\n\n414\n00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.700\nSo the next one is VOP,\nwhich stands for voice of the process.\n\n415\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.070\nAnd this goes back to that\ninanimate object thing.\n\n416\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.990\nIf you're asking the process something\nto do that it's not capable of doing,\n\n417\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.520\nremember we had that whole\nsession on process capability.\n\n418\n00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.040\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then\n\n419\n00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.600\nwe have to address that right then.\n\n420\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.510\nIs the process even capable of doing that?\n\n421\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:48.490\nSo just to make it a simple example,\nif you have a printer and\n\n422\n00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:53.350\nthe printer has the capability of\nprocessing 11 pages per minute, but\n\n423\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.250\nyou want it to produce\n20 pages per minute,\n\n424\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.220\nit doesn't have that capability\nwithout extra hardware.\n\n425\n00:21:59.220 --> 00:21:59.960\n&gt;&gt; Hardware.\n\n426\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.160\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nlistening to the voice of the process, And\n\n427\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.430\nthe voice of the process can\ntell us a whole lot of things.\n\n428\n00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.590\nI just watched The Wizard of Oz last\nnight again for like the hundredth time.\n\n429\n00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.720\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\nThat's a great movie.\n\n430\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.830\n&gt;&gt; And the voice of the process\ncan be seen like the wicked witch,\n\n431\n00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:14.845\nhelp me I'm melting.\n\n432\n00:22:14.845 --> 00:22:17.060\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But the voice of the process could be\n\n433\n00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.150\ntelling us other things.\n\n434\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.830\nCan you think of anything, Cherokee,\n\n435\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.300\nthat if the process could speak,\nother things it might be telling us?\n\n436\n00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.680\n&gt;&gt; Well let's think about this for\na second.\n\n437\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.650\nThe process might say that,\nhey not enough people know about me.\n\n438\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.265\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n439\n00:22:31.265 --> 00:22:34.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No one understands the process.\n\n440\n00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.025\nThey haven't been told the process.\n\n441\n00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:42.290\nAnd you would be amazed in business how\nmany stellar processes are in place,\n\n442\n00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.640\nbut no one knows the rules.\n\n443\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's a big one.\n\n444\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.470\nIt could also be telling\nus things like I'm broken.\n\n445\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.040\nI'm old.\n\n446\n00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All those kinds of things.\n\n447\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.190\n&gt;&gt; I'm too confusing.\n\n448\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.360\n&gt;&gt; I'm too confusing.\n\n449\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.920\nThat's a big one.\n\n450\n00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.460\nOkay and\nthen finally it's voice of the business.\n\n451\n00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.750\nAnd this one's a little tricky\nbecause when it shows up on an exam,\n\n452\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:07.250\nbecause we keep talking about voices and\nthe inanimate object.\n\n453\n00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.950\nIt would be easier to think that voice of\nthe business would be your business which\n\n454\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.730\nI think it's cool, that will be\nmore like the voice of the culture.\n\n455\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:17.980\nAnd I think that's really huge when you\nare trying to make a process improvement\n\n456\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.630\nto think of the company,\nwhat is the company voice?\n\n457\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.380\nWhat are they saying?\n\n458\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.040\nWhat are their goals?\n\n459\n00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.870\nHowever voice of the business\ntraditionally and\n\n460\n00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.320\non the test, really means more\nlike voice of the industry.\n\n461\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.920\nWhat is the industry telling us?\n\n462\n00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:38.180\nSo the industry could be telling us things\nabout our product, such as compliance\n\n463\n00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.735\nlike, that's a really great process\nimprovement, but it's illegal.\n\n464\n00:23:41.735 --> 00:23:42.753\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n465\n00:23:42.753 --> 00:23:46.407\nthere's some things that\nit could be telling us.\n\n466\n00:23:46.407 --> 00:23:48.611\nCan we think of any other types of things?\n\n467\n00:23:48.611 --> 00:23:50.492\nI want you guys to be\nthinking out there too.\n\n468\n00:23:50.492 --> 00:23:53.123\nWhat are some of the things\nthat the industry,\n\n469\n00:23:53.123 --> 00:23:57.680\nour industry might be telling us\nabout our product or our service?\n\n470\n00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.910\n&gt;&gt; Sure, I actually, and I'm just\ngoing off of past experiences here.\n\n471\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:06.260\nI also worked for a newspaper company and\nit's kind of a dying art because people,\n\n472\n00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.770\nbecause of the Internet,they're really\nreaching out to other methods to\n\n473\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.520\nget that real time news.\n\n474\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:17.130\nSo maybe there might be some alternatives\nfor that company to still continue.\n\n475\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, that's really good.\n\n476\n00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.140\nYeah, I like that example.\n\n477\n00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.680\nSo voice of the industry,\nwhat is the industry telling you?\n\n478\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.040\nThe industry could be\ntelling you it's outdated and\n\n479\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.590\nthat you need to come up with different\nmedia to get your message out.\n\n480\n00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:35.960\nSo a lot of times like I said\ncompliance issues, that type of thing.\n\n481\n00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.700\nSo those are the four primary voices.\n\n482\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.490\nThe nice thing about we're just looking\nat the voice of the customer questions.\n\n483\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.720\nThis is a handout that you receive\nin your student package so\n\n484\n00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.250\nI'm not expecting you to read or\nmemorize any of this stuff.\n\n485\n00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.570\nIt's just some ideas of what you\nmight want to ask a customer.\n\n486\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.010\nWhat I think is kinda cool about\nthe voice of the customer,\n\n487\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:01.810\nvoice of the employee is that you can use\nthe same tools to gather up information.\n\n488\n00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.310\nSo if I wanna know what my customer is\nthinking or my employee is thinking,\n\n489\n00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.680\nwhat are some ways I could\nget that information?\n\n490\n00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.870\nI could do.\n\n491\n00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.368\n&gt;&gt; So let me just clarify.\n\n492\n00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:13.680\nYou just said voice of my customer or\nvoice of my employee, but if we have\n\n493\n00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:19.970\na separate VOE, what differentiates VOC\nemployee versus VOE, if that makes sense?\n\n494\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:23.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so voice of the customer\nwould be your external customer or\n\n495\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.740\nyour internal customer that\nyou have to report to.\n\n496\n00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.670\nVoice of the employee would be\nactually the worker people.\n\n497\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.840\nThe people that are actually\nemployed there.\n\n498\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.756\n&gt;&gt; Just making sure.\n\n499\n00:25:33.756 --> 00:25:34.586\n&gt;&gt; Yeah this is for customer.\n\n500\n00:25:34.586 --> 00:25:35.789\nLike when we are talking about tools.\n\n501\n00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:39.798\nBut when we are talking about tools like\nhow to get this information, we can use\n\n502\n00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:44.000\nthe same tools to get the information\nfrom customers that we do from employees.\n\n503\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have taken internal surveys.\n\n504\n00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:46.810\n&gt;&gt; Surveys, right.\n\n505\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.980\n&gt;&gt; We have talked about using surveys for\ncustomers but\n\n506\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.980\nas employees I have also done surveys, so.\n\n507\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.740\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n508\n00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.140\nSo surveys, interviews, small forums.\n\n509\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.130\nSo the vehicle to get the information\nthat you need is pretty much the same.\n\n510\n00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.250\nAnd these are just some things that\nyou might wanna ask your customer.\n\n511\n00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:08.470\nSo when we're looking at what voice\nof the customer or employee, even\n\n512\n00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.650\nthough that's not what the slide says,\nhere are some things that could happen.\n\n513\n00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:17.150\nWe could improve our quality,\nwe could reduce errors, we could\n\n514\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.500\neliminate ambiguity, which is what you\nwere saying about, it's just so confusing.\n\n515\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.880\nAll right, we could eliminate the unknown,\nwe could improve data integrity.\n\n516\n00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.710\nSo by paying attention to the customer and\nthe employee,\n\n517\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:36.050\nthese are really incredible things that we\ncould determine, by a survey sometimes.\n\n518\n00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:40.110\nSometimes by, my goodness, it is\npicking up the phone and asking them.\n\n519\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.160\n&gt;&gt; Well I know just recently we\nhad a survey here at IT ProTV,\n\n520\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.450\nsome of you guys and\ngals may even receive this survey.\n\n521\n00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.880\nIt was a one question survey and\n\n522\n00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.690\nit just said what could we\ndo to our site to improve?\n\n523\n00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:53.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n524\n00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.820\neven little things like that\ncould potentially help.\n\n525\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I love those kinds\nof surveys that are one question.\n\n526\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.470\nWhat I don't like are those ones that will\nonly take you five minutes to fill out\n\n527\n00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.980\nthis survey.\n\n528\n00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.529\nAnd like question 30\nyour start [CROSSTALK].\n\n529\n00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:05.210\n&gt;&gt; They lie.\n\n530\n00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.029\n&gt;&gt; To believe it anymore.\n\n531\n00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:10.330\n[LAUGH] So, some other things that\nvoice of the customer can do and\n\n532\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.710\nsome of these also apply to voice of the\nemployee it that you can improve delivery,\n\n533\n00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.030\nidentify true dates of delivery,\nshorten turn around time.\n\n534\n00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:23.190\nI know you guys can read all these, so\nI'm just kinda going quickly through them.\n\n535\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.360\nHelp set priorities and organize tasks.\n\n536\n00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.290\nIt's just,\n\n537\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:33.950\nwe forget that the customer as well as our\nemployees have all kinds of information.\n\n538\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.740\nWe're out there trying to do process\nimprovement and our most obvious voice\n\n539\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.610\nthat we should be listening to is\nthe customer and the employee, right?\n\n540\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:47.290\nNow when we're trying to get the voice of\nthe customer, we can just do our homework.\n\n541\n00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.840\nThere's some things that we can look at.\n\n542\n00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.420\nFor example, we can look at the statement\nof work, we can look at purchase orders.\n\n543\n00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.300\nWe can look at requests for quotes.\n\n544\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.780\nEven if we don't get the job,\nwhat are people asking for?\n\n545\n00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.900\nWhy didn't we get it?\n\n546\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.330\nRight?\nSo sometimes,\n\n547\n00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:08.290\na lot of times when a customer\nrequests a quote from us or\n\n548\n00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.980\na bid and we don't get the job, then it's\njust yeah, well, we didn't get that one.\n\n549\n00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.170\nBut if there's a lot of repetitive\nrequests and we're not getting them.\n\n550\n00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.150\nWell, you know why, right?\n\n551\n00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.540\nAnd then technical specifications.\n\n552\n00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:25.370\nWhen I'm looking at voice of the customer,\nand this kind of plays into a concept\n\n553\n00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:31.960\ncalled House of Quality, and the deal\nis that the customer wants some thing.\n\n554\n00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.960\nAnd I have to make sure I have\nthe technical requirements to fulfill\n\n555\n00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.030\nthat, right?\n\n556\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.160\nSo going on with the voices,\nvoice of the employee.\n\n557\n00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.510\nA lot of times you want to think\nemployee engagement as well.\n\n558\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.970\nIf the employee is getting that\nlittle bit more of attention,\n\n559\n00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.240\nyou know that they might be more engaged.\n\n560\n00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.270\nVoice of the Business, I just wanna remind\nyou that that means compliance like\n\n561\n00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.630\nlooking at compliance and trends and\nthings such of that nature.\n\n562\n00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.960\nAnd then Voice of the Process,\n\n563\n00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.470\nwe always wanna make sure\nthat the process is capable.\n\n564\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.530\nSo I just wanna kinda tie\nall of this together.\n\n565\n00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.090\nWe had a part one and part two of ways,\nCTQs and voices, right?\n\n566\n00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The idea is that CTQ and\n\n567\n00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:14.310\nvoices can be used in\nconjunction with Tim Woods.\n\n568\n00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:18.920\nSo if I were trying to look at\ntransportation issues, let's\n\n569\n00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.940\nsay I wasn't using it as a pure waste\nmodel, I am just trying to look at issues.\n\n570\n00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.200\nWell, what are the voice of the customer?\n\n571\n00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.240\nWhat is the voice of the employee\nabout that transportation issue?\n\n572\n00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.120\nWhat is the process?\n\n573\n00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.430\nWhat is the business,\nthe industry, in other words?\n\n574\n00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:37.070\nI could be looking at it\nfrom a CTQ standpoint.\n\n575\n00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:41.390\nWhat does transportation need\nfrom me to be successful?\n\n576\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.890\nSo you'll also notice that we're gonna\nuse CTQ and Voices on other models, but\n\n577\n00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.440\nthe first model was Tim Wood's.\n\n578\n00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I don't think it's\nnecessarily a bad thing now if you say,\n\n579\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.038\nI hear voices that really aren't there.\n\n580\n00:29:54.038 --> 00:29:55.850\n[LAUGH] Inanimate objects.\n\n581\n00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.030\nPeople might look at you strange but\nif they have watched this video, then I'm\n\n582\n00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:03.360\nsure they will understand because you have\ncovered that as well as CTQs in depth.\n\n583\n00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.680\nI appreciate that and I appreciate you for\nstaying tuned, but don't go anywhere.\n\n584\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.540\nWe do have a lot more headed your way,\nso stay tuned.\n\n585\n00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.880\nBut I am going to go ahead and\nwrap up for this episode and\n\n586\n00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.560\nsign off as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n587\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.080\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.825\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification preperation series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:19.850\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.350\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna\nbe looking at suppliers inputs.\n\n7\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.280\nWhat's next?\n\n8\n00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.010\nProcesses, outputs, customers,\nand yes, that's a mouthful,\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.490\nso that's why we normally just say SIPOC.\n\n10\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.620\nWith us today in studios we have Dr.\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.720\nTerra Vanzant Stern to really explain and\nbreak down SIPOC.\n\n12\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.620\nSo thank you for\nbeing with us today, Doctor.\n\n13\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.900\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.635\nI'm looking forward to explaining SIPOC.\n\n15\n00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:45.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And this one's pretty easy.\n\n16\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.302\nWe know where to start, right?\n\n17\n00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:49.068\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; With the S, suppliers, so-\n\n18\n00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:51.544\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n19\n00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:53.940\n[LAUGH] Okay.\n\n20\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.770\nSo, in this session,\nwe're gonna talk about SIPOC.\n\n21\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.405\nAnd then I wanna tie SIPOC to some of\nthe concepts that we've already discussed,\n\n22\n00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:04.730\nCTQs, voices, stakeholders,\nand customer analysis.\n\n23\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n24\n00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.150\nSo sometimes the SIPOC\nprocess is called COPIS.\n\n25\n00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.070\nBut SIPOC is what you're\ngonna hear on any of\n\n26\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.180\nthe Lean Six Sigma or\nLean Six Sigma exams.\n\n27\n00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.080\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n28\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.011\n&gt;&gt; But just so you know that\nsometimes it's called other things.\n\n29\n00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:31.170\nNow, SIPOC stands for suppliers,\ninput, process, output, and customer.\n\n30\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240\nAnd the first thing that I wanna point out\nis that it's structured brainstorming.\n\n31\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.600\nAnd one of the things that we said\nabout structured brainstorming is one,\n\n32\n00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.200\nyou can't do it wrong.\n\n33\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.710\nIt's just a vehicle to help you think.\n\n34\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.780\nSo who are all the suppliers involved?\n\n35\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.960\nWhat's the input, what's the process,\nthat type of thing?\n\n36\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.510\nSo it's a structured brainstorming.\n\n37\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.010\nThings can show up in multiple categories.\n\n38\n00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.950\nIf you have something\nin multiple categories,\n\n39\n00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.780\nremember, in structured brainstorming,\nthat is actually a good thing.\n\n40\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.920\nBecause that helps you prioritize\nwhat you're gonna look at.\n\n41\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.630\nAnother thing I'd like to point\nout before we get started\n\n42\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.620\nis that we were talking a lot about\nthat fishbone diagram, where we put\n\n43\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.120\nthe problem in the head of the fish, and\nthen we named the bones certain things.\n\n44\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.251\nThis is another strategy for\nnaming those major bones,\n\n45\n00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:21.392\nkeeping in mind that you could\njust name them yourself.\n\n46\n00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.170\nYou could just randomly pick out things.\n\n47\n00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.480\nBut if you wanted to, you could name\na bone supplier and put output.\n\n48\n00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.980\nOr you could use that three Ps we talked\nabout, or the six Ms. So SIPOC's just\n\n49\n00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.550\nanother option if you're trying to\ncome to the root cause of a problem.\n\n50\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.000\nThis might be a strategy that you use.\n\n51\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.810\nNow, suppliers are vendors for\nsure, so vendors by default.\n\n52\n00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.950\nJust like when we were talking about CTQs,\n\n53\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.910\na customer requirement\nby default is a CTQ.\n\n54\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.590\nAlthough there's other CTQs, but\nwe know customer requirements.\n\n55\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.950\nSo suppliers is like that.\n\n56\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.400\nIf you have a supplier,\nit's kind of a manufacturing term.\n\n57\n00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.810\nAll vendors would be considered suppliers.\n\n58\n00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.038\nHowever, you may have someone\ninternally that's supplying.\n\n59\n00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:14.530\nSo a supplier is anyone that you have to\ndepend on to get your work done, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.290\nSo if I have to get a signature\nfrom you before I can move forward,\n\n61\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.630\nyou become a supplier to me, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.500\nSo vendors always supplier.\n\n63\n00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.030\nAnyone internally that I have to\nget stuff from them before I can\n\n64\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.034\nmove forward would be-\n&gt;&gt; Like someone\n\n65\n00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:28.030\nin the purchasing department?\n\n66\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.650\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n67\n00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.862\nThey would be my supplier, right?\n\n68\n00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:30.961\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n69\n00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:35.260\n&gt;&gt; So input is anything\nthat goes into the system.\n\n70\n00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.020\nAnything that goes into the system.\n\n71\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.290\nA lot of times those are referred\nto in Lean Six Sigma as exes.\n\n72\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.840\nNow in my literature, in the Leaner\nSix Sigma, we just call them inputs.\n\n73\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.570\nBut you hear a lot of words for\ninputs, so exes might be one.\n\n74\n00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.130\nThe vital few exes, sometimes they'll say.\n\n75\n00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.820\nKey input process variables.\n\n76\n00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.735\nI mean, you're just gonna hear inputs\nsaid a lot of different ways, okay?\n\n77\n00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:09.434\nAny of the processes, rather,\nthat are happening within the major\n\n78\n00:04:09.434 --> 00:04:14.143\nprocess output anything that you're\npushing out to the customer.\n\n79\n00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:18.603\nAny documents, any deliverables,\nany product, any service,\n\n80\n00:04:18.603 --> 00:04:20.884\nanything that goes out, right?\n\n81\n00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:25.215\nAnd then customer,\nyou just wanna kind of think of customer,\n\n82\n00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:30.710\nyour internal as well as your external\ncustomers, as being customers.\n\n83\n00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.120\nNow, if you were looking at a SIPOC map,\nit would look something like this.\n\n84\n00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.600\nAnd this is the collateral that\nyou'll get in your student package,\n\n85\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.400\nbecause it kind of breaks\nit down a little bit.\n\n86\n00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.590\nJust like you have one for\nTIM WOODS, it breaks it down so\n\n87\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.610\nthat you're not just looking\nat the word SIPOC, right?\n\n88\n00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.640\nSo it kind of helps you when\nwe're thinking suppliers,\n\n89\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.480\nwe're looking at people,\nfunctions, systems.\n\n90\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.690\nWhen we're looking at inputs,\nmaterials, procedures.\n\n91\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.640\nSo this diagram is just to kinda help\nyou even think a little bit further.\n\n92\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.253\nIf you're thinking I don't even\nknow where to start with inputs,\n\n93\n00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:06.037\nI don't know where to\nstart with processes.\n\n94\n00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:11.921\nSo again, what I think is kinda fun about\nSIPOC, remember what we're trying to do is\n\n95\n00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.920\nwe're trying to make things better,\nfaster, and more cost effective.\n\n96\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.880\nThere is a theory of thought that, if we\nknow every one that touches what we're\n\n97\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.550\ndoing, that that's gonna give us\nsome information right off the back.\n\n98\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.999\nIt's gonna give us some education.\n\n99\n00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.110\nIt might help us identify someone who\nwill help us or maybe be our champion.\n\n100\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.350\nIt might help us identify challenges\nthat are gonna get in the way.\n\n101\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.660\nSo there's just value knowing\nwho touches the process.\n\n102\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.080\nIn the days of TQM when all of this\nfirst started in the late 40s and\n\n103\n00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.950\n50s, they did, and some companies still do\nthis, something called a Quality Circle.\n\n104\n00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.520\nWhere you get everyone together\nthat touched the process.\n\n105\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.770\nWhat's happened in more modern times is\nthat, especially with global presence,\n\n106\n00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.390\nit might just be too hard to get\neveryone in the same room, right?\n\n107\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.989\nAnd we've got time frames and even just\ngetting to another building sometimes.\n\n108\n00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.388\nLike, I live in Denver now.\n\n109\n00:06:05.388 --> 00:06:08.715\nAnd sometimes with the snow,\neven if the building's next door,\n\n110\n00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:13.070\njust getting everyone physically\ntogether is kind of a big deal, right?\n\n111\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.860\nSo, what I'd like to do is I'd\nlike to do something similar\n\n112\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.970\nthat we did with TIM WOODS just to\nget us into the swing of things.\n\n113\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.920\nI'd like to apply SIPOC to my home.\n\n114\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.310\nNow remember,\nall of these tools are ultimately designed\n\n115\n00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.070\nto make our existing processes better,\nfaster, more cost effective, right?\n\n116\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.564\nBut if we were using the SIPOC\nmodel towards our home,\n\n117\n00:06:34.564 --> 00:06:37.446\nI would like to do this\nagain with Cherokee.\n\n118\n00:06:37.446 --> 00:06:38.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And just,\n\n119\n00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:40.290\nI think it's a fast way\nto learn the model.\n\n120\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.006\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n121\n00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:42.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm at home.\n\n122\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.720\nOne of the strategies I could use\nto make my home better, faster,\n\n123\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.010\nmore cost effective,\nis I could try to identify waste.\n\n124\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.580\nThat's one way to do it.\n\n125\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.205\nI could maybe say, what are the CTQs?\n\n126\n00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:56.452\nI could maybe look at my home, and\nI could go to those voices, right?\n\n127\n00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:58.750\nThere's lots of different strategies, but\n\n128\n00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.530\none strategy I might use\nis the SIPOC strategy.\n\n129\n00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.930\nSo I'm going to try to figure out\neveryone who touches my home.\n\n130\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.403\nSo when we think about suppliers or\nvendors, who do we depend upon, or on,\n\n131\n00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:10.973\nrather?\n\n132\n00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:13.364\nWho do we, good thing they\ndon't let me teach English.\n\n133\n00:07:13.364 --> 00:07:16.875\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who do we depend on to keep our home\n\n134\n00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:17.700\ngoing?\n\n135\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.060\n&gt;&gt; Sure, all right.\n\n136\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.583\nSo, some of these are more,\nnot necessarily necessities, but\n\n137\n00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:25.186\njust average things.\n\n138\n00:07:25.186 --> 00:07:30.840\nOkay, so maybe my carriers,\nlike for USPS and UPS.\n\n139\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.510\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n140\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.346\nObviously my utilities companies.\n\n141\n00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:37.183\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So here in Gainesville, it's GRU,\n\n142\n00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:39.240\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n143\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.309\nI also have internet, so\nthat provider is Cox Cabling.\n\n144\n00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:49.621\nAnd groundskeepers, hm.\n\n145\n00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:50.785\nI think that's about it.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.\n\n146\n00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:52.041\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n147\n00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:54.483\nAnd, so\nwhen you think about input to your home,\n\n148\n00:07:54.483 --> 00:07:57.770\nwhat I want you to visualize is\nwho walks through your front door.\n\n149\n00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.024\nFamily.\n\n150\n00:08:02.024 --> 00:08:02.711\n&gt;&gt; Children for sure.\n\n151\n00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, friends, and maybe some service\ntechnicians, plumbers if need be.\n\n152\n00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.190\nThat's probably about it.\n\n153\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.160\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n154\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.440\nNow you're looking at processes.\n\n155\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.060\nAnd we discussed in another example,\nthe washing clothes process.\n\n156\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.150\nSo other than the washing clothes process,\n\n157\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.030\nwhat are some other processes\nthat happen in your home?\n\n158\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.160\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm not too exciting.\n\n159\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.940\nBut I'll go through-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n160\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.610\n&gt;&gt; Them anyways.\n\n161\n00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's okay.\n\n162\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.950\n&gt;&gt; I have putting away the groceries\nwhen you buy them from the store.\n\n163\n00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.540\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n164\n00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Making dinner, doing the dishes\n&gt;&gt; Getting ready for bed,\n\n165\n00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.650\nthe brushing the teeth process.\n\n166\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.200\nAnd then, of course, in the morning,\njust the opposite of that.\n\n167\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.130\nGetting up and getting ready for\nschool and for work.\n\n168\n00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.580\nSo I think that's about it.\n\n169\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.455\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, so what goes\n&gt;&gt; Out of your home?\n\n170\n00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:48.365\nWhat walks out that front door?\n\n171\n00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:51.365\nWe talked about walked in, what walks out?\n\n172\n00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.405\n&gt;&gt; Again, I would say the same category.\n\n173\n00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:59.430\nSo family, of course, friends,\nand potential contractors.\n\n174\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, and one that doesn't come in,\nthat goes out hopefully is trash.\n\n175\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n176\n00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.420\n&gt;&gt; So there are some things.\n\n177\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.330\nWhen you're thinking,\nbecause what Cherokee capitalized on,\n\n178\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.710\nis a lot of your inputs are going\nto somehow be your outputs.\n\n179\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.990\nBut in both cases, there's going to\nbe some inputs that don't leave.\n\n180\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.065\nBecause one of the inputs\nis certainly groceries.\n\n181\n00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:22.740\nAnd they're not probably going to go out\nbecause you're going to consume them.\n\n182\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.720\nOne of the outputs would\nbe something such as trash.\n\n183\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.620\nSo a lot of times people say, well,\n\n184\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.050\nI don't really get how valuable is it\nthinking about inputs and outputs.\n\n185\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.760\nIt's incredibly valuable.\n\n186\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.310\nAll Lean Six Sigma is based on what\nwe put in the system, what we get\n\n187\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.600\nout of the system, and studying those\nvariations and how that all works.\n\n188\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.510\nSo really, really important.\n\n189\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay so customers.\n\n190\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.670\nNow when you think of\ncustomers in the model,\n\n191\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.690\nanyone you have to keep happy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n192\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.017\n&gt;&gt; To keep your home going,\n\n193\n00:09:53.017 --> 00:09:54.600\nis going to be your customer.\n\n194\n00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.408\nSo who do you have to keep\nhappy to make the home work?\n\n195\n00:09:57.408 --> 00:10:01.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] this is a good one.\n\n196\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.930\nSo, I have to keep my supplier's happy.\n\n197\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:06.800\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; Does that still count?\n\n198\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because-\n\n199\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they count, absolutely.\n\n200\n00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.750\n&gt;&gt; They're not going to\ngive me a service for free.\n\n201\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I have to keep my family happy,\n\n202\n00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.820\notherwise I might have to forego\nmy sanity in that situation.\n\n203\n00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.160\nI have to keep my neighbors happy,\nI have to keep my landlord or\n\n204\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.850\nmy mortgage company happy.\n\n205\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.290\n&gt;&gt; And home association.\n\n206\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.234\n&gt;&gt; And home association happy.\n\n207\n00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:36.775\n[LAUGH] I have to keep\nsop may people happy.\n\n208\n00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:38.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n209\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.240\nthe idea is that we take that SIPOC\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n210\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.190\nI would apply it to whatever\nthing that I'm trying to improve.\n\n211\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:51.880\nSo let's say I'm trying to improve\nthe layout of the office, for example.\n\n212\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.760\nSo I would take each individual thing and\nI would say,\n\n213\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.170\nwell, what supply pieces work on that?\n\n214\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.770\nWhat input?\n\n215\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.630\nWhat output?\n\n216\n00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.260\nSo the idea is that I would take\njust like I would Tim Woods.\n\n217\n00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.400\n&gt;&gt; I think kind of high level\nwhat my process improvement is,\n\n218\n00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.430\nwhat it is I'm trying to do, and\nthen I would take it through that model.\n\n219\n00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.950\nNow, in the process of\ntaking through that model\n\n220\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.930\nthere's lots of different\ndiagrams that I can use.\n\n221\n00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.880\nAnd these templates are available on\nthe student page of SST Global Solutions.\n\n222\n00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.020\nBut there's also, you know,\n\n223\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.970\nthese kinda templates are also\navailable on search engines.\n\n224\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.940\nIf you type Sipoc template, you're going\nto see lots of different templates.\n\n225\n00:11:31.386 --> 00:11:33.080\nI just wannt to show you a few, so\n\n226\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.350\nthat you can kinda get an idea of\nways to display this information.\n\n227\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.310\nOne of the things I want to point\nout of this particular diagram,\n\n228\n00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.400\nis that no In the process they\nactually put a process map.\n\n229\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.520\nAnd you're going to see that in\na couple of other examples as well.\n\n230\n00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.880\nSo if I were trying to give you\na one page collateral here, right?\n\n231\n00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.560\nThis is something that\nI might want to use.\n\n232\n00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.220\nNow in this one,\nthis is taking a SIPOC and\n\n233\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.070\nit's comparing it against\nfour different areas, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:10.530\nSo kinda think the SIPOC 1, 2, 3, and\n4 represent different departments.\n\n235\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.190\nSo in this SIPOC, what I'm trying to\nidentify is who has the same suppliers,\n\n236\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.730\nwho has the same inputs,\n\n237\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.710\nwho has the same process because if I were\nin this example where it says supplier,\n\n238\n00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.810\nthree of my four departments\nare using the same supplier.\n\n239\n00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.050\nOr using the same types of supplier.\n\n240\n00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.925\nSo if I solve that problem or\nI look at those CTQs and I'm trying.\n\n241\n00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:34.735\nTrying to make a process improvement,\n\n242\n00:12:34.735 --> 00:12:37.465\nI might be able to make\nan overall process improvement.\n\n243\n00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.475\nBecause I'm kind of killing\nthree birds with one stone.\n\n244\n00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:40.545\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nYou just apply it to those other\n\n245\n00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:41.155\ndepartments.\n\n246\n00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:41.975\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n247\n00:12:41.975 --> 00:12:45.485\nSo this is an idea of using\nSIPOC as a comparison.\n\n248\n00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:52.865\nNow here's one that you\nmight use in a presentation.\n\n249\n00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:54.940\nVery clean, very pretty.\n\n250\n00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.240\nA lot of times what I'll do\nin a facilitation exercise,\n\n251\n00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.960\nis I'll leave this blank and let the\npeople fill it in, especially [CROSSTALK].\n\n252\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.730\n&gt;&gt; Good idea, yeah.\n\n253\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.450\n&gt;&gt; If I go to a department or to Cut Me\nand I'm not familiar with their industry,\n\n254\n00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.180\nwe can just write the,\nwe can put this on the screen and\n\n255\n00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.460\nthen we can just key in like\nwho are your suppliers?\n\n256\n00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.240\nIt's a very first effective excercise.\n\n257\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.710\nNow how things tie together.\n\n258\n00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:27.430\nIf I'm looking at my Cypoc well\nlet's think back to our SIPOC right.\n\n259\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.220\nSo what is the voice of\nthe supplier telling us?\n\n260\n00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.840\nRight.\n\n261\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.660\nWhat is the CTQ for\nthe supplier to be happy?\n\n262\n00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.470\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; So when I'm thinking about CTQs and\n\n263\n00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.360\nvoices, I could apply that to my model.\n\n264\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.080\nBecause remember the whole thing is\nI wanna do a process improvement.\n\n265\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.020\nIf I get stumped, then I could go back to\nall the people that touched the process\n\n266\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.150\nand I could think from the perspective,\nwhat is their voice?\n\n267\n00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.390\nWhat are they saying to me?\n\n268\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.500\nOr what is their CTQ?\n\n269\n00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.470\nSo, if I were looking at\nCTQs to feed the dog, right?\n\n270\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I want you to look at this diagram and\n\n271\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.760\nit says okay what\nare the CTQs to feed to dog?\n\n272\n00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.580\nWell suppliers, I got have a grocery store\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n273\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.150\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n274\n00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.100\nWhat else do I need?\n\n275\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.440\nIs there anything else that you can\nthink of I might need to feed my dog?\n\n276\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.825\nAs far as-\n&gt;&gt; Well, we know I'm not\n\n277\n00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:18.300\ncheating because I can't read that [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n\n278\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.070\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n279\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:19.750\n&gt;&gt; Sorry\n\n280\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.350\n&gt;&gt; I would\n\n281\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.470\nneed\n&gt;&gt; No it's me.\n\n282\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.798\nI would need a dog bowl.\n\n283\n00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:24.783\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n284\n00:14:24.783 --> 00:14:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that kind of stuff, exactly, and\n\n285\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.310\neven when you're thinking well,\nthis is just something small.\n\n286\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.640\nWhat we say in Process Improvement is,\n\n287\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.030\nthose are the things,\nthat's that low lying fruit, right?\n\n288\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so for the inputs,\n\n289\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.680\nI'd have to go shopping,\nI'd have to buy dog food.\n\n290\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.930\nI'd have to put groceries\naway in the cupboard, okay.\n\n291\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.380\nSo if I were trying to improve any\nof those processes, for example,\n\n292\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.000\ngo shopping, and\nthis would be an easier one.\n\n293\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.590\nLet's say, cuz we were just talking\nabout having Prime on Amazon.\n\n294\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'd go to the store and\n\n295\n00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.950\nmaybe I even go to a special store\nto buy my really healthy dog food.\n\n296\n00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.800\nWhat's a process improvement\nif I own the prime-\n\n297\n00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Amazon Fresh.\n\n298\n00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.070\nUnfortunately, they don't\nhave it in games, though, but\n\n299\n00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.120\nit's actually a really cool service where\nyou can order your food from Amazon,\n\n300\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.335\nand they deliver it to you in a\nrefrigerated box right there at your step.\n\n301\n00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:22.200\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay perfect, I mean perfect.\n\n302\n00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.440\nOkay so the processes is I open\nthe cupboard, I get out the dog food,\n\n303\n00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.547\nI fill the bowl, I go find the dog, right?\n\n304\n00:15:29.547 --> 00:15:30.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I\n\n305\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.220\nwere trying to improve that process,\nsomething I might consider, I mean,\n\n306\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.830\njust to kinda help me out a little bit.\n\n307\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.890\nI probably wouldn't want to do it\nlong-term for a couple of weeks.\n\n308\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.130\nBut I could get one of those\ndog feeders that feeds.\n\n309\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:41.730\n&gt;&gt; That's automated.\n\n310\n00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's automated that at\nleast feeds them for the next three or\n\n311\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.410\nfour days.\n\n312\n00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.950\nAnd then maybe I'm not having to come\nhome to make sure the dog is fed.\n\n313\n00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.870\nI mean maybe I'm only going to use it for\nemergencies.\n\n314\n00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.770\nSo the output, the dog eats.\n\n315\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.625\nThe dog fertilizes the garden.\n\n316\n00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:58.466\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So there's probably not much I can\n\n317\n00:15:58.466 --> 00:15:59.608\ndo to improve\n&gt;&gt; Prove that.\n\n318\n00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:00.306\nSo I would just go on.\n\n319\n00:16:00.306 --> 00:16:02.853\nSo my customers are the dog,\nthe family, and the garden.\n\n320\n00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:04.379\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n321\n00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:09.031\nBut the idea is that I can marry\nthese to concepts together,\n\n322\n00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:12.020\nwhat's my SIPOCs, what's my CTQs.\n\n323\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.890\nNow, if I were trying to\napply the voices just,\n\n324\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:23.230\njust a reminder the primary voices are\ncustomer employee business and process.\n\n325\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.240\nSo if I were feeding the dog,\nmy customer is the dog.\n\n326\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.930\nIn this case, the employee is probably me.\n\n327\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.994\n&gt;&gt; The owner.\n[LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:31.631\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm working for that dog.\n\n329\n00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:32.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.650\n&gt;&gt; The voice of the business.\n\n331\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.230\nSo what would be the voice\nof the business for the dog?\n\n332\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.230\nFor feeding the dog?\n\n333\n00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.520\nIt would be.\n\n334\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.330\nWhat's the.\n\n335\n00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.450\n&gt;&gt; He's the guard dog.\n\n336\n00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. There you go. &gt;&gt; Home security.\n\n337\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.960\nThe home security business.\n\n338\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.720\n&gt;&gt; Security.\nExactly.\n\n339\n00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.110\nAnd then the process.\n\n340\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.780\nAgain.\n\n341\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.600\nThe process we said we went to the cover,\nwe dumped in the dog food,\n\n342\n00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.470\nwe called the dog but we already said\nwe could maybe possibly automate that.\n\n343\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.390\nSo, we can use SIPOC as\na problem solving model as well.\n\n344\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:08.620\nLet's say your a project manager and\nyou have an employee who is emoting.\n\n345\n00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.470\nThey're coming in and\nthey have this big problem.\n\n346\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.850\nNow, we're told that we need\nto send this employee to HR.\n\n347\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.230\nThat's what we're told to do.\n\n348\n00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.990\nHowever, a lot of times, we can't do that\nand a lot of times that's not practical\n\n349\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.110\nand sometimes you have a small company\nthat doesn't have an HR department, right?\n\n350\n00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.180\nSo, you're stuck.\n\n351\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.160\nYou've got to handle this problem.\n\n352\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.080\nNow what you want to do is whatever you're\nworking on you want to make it better,\n\n353\n00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.530\nfaster, more cost effective.\n\n354\n00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.240\nBut now you're dealing with this\nemployee whose just out of control.\n\n355\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.250\nSo, one thing you could do is use\nthe SIPOC as a mini problem solving model.\n\n356\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.650\nAnd you can have the employee sit down.\n\n357\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.780\nNow I'm not suggesting that\nyou get in their face and\n\n358\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.960\nyou go,\nwho's supplying this problem, right?\n\n359\n00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.460\nBut you can use it as a speaking model.\n\n360\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.590\nYou can use it as a structured\nway to handle the conversation.\n\n361\n00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.870\nAnd you can ask them things such as what\nare the inputs, you know, what came in.\n\n362\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.630\nYou would probably want to do it in a\ndifferent vernacular, so you would just be\n\n363\n00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.930\nusing this model to structure your\nconversation with the employee to kind of\n\n364\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.820\nbring them down a little bit onto-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n365\n00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.960\nwould you ever be able to kind of\nimplement this on an anonymous\n\n366\n00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.510\nlevel to remove that conflict that may\noccur maybe through like an email or\n\n367\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.360\nsome kind of third party entity-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and you could,\n\n368\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.410\nyou have that conversation\nbased on that model, sure.\n\n369\n00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.370\nSo this is kind of a, again, it's sort of\nstructured brainstorming even for you.\n\n370\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.990\nSo if you're in a situation where all of\na sudden you're feeling like a little off\n\n371\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.370\ncenter, if you could reach for one of\nthese models and, in this case we're\n\n372\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:39.190\nsaying SIPOC, you can kind of form\nyour argument or your conversation\n\n373\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:43.440\nalong those lines, and get a multiple\namount of, just tons of information.\n\n374\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:52.570\nOkay, so let's say the scenario is,\nfor our next exercise, the scenario\n\n375\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.950\nis customers are receiving products\nthat don't meet their specifications,\n\n376\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.040\nthey're getting stuff that That just don't\nlive up to what they ask for, right?\n\n377\n00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.980\n&gt;&gt; I can relate [LAUGH].\n\n378\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.100\n&gt;&gt; So\nif we were doing the SIPOC as a supplier,\n\n379\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.210\none of the questions is\nwho do we depend on?\n\n380\n00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.190\nIs the problem with who is supplying this,\nright?\n\n381\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.950\nSo I'm trying to solve this problem,\nso I would look at suppliers, right?\n\n382\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.500\nSo suppliers,\nthey're not getting the products,\n\n383\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.180\naren't meeting the specification.\n\n384\n00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.180\nSo I would take a step back, and\nif I'm putting kits together,\n\n385\n00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.510\nI'm bringing other suppliers together\nto form a particular product.\n\n386\n00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.720\nIs there a problem there, right?\n\n387\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.860\nSo, some of the questions with input.\n\n388\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.450\nHow are they receiving the orders?\n\n389\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.320\nHow do they put these\norders into the system?\n\n390\n00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.400\nThey're not getting what they ordered so\ninput-wise what could be the problem?\n\n391\n00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.230\nRight?\nWhat could be the issue there?\n\n392\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.830\n&gt;&gt; If a human is performing data\nentry then it could be human error.\n\n393\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.620\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n394\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.160\nExactly.\nAnd\n\n395\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.010\nso this is a way of like looking\nat this problem using side POC and\n\n396\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.030\nthis kind of stepping back and\nasking questions about it.\n\n397\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:03.180\nSo process is there a map or\nstandard work?\n\n398\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.450\nNow the process map, is there like\nthey're getting things that they're\n\n399\n00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.110\nnot living up to their specification,\nwhat is the process?\n\n400\n00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.660\nHas anyone written that process down.\n\n401\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.180\n&gt;&gt; And to find it.\n\n402\n00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.440\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; How do they know if they're not meeting\n\n403\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.660\ntheir expectations if one\nhasn't been explained to them?\n\n404\n00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and then if you've got\nmultiple employees like say packaging or\n\n405\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.300\npicking these orders out,\nis there standard work?\n\n406\n00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.770\nAnd a reminder standard work is like\nreally nothing more than a Standard\n\n407\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.660\noperating procedure but on a smaller\nlevel, like something you wouldn't\n\n408\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.430\ndocument for the entire company\nlike a best practice but\n\n409\n00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.538\njust the way I do work everyday, right?\n\n410\n00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:43.450\nOutput, Howard Roofing done now what is\n\n411\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:48.880\nthe audience Auditing Department do right\nso that would be an example of output and\n\n412\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.000\ncustomer, do we have specific complaints\nbecause right now they're saying,\n\n413\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.430\nthe products aren't meeting their\nspecifications but are they saying-\n\n414\n00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.480\n&gt;&gt; What does that mean?\n\n415\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what does that mean?\n\n416\n00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.790\nAnd inset could we do a operator chart for\nexample, and\n\n417\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.730\ntry to figure out when people aren't\ngetting the products that are not meeting\n\n418\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.700\ntheir specifications is there one\narea that we could tackle, right?\n\n419\n00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.305\n&gt;&gt; That's when Joe's on shift and\nhe's the night manager or whatever, yeah.\n\n420\n00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:15.275\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n421\n00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:20.039\nAnd so you can start to see how these\ntools all kind of work together, right.\n\n422\n00:21:22.896 --> 00:21:29.640\nSo SIPOC is a great self education\ntool your add a new job, all right.\n\n423\n00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.940\nNow one thing you can do like I'm\na new job I'm new employee, or\n\n424\n00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.760\nI'm in a new department.\n\n425\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.200\nAnd maybe it's a small enough company\nwhere there isn't a formal orientation,\n\n426\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.280\nand I'm gonna have to orientate myself,\nright?\n\n427\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.410\nAnd I'm sure a lot of you have been in\nthat situation where you were parachuted\n\n428\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.720\ninto a job you knew nothing about, right?\n\n429\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.810\nWell, certainly, one model you\ncould use is back to Tim Woods.\n\n430\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.900\nYou could say, well, what kind of\ntransportation impacts this department?\n\n431\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.808\nWhat kind of Inventory,\nwhat kind of weighty.\n\n432\n00:21:57.808 --> 00:22:01.980\nBut another good self education\ntool is to approach from a SIPOC.\n\n433\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.970\nSo it's my first day at the job, and\n\n434\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.390\nmaybe it's just a part time job through\nthe holidays to supplement my income.\n\n435\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.900\nAnd so they really aren't spending\na lot of time training me.\n\n436\n00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.650\nThey're just saying, go do this at\nthe cash register, or something, right?\n\n437\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.776\nSo if I wanna quickly get on board,\nwho supplies this company?\n\n438\n00:22:17.776 --> 00:22:21.280\nWho are the suppliers,\nwho are the major vendors?\n\n439\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.670\nWhere does the input come from?\n\n440\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:28.270\nHow do I get stuff into my store or\ninto my service or to my desk,\n\n441\n00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.410\nhow does that happen?\n\n442\n00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.330\nWhat kind of processes\nare happening around this office?\n\n443\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.330\nWhat are some of the mini processes?\n\n444\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.630\nWhat is the final product?\n\n445\n00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.870\nWhat goes out the door, right?\n\n446\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.530\nAnd then finally, who are the customers?\n\n447\n00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.120\nWho are the customers that\npatronize this particular facility?\n\n448\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:49.320\nSo that's when we come into customer\nanalysis versus stakeholder's\n\n449\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.050\nanalysis, okay?\n\n450\n00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:52.820\nSo it's actually kind\nof a different topic.\n\n451\n00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.370\nWe've been talking about SIPOC,\nwe've been talking about how SIPOC can\n\n452\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:03.390\nbe used to just identify who we touch,\nwho's part of the process.\n\n453\n00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.130\nWhich is huge because we might\nbe able to find friends and\n\n454\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.980\nfoes and\nall kinds of information we didn't know.\n\n455\n00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.170\nWe said we could use it as\na self-orientation tool.\n\n456\n00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:16.890\nStill, no matter how we use it, it comes\ndown to that final thing customer, and so\n\n457\n00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.740\nwhen we're looking at customers,\n\n458\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.020\nhow does a customer analysis change\nfrom a stakeholder's analysis?\n\n459\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.030\nWell, when we think about\na customer analysis,\n\n460\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.430\nit's an important piece\nof the business plan.\n\n461\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.550\nWho are our customers,\nwho are our competitors?\n\n462\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.095\nI've had people tell me\nwe have no competitors.\n\n463\n00:23:36.095 --> 00:23:39.245\n[LAUGH] I think that's kinda funny,\nbecause we all have competitors.\n\n464\n00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:41.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What is the demographics of our\n\n465\n00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:42.570\ncustomer?\n\n466\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:43.590\nWhere are they at?\n\n467\n00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.860\nWhat do they do?\n\n468\n00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.420\nHow long have they been my customer or\nyour customer?\n\n469\n00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.980\nSo that's all a customer\nanalysis is doing.\n\n470\n00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.350\nAnd a SIPOC kinda makes\nus go in that direction.\n\n471\n00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.650\nI wanna think about my customer, right?\n\n472\n00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.760\nSo who is my customer really?\n\n473\n00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.212\nWho's competing?\nHow long have they been around?\n\n474\n00:24:02.212 --> 00:24:05.236\nSo it forces us into\nthinking about our customer.\n\n475\n00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:08.099\nAnd sometimes, when you're doing a SIPOC.\n\n476\n00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:12.540\nThe answer to who is my customer is super\nsimple, so you don't even have to worry.\n\n477\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.580\nI've worked in several situations,\nhowever,\n\n478\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.950\nwhere people were really struggling\nwith who is my customer.\n\n479\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:23.130\nOne of the most recent ones in\nan unnamed state, I was working for\n\n480\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.420\nchild support services, and we were trying\nto make that service better, faster,\n\n481\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.460\nand more cost effective\nin this particular state.\n\n482\n00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.590\nAnd so I started the session with,\nwho's our customer?\n\n483\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.140\nIn my mind, the customer's the child.\n\n484\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.697\nBut I had people getting up,\nyelling out the governor's name and\n\n485\n00:24:40.697 --> 00:24:43.810\nvarious other people when I said,\nwho's the customer?\n\n486\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:49.707\nAnd we spent really, seriously,\ntwo hours defining who is the customer.\n\n487\n00:24:49.707 --> 00:24:53.084\nWell, you can't make a process\nimprovement, if don't have a customer,\n\n488\n00:24:53.084 --> 00:24:54.920\nif you don't know who your customer is.\n\n489\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.867\nAnd sometimes,\n\n490\n00:24:55.867 --> 00:25:00.471\nit actually takes a customer analysis to\ndetermine who is my customer, really.\n\n491\n00:25:00.471 --> 00:25:01.073\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n492\n00:25:01.073 --> 00:25:02.989\n&gt;&gt; So just something to keep in mind.\n\n493\n00:25:02.989 --> 00:25:08.380\nAnd when we're talking about SIPOC versus\na stakeholders' analysis, in project\n\n494\n00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:13.810\nmanagement, stakeholders' analysis\ntakes kind of a weird turn in my mind.\n\n495\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.370\nAnd if you're taking\nthe project management test,\n\n496\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:21.450\npay attention [LAUGH] to the way we\ntalk about stakeholders' analysis.\n\n497\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:26.200\nSo traditionally, a stakeholders' analysis\nis supposed to list everyone who has a key\n\n498\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.890\nstake in that particular project.\n\n499\n00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.880\nSo you are stakeholder for sure,\nyour boss is usually a stakeholder.\n\n500\n00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.900\nBut it's just kinda\nthe major stakeholders.\n\n501\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.225\nSo how that relates to SIPOC is SIPOC is\nsort of like a stakeholders' analysis\n\n502\n00:25:40.225 --> 00:25:43.698\non steroids because it's telling\nyou all the stakeholders.\n\n503\n00:25:43.698 --> 00:25:48.458\nNow you're gonna maybe put some of your\nstakeholders on your project charter.\n\n504\n00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.363\nAnd as a reminder,\n\n505\n00:25:49.363 --> 00:25:53.640\nyour project charter is that form you fill\nout to say can I work on this project?\n\n506\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.130\nSo you're probably still gonna\njust put the major stakeholders.\n\n507\n00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.425\nBut it's valuable to\nknow all the people and\n\n508\n00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:01.978\nall the things that have\na stake in your project.\n\n509\n00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:07.273\nAnd that's how stakeholders'\nanalysis relates to the SIPOC.\n\n510\n00:26:07.273 --> 00:26:10.513\nHowever, even the stakeholders' analysis,\n\n511\n00:26:10.513 --> 00:26:15.430\nwe do the SIPOC, it's like\nstakeholders' analysis on steroids.\n\n512\n00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.800\nWhen we do stakeholders' analysis, it's a\nlittle different than project management.\n\n513\n00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.109\nSo I'm gonna go back to what I was saying,\nin project management,\n\n514\n00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:24.603\nstakeholders' analysis says,\nwho has a stake?\n\n515\n00:26:24.603 --> 00:26:27.660\nAnd then it says are they for\nyou or against you?\n\n516\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.930\nAre they for you, but\nthey're not gonna help you?\n\n517\n00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.840\nAre they against, or\nyou're not gonna get in the way?\n\n518\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.290\nThat’s a traditional\nstakeholders' analysis.\n\n519\n00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:38.110\nPersonally, that makes me a little nervous\nabout having a document like that floating\n\n520\n00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.460\naround, so I don't know, but that’s\na traditional stakeholders' analysis.\n\n521\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.650\nIn Lean Six Sigma, we have a tendency to\nthink of the SIPOC as our stakeholders'\n\n522\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:51.070\nanalysis and the stakeholders'\nanalysis as a communication tool.\n\n523\n00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.740\nSo let's say I'm working on a lot of\ndifferent projects, then in that case,\n\n524\n00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.240\nI might need to know that Bob only\nwants analytical information,\n\n525\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.090\nhe is only interested in graphs and\ncharts.\n\n526\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.970\nAnd maybe Matthew says, I don't care,\n\n527\n00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.360\ndon't even bother me unless\nthe project's going out of control.\n\n528\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.524\nAnd then maybe Cindy says,\nI just need a status report on Fridays.\n\n529\n00:27:12.524 --> 00:27:15.792\nSo if I've got multiple projects going on,\nif I only have one project and\n\n530\n00:27:15.792 --> 00:27:17.935\nI'm working with the same\npeople all the time,\n\n531\n00:27:17.935 --> 00:27:20.683\nthis isn't gonna be that\nvaluable of a communication tool.\n\n532\n00:27:20.683 --> 00:27:24.606\nBecause I'm gonna know this\nperson likes phone calls,\n\n533\n00:27:24.606 --> 00:27:29.124\nthis person never reads their email,\nthey want me to text them.\n\n534\n00:27:29.124 --> 00:27:31.020\nI'm gonna know that, right?\n\n535\n00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.410\nBut if I'm working on multiple projects,\n\n536\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.140\nit might be helpful to\nhave this as a reminder.\n\n537\n00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.030\nThis is what each one\nof these people want.\n\n538\n00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.630\nSo stakeholder analysis, who has\nthe major interest on your project,\n\n539\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.720\njust like we said, you, the sponsor,\n\n540\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.340\nand the sponsor in Lean Six Sigma is\nalways the one that signs the check.\n\n541\n00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.860\nSo the tricky thing about\nyour sponsor is that\n\n542\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.820\nit could be your boss's boss's boss,\nright?\n\n543\n00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.550\nSo sponsors always, who said it's okay,\nwho allocated the money,\n\n544\n00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.310\nwho said that you can move forward.\n\n545\n00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.230\nBut they're always gonna be a stakeholder,\nright?\n\n546\n00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:12.100\nAnd then others who are impacted,\nand the way others are impacted\n\n547\n00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.750\nis you go through your SIPOC, and\nyou figure what others are impacted.\n\n548\n00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.460\nThe advantage of a SIPOC over\na traditional stakeholders' analysis\n\n549\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.465\nis that SIPOC also identifies\nthe nonhuman resources.\n\n550\n00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:26.470\nStakeholders' analysis, you're never gonna\nsee something like if you're building\n\n551\n00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.760\na deck, you're not gonna\nsee as stakeholder lumber.\n\n552\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.450\nBut in the SIPOC, you might, right?\n\n553\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.520\nSo traditional versus the leaner way,\nI already covered that.\n\n554\n00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.480\nThe project management version\nversus the Lean Six Sigma.\n\n555\n00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.790\nBut in a nutshell, the project management\nversion, if you're sitting for\n\n556\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.790\nthe PMBOK, you wanna go back and\nmake sure that you read that carefully.\n\n557\n00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:52.418\nBecause it says, for, against, help me,\nnot help me type kind of thing.\n\n558\n00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:55.867\nBut in Lean Six Sigma,\nwe use it more as a communication tool.\n\n559\n00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:56.819\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n560\n00:28:56.819 --> 00:29:04.070\n&gt;&gt; So I think we've come to the end of\nthis discussion about SIPOC suppliers.\n\n561\n00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:08.260\n&gt;&gt; All right, if you don't have any other\nthoughts, then we'll go ahead and wrap up\n\n562\n00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.388\nfor this particular episode, but I want\nyou guys to go ahead and stay tuned, we do\n\n563\n00:29:12.388 --> 00:29:15.919\nhave more information headed your way\n&gt;&gt; But we are gonna go ahead and\n\n564\n00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:20.277\nwrap up for this episode, and I'll\nsign out as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n565\n00:29:20.277 --> 00:29:24.583\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr.

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n4\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.700\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.190\nIn this episode we're gonna be looking\nat some important graphs and charts.\n\n6\n00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.450\nAnd to go ahead and demonstrate and\nshow us some of those charts and\n\n7\n00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.500\ngraphs we have in studios Dr.\nTerra Vanzant Stern.\n\n8\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.780\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n9\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.620\nIt's a pleasure to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.770\n&gt;&gt; So graphs and charts always add a nice,\n\n12\n00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.010\nadditional visual element to any kind of\npresentation, to help convey your message,\n\n13\n00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.520\nso are there any types of charts\nthat might be more influential,\n\n14\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.150\nor used in specific instances,\nor where should we start?\n\n15\n00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.980\n&gt;&gt; Well I'd like to go\nto my slide deck and\n\n16\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.070\nthe first thing that I want to mention is\nthat remember, we've already looked at\n\n17\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.020\nseven tools that are chart-like and\ngraph-like in nature.\n\n18\n00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.800\nAnd those are up on the screen right now.\n\n19\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.180\nSo those are still the most\nimportant graphs and charts.\n\n20\n00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.460\nAnd I maintain that you can do\nan entire Lean Six Sigma project\n\n21\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.470\nby just even using part of these, right?\n\n22\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.000\nBut there are some other different charts,\nand in this session these are popular\n\n23\n00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.180\ncharts that are used in project\nmanagement as well as Lean Six Sigma.\n\n24\n00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.850\nSo those would be Gantt charts,\nPERT diagrams, your Burn Down Chart,\n\n25\n00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.720\nwhich is mostly an agile one,\na relationship diagram,\n\n26\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.370\nswindling charts and spaghetti diagrams.\n\n27\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.856\nAnd even though that sounds like\na mouthful because mostly I'm gonna be\n\n28\n00:01:38.856 --> 00:01:42.241\nshowing you the pictures of these things,\nit should go pretty fast.\n\n29\n00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n30\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.890\n&gt;&gt; One of the things that I wanna point\nout, is that we do have templates for\n\n31\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.320\nthese types of chart on our\nsite at www.ssdglobal.net.\n\n32\n00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.130\nHowever, any of these charts if\nyou were to write in the word and\n\n33\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.520\ntemplate in any search engine,\nit's gonna come back with other templates.\n\n34\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.700\nWe tried it.\n\n35\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.110\nIn fact, we get a lot of student input\nabout our templates on our website.\n\n36\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.060\nSo we're always getting new ones.\n\n37\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.410\nAnd we're always kind of playing\naround with charts and graphs.\n\n38\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.146\nSo we like to think that we\nhave the most current ones, but\n\n39\n00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:18.830\nsometimes you just find one\nthat you like to use better.\n\n40\n00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.440\nGantt charts, this kind of goes back to\n\n41\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.549\nthe whole thing about how Lean likes\nto give the chart or the graph.\n\n42\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.527\n&gt;&gt; Credit where credit is due.\n\n43\n00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.666\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, so\nHenry Gantt did this, but\n\n44\n00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:40.525\nback in the old days with Gantt charts,\nthey had butcher block paper that they\n\n45\n00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:45.050\nwould literally tape on the walls and\npeople would draw on the paper.\n\n46\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.770\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n47\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.767\n&gt;&gt; Now we have a-\n&gt;&gt; Digital.\n\n48\n00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.690\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot easier.\nYeah, we have digital stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.010\nSo, this is kinda how it would of\nlooked in 1918, the Basic Gantt Chart.\n\n50\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.730\nYou have your project tasks, and so,\nyou'll see on the left-hand side,\n\n51\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.790\nyou would have all the things\nthat you need to do, right?\n\n52\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.900\nAnd in this case, the basic project stuff,\nthe research for that project,\n\n53\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.120\nthe development, the prototype production.\n\n54\n00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.023\nAnd then along the top\nwhere you see that J, F, M.\n\n55\n00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:17.239\nThat's just short for January,\nFebruary, and March, right?\n\n56\n00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.730\nAnd so you'll notice that some\nof the bars overlap, right,\n\n57\n00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.470\nbecause research is still going on.\n\n58\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.030\nThe project, that first one,\n\n59\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.370\nis encompassing the entire project,\nthat first bar.\n\n60\n00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.126\nThen the second bar says at that first\npart of the project, that's where\n\n61\n00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:37.325\nthe research element's gonna happen,\nand then you move over the development.\n\n62\n00:03:37.325 --> 00:03:40.409\nAnd you'll notice then finally\nthe prototype production, but\n\n63\n00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.034\nif you look at the bars\nthere's some overlap, right,\n\n64\n00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:46.010\nbecause then things are starting up as-\n&gt;&gt; To happen in tandem.\n\n65\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\nsome things can happen in tandem.\n\n66\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.230\nSo when we're thinking about the evolution\nof Gantt charts, this is where it started,\n\n67\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.410\nand this was all it was, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.700\nAnd so the reason why I mention that is\nsometimes people have seen Gantt charts\n\n69\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.880\nin packages such as MS Project, and there\nare some extra things that that gives you.\n\n70\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.540\nBut we'll be talking about those.\n\n71\n00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.780\nSo this is just the same thing again.\n\n72\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.690\nJust to show you here\nthat basic Gantt chart,\n\n73\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.930\nit showed the timeline of your\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n74\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.904\nSo, in that left-hand column, a lot of\ntimes what you're gonna see is Task 1, 2,\n\n75\n00:04:23.904 --> 00:04:27.234\n3, 4, and then under those tasks,\n1.1, 1.2.\n\n76\n00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:31.339\nSo, in the basic Gantt chart,\nyou're just seeing the timeline for\n\n77\n00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.970\neach one of those tasks.\n\n78\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.260\nAnd then at the lower right-hand, it's\nshowing you where we are in that task.\n\n79\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.950\nSo that blue bar is representing this is\nhow long the task is supposed to take and\n\n80\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.370\nthis is where we're at.\n\n81\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.220\nBecause a lot of times we over or\nunderestimate a task, and\n\n82\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.020\nwe're just saying we think this is\nhow long it's gonna take, right?\n\n83\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.300\nSo, Gantt charts are really\nkinda helpful in that way.\n\n84\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.400\nSo, a basic Gantt chart these days\nsometimes also includes the milestones,\n\n85\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.130\nand it's really interesting.\n\n86\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.373\nBecause even in project management,\nwhere they talk about milestones and\n\n87\n00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:10.472\ndeliverables, sometimes\nseasoned project managers\n\n88\n00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:14.190\nwill disagree on what's a milestone and\nwhat's a deliverable.\n\n89\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.238\nThe easiest way for me to explain it,\n\n90\n00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.280\nis a deliverable is anything\nyou promise the client.\n\n91\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.840\nSo, if you promise them a status report,\nthat's a deliverable, right?\n\n92\n00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.180\nCertainly when the project's over and\nyou're done, that's a deliverable.\n\n93\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.160\nBut anything that you're actually\noutputting, you're giving to the client.\n\n94\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.470\nA milestone is a phase\nthat you go through.\n\n95\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.330\nSo, if you were looking at the PDCA model,\n\n96\n00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.460\nyou might mention\na milestone between P and D.\n\n97\n00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.930\nRemember, it was Plan, Do, Check, Act.\n\n98\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.362\nSo, as I move from Plan to Do,\nthat might be my milestone.\n\n99\n00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:45.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n100\n00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.650\n&gt;&gt; A lot of times,\nmilestones can be the time of year, too.\n\n101\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.620\nWe're passing from the fall\nquarter into the winter quarter.\n\n102\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.130\nSo milestones are just\nthings that we're passing.\n\n103\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.670\nWell, on today's Gantt chart,\n\n104\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.270\na lot of times those milestones\nare recorded on the actual chart itself.\n\n105\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.250\nNow, this is called a combination chart,\nand\n\n106\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.870\nonly because it's tracking and\nthe milestones.\n\n107\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.920\nSo if you had something\nin project management,\n\n108\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.910\nespecially called a milestone chart,\nall you're gonna\n\n109\n00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.850\nhave on a thing that looks a little like\na Gantt chart, is just the milestones.\n\n110\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.230\nBut on a combination chart,\nit's kind of silly, but\n\n111\n00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.960\non combination chart you have everything.\n\n112\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.590\nAnd that's leaner, right?\n\n113\n00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.240\nIt's leaner just to have\neverything on the same chart.\n\n114\n00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.670\n&gt;&gt; One quick, quick glance.\n\n115\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\nthat's the whole purpose of it.\n\n116\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.290\nAnd then remember,\non a combination chart you could also have\n\n117\n00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.290\nwhere you are in that task.\n\n118\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.710\nI think it's kind of interesting cuz a lot\nof times people put Gantt charts together,\n\n119\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.160\nand they don't go ahead and\nrecord where they are in that task.\n\n120\n00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.630\nThat's kind of sad because this is\na good way to know if you're ahead or\n\n121\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.730\nbehind in schedule.\n\n122\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.840\nSo Gantt charts are constructed\nwith horizontal axis, and\n\n123\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.630\nthat represents the timespan.\n\n124\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.520\nSo that's always gonna be there,\nthat little blue box that you see.\n\n125\n00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.464\nIt's always gonna be\nrelated somehow to time.\n\n126\n00:07:09.464 --> 00:07:11.960\nNow your project could be a day.\n\n127\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.180\nAnd so what you're seeing\ninstead of Monday, Tuesday,\n\n128\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.460\nWednesday, Thursday is hour one,\nhour two, hour three.\n\n129\n00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.120\nBut there's always gonna be a line\nthere that's connected to time.\n\n130\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.620\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:28.451\nAnd then the vertical access generally\nrepresents the task in the project\n\n132\n00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:31.470\nlike the 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,\nthat type of thing.\n\n133\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this looks very familiar and\nRonnie would probably kill me\n\n134\n00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.505\nright now because I don't remember all the\ndifferent variations, but in Project Plus?\n\n135\n00:07:41.505 --> 00:07:42.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n136\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.850\nYou do have for instance,\nif you have any dependencies for\n\n137\n00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.580\nthose tasks, then you have to\nwait until one has completed and\n\n138\n00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.240\nthey have all these different terms and\neverything for that.\n\n139\n00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.930\nDo we need to know any of those here?\n\n140\n00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n141\n00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.224\nYou wanna kind of think, but not so\nmuch from a testing standpoint,\n\n142\n00:07:58.224 --> 00:08:00.687\nis that when you're doing\nyour project planning.\n\n143\n00:08:00.687 --> 00:08:02.367\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; When you're doing your project\n\n144\n00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:05.625\nplanning, you wanna know the difference\nbetween a milestone and a deliverable.\n\n145\n00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:09.372\nRight, or project planning as\nfar as the test is concerned.\n\n146\n00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:13.812\nThe test is gonna wanna know that you know\nthe difference between a milestone and\n\n147\n00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:14.749\na deliverable.\n\n148\n00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:18.750\nIt's gonna want to know that you\nunderstand what a dependency is.\n\n149\n00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.070\nAnd a dependency is just what you said,\n\n150\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.970\nthis task has to be done\nbefore this other task.\n\n151\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.750\nOn your project management exams,\nwhich sometimes people take project\n\n152\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.340\nmanagement in conjunction with Lean Six\nSigma, that's not an uncommon thing.\n\n153\n00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.960\nThey're gonna wanna know about\nassumptions and constraints.\n\n154\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.740\n&gt;&gt; So on that exam you would\nwanna know those terms as well.\n\n155\n00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n&gt;&gt; For Lean Six Sigma,\n\n156\n00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.270\nyou pretty much wanna know\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n157\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.780\nIf I wanted to graphically\nrepresent a work\n\n158\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.950\nbreakdown structure then that would be\na Gantt chart, does that make sense?\n\n159\n00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n160\n00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:59.463\nAnd these are just some things, again,\nthat you might wanna be aware of,\n\n161\n00:08:59.463 --> 00:09:01.430\nmilestones, resources.\n\n162\n00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.370\nAnd resources would generally\nmean your human resources, but\n\n163\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.370\nit could mean non-human resources as well.\n\n164\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.877\nSome Gantt charts have sort of a,\n\n165\n00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:15.902\ndepending on if you're doing a Gantt\nchart with the specialized software.\n\n166\n00:09:15.902 --> 00:09:19.240\nSometimes it will prompt\nyou to do a status report.\n\n167\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.810\nSometimes it will point out\nthe dependencies for you.\n\n168\n00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.320\nSo if you enter,\nwhen you're using graphical software,\n\n169\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.180\nsometimes they can do all\nkinds of fancy things.\n\n170\n00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was really cool, yeah.\n\n171\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really fun.\n\n172\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.450\nAnd Microsoft Project,\nyou were saying with Project+.\n\n173\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.470\nBut what I want everyone in the Lean Six\nSigma environment to remember is that you\n\n174\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.170\ncan do a Gantt chart just in Excel.\n\n175\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.120\nIt's just gonna take longer cuz\nyou're manually entering that.\n\n176\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.540\n&gt;&gt; Inputting that information, perfect.\n\n177\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so if you were using\nProject software to do it, it's gonna.\n\n178\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.925\nLet's say you went in and you added a 1.2\ntask, it's gonna automatically go number,\n\n179\n00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.230\nre-number everything for you.\n\n180\n00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.340\nWhereas if you're doing\nyour project plan in Excel,\n\n181\n00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.972\nyou may-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n182\n00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:58.335\nthat's what you're paying for, right?\n\n183\n00:09:58.335 --> 00:10:00.250\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, for that automation.\n\n184\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n185\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.100\n&gt;&gt; Now, again just like, I think I\nhad mentioned in one of the sessions,\n\n186\n00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.320\nwhereas I use Minitab sometimes\nto reason out a problem.\n\n187\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.741\nUsually I will still send\nit in an Excel spreadsheet,\n\n188\n00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:15.866\nbecause that's what most\nof my customers have.\n\n189\n00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.110\nSo same thing with all\nthe Project software.\n\n190\n00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:23.330\nA lot of people haven't got on the ball\nyet [LAUGH] about using Project software.\n\n191\n00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.190\nSo sometimes I do my project\nin a Project software.\n\n192\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.650\nAnd I use MS Project and Project+ and\n\n193\n00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.740\nProject Workbench, cuz we just\nhave all this software available.\n\n194\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.120\nBut then when I get ready to\npackage it to my client [CROSSTALK]\n\n195\n00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.206\n&gt;&gt; Right, in Microsoft,\n\n196\n00:10:36.206 --> 00:10:38.756\nthey even give you the option,\nlook, if you don't have\n\n197\n00:10:38.756 --> 00:10:42.285\nExcel installed on your system, as long\nas you have an Internet connection,\n\n198\n00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:44.330\nyou'll still be able to view the document.\n\n199\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.130\nWhereas before, you had to worry about all\nthe different formats and compatibility.\n\n200\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.480\nNot as big of a deal.\n\n201\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.610\nUnless you want to edit that document.\n\n202\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.540\nAnd then you need to have that software.\n\n203\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.790\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n204\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.490\nSo the next thing I want to point out.\n\n205\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.540\nAnd this is, again,\nyou would manually enter this into Excel.\n\n206\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.658\nThe project softwares have different\nplaces where you can enter it, and\n\n207\n00:11:05.658 --> 00:11:07.070\nit gives you some help.\n\n208\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.565\nSo another thing you might want\nto consider on your Gantt chart\n\n209\n00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:11.717\nis your resources.\n\n210\n00:11:11.717 --> 00:11:15.427\nWhich resource is responsible for\nwhich task?\n\n211\n00:11:15.427 --> 00:11:19.710\nThat goes back to, if in the left hand\ncolumn, when you put your task in,\n\n212\n00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.897\nif you've numbered them 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.\n\n213\n00:11:22.897 --> 00:11:26.090\nThen you can assign 1.3.2 to\na particular resource right?\n\n214\n00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.420\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n215\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.200\n&gt;&gt; So in project software, a lot of\ntimes they'll have a calendar set up and\n\n216\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.970\nyou can enter your\nresources into a calendar.\n\n217\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.420\nAnd it will kinda populate the fields\nbased on the information you gave into\n\n218\n00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.260\nthe calendar.\n\n219\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.973\nBut, if you don't,\nyou just would enter it in Excel.\n\n220\n00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:46.787\nSo it's kinda making your\nGantt Chart more robust.\n\n221\n00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:51.047\nCuz I want everyone to remember that the\nactual dynamics of a Gantt chart are just\n\n222\n00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:54.110\nputting your work breakdown\nstructure in graphic form.\n\n223\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.770\nSo all these are extra things\nyou can do to your Gantt chart.\n\n224\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.315\nTo make it more interesting and\nto also make it a living document.\n\n225\n00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:04.056\nOne of the sad things about\nthese Gantt charts, and\n\n226\n00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:07.200\nI'm just showing you some\nexamples as I'm speaking.\n\n227\n00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.307\nOne of the sad things is a lot of times\npeople make these project plans, and\n\n228\n00:12:10.307 --> 00:12:13.435\nthey make them really beautiful, but\nthey just don't ever go back to it.\n\n229\n00:12:13.435 --> 00:12:16.510\nIt's just like that's part\nof their project charter.\n\n230\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.090\nThey'll do a graphic representation\nof their project plan, and\n\n231\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.780\nthen never ever go look at it again.\n\n232\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.700\nAnd that's a little sad.\n\n233\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.830\nAnd this is just talking\nabout the dependencies again.\n\n234\n00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.833\nRemember we were saying one task\nhas to be done before another task.\n\n235\n00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:33.980\nAnd this is a dependency Gantt chart.\n\n236\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.730\nAgain, there are some people that like to\nsee milestone charts, dependency charts.\n\n237\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.117\nI prefer the combination chart.\n\n238\n00:12:40.117 --> 00:12:44.900\nI think putting everything on the same\nchart that you can is a lot leaner.\n\n239\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.450\nBut they might ask you.\n\n240\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.725\nYou could conceivably get asked in\nan exam, what's a milestone chart?\n\n241\n00:12:51.725 --> 00:12:53.710\nWhat's a dependency chart?\n\n242\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.220\nWhat's just a regular Gantt Chart?\n\n243\n00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.350\nSo you could get asked that.\n\n244\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.550\nSo just want you to be familiar.\n\n245\n00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.690\nAnd this is an example of a Gantt\nchart in Microsoft Project.\n\n246\n00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.600\nJust because that's\nthe one I use the most.\n\n247\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.010\nSo let's go back up here.\n\n248\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.210\nYou'll notice on\nthe Microsoft project one,\n\n249\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.300\nthere's legend at the bottom\nthat kind of helps you.\n\n250\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.815\nSo that if you're looking at the project\nplan, and you don't know what those things\n\n251\n00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:20.192\nstand for, what's kind of\nfun in project software, and\n\n252\n00:13:20.192 --> 00:13:23.334\nthis is just generically in all project\nsoftware, you can change things.\n\n253\n00:13:23.334 --> 00:13:26.713\nSo, if you don't like the default\nthing for a milestone, or dependency,\n\n254\n00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.670\nyou can kind of change it, so.\n\n255\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.410\nBut it just makes it, I think it's kind\nof fun, cuz it makes it more colorful and\n\n256\n00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.680\nit's a little easier to\ntrack your project, so.\n\n257\n00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you company has\nalready purchased the software,\n\n258\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.760\nthen definitely utilize that.\n\n259\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nthat goes back to that Lean concept.\n\n260\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.560\nThe whole Lean thing is that,\nif they have something, use it.\n\n261\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So very good, very good.\n\n262\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.220\nOkay, so another way that I might\nlook at a chart is doing a PERT,\n\n263\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.980\nand that stands for\nprogram evaluation review technique.\n\n264\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.300\nAnd it's another kind of simple concept.\n\n265\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.045\nBut remember when we were\ntalking about the PDCA was\n\n266\n00:14:02.045 --> 00:14:05.060\na classified government\ndocument during World War II?\n\n267\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.072\nWell, for the Army, PDCA, well,\n\n268\n00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:11.600\nPERT was the classified document for\nthe Navy during World War II.\n\n269\n00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.170\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n270\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.223\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just think it's kind of fun.\n\n271\n00:14:14.223 --> 00:14:17.900\nSo, PERT is a tool to use to schedule.\n\n272\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.340\nAnd basically what I'm looking at\nis something called critical path.\n\n273\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.110\nWhat has to be done?\n\n274\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.972\nIt's a little kind of thinking\nlike that value stream mapping,\n\n275\n00:14:25.972 --> 00:14:27.934\nlike I'm looking at the essential things.\n\n276\n00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:31.180\nBut on my PERT chart,\nI'm looking at kind of timelines.\n\n277\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.340\nWhat has to happen for that product,\nproject, or service to go out the door?\n\n278\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.390\nSo if one of these tasks slips time-wise,\nit messes up my project.\n\n279\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.060\nIt's not gonna be delivered on time.\n\n280\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.710\nSo we do PERTs in our head all the time.\n\n281\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.420\nWe get up in the morning, and\nwe might turn on the coffee\n\n282\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.580\nbefore we go take our shower, so\nthat the coffee will be ready.\n\n283\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.150\nRight?\n\n284\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.250\nAren't some of us organized enough\nto have that on automatic setting?\n\n285\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.430\nI don't [LAUGH] and I'm in hotels a lot.\n\n286\n00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.690\nSo, I'll start the coffee,\nthen I'll take my shower.\n\n287\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.560\nSo we're used to doing that intuitively.\n\n288\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.500\nIt's just this puts it on a chart.\n\n289\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:13.585\nSo what you have to do first is\ndetermine the duration of your projects.\n\n290\n00:15:13.585 --> 00:15:18.419\nSo if you have a drop-dead date, like\nthis has to be published by the 15th, or\n\n291\n00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:22.600\nthis product has to be in\nthe customer's hands by the 20th.\n\n292\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.549\nThat would be your drop-dead date,\nand you would work kind of backwards.\n\n293\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.240\nNow, oops.\n\n294\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.750\nOkay, so\nhere's an example of a PERT chart, and\n\n295\n00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.860\nit's looking at these various\ntasks that have to happen, and\n\n296\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.300\nit's saying how much time within\neach of these is allotted, right?\n\n297\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.742\nNow, in this one you'll\nnotice that task eight and\n\n298\n00:15:43.742 --> 00:15:47.510\ntask ten can happen in\nthat same timeframe.\n\n299\n00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.660\nAnd it's not gonna throw anything up.\n\n300\n00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.450\n&gt;&gt; In tandem, yep.\n\n301\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:54.170\n&gt;&gt; So, the ones that are red are the ones\nthat have to happen at the right time,\n\n302\n00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.970\nthat's called your critical path.\n\n303\n00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.920\nIf those slip, the whole project slips.\n\n304\n00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.912\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so if task 8 completed before\ntask 10, you would still have to wait for\n\n305\n00:16:02.912 --> 00:16:07.070\ntask 10 before you proceed to task,\nwhat was that, 15?\n\n306\n00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n307\n00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.470\nYeah.\n\n308\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.592\nSo the first thing,\n\n309\n00:16:09.592 --> 00:16:13.424\ngetting your duration, getting all\nthe things that have to happen.\n\n310\n00:16:13.424 --> 00:16:18.397\nAnother good example of PERT is that\nif I'm gonna have a holiday party at my\n\n311\n00:16:18.397 --> 00:16:19.930\nhouse, any holiday.\n\n312\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.350\nIf I wanted to have a party, I'd have to\nget the invitations out early, and other\n\n313\n00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.593\nthings can work in tandem, like ordering\nthe food and ordering the band out.\n\n314\n00:16:28.593 --> 00:16:32.148\nBut if I don't get those invitations\nout first, the whole project slips,\n\n315\n00:16:32.148 --> 00:16:35.210\nbecause no one would know\nI was having a party.\n\n316\n00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.200\nSo it's kind of thinking in that way.\n\n317\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.770\nThis is a PERT chart for a musical video.\n\n318\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.597\nThis is the handout that you're going to\nget in your student package because we\n\n319\n00:16:44.597 --> 00:16:48.194\nlike to show you charts and\ngraphs that have some meaning.\n\n320\n00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:49.624\nSo that when you're looking at it,\n\n321\n00:16:49.624 --> 00:16:52.015\nit's like you're not just\nlooking at task one, task two.\n\n322\n00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:56.182\nBut you'll see that it has a start and\nat the very end,\n\n323\n00:16:56.182 --> 00:17:01.924\nthe purple is the limited, so all\nthe purple boxes in this case are the ones\n\n324\n00:17:01.924 --> 00:17:07.360\nthat have to happen in order for\nyour video to be produced on time.\n\n325\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.780\nSo those have to happen and those purple\nthings are called your critical path.\n\n326\n00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.620\nSo, optimistic time when you're\ntrying to figure out duration,\n\n327\n00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.680\nyou look at your optimistic time,\nyou look at your realistic time and\n\n328\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.790\nyou look at your pessimistic time.\n\n329\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.369\nSo what you're doing is you're basically,\nI'm gonna use my hands for\n\n330\n00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:33.350\nthis because you can also use\nthis as an estimating for money.\n\n331\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.810\nSo I'm gonna look at my longest\ntime that it's ever taken,\n\n332\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.610\nmy shortest time, and\nthen my most likely time.\n\n333\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.460\nSo I get six,\nthat's why we're dividing by six.\n\n334\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.640\nSo I can also do that if I were\ntrying to do a cost estimate.\n\n335\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.090\nSo lets say I was trying to budget for\nan item.\n\n336\n00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.090\nHistory trumps everything,\nif I know how much the item cost,\n\n337\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.560\nI wouldn't use an estimating theory,\nright?\n\n338\n00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.860\nBut let's say, I don't know how\nmuch it's gonna cost, right?\n\n339\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.520\nThen I would say,\nthe most it's ever cost is this.\n\n340\n00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.550\nThe least it's ever cost is this.\n\n341\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.420\nAnd usually it cost that.\n\n342\n00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.620\nAnd then I divide that number by six,\nI get my cost estimate.\n\n343\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.254\nNow on the other side of the coin,\nif I'm trying to get an estimate like,\n\n344\n00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:17.510\nhow much is it gonna cost to\nhave my kitchen remodeled?\n\n345\n00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.890\nSomeone could say, well, the least it\ncould cost, the most it would cost.\n\n346\n00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.030\nWhat it usually cost?\n\n347\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.262\nAnd then they could give me an estimate.\n\n348\n00:18:24.262 --> 00:18:27.388\nAnd I could decide from the estimate,\nif I wanted to move forward or not.\n\n349\n00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:32.400\nSo this thing that we use in PERT can\nbe used in a lot of different things.\n\n350\n00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.620\nAnd so again, this is just showing\nyou another graphic of PERT,\n\n351\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.950\nabout how you could work with it,\ncuz it could be any of those things.\n\n352\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.400\nNow in this case, it's saying\neverything's on the critical path, right?\n\n353\n00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.440\nSo nothing can slip.\n\n354\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.440\nSo, well, actually it's not.\n\n355\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.530\nLet's go back and look at that.\n\n356\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.510\nOkay, so here's the graphic,\nlet's look at the graphic.\n\n357\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:55.480\nAnd maybe full screen.\n\n358\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.000\nThank you.\n\n359\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.702\nAnd what it's saying is that, and it would\nhave been a lot easier if we had those\n\n360\n00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:05.923\nbubbles colored a different color cuz\ntypically, I try to make the critical path\n\n361\n00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:08.737\nin red or blue, or\nsomething that kind of stands out.\n\n362\n00:19:08.737 --> 00:19:10.576\nSo it's saying critical path is A-C-E-G.\n\n363\n00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:15.990\nSo let's just go back and look at that\nreally quickly and see if that's true.\n\n364\n00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:21.236\nSo it's saying A, C and\nG have to happen on time, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:27.633\nI'm not really sure if it's gonna\ngive us anymore information.\n\n366\n00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.687\nPath, okay so A, D and F equals 14.\n\n367\n00:19:30.687 --> 00:19:32.413\nA-C-E-G equals 19.51 days.\n\n368\n00:19:32.413 --> 00:19:34.681\nAnd then B-E-G equals 15.67 days.\n\n369\n00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:39.866\nSo if I were trying to do this,\nI guess it's looking at that pessimistic,\n\n370\n00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:43.140\noptimistic most likely\ntype kinds of things.\n\n371\n00:19:46.332 --> 00:19:48.490\nAnd we're back to that graph again.\n\n372\n00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.460\nSo, hopefully this isn't\nconfusing everyone.\n\n373\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.630\nOkay, so another chart, so\nlet's just kind of wrap up,\n\n374\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.810\nbecause I think a couple of these graphics\nmight have been a little confusing.\n\n375\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.111\nThe main thing that you'd wanna take\naway for your test, and this is also on\n\n376\n00:20:03.111 --> 00:20:07.164\nthe PMBOK test, on the Project\nManagement Body of Knowledge for PMI.\n\n377\n00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:09.483\nWhat we really care about on a PERT chart,\n\n378\n00:20:09.483 --> 00:20:13.278\nthe whole purpose of a PERT chart\nis to determine the critical path.\n\n379\n00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:17.219\nAnd the critical path is,\nwhat items have to be done and\n\n380\n00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:21.426\nwhat time frame to make sure\nthings go out the door on time.\n\n381\n00:20:21.426 --> 00:20:24.000\nAnd there's some things that\ncan happen in tandem, but\n\n382\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.832\nthere's some things that absolutely be on\nthe shadow of a doubt have to happen, and\n\n383\n00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:29.930\nthat's what PERT chart does for us.\n\n384\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.648\nSo, I don't know.\n\n385\n00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.448\nOkay, so burn down chart and\nthat's an agile.\n\n386\n00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:38.354\nAnd that's when you're kind of thinking\na traditional project management.\n\n387\n00:20:38.354 --> 00:20:44.029\nI'm thinking a WBS, and if I wanna take\na WBS, a word breakdown structure and\n\n388\n00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:49.640\ntranslate that into a GANT chart,\nthat would be a good thing, right?\n\n389\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.420\nSo that's kinda traditional.\n\n390\n00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.450\nWell, a non-traditional way of\nthinking is the burn down chart.\n\n391\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.370\nSo I start with the chart that has\nthe body of work that I wanna do and\n\n392\n00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:03.960\nI go backwards as I knock down\nthose pieces of work, right?\n\n393\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.459\nSo as opposed to looking at it linear way,\nI'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this,\n\n394\n00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:08.338\nI'm gonna do this.\n\n395\n00:21:08.338 --> 00:21:13.006\nI'm saying, here's everything I have\nto do and okay, knock that down.\n\n396\n00:21:13.006 --> 00:21:13.629\n&gt;&gt; Starting left to right.\n\n397\n00:21:13.629 --> 00:21:15.130\n&gt;&gt; And so I knock down that piece down.\n\n398\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.530\nWhen do I plan to finish?\n\n399\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.900\nAm I on track to finish?\n\n400\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.930\nEvery member on my team,\nare they on track?\n\n401\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.311\nShould I re-plan early?\n\n402\n00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:27.570\nThat, I think technically even though\nthey attribute that to a burn down chart.\n\n403\n00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.310\nI think the WBS, if you're following it.\n\n404\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.120\nIf you're tracking it\nlike on the GANT chart,\n\n405\n00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.020\nyou're actually tracking the progress.\n\n406\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.410\nYou could do it on that as well.\n\n407\n00:21:39.569 --> 00:21:42.691\nAnd this is just another\nexample of a burn down chart.\n\n408\n00:21:42.691 --> 00:21:47.431\nOn this one, the X axis, remember which\nis on the bottom is date related and\n\n409\n00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:50.817\nthat's almost always,\njust like on the GANT chart,\n\n410\n00:21:50.817 --> 00:21:53.890\nthat one bar is almost always time bound.\n\n411\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.490\nOn histogram,\nif I'm tracking the history of something,\n\n412\n00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:59.510\nthe X axis is time bound, right?\n\n413\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.087\nSo and the Y axis is hours of\nwork remaining in the project.\n\n414\n00:22:03.087 --> 00:22:04.690\nSo this is just another way.\n\n415\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.900\nI think the bars are easier to process,\nthat first one that we looked at.\n\n416\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.239\nBut this is just another way I\ncould look at a burn down chart.\n\n417\n00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:17.273\nAnd again, another way.\n\n418\n00:22:17.273 --> 00:22:19.437\nSo this looks more like a scatter diagram,\nright?\n\n419\n00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:21.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n420\n00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.520\n&gt;&gt; So, again when you're looking at the\nconcept of the burn down chart is that I'm\n\n421\n00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.750\nstarting with a large body of work and\nI'm trying to show that I knock it off.\n\n422\n00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.860\nThat I knock down a little bit of that.\n\n423\n00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.260\nAnd how I graphically represent that.\n\n424\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.240\nIf I'm in Excel,\nI can look at a bunch of different ways.\n\n425\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:43.190\nI can try different graphs and see which\none makes the most sense to my audience.\n\n426\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:48.893\nOkay, so the next one that we're gonna\nlook at is a relationship diagram.\n\n427\n00:22:48.893 --> 00:22:51.910\nAnd relationship diagrams look like this.\n\n428\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.889\nAnd the idea is that I'm trying to\nfigure out what relates to other things.\n\n429\n00:22:55.889 --> 00:22:59.437\nSo sometimes they can get pretty messy,\nespecially the first time.\n\n430\n00:22:59.437 --> 00:23:01.375\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n431\n00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:06.604\nthe advantage of a relationship diagram is\nif I'm trying to do a process improvement,\n\n432\n00:23:06.604 --> 00:23:09.339\nit might apply to other\nthings in my network.\n\n433\n00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:12.590\nAnd anytime I can kill two birds with\none stone, that's gonna be leaner.\n\n434\n00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:18.200\nhere's a kind of a prettier\nrelationship diagram.\n\n435\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.080\nAnd in this case, they used it,\nthey put word process in the middle, and\n\n436\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.990\nthey kind of used it like\nyou would a spider diagram.\n\n437\n00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:34.099\nNow, a lot of times you'll hear\nrelationship diagrams referred to as\n\n438\n00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:37.380\nan entity/relationship diagram.\n\n439\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.560\nAnd it gives an conceptual\nview of the database and\n\n440\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.180\nhow things are related,\nwhat things are dependent, interdependent.\n\n441\n00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:50.020\nSo, if I were trying to improve my class,\n\n442\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.620\nI would say okay the components of\nthe class would be the lecture,\n\n443\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.770\nthat would be me, the tutors that\nmight be the help in the module.\n\n444\n00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.931\nAnd the from there, I could break off.\n\n445\n00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:04.611\nSo in this example of the tutors would\nbreak off the student, name, course, ID.\n\n446\n00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:08.633\nSo when you're thinking relationship\ndiagram, it's just like, I have a piece of\n\n447\n00:24:08.633 --> 00:24:12.317\nthe puzzle, I don't have all of the puzzle\nso what are the main components?\n\n448\n00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:15.074\nAnd then how do those main\ncomponents relate to each other?\n\n449\n00:24:15.074 --> 00:24:17.696\nAnd can I spread them out and\nthen there's just different,\n\n450\n00:24:17.696 --> 00:24:20.057\njust like the burn down chart\nthat we just looked at and\n\n451\n00:24:20.057 --> 00:24:22.890\njust like the PERT chart\nthat showed that ugly chart.\n\n452\n00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.660\nThere's different ways that I can look\nat the chart, and in boxes, squares, but\n\n453\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.480\nthe concept is still the same.\n\n454\n00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.892\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n455\n00:24:31.892 --> 00:24:36.550\n&gt;&gt; So, entity/relationship models.\n\n456\n00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.000\nA lot of times, again,\nyou'll see them called E/R models.\n\n457\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.640\nThey might show things like mandatory\nrelationships, optional relationships,\n\n458\n00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.364\nmany-to-many, one-to-many,\none-to-one, recursive.\n\n459\n00:24:49.364 --> 00:24:54.477\nNow, in Lean Six Sigma, we just want\nyou to know that a relationship\n\n460\n00:24:54.477 --> 00:25:01.350\ndiagram is a way that you can graphically\nshow how things relate to one another.\n\n461\n00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:05.670\nFor the purposes to see if you\ncould impact multiple things.\n\n462\n00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.365\nThat if I understand how\nthings relate to one another.\n\n463\n00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:14.060\nWhatever I'm doing to make something\nbetter, faster, more cost effective may be\n\n464\n00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.510\nable to make something else better,\nfaster and more cost effective.\n\n465\n00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.700\nOr on the flip side might hurt something.\n\n466\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.810\nI'm making my little area better,\nfaster, more cost effective, but\n\n467\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.690\nmaybe I haven't considered all\nthe thing that relate to that area.\n\n468\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.230\nAnd I could inadvertently.\n\n469\n00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.910\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n470\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.020\nAnd so that's kind of the concept.\n\n471\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.750\nIf you're doing the Six Sigma exams,\nyou wanna know many-to-many.\n\n472\n00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.840\nAnd we have a handout in the student\npacket that will help you with that.\n\n473\n00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.145\nBut you wanna think about the one-to-many,\nthe one-to-one,\n\n474\n00:25:43.145 --> 00:25:45.630\nthe many-to-one type\nkinds of relationships.\n\n475\n00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:50.220\nSo, you just wanna be familiar with the\ndifferent types of relationship diagrams.\n\n476\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.722\nIn the lean, they're not mentioned to you\nmuch, in Lean Six Sigma, like I said,\n\n477\n00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:58.965\nwe just want you to know the purpose of\nthe relationship diagram is to kind of,\n\n478\n00:25:58.965 --> 00:26:01.932\nI don't know,\nkind of to identify the pros and cons.\n\n479\n00:26:01.932 --> 00:26:04.329\nWhat are things you might\nimpact in a good way,\n\n480\n00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.924\nwhat are some things you\nmight impact in a bad way.\n\n481\n00:26:06.924 --> 00:26:10.274\n&gt;&gt; Here, I'm just looking at\nthe recursive relationships,\n\n482\n00:26:10.274 --> 00:26:13.491\nI can only assume that it has\nthe same meaning within ITs.\n\n483\n00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:18.071\nSo if I were to, if I had a model\nto explain, who I need to go to,\n\n484\n00:26:18.071 --> 00:26:19.670\nto answer question.\n\n485\n00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.305\nAnd then if they don't have the answer,\nwho do they go to to answer the question.\n\n486\n00:26:23.305 --> 00:26:27.700\nSo if I remove a piece of that\npuzzle to make it more streamline.\n\n487\n00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.290\nThen I might not get\nthe answer to my question.\n\n488\n00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:31.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And inadvertently hurt someone\n\n489\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.473\nalong the way.\n\n490\n00:26:32.473 --> 00:26:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n491\n00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:38.010\nAnd those E/R, what they refer to\nas entity/relationship models.\n\n492\n00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.910\nThey're really huge in trying\nto reason out problems, and.\n\n493\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.330\nSo the next thing I'd like to address,\nCherokee, is the four common types of\n\n494\n00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:50.240\nprocess maps, and we've actually\ndiscussed a couple of them already.\n\n495\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.740\nSo.\n\n496\n00:26:52.303 --> 00:26:56.642\nAs a reminder, this is a simple process\nmap and this one's a high level process\n\n497\n00:26:56.642 --> 00:26:59.758\nmap, because it doesn't\nbreak down in the detailing.\n\n498\n00:26:59.758 --> 00:27:00.535\n&gt;&gt; All the details.\n\n499\n00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:01.726\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n500\n00:27:01.726 --> 00:27:06.395\nAnd then, here's a process flow map,\nwell, this is just explaining again,\n\n501\n00:27:06.395 --> 00:27:11.156\nit's the sequence of task, the involvement\nof people, the use of documents.\n\n502\n00:27:11.156 --> 00:27:16.560\nSo it's just a little bit more of\na reminder about a simple process map,\n\n503\n00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.797\nand uses these types of workflow symbols,\nand we talked about that.\n\n504\n00:27:21.797 --> 00:27:22.297\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n505\n00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.300\nThen I also wanted to remind\nyou of a value stream cuz\n\n506\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.470\nwe're talking about the different\ntypes of process maps.\n\n507\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:33.220\nSo one would be your traditional process\nmap, one would be the value stream map.\n\n508\n00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.512\nAnd the value stream map, the big thing,\nit's got different symbols.\n\n509\n00:27:36.512 --> 00:27:39.655\nAnd the difference between\nthe process map and the value stream\n\n510\n00:27:39.655 --> 00:27:43.754\nmap is the value stream map is just gonna\nhave these essential functions, right.\n\n511\n00:27:43.754 --> 00:27:49.640\nAnd the things that you just wanna\nmake sure stay in the process.\n\n512\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.800\nSo from that, if we're building on that,\n\n513\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.430\nanother way that we can look at a process\nchart, or a process map rather.\n\n514\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:02.972\nAnd we have seen some examples, but\none popular thing is the swim lane chart.\n\n515\n00:28:02.972 --> 00:28:07.140\nAnd what the swim lane chart\ndoes is it takes items and\n\n516\n00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.272\nit puts them in different categories.\n\n517\n00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.640\nSo, I can see how the process flows.\n\n518\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.190\nSo if I'm doing a detailed process map\neven, it's gonna look very linear, and\n\n519\n00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.730\nI might not necessarily know which\ndepartments that it impacts.\n\n520\n00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:25.060\nSo in this case,\nI'm looking at patient check out.\n\n521\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.720\nAnd the categories that I have which\naudience might have trouble seeing is\n\n522\n00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.590\npatient and\nthe front desk receptionist, right?\n\n523\n00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, if I were just doing\n\n524\n00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.810\na regular detailed process map, I would\njust be going, this happens, this happens,\n\n525\n00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:38.780\nthis happens.\n\n526\n00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.140\nIn a swim lane,\nI'm seeing these happen in this area and\n\n527\n00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.840\nit morphs over to this other area.\n\n528\n00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.870\nThe advantage of a swim lane chart, and\nhere's a clinic telephone encounter.\n\n529\n00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.300\nAnd I'll just go ahead and read those.\n\n530\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.720\nI'm turning my head for everyone.\n\n531\n00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.540\nWell, actually,\nI can't see those very well.\n\n532\n00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.920\nSo the first one is patient, and\n\n533\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.250\nthen there's other departments\nthat the patient goes through.\n\n534\n00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.240\nSo you're just gonna have to\nkinda go with me on this.\n\n535\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.330\nYou notice that in one area,\nand that area is the nurse and\n\n536\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.679\nthe medical practitioner has\nmore boxes than any other box.\n\n537\n00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.020\nAnd the thinking is,\n\n538\n00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.840\nwherever there are the most activities,\nthat's where the opportunity for\n\n539\n00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.740\nprocess improvement, the biggest ares for\nprocess improvement lies.\n\n540\n00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:36.110\nSo here's an office visit workflow\ntemplate and then this one, you can see,\n\n541\n00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:43.680\nit's the patient, the medical\nprofessional, the provider, and the nurse.\n\n542\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.787\n&gt;&gt; Don't strain yourself.\n\n543\n00:29:44.787 --> 00:29:47.772\n[LAUGH] I mean you're gonna end up with\na crook in your neck, looking at that.\n\n544\n00:29:47.772 --> 00:29:50.005\n&gt;&gt; I know, looking sideways like that.\n\n545\n00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.725\nWell, and usually they're a lot bigger.\n\n546\n00:29:51.725 --> 00:29:56.045\nIn your packet,\nthis'll be a little bit more readable.\n\n547\n00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:59.585\nBecause we like to show you, once again,\nwe like to show you the graphs and\n\n548\n00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:04.295\ncharts that are related to some things,\nso it's a little easier to read.\n\n549\n00:30:04.295 --> 00:30:12.950\nBut in this one, you'll see that\nthe medical professional and the provider.\n\n550\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.270\nThere's a lot of boxes there.\n\n551\n00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.520\nSo, I probably wouldn't,\nif I were trying to improve this process,\n\n552\n00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.920\nI probably wouldn't be looking at\nthe patient or the nursing at this point,\n\n553\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.390\nI'd probably concentrate on this two.\n\n554\n00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.090\nSo, sometimes you can have a flow\nchart that's as simple as Monday,\n\n555\n00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:28.900\nTuesday, Wednesday,\n\n556\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.840\nThursday and these are the activities that\nhave to happen on those particular days.\n\n557\n00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.810\nSo this one, finally,\nis one I think we can read.\n\n558\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.950\nThis is,\ncurrent state of a pizza place, right?\n\n559\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.590\nAnd you see all the different\nthings that are happening.\n\n560\n00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:47.560\nSo based on that theory that I had that\nwhere the most activity is happening is\n\n561\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.070\nthe most opportunity for\nprocess improvement.\n\n562\n00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.100\nThat would be in the prep\npart of the pizza.\n\n563\n00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.420\nSo I'll give you a second to digest.\n\n564\n00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.720\nThis is the first one that we\ncan actually read comfortably.\n\n565\n00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.958\nAgain, the other ones will\nbe in your student pack.\n\n566\n00:31:00.958 --> 00:31:03.972\n&gt;&gt; Dough, storage, stove.\n\n567\n00:31:03.972 --> 00:31:04.870\nWhat does the orange?\n\n568\n00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:07.560\n&gt;&gt; Fridge.\n\n569\n00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.250\n&gt;&gt; Fridge and oven.\n\n570\n00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.025\nOkay.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n571\n00:31:09.025 --> 00:31:11.198\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.090\n&gt;&gt; So, the idea, the biggest difference,\n\n573\n00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.740\nthe takeaway is how a swim lane\n\n574\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.460\nis different from just\na regular detailed process map.\n\n575\n00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.624\nIs the swim lane has actual lanes, and\nthey can be horizontal or vertical.\n\n576\n00:31:25.624 --> 00:31:30.542\nThere's all kinds of templates out there\non search engines also on our student page\n\n577\n00:31:30.542 --> 00:31:31.816\nat SSDGlobal.net.\n\n578\n00:31:31.816 --> 00:31:34.665\nSo there's all kinds of\ntemplates that you can use but\n\n579\n00:31:34.665 --> 00:31:38.715\nthe idea is I'm trying to see how\nthe process goes to different categories,\n\n580\n00:31:38.715 --> 00:31:42.230\ndifferent departments or\nhandled by different people.\n\n581\n00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.906\nThat type of thing.\n\n582\n00:31:42.906 --> 00:31:44.289\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n583\n00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:49.880\n&gt;&gt; So, I think this is close to the the\nlast diagram, is the Spaghetti Diagram.\n\n584\n00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.150\nAnd I kind of really love this one.\n\n585\n00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.450\nHere's an example of a Spaghetti Diagram\njust drawn on paper.\n\n586\n00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.518\nSo the idea of a Spaghetti Diagram is I'm\ntrying to physically track the process.\n\n587\n00:32:01.518 --> 00:32:06.430\nSo I'm putting my pencil kind of like\nan old game that was played many,\n\n588\n00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:07.609\nmany years ago.\n\n589\n00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:09.394\nI'm putting my pencil on a piece of paper.\n\n590\n00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:13.436\nI'm trying to not take the pencil off\nuntil I connect all the dots, right?\n\n591\n00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:15.943\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because what I'm doing is I'm trying to\n\n592\n00:32:15.943 --> 00:32:18.557\nfigure out how things move\nfrom one area to another.\n\n593\n00:32:18.557 --> 00:32:22.052\nAnd if there's an opportunity\nto improve that process.\n\n594\n00:32:22.052 --> 00:32:24.440\n&gt;&gt; Reduce the waste by\nreducing the motion?\n\n595\n00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n596\n00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.600\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n597\n00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.500\nAnd here's one, you know, again,\nI can't stress this enough,\n\n598\n00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.320\nwe've talked about it in other sessions.\n\n599\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.790\nMost of these tools,\nwere meant to be paper and\n\n600\n00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.840\npencil tools to help\nour critical thinking.\n\n601\n00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.000\nAnd then over the years,\nthey became computerized and\n\n602\n00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.840\nthey became templates, and\nnow we use them in presentations.\n\n603\n00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:50.570\nBut don't discount just drawing something\nout just to help your thinking process.\n\n604\n00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:54.841\nSo here's another one,\njust looking at some different movements.\n\n605\n00:32:59.251 --> 00:33:00.890\nAnd then that one's kind of pretty.\n\n606\n00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.556\nI mean, it doesn't look like\na lot of things are going on.\n\n607\n00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:11.880\nNow, as you see in example one,\nthat's before.\n\n608\n00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.430\nThat's all the movement before.\n\n609\n00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.530\nAnd then it's all cleaned up.\n\n610\n00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:16.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In the second one.\n\n611\n00:33:18.856 --> 00:33:20.712\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they organize by departments.\n\n612\n00:33:20.712 --> 00:33:21.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n613\n00:33:21.381 --> 00:33:22.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n614\n00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.850\nagain, these are just examples\nof spaghetti diagrams.\n\n615\n00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:30.030\nNow, there are programs, I think we may\neven see a graph, well I guess not.\n\n616\n00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:33.310\nThere are programs that take\nthe spaghetti diagram and\n\n617\n00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.630\nmake it look more like a flow chart.\n\n618\n00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:41.010\nAnd so they're clean, so\nit shows you the process, it\n\n619\n00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:45.710\nshows you the process all messed up, using\nflow chart symbols, and then it shows that\n\n620\n00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:51.900\nall fixed using flow chart symbols, and\nusually, there's less boxes, right?\n\n621\n00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.750\nBut I think that there is some value\nsometime in actually drawing it out,\n\n622\n00:33:55.750 --> 00:34:00.530\nand letting people know on a flow\nchart like how crazy it is.\n\n623\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think sometimes when you do\n\n624\n00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.200\nthat spaghetti diagram and you use flow\nchart symbols, it doesn't look that bad.\n\n625\n00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.500\nAnd if you're trying to say look,\nit is really bad, and\n\n626\n00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.160\nnow it's like really better\nbecause we cleaned it up,\n\n627\n00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.290\nthen sometimes just drawing\nit out really does help.\n\n628\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:17.560\n&gt;&gt; Well that was a lot of different types\nof charts and graphs that we looked at and\n\n629\n00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.140\nI definitely feel more inspired and\nI'm thinking in different ways.\n\n630\n00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.330\nAnd so I appreciate you taking the time to\nshow us all of those different examples.\n\n631\n00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.800\nAnd I appreciate you guys for staying here\nwith us for our Green Belt Training but we\n\n632\n00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.280\ndo have more really great content headed\nyour way so please don't go anywhere,\n\n633\n00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.840\nget comfortable, but we're gonna go\nahead and wrap up for this episode.\n\n634\n00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.340\nI'll sign off as your\nshow host Cherokee Boose.\n\n635\n00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.410\n&gt;&gt; And this is Doctor Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n636\n00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:48.942\n&gt;&gt; See you next

00:00:08.274\n[MUSIC].\n\n4\n00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.150\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.690\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.940\nNow, we're gonna be taking\na look at the DMAIC Model.\n\n8\n00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.250\nAnd well, it only seems logical\nto start at the beginning.\n\n9\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.590\nSo here we have Dr Terra Vanzant-Stern\nin studios with us today.\n\n10\n00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.520\nWelcome, thank you for being here Doctor.\n\n11\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590\n&gt;&gt; So I was thinking we would go ahead and\nstart at well,\n\n13\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.800\nthe Define Phase because\nthat's at the beginning.\n\n14\n00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.870\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n15\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.020\nAnd the thing is that you want to remember\nabout the DMAIC Model, it is almost,\n\n16\n00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.470\nit's like 40 to 45% of the test\nrelates to things in the DMAIC Model.\n\n17\n00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.060\nA lot of the tools and\nthings we've already covered.\n\n18\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.050\nSo we're gonna be talking about where\nyou would use them in different\n\n19\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.670\nphases of the model to kind of\nmake those tools resonate a bit.\n\n20\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.243\nBut if you have time,\nyou wanna spend it in define.\n\n21\n00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:09.969\nNow obviously if you've got a deadline,\nyou're gonna have to temper that,\n\n22\n00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.169\nbut the more time you can\nspend in Define the better,\n\n23\n00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:15.930\nbecause that really sets the stage.\n\n24\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.941\nSo if we could just go to my slide deck,\nAs Cherokee said,\n\n25\n00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:30.380\nwe're in the Define Phase,\nthis is phase one of the DMAIC Model.\n\n26\n00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.730\nRemember, there are other models\nthat Lean Six Sigma recognizes.\n\n27\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.200\nOne is the PDCA, right?\n\n28\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.364\nAnd the other is designed for Six Sigma.\n\n29\n00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:43.749\nPDCA, a lot of times as a Lean Six Sigma\nprofessional in the workplace,\n\n30\n00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.100\nthat's gonna be the one that you use.\n\n31\n00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.970\nBecause the problem's simple or\nperhaps you have to\n\n32\n00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.710\nget the project done by Monday, so\nthere could be some time sensitivity.\n\n33\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.910\nBut the DMAIC is really\nthe flagship of Lean Six Sigma.\n\n34\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.543\nAnd so in this session, we're just gonna\nquickly review the DMAIC so that you can\n\n35\n00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:06.936\nsee where Define fits in, and then we\nwon't be doing that on the other sessions.\n\n36\n00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.114\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But we'll kinda start there, and\n\n37\n00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:12.112\nthen we'll concentrate mostly\non Define and Decision.\n\n38\n00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:19.493\nAnd that's just a reminder\nthat there's other phases,\n\n39\n00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.440\nMeasure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.\n\n40\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.820\nIt's five phases.\n\n41\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820\nDefine is phase one.\n\n42\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.790\nNow you'll remember that\nwe said in Six Sigma,\n\n43\n00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.000\nthe biggest deal about\nthe DMAIC Model is that in Define,\n\n44\n00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.860\nwe get a very clear idea\nof what the problem is.\n\n45\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.760\nWhereas, in typical problem solving\nsometimes we just throw it out,\n\n46\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.390\nwe're very reactive and we just go and\ntry and solve that problem.\n\n47\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.130\nDefine has a big commitment to making\nsure that we're actually working on\n\n48\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.570\nthe right thing.\n\n49\n00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.900\nThen we go to Measure and we get a clear\nas-is picture of where we are today.\n\n50\n00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.450\nThen we go to Analyze.\n\n51\n00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.110\nIt's at the end of Analyze, after we've\nDefined, and Measured, and Analyzed,\n\n52\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.140\nthat we come up with our\nbrainstorm list of solutions.\n\n53\n00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.900\nIn typical problem solving, we throw out\nthat problem, we have a list of solutions,\n\n54\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.550\nand then we pick one, right?\n\n55\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.830\nBut in the DMAIC Model, we Define,\nwe Measure, we Analyze, and\n\n56\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.100\nwhat that buys us, is that our list of\nsolutions is pretty well thought-out.\n\n57\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.190\nAnd then we move into Improve,\nwhere the project actually happens.\n\n58\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.570\nAnd even though I just told you, you wanna\nspend as much time as you can in Define,\n\n59\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.770\nkinda keep in mind that it's Improve where\nthe actual project is being tested and\n\n60\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.270\nrolled out.\n\n61\n00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.090\nSo you wanna make sure that you allow\nyourself enough time to actually do that.\n\n62\n00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Actually do that.\n\n63\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.730\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n64\n00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.150\nAnd then Control is just\nmostly how to sustain.\n\n65\n00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.645\nWhy that's such a big deal,\nis that when you compare the DMAIC against\n\n66\n00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:52.080\ntypical problem solving,\neven though we say we evaluate an update.\n\n67\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.259\nSometimes we don't even update but\n\n68\n00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.451\nwe rarely look at how to\nkeep that process into play,\n\n69\n00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:03.600\nthat sustainability is sometimes left out\nall together on typical problem solving.\n\n70\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.173\nWe also said that the DMAIC Model\nin Lean Six Sigma is circular, and\n\n71\n00:04:08.173 --> 00:04:13.165\nwhat we mean by that is you're\nthe project manager from cradle to grave.\n\n72\n00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:18.263\nAnd so if you go to one phase, to another\nphase, and you figure out, you know what?\n\n73\n00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:21.009\nI need to go back and\ncheck something in Measure or Define,\n\n74\n00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.690\nthe whole world isn't\ngonna fall apart on you.\n\n75\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.040\nHowever that's not the goal.\n\n76\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.720\nThe goal is to finish each phase and\ngo to the next phase,\n\n77\n00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.180\nit's just you're not really hurting the\nprocess, if you have to take a step back.\n\n78\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.660\nWhereas, if you're looking at\nthe DMAIC in a waterfall method,\n\n79\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.590\nwhich is what Six Sigma uses,\n\n80\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.880\nit might, these phases might be handled\nby totally different departments.\n\n81\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.508\nAnd so that's why it's really\nimportant to wrap it up.\n\n82\n00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:48.920\nBut in the Lean Six Sigma,\nyou're responsible for\n\n83\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.400\nthe project through all the phases.\n\n84\n00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.040\nAnd that's why you can kind of\ntake a step back, if you need to.\n\n85\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.090\nNow, it's a good idea to have\nthe DMAIC Model handy if you're working\n\n86\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.857\non a number of projects.\n\n87\n00:05:01.857 --> 00:05:05.070\nAnd it can be something really simple,\nor it can be something like this,\n\n88\n00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.346\nthat's very complicated.\n\n89\n00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:09.920\nSo I'm going to get back to\nthe simple model first, maybe.\n\n90\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.520\nOkay, so the simple model,\nthat's just if you can remember\n\n91\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.910\nall the different phases and stuff,\nit's just handy to have that around.\n\n92\n00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.030\nAnd the reason is because\nthe social dynamics in the model\n\n93\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.450\nstart becoming different.\n\n94\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.330\nIn Define, you're behind closed doors,\nyou're working on the problem,\n\n95\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.310\nno one really knows what you're doing.\n\n96\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.710\nWhen you move into Measure, a lot of\ntimes you're out on the shop floor or\n\n97\n00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.120\nyou're in the office, or\nyou're in the grocery store, or\n\n98\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.770\nyou're at the hospital, and\nyou're collecting information.\n\n99\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.120\nAnd you're asking people to give\nyou information that they may\n\n100\n00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.820\neither not have or\nmight not feel comfortable giving you.\n\n101\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.220\nAnd so sometimes, even though you\nhave people excited in Define,\n\n102\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.910\nthey're a little bit more\nsuspicious in Measure.\n\n103\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.300\nNow Analyze,\nyou go back behind closed doors and\n\n104\n00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.780\nthe worse anyone is gonna say is,\nwhat are they doing back there, right?\n\n105\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.300\nWell in Improve,\nwhen you're rolling out the project,\n\n106\n00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.750\nthere is a psychological dynamic\nwhere we can plan, plan, plan.\n\n107\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.910\nBut when it gets ready to execute,\nsometimes everybody kinda freezes up.\n\n108\n00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.180\nSo knowing what phase of the model\nyou're in, I think is really valuable.\n\n109\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.020\nSo especially if you've got\nmultiple projects going, and\n\n110\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.070\nif you can remember what the different\nphases are, something simple like this,\n\n111\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.750\njust on a three by five card close to\nyour computer, could be very helpful.\n\n112\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.630\nNow in this more complicated,\ncomplex model, where this comes in handy,\n\n113\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.650\nand I think it's very helpful,\nas I mentioned in some other sessions,\n\n114\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.670\nthat the trend right now\nis to take Lean Six Sigma.\n\n115\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.620\nAnd to test for Lean Six Sigma, SSD Global\nSolutions has a test that you can take on\n\n116\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.650\nour website, for a fee, obviously.\n\n117\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:53.040\nOther vendors have Lean Six Sigma as well,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.160\nHowever there's a lot of people that\nare just Six Sigma or just Lean.\n\n119\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.557\nNow those environments are still trying\nto recruit Lean Six Sigma people, but\n\n120\n00:07:01.557 --> 00:07:05.761\nyou could be Lean Six Sigma certified and\nend up in a Six Sigma environment.\n\n121\n00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:09.056\nAnd they wanted you there to\nbring that other expertise.\n\n122\n00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:15.000\nYou could be in a Lean environment,\nand be a primarily Lean environment.\n\n123\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.417\nSo what this shows you is\nthe DMAIC Model and it says hey,\n\n124\n00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:21.919\nhere's some popular tools\nused by Six Sigma, our Lean.\n\n125\n00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.812\nSo you're a lean Six Sigma\nperson in a Lean environment,\n\n126\n00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:28.020\nyou're just trying to get\npeople to go through the Model.\n\n127\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.101\nWell, why not pick from the Lean tools\nthat they're already familiar with.\n\n128\n00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.344\nThey typically don't use the DMAIC Model,\nthey typically in Lean environments,\n\n129\n00:07:36.344 --> 00:07:37.220\nuse PDCA.\n\n130\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.400\nBut let's say that's part of your job,\nyou're trying to introduce that model.\n\n131\n00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.440\nSo it's a little bit of a soft landing.\n\n132\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.060\nSame thing in Six Sigma, Six Sigma people\nsometimes are a little suspicious that\n\n133\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.470\nyou're a Lean Six Sigma person.\n\n134\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.033\nSo I think if you kinda concentrate\non the tools that they already know,\n\n135\n00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.937\nthat it might be a little\nbit better landing.\n\n136\n00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:59.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and just show them that you are\nflexible and adaptable to make sure that\n\n137\n00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:02.311\nthey don't feel any of that\nuncomfort right away or initially.\n\n138\n00:08:02.311 --> 00:08:04.273\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n139\n00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:07.532\nOkay so in the main purpose in define,\nand this is really huge,\n\n140\n00:08:07.532 --> 00:08:10.970\nis that I want to make sure I'm\nworking on the right thing.\n\n141\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.070\nThat's the thing because, really,\na lot of times, just like\n\n142\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.190\nI said earlier in this presentation,\nsometimes we're just reactive.\n\n143\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.170\nThe problem comes in.\n\n144\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.860\nWe start going out to try\nto solve the problem.\n\n145\n00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.790\nAnd that's kind of counter productive.\n\n146\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.010\nWe want to take a step back.\n\n147\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.100\nMake sure we're really\nworking on the right thing.\n\n148\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.620\nWe also want to make sure that\nthe people who are working with us.\n\n149\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.610\nWhether they agree that it's\na good thing to work on or not.\n\n150\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.570\nWe want to make sure they\nunderstand what we're working on.\n\n151\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.540\nAnd the biggest reason for\n\n152\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.730\nthat Cherokee is that the number one\nreason people don't buy into our ideas.\n\n153\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.070\nThere's lots of reasons why\npeople don't buy into our ideas.\n\n154\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.490\nBut number one reason, they don't\nunderstand what we're talking about.\n\n155\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.860\nThat's it, the number one reason.\n\n156\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.310\n&gt;&gt; So do you think a little bit of\nprep ahead of time before you entered\n\n157\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.180\nthe defined phase,\n\n158\n00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.420\nsuch as maybe some problem in area\nanalysis and then submitting that process\n\n159\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.020\nimprovement charter will really get you\non the right track to enter define?\n\n160\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.470\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, because this is the deal,\ndefine is doing all those things.\n\n161\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.110\nIt's saying hey, let's look at the CTQ's.\n\n162\n00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[CROSSTALK] So that's not necessary?\n\n163\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.161\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n164\n00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:22.630\nThat's what define does is all that\nthings that you were talking about.\n\n165\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.005\nLooking at all of that stuff, but\nit kind of forces us into doing it.\n\n166\n00:09:27.005 --> 00:09:29.040\nWhereas you know we all\nthink that's a good idea.\n\n167\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.790\nI mean I think intuitively we\nwould say hey let's do that.\n\n168\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.130\nWe should have done a market analysis or\n\n169\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.100\nfeasibility study before\nwe jumped into something.\n\n170\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.930\nBut define just kinda makes you do it.\n\n171\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.880\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So absolutely.\n\n172\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.850\nAnd when we first start a process,\nsometimes, if we can go back to my slides,\n\n173\n00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.715\nwhen we first start a process, sometimes\nit might feel a little like this.\n\n174\n00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:56.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right,\nso where are we headed?\n\n175\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.860\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:03.730\nAnd so that's another thing that define\nhelps us with, is it gives us that idea.\n\n177\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.710\nRight, I mean it provides a direction.\n\n178\n00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.550\nNow we may have to tweak up the direction\nby the time we're at the end of define,\n\n179\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.230\nbut it helps us with\nwhich way we want to go.\n\n180\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.760\nSo define basically\nprovides a structure and\n\n181\n00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.070\nhandles those things that\nyou were talking about.\n\n182\n00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:25.070\nIt helps us to achieve buy in, because\nit's the number one people don't buy in.\n\n183\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.110\nAnd it sets the stage for problem solving.\n\n184\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.470\nSo I think we mentioned earlier in some\nsessions, even when you're studying,\n\n185\n00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.900\nsometimes it's better to physically set\nthe stage and then come back and study.\n\n186\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.580\nSo in Define, I'm setting the parameters.\n\n187\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.690\nI'm setting boundaries.\n\n188\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:45.095\nI'm getting to know who can help me and\nwho I might need to even watch out for.\n\n189\n00:10:47.917 --> 00:10:51.531\nNow one of the ways that it provides\nstructure is something that we've already\n\n190\n00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:54.180\ntalked about which is the project charter.\n\n191\n00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.220\nIn define, define, measure and\n\n192\n00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.150\nanalyzer actually quite creative\nphases However, there are a few rules.\n\n193\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.340\nAnd one of the rules in define is\nthat you can't leave define without\n\n194\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.500\na project charter.\n\n195\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.600\nNow it's possible that you started define\nwith a project charter, and then when\n\n196\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.280\nyou're in define you're just making sure\nyou're working on the right problem,\n\n197\n00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.760\nyou've got the right people.\n\n198\n00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.640\nSo you can start define with\na project charter which basically\n\n199\n00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.030\nmeans this is what I'm going to make.\n\n200\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.620\nBetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n201\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.560\nOr you can develop the project\ncharter in Define.\n\n202\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.610\nYou just can't leave Define without one.\n\n203\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.600\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n204\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.210\nNow we also said that project\ncharters could be formal or informal.\n\n205\n00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.640\nAnd this is just a reminder.\n\n206\n00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.620\nI know this is probably\nreally difficult to see.\n\n207\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.660\nBut remember in your student packet,\n\n208\n00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:45.370\nwhich is at ssdglobal.net You're going\nto have that project charter template.\n\n209\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.440\nNow our template has a tendency\nto be fairly extreme.\n\n210\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.720\nAnd the reason is because if you\nfill out the template correctly,\n\n211\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.160\ndefine almost writes itself.\n\n212\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.600\nSo define when you're doing\na domaic report, is a narrative.\n\n213\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.760\nIt says this is what I did.\n\n214\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.240\nThis is why I did it.\n\n215\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.560\nAnd the project charter\nis obviously a form, so\n\n216\n00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.630\nyou’re gonna have to take that form and\ntranslate it into a narrative, but\n\n217\n00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.460\nif you fill out everything on our form,\nyou’re almost done with defining.\n\n218\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.380\nSo some companies have a little\nbit less aggressive charter, and\n\n219\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.500\nremember the rule in Lean Six Sigma\nis if they have a collateral.\n\n220\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.390\nIf they have something on hand,\nyou want to use that.\n\n221\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.750\nNow there’s no reason why Let's say\nthey have a leaner project charter.\n\n222\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.860\nAnd you think that you want\nto include some other things.\n\n223\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.540\nThere's no reason why you\ncan't add an appendix.\n\n224\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.910\nBut you always want to try in\nLean Six Sigma, to use what's available.\n\n225\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.080\nOne of the common problems, when people do\nprocess improvement with other programs.\n\n226\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.330\nOr one of the common complaints, is that.\n\n227\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.500\nYou know, we worked a long time\nputting these swarms together and\n\n228\n00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.360\ncoming up with some\nsort of infrastructure.\n\n229\n00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.110\nAnd we don't wanna just turn\npeople off right off the bat\n\n230\n00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.140\nby not using their stuff.\n\n231\n00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.070\n&gt;&gt; All this extra paperwork that's\n\n232\n00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.640\nreally not-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n233\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.840\n&gt;&gt; Something that they're gonna be using,\nso you wanna keep it relevant.\n\n234\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.432\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n235\n00:13:01.043 --> 00:13:04.740\nSo here's just another way you\ncould look at a project charter.\n\n236\n00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.800\nLike I said we have our project\ncharter on the intranet.\n\n237\n00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.440\nIf your company has one you want to use\nthat one but also you might look at our\n\n238\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.640\ncharter and say you know that just doesn't\nresonate with me This is kind of taking\n\n239\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.920\na little bit of that A3 angle where I'm\nputting my project charter on one page and\n\n240\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.340\ni'm trying to cover everything.\n\n241\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.340\nSo also king of keep that in mind,\neven though we've like our charter and\n\n242\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.700\nwe think there are some\nadvantages to using it,\n\n243\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.210\nwhat's important is that\nyou fell comfortable.\n\n244\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.440\nIf you are in an environment where\nthey don't require project charter or\n\n245\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.000\nthey are just thinking some busy work,\nYou could take something like this and\n\n246\n00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.630\nwork out your thoughts.\n\n247\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.570\nAnd then form a really good email that\nyou send to your go to person that has\n\n248\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.380\nthese components.\n\n249\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.200\nBut this is still what\nyou're working from.\n\n250\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.420\nThe reason why you wanna do\na project charter in the first place\n\n251\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.150\nis a little bit like you\nwanna cover yourself.\n\n252\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.000\nSo down the line if someone says well I\nthought you were gonna be working on this,\n\n253\n00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.530\nor I thought you were gonna be working\non that, or I didn't understand.\n\n254\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.940\nYou've kinda got this\ncharter to go back to.\n\n255\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.210\nMostly what I do is I train students and\nI train the instructors however\n\n256\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:18.310\nI do have a small consulting presence from\nmany years ago when I started the company.\n\n257\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.590\nCompanies that just want to work with me\nthey don't want to work with anyone else.\n\n258\n00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.286\n&gt;&gt; Of course why not.\n\n259\n00:14:23.286 --> 00:14:25.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah right exactly\n\n260\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.400\n&gt;&gt; and they don't use project charters.\n\n261\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.690\nI mean I send them an email, but\nI always go back to this charter and\n\n262\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.430\nmake sure that I've got the things\nthat are included in the charter and\n\n263\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.440\nI can't tell you over the years\nhow many times someone\n\n264\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.130\nbrought me in their office and\nthey said, like the CEO said, \"Dr.\n\n265\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.500\nStern, what are you working on?\" and\nthey worked with me on the charter, but\n\n266\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.940\nthey forgot what I worked on because\nthey've got a lot of competing things.\n\n267\n00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.050\nOr I'm working with a department head and\nthey again, like I said thought they were\n\n268\n00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.710\ngoing in a direction but\nwe were going in a different one.\n\n269\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.490\nIt just kind of a nice\ndocument to go back to.\n\n270\n00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.630\nBut also you wanna go back to it yourself.\n\n271\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.610\nYou constantly wanna say,\nyou know am I on target?\n\n272\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.830\nAm I doing what I said I was gonna do?\n\n273\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.820\nSo I see project charters as\nbeing more of a living document.\n\n274\n00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.140\nAt some large companies,\n\n275\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.570\nsometimes they get filed and\nthey basically don't get looked at again.\n\n276\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.180\nAnd people get way off course.\n\n277\n00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.630\nSo project charter kind\nof a living document.\n\n278\n00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.500\nBut you want to find something\nthat resonates with you.\n\n279\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.750\nNow, at the bottom of your\nproject charter or your email,\n\n280\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.630\nif you're in an environment that\ndoesn't use project charters.\n\n281\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.590\nOne of the things that you want to\ndo is make sure you've included\n\n282\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.900\nyour projected return on investment.\n\n283\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.650\nWe covered projected return on\ninvestment in another session, and\n\n284\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.230\nwe said that that's my best guess.\n\n285\n00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:46.692\nIf we solve this problem,\nif we make this activity better, faster or\n\n286\n00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:53.586\nmore cost-effective, this is what I think\nWe could make, save, or avoid spending.\n\n287\n00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:57.568\nIt's really crucial,\nbecause when you're doing a process\n\n288\n00:15:57.568 --> 00:16:02.340\nimprovement project charter,\nyou're essentially doing a proposal.\n\n289\n00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.137\nWhat you're asking for is I want\npermission to go to that next level.\n\n290\n00:16:06.137 --> 00:16:08.860\nRemember, the next level in\nthe domain model is measure.\n\n291\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.940\nWe're trying to get a clear assess\npicture of where we are today, right?\n\n292\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.980\nSo, all I'm trying to do with my project,\n\n293\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.750\nprocess improvement project charter,\nis get you to understand.\n\n294\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.350\nThis is a real problem.\n\n295\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.720\nI think if we solve the problem,\nthat we could make, save, or\n\n296\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.370\navoid spending a certain amount of money,\nand I just need some time to work it out.\n\n297\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.256\nNow, if I'm in define, and\nthis happens all the time, I'm in define,\n\n298\n00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:35.063\nand because they're all\nthese great define tools,\n\n299\n00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:38.570\nI might figure out how to\nsolve the problem in define.\n\n300\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.290\nNow, I need to stop,\nnot go to measure, just go ahead and\n\n301\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.150\nbuild my project plan and\nsolve the problem.\n\n302\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.810\nSo, sometimes at the end of define,\nyou do know the answer.\n\n303\n00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:52.366\nAnd if you know the answer, you really\ndon't need the rest of the domaic model,\n\n304\n00:16:52.366 --> 00:16:56.518\nbecause the domaic model is designed\nto come up with the answer, right?\n\n305\n00:16:56.518 --> 00:17:01.699\nSo, project charter, you wanna make\nsure that if it's a process improvement\n\n306\n00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:06.812\nproject charter, that you make it sexy\nenough that your employers gonna go-\n\n307\n00:17:06.812 --> 00:17:07.588\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sure, money talk.\n\n308\n00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:08.980\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n309\n00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.530\n&gt;&gt; They see that dollar amount, and\nit's really gonna resonate with them.\n\n310\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and the way you\nwanna think about it, is if took that\n\n311\n00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.690\nproblem out of the mix, then what\ncould I make, save, or avoid spending?\n\n312\n00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.630\nI know I've said that a couple of times,\nbut I think there's a lot of confusion\n\n313\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.610\nabout projected return on investment,\nbecause it really isn't math.\n\n314\n00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.000\nReturn on investment, when you're all\ndone with your project, that's math.\n\n315\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.720\nThis is how much I put in,\nthis is how much I got out.\n\n316\n00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.198\nBut projected, it's more of an art.\n\n317\n00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:41.177\nAnd you can get some of that projected\nreturn on investment of information, maybe\n\n318\n00:17:41.177 --> 00:17:44.926\nyou did that project at another company,\nor you researched the net and you saw\n\n319\n00:17:44.926 --> 00:17:49.097\na company that did this, and that's what\nthey made, so, it's still a bit of an art.\n\n320\n00:17:54.275 --> 00:17:59.244\nAnd I mentioned this, and this is, I would\nsay, our project charter specifically, but\n\n321\n00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.600\nsome of the other one's out there.\n\n322\n00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.790\nIf you take time to fully think\nout your charter, seriously,\n\n323\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.880\ndefine writes itself,\nbecause it includes all those components.\n\n324\n00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:15.340\nNow, another way to provide structure\nis using TIM WOODS, and remember,\n\n325\n00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:22.230\nTIM WOODS was a way that we could\ntry to figure out the area of waste.\n\n326\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.700\nSo, in this case, I'm using TIM WOODS,\n\n327\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.530\nbecause maybe I'm not really\nsure because this could happen.\n\n328\n00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.330\nRemember, I can enter define\nwith a project charter,\n\n329\n00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.350\nI can develop my project charter and\ndefine, I just can't leave without it.\n\n330\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.470\nSo, let's say I'm in define, and\nI'm working on a department.\n\n331\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.450\nI'm supposed to make this department\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n332\n00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.650\nWell, that's a big thing to think about,\nright?\n\n333\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.000\n&gt;&gt; You don't know where\nexactly the problem is.\n\n334\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.650\nSo, by using this tool, it could help you\nreally narrow down at that particular.\n\n335\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.530\nOr maybe there might be more than one,\nand then once you kind of branch off and\n\n336\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.810\njust put a pin into the other less\nimportant, or less serious problems.\n\n337\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and a lot of times,\nthis is gonna happen.\n\n338\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.210\nBecause once you're a process\nimprovement person,\n\n339\n00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:08.790\nor people recognize that you make things\nbetter, faster, more cost effective,\n\n340\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.390\nthey really could parachute you\ninto an area and go hey, fix it.\n\n341\n00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.660\nSo, I don't even know where to start, I'm\nin define I don't even know what to fix.\n\n342\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.650\nSo, TIM WOODS is gonna direct\nme towards areas of waste,\n\n343\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:25.080\nbecause what we know is that if\nI eliminate or minimize waste,\n\n344\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.010\nthat's an automatic path to making things\nbetter, faster, more cost effective.\n\n345\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.960\nSo, there's just another tool, and\n\n346\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.600\njust as a reminder,\nI know we covered this tool in depth.\n\n347\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.260\nI'm gonna let you take a second,\nand look at this slide.\n\n348\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.320\nThis is what you would see for Tim Woods.\n\n349\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.556\nAnd on the student page for your student\npackage, you're gonna see a TIM WOODS\n\n350\n00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:49.242\nthat's fleshed out a little bit more, it\ngives you some ideas about transportation,\n\n351\n00:19:49.242 --> 00:19:51.510\nit gives you some ideas about Inventory.\n\n352\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.480\nSo, when you go over to www.ssdglobal.net,\nyou're gonna look for\n\n353\n00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:03.550\nthe ITPro.TV Student Page, and\nit'll take you over to those handouts.\n\n354\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.500\nAnd like I said, on that handout,\n\n355\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.680\nyou'll have the one that you saw when\nwe did the full session on TIM WOODS.\n\n356\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.850\nBut it's a great place to start,\nand one of the things I think,\n\n357\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.130\nI probably said this already.\n\n358\n00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.660\nBut one of the things I think is really\ngreat about starting with TIM WOODS\n\n359\n00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.610\nis that if you get parachuted into\na department, and you're trying to\n\n360\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.030\nfigure out what should I even be working\non, this is a good place to start.\n\n361\n00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.650\nAnd it automatically gives you something\nto say to whoever you're working with.\n\n362\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.870\nThey say what are you working on?\n\n363\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.247\nIt's, well, I'm working on-\n&gt;&gt; You don't really have to think about\n\n364\n00:20:32.247 --> 00:20:35.361\nit, because you have it all filled out,\nand you should know that at that point-\n\n365\n00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:36.058\n&gt;&gt; Exactly-\n\n366\n00:20:36.058 --> 00:20:37.161\n&gt;&gt; It's all laid out.\n\n367\n00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:38.997\n&gt;&gt; And I think it gives confidence,\n\n368\n00:20:38.997 --> 00:20:41.556\nsometimes in the Lean Six Sigma\nenvironment,\n\n369\n00:20:41.556 --> 00:20:46.081\nespecially if you're a Lean Six Sigma\nperson going into a Six Sigma environment,\n\n370\n00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:50.362\nthey might be testing you a little bit,\nso they might throw something at you.\n\n371\n00:20:50.362 --> 00:20:52.523\nOne of the people that work for\n\n372\n00:20:52.523 --> 00:20:56.515\nme now was told to fix\nthe Denver Public School System.\n\n373\n00:20:56.515 --> 00:20:57.571\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n374\n00:20:57.571 --> 00:21:00.243\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They hired him as Director of\n\n375\n00:21:00.243 --> 00:21:03.400\nProcess Improvement, and\nthat was his first job.\n\n376\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.269\nAnd it's, okay, really?\n\n377\n00:21:05.269 --> 00:21:06.569\nLet's be realistic.\n\n378\n00:21:06.569 --> 00:21:08.585\n&gt;&gt; Can we send him to Gainesville?\n\n379\n00:21:08.585 --> 00:21:11.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, I mean, a lot of times,\n\n380\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.350\nyou're just put somewhere, and\n\n381\n00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.140\nyou don't know where to start, but\nTIM WOODS is a great place, I think.\n\n382\n00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.450\nNow, another place that you can start,\nthat I think is really valuable.\n\n383\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.700\nAnd in this case, you may or may not have\na high level idea what you want to work\n\n384\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.640\non yet, and that's to go back to the CTQs.\n\n385\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.260\nNow remember,\na CTQ is critical to quality, right, and\n\n386\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.355\nthat means it's critical to success,\nit's critical to satisfaction.\n\n387\n00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:42.860\nIt's critical to price, or\nto speed, or to cost effectiveness.\n\n388\n00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.260\nWell, cost effectiveness and price\nare the same thing, that better faster,\n\n389\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.190\nmore cost effective.\n\n390\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.810\nCustomer requirements are always CTQ.\n\n391\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.642\nSo, one place you could start in define,\nregardless if you have an idea of what you\n\n392\n00:21:56.642 --> 00:22:00.021\nwanna work on or not,\nis you could go and look at the CTQs.\n\n393\n00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:01.367\nWhat does the customer want?\n\n394\n00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:03.399\nAnd that's gonna give you some ideas.\n\n395\n00:22:03.399 --> 00:22:04.223\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n396\n00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:11.364\n&gt;&gt; And just as a reminder,\nthese are just kind of,\n\n397\n00:22:11.364 --> 00:22:16.390\nthese slides are just going to\nhelp you remember what CTQs are.\n\n398\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.770\nThese are part,\nthe reason I'm showing them to you.\n\n399\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.545\nThis is part of your student package.\n\n400\n00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:25.573\nAnd so, if you get a little confused,\nwell, what's a CTQ?\n\n401\n00:22:25.573 --> 00:22:28.780\nOr how can I figure out what they are?\n\n402\n00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.790\nRemember, in our CTQ session,\nsome of the slides that you saw,\n\n403\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.210\nthese are in addition to those.\n\n404\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.920\nSo, if you get into define, and\nyou're having a struggle with that,\n\n405\n00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.180\nyou can always go and look at\nthe student packet for extra ideas.\n\n406\n00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.670\nWhen you're looking at CTQs,\n\n407\n00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.240\nsome of the questions that you\nask will also help you in define.\n\n408\n00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.310\nEven if you know the CTQs, I think these\nquestions that lead you to the CTQ\n\n409\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.840\nmight help you figure out\nwhat you want to work on.\n\n410\n00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.410\nSo, what does the customer really want?\n\n411\n00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.510\nWhat are their expectations?\n\n412\n00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.850\nWhat expectations are used\nto drive the design process?\n\n413\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.270\nAnd can the design team\nachieve customer satisfaction?\n\n414\n00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.610\nThat goes back to process capability,\nright?\n\n415\n00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.640\nSo, when I'm in define, and\nall these topics we've talked about in\n\n416\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.910\nother sessions, so hopefully, I'm pulling\nthem together a little bit for you.\n\n417\n00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.750\nCan I achieve what the customer wants?\n\n418\n00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.700\nIs my process even capable of doing that?\n\n419\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.630\nAnd these are things I wanna think\nabout when I'm in the defined phase.\n\n420\n00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.170\nI wanna acknowledge the right people,\n\n421\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.710\nI wanna make sure the right\npeople are working with me.\n\n422\n00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.560\nThere's the Jim Collins,\nthe right people are on the right bus.\n\n423\n00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.250\nThe reality, as a Lean Six Sigma\npractitioner, is a lot of times,\n\n424\n00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.300\nit's just Team Tera, Team Dr. Stern.\n\n425\n00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.934\nAnd I don't have anyone working with me,\nbut if you can,\n\n426\n00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:55.654\nyou want that collective intelligence,\nbecause that gives you better.\n\n427\n00:23:55.654 --> 00:23:59.006\n&gt;&gt; And not only that, but\nif you are brought in as a third-party,\n\n428\n00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:02.179\nyou don't wanna step on any toes,\nyou want them to be open.\n\n429\n00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.779\nAnd be working with you not against you,\nright?\n\n430\n00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:06.439\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n431\n00:24:06.439 --> 00:24:10.346\nAnd one of the things that I might want\nto look at is a stakeholder's analysis.\n\n432\n00:24:10.346 --> 00:24:14.700\nWe address the stakeholder's\nanalysis in other sessions.\n\n433\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.670\nAs a reminder it's the main people\nthat have a stake in the process.\n\n434\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:24.020\nThe thing is that project management\nhas a little bit different\n\n435\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.800\ntake on a stakeholder's analysis\nthan we do in Lean Six Sigma, so\n\n436\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.750\nyou might want to review that session.\n\n437\n00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.823\nBut obviously,\n\n438\n00:24:30.823 --> 00:24:35.661\nat the beginning, we need to know who\nis gonna be impacted by this project.\n\n439\n00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:42.778\nAnd the way we're going to figure out all\nof that kind of stuff is we're going to\n\n440\n00:24:42.778 --> 00:24:46.743\ntake full advantage of some of the tools\nthat we've learned in other sessions,\n\n441\n00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:50.490\nsuch as Process Map, Value Stream Map,\nSIPOC, and the Voices.\n\n442\n00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:55.270\nNow, I do want to point out that earlier\nI said, in Define, it's very creative.\n\n443\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.390\nI mean, I get to figure out\nwhat I want to work on and\n\n444\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.070\nI get to figure out what\ntools I want to work on.\n\n445\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.670\nThere's only a couple of rules.\n\n446\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.750\nOne rule is that I start with a process\nmap, a high level process map.\n\n447\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.180\nAnd remember,\nif we were thinking in terms of a WBS,\n\n448\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.420\nwe would say things like step one,\nstep two, step three, step four.\n\n449\n00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.690\nSo I have to have a process map and I have\nto end Define with a project charter.\n\n450\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.110\nWherever I developed it,\nI just can't leave.\n\n451\n00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.140\nSo there's two rules in Define.\n\n452\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:28.140\nThe process map rule, which we could\nalso look at a value stream map or\n\n453\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.240\na swim lane chart.\n\n454\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.130\nThe idea is that,\nwhich I think makes a lot of sense but\n\n455\n00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.120\npeople skip this, I have to have a high\nlevel idea of what's going on now.\n\n456\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n457\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.430\n&gt;&gt; If I want to determine what\nthe problem is [INAUDIBLE].\n\n458\n00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.930\n&gt;&gt; A picture, yeah.\nYou\n\n459\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.890\nhave to have a picture of\nwhat's happening or a baseline.\n\n460\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.300\nOtherwise, you're not even gonna be\nable to measure if anything has changed\n\n461\n00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.290\nat the end of your project.\n\n462\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.230\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n463\n00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.140\nAnd perception is such a crazy thing.\n\n464\n00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.195\nWe perceive that we know what's going on.\n\n465\n00:25:54.195 --> 00:25:55.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Without the tool.\n\n466\n00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.880\nWe're always just amazed.\n\n467\n00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.230\nAnd I mentioned in other sessions that\nthere are people that just go in and\n\n468\n00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.050\ndo process mapping and sometimes\nthe CEO of that company is like really,\n\n469\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.900\nthey had no idea, right?\n\n470\n00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.340\n&gt;&gt; I was pretty, I was just, I was\nastonished actually whenever I found that\n\n471\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.040\nyou've got this process, someone's already\ndeveloped it but ten people are following\n\n472\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.320\nthis process and there are ten different\nways that they're doing the same thing.\n\n473\n00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.210\nBut they should be following it's\njust a little crazy when you think\n\n474\n00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.120\nof it like that.\n\n475\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n476\n00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.830\nAnd then another thing\nremember we were saying that\n\n477\n00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.570\nthe number one reason why\npeople don't buy into our\n\n478\n00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.090\nideas is because they flat don't\nunderstand what we're talking about.\n\n479\n00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:41.750\nSo some tools that will help us\nwith that are SPOC and the voices.\n\n480\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.340\nSo if you'll remember that,\nwell and voice of the employee.\n\n481\n00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.670\nAnd voice of the employee's huge.\n\n482\n00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.550\nI mean, there's some major companies that\nyou see, Expedia, FitBit, Microsoft,\n\n483\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.880\nMarriott, that say that they base\neverything on the voice of the employee.\n\n484\n00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.780\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty awesome.\n\n485\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's cool and\nthey make that statement quite frequently.\n\n486\n00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.440\nAnother thing that I\nwanna make sure that I do\n\n487\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.170\nis that I align my goals with\nthe business objectives.\n\n488\n00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.110\nAnd the reason why I wanna do that is\nbecause if there's a change in leadership,\n\n489\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.060\nI'm gonna have to defend my project.\n\n490\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:20.820\nAnd seriously, it doesn't have\nto be a dot to dot connection to\n\n491\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.170\nthe business objectives in your department\nor into the company as a whole.\n\n492\n00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.658\nIt can connect to something\nthat connects to something.\n\n493\n00:27:27.658 --> 00:27:31.130\nBut if you're working on something and\nit's not in some way\n\n494\n00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.190\nmeeting those business objectives,\nyou're kind of dead in the water anyway.\n\n495\n00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:40.440\nSo and if someone gives you something,\nand you might wanna say this\n\n496\n00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.560\nin an eloquent way because supervisors\nsometimes don't wanna be challenged.\n\n497\n00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.870\nBut if you're working on something and\n\n498\n00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.090\nyou honestly don't see the connection\nto the major business objectives,\n\n499\n00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.510\nthat's a fair conversation to have,\nI think, Cherokee.\n\n500\n00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.513\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, you always make to sure\nthat you have your morals in line with\n\n501\n00:27:58.513 --> 00:28:02.340\neverything that the company,\nwell their mission statement, or\n\n502\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.745\ntheir company values.\n\n503\n00:28:03.745 --> 00:28:08.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and now we're gonna come back,\nI know I've said this a bunch,\n\n504\n00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.972\nbut in accelerated\nlearning we do this a lot,\n\n505\n00:28:10.972 --> 00:28:15.891\nwhere we repeat facts that are really\nimportant especially ones that will show\n\n506\n00:28:15.891 --> 00:28:20.230\nup on your exam in the Lean Six Sigma\ncertification process.\n\n507\n00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.180\nThere are 2 rules in DEFINE.\n\n508\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.764\nI have to have a Process Map and\nthey have to have a Project Charter.\n\n509\n00:28:26.901 --> 00:28:30.480\nNow all these other tools that\nwe talk about, for example,\n\n510\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.274\nthe voices and\nthe SIPOC which we addressed and\n\n511\n00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:37.480\nthe tinwoods and all of those other tools,\nthose are optional.\n\n512\n00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.730\nThose are tools that are supposed to\nget you from what's happening now,\n\n513\n00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.810\nwhat's the process map to the project\ncharter, what do I want to work on, right?\n\n514\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.190\nThose are all kind of ancillary tools.\n\n515\n00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:51.830\nNow in the project charter and in this\ncase think of when I'm leaving Define.\n\n516\n00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.200\nBecause I'm leaving Define\nwith my project charter.\n\n517\n00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.190\nBut the main thing when I'm leaving\nDefine is I want to make sure\n\n518\n00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:00.060\nI have my problem statement.\n\n519\n00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.260\nOkay and\nthat's how we say it mostly in IT.\n\n520\n00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.860\nWhat's my problem statement?\n\n521\n00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.080\nIn Lean Six Sigma, what is it?\n\n522\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.810\nWhat activities specifically am I\ntrying to make better, faster or\n\n523\n00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.740\nmore cost effective?\n\n524\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.810\nIn some cases all three, some cases two.\n\n525\n00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.540\nRemember we talked about how it all\nboils down to money in the end but\n\n526\n00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.470\nwhat is your objective?\n\n527\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.010\nWhat is your first objective?\n\n528\n00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.710\nAnd so this is called the Y\nstatement in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n529\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.030\nSo my Y statement,\nbecause Y is the major output.\n\n530\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.900\nI don't want to leave Define without\na clearly defined Y statement.\n\n531\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.170\nNow that should be on my project charter,\nbut even if it's not\n\n532\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:41.280\nclearly articulated or it took me\na long time to explain my Y statement,\n\n533\n00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.150\nI really need just a simple statement so\nthat people stop me in the hall and\n\n534\n00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.180\nthey say, what are you working on?\n\n535\n00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.740\nI can say I'm working on\nmaking enrollment faster.\n\n536\n00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.850\nI'm working on getting\nhotel rooms cleaned faster.\n\n537\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.210\nI'm working on answering the phone\nin a more efficient way, right?\n\n538\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.237\nI want to be ready to answer\nthose kinds of questions.\n\n539\n00:30:01.237 --> 00:30:06.420\nSo the xs that you see in\nthis Y=f(x) statement,\n\n540\n00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.310\nI think I mentioned it in another session.\n\n541\n00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.130\nIt looks like math, but it's not.\n\n542\n00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.840\nSo my Y statement is,\nwhat is it I'm trying to do?\n\n543\n00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.410\nWhat am I trying to make better,\nfaster, more cost effective?\n\n544\n00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.991\nThe xs are the inputs and\n\n545\n00:30:18.991 --> 00:30:24.230\nyou'll notice that it's a small x because\nvery rarely is it gonna be one big X.\n\n546\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.940\nIf I do this one thing,\nI'm gonna have a positive outcome.\n\n547\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.170\nNow it can happen and,\nhey that's awesome, right.\n\n548\n00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.310\nIf all I have to do is\nchange this one thing and\n\n549\n00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.250\nhave a positive outcome that's Lean.\n\n550\n00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.300\nAnd there's a lot of things in our\npersonal life and in our business\n\n551\n00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:43.770\ndepartments that, yeah, if we change\nthis one thing, it's one big X, right?\n\n552\n00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.210\nSo kind of keep that in mind.\n\n553\n00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:48.545\nBut usually it's gonna be several inputs,\nright?\n\n554\n00:30:48.545 --> 00:30:49.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n555\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.630\n&gt;&gt; And the example that we used in\nthe other session is if I wanted to make\n\n556\n00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:57.300\nthe perfect birthday cake some of the x's\nI would need would be what, Cherokee?\n\n557\n00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:04.890\n&gt;&gt; The x's for my input would be the eggs,\nthe flour, the sugar, oil, milk.\n\n558\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.770\nI don't know [LAUGH].\n\n559\n00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.080\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all those kinds of things.\n\n560\n00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.790\nAnd then we have to consider, and\n\n561\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.410\nthis is where the f comes in,\nHow did those function?\n\n562\n00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:16.455\nNow what I think, so\ndo the eggs have to be fresh?\n\n563\n00:31:16.455 --> 00:31:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Do they have to be a certain size?\n\n564\n00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.990\nSo, that was kind of the gist of it,\nright?\n\n565\n00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.560\nBut what I think is kinda cool in Define,\nis let's say,\n\n566\n00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.030\nbecause this happens all the time.\n\n567\n00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.730\nWe take the stance that we got\nto develop the project and\n\n568\n00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.140\nwe get to do all these stuff.\n\n569\n00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.240\nA lot of times people just hand us\nsomething to take care of, right?\n\n570\n00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.560\nOur boss just says,\nI want you to fix this.\n\n571\n00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n572\n00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.990\n&gt;&gt; And so-\n&gt;&gt; Delegation.\n\n573\n00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n574\n00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.900\nAnd so I didn't get a choice in it,\nat all.\n\n575\n00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.520\nI didn't get to look at voice of\nthe customer, or SIPOC, or Tim Woods.\n\n576\n00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.170\nMy boss just said,\nthis is what I want you to fix.\n\n577\n00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:51.260\nSo essentially what I'm doing is\nI'm starting in the second phase\n\n578\n00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:51.960\nof the domain.\n\n579\n00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.530\nI have to start measure because\nthey already said the y statement.\n\n580\n00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.790\nWhether it's a good y statement or\nnot, this is what my boss-\n\n581\n00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.602\n&gt;&gt; Your job is.\n\n582\n00:31:58.602 --> 00:31:59.496\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n583\n00:31:59.496 --> 00:32:04.986\nAnd so, one of the things that you\ncan do in Define is to step back and\n\n584\n00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:10.340\nsay Do I have the xs,\ndo I have the capability to achieve y?\n\n585\n00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:15.550\nSo in this case, if I were trying to\nmake the perfect birthday cake, and\n\n586\n00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.250\nI have no oven, right, I could have all\nthe eggs and sugar and milk that I wanted.\n\n587\n00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n588\n00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.690\n&gt;&gt; But I don't have an oven, right.\n\n589\n00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.720\nAnd so this is where I want to\nstart going back to my employer.\n\n590\n00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.440\nAnd I wanna say to them, you know, this is\nwhat you want me to do, and I made a list.\n\n591\n00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.590\nAnd I would suggest write it down or\ntype it out.\n\n592\n00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.335\nI made a list of all the things\nwe need to accomplish y, and\n\n593\n00:32:38.335 --> 00:32:41.095\nthe ones I have checked\nare ones we don't have.\n\n594\n00:32:41.095 --> 00:32:43.495\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And so, what would you like me to do?\n\n595\n00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:46.605\nSo I'm putting the onus back on\nthe person who's asked me to\n\n596\n00:32:46.605 --> 00:32:48.595\nthis rather ridiculous thing.\n\n597\n00:32:48.595 --> 00:32:50.135\nSo sometimes what's happened,\n\n598\n00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:54.050\nand I'm sure everyone's been in this\nsituation, their boss asked them.\n\n599\n00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.690\nThey didn't know, so\nthey're gonna ask you.\n\n600\n00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.310\nThey're gonna put it on you, right?\n\n601\n00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you're giving them some logic to go\n\n602\n00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.810\nup the hierarchy too.\n\n603\n00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.250\nSo you go back and you say, these are some\nof the things that we don't have.\n\n604\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:09.720\nIn fact, what you're saying is my\nprocess isn't really capable right now,\n\n605\n00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.780\nbecause I don't have these core xs.\n\n606\n00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.850\nNow, I always think it's a good idea in\ndefine, someone ask you to do something,\n\n607\n00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.080\nyou go ahead and you look at the xs, you\nrealize you don't have the score things.\n\n608\n00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.590\nI think it's always good to be\nable to offer some suggestions.\n\n609\n00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:30.170\nSo, if a core x doesn't exist, keep in\nmind, you can still buy that x, right?\n\n610\n00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.060\nYou can go out and buy it.\n\n611\n00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.540\nOr outsource it.\n\n612\n00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.980\nYou can develop it internally by training,\nright, or you can do a work around.\n\n613\n00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.740\nMaybe they have an idea.\n\n614\n00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.500\nHey, I don't have an oven.\n\n615\n00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.600\nWhat are gonna do here, right.\n\n616\n00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.240\nSo it's not like you're saying no.\n\n617\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.850\nYou're saying that this present time we\njust don't have this core capabilities.\n\n618\n00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.840\nNow what's beautiful about getting\nthat y statement and let's say and\n\n619\n00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.090\ndefine you have determined that\nyou have the appropriate access\n\n620\n00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.800\nto facilitate the problem.\n\n621\n00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.030\nYou still don't know how to do, but\n\n622\n00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.180\nat least you got the core things\nthat you think you need, right?\n\n623\n00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n624\n00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.420\n&gt;&gt; Then I have to look at how\ndo this core things function So\n\n625\n00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.970\nlet's say, and this might be something\nthat I save until measure, right?\n\n626\n00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:20.330\nSo I'll bring it back up when\nwe're talking about measure but\n\n627\n00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.300\nI might save this part for then.\n\n628\n00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:29.920\nBecause as long as I have the basic\nstuff to create the positive outcome.\n\n629\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.010\nI probably would be willing\nto move forward, right?\n\n630\n00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.940\nI might not know until I got to measure.\n\n631\n00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:38.740\nBut the idea of the f is that now I\nneed to know how those things function.\n\n632\n00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.890\nSo, remember if the eggs are fresh or\nnot, so\n\n633\n00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:44.630\nI have to kind of think\nabout that functionality.\n\n634\n00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.520\nSo let's just do another.\n\n635\n00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.230\nAnd if I'm picking something\nsuch as temperature,\n\n636\n00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.300\nthe temperature may have some variation.\n\n637\n00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.890\nSo I could look at that variation,\nas well, as part of my capability study or\n\n638\n00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.470\npart of my measure statement, right?\n\n639\n00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.530\nSo, let's just quickly do another example.\n\n640\n00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and\nask if we pause right there, so\n\n641\n00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.730\nthat we can spend a little more time.\n\n642\n00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.220\nBecause define is such\nan important phase that I\n\n643\n00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:15.270\nreally wanna make sure we spend\nenough time covering all the details.\n\n644\n00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.570\nSo, in this episode, we were able\nto really look at our two rules,\n\n645\n00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.480\nour two components that we need there.\n\n646\n00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.660\nWe need to have our process map and\nwe need to have our process charter.\n\n647\n00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.820\nBut don't go anywhere because we are,\n\n648\n00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.530\nwe're gonna spend a little\nmore time in define phase.\n\n649\n00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.960\nI think it's really important so\ndon't go anywhere.\n\n650\n00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.290\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this particular episode.\n\n651\n00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:38.660\nSo I'm gonna sign off as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n652\n00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.200\nAnd this is Dr Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n653\n00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.761\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n654\n00:35:45.761 --> 00:35:51.480\n[MUSIC]\n\n655\n00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.713\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

you live from San Francisco.\n\n4\n00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.170\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n7\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.700\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.470\nIf you've been following along, we've\nalready taken a look at the Define phase;\n\n9\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.010\nhowever, we wanted to spend a little\nextra time in this very important phase.\n\n10\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.840\nSo we'll go ahead and start that now.\n\n11\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.520\nIn the studios, we have Dr.\nTerra Vanzant Stern.\n\n12\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.920\nThank you for joining us today, Dr.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440\nThank you for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.300\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and get started and\n\n15\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.290\nlook at the defined details\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n16\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.550\nif we could just go to\nmy deck very quickly.\n\n17\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.110\nWhen we left off in our\nlast session we were\n\n18\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.670\ntalking about the Y = f(x) relationship.\n\n19\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.190\nAnd what we said is Y is\nlike the problem statement.\n\n20\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.660\nSo in IT we say the problem statement.\n\n21\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.440\nAnd remember, a problem statement\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's a problem.\n\n22\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.240\nThe problem statement means this\nis what we're gonna work on.\n\n23\n00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.990\nIn Lean Six Sigma, that's the activity and\n\n24\n00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.880\nwhat we're gonna do if we wanna make it\nbetter, faster, and more cost effective.\n\n25\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.830\nSo I've got some examples\non the other screen.\n\n26\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.040\nI want to make enrollment faster.\n\n27\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.520\nI want to clean my house more efficiently.\n\n28\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Don't we all?\n\n29\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.935\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, really.\n\n30\n00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I want to make my expenses more cost\n\n31\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.430\neffective.\n\n32\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.450\nI want to make the birthday party better.\n\n33\n00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.070\nRight?\nSo those are some examples.\n\n34\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.900\nSo I'm going to go back to\nour Y=f(x) relationship.\n\n35\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.920\nOne of the things that we said\nin the last session is that\n\n36\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.710\nit's possible I'm in Define,\nbut my employer, or my boss, or\n\n37\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.670\nmy client, gives me what they want to\nmake better, faster, more cost effective.\n\n38\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.570\nSo they've already determined the why,\nright.\n\n39\n00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.700\nNow if I get to be part of Define,\nI get to come up with why,\n\n40\n00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.230\nby using all those great tools that\nwe talked about in the last session.\n\n41\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.950\nBut let's say I don't,\nthey just hand it to me.\n\n42\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.710\nOne of the ways this formula can be\neffective is I can take a step back and\n\n43\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.140\nI can say, do I have all the inputs\nnecessary to accomplish the Y statement?\n\n44\n00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.440\nAnd the x's represent anything that\nI have to do to make that happen.\n\n45\n00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.400\nSo if I find out that I don't have all the\ncore x's, I'm not saying no to my boss.\n\n46\n00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790\nI'm not going back and saying,\nhey, we can't accomplish this.\n\n47\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.310\nI'm saying these are some\nof the things that we lack,\n\n48\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.420\nthis is some of the process\ncapability that we don't have.\n\n49\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.620\nNow we're not exactly,\n\n50\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.100\nwhen we're doing this we're not\nexactly saying it can't happen.\n\n51\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.860\nBecause we could buy the expertise,\nwe could outsource it,\n\n52\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740\nwe could train it internally.\n\n53\n00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.550\nSo we're not saying, no forever.\n\n54\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.660\nI'm just saying no for right now.\n\n55\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.570\nAnd what we were talking about\nwhen we ended the last session\n\n56\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.390\nis that it's also how these x's function.\n\n57\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.960\nNow the Y equals x.\n\n58\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.110\nWe were gonna work it within Define.\n\n59\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.725\nSome of the stuff that we could\nwork within Define, y = f(x),\n\n60\n00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:03.320\nwe could also use in measure.\n\n61\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.500\nWe might not even look at\nit till we get to measure.\n\n62\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.190\nBut if we're looking at it now in Define,\nand we're seeing it's not\n\n63\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.450\nalways just having the x's available,\nit's how those x's function.\n\n64\n00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.630\nAnd in our first example we said that we\nare trying to make the perfect birthday\n\n65\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.600\ncake and so we needed eggs and\nan oven and flour and sugar and\n\n66\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.100\nall these kinds of things.\n\n67\n00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.130\nAnd the example we use is that\neggs had to be a certain size and\n\n68\n00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.070\nthey had to be fresh, okay.\n\n69\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.980\nSo we're just gonna do one more\nexample before we move on so\n\n70\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.790\nthat we kind of tie this to\nthe other things in Define.\n\n71\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.855\nSo let's say our problems statement on the\nfire department and my problem statement.\n\n72\n00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:46.205\nMy why is that I want to put\nthe house fire out faster?\n\n73\n00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.025\nNow that sounds pretty reasonable right?\n\n74\n00:03:48.025 --> 00:03:50.185\nI wanna put out house fires faster.\n\n75\n00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:50.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.966\n&gt;&gt; I live in the mountains and\n\n77\n00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.540\nwe're always worried about fires and\nthings like that.\n\n78\n00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.740\nSo on fire department my major thing\nI want to put out fires faster.\n\n79\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.890\nSo what are some of the core\nx's I'd have to have?\n\n80\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.100\n&gt;&gt; So your inputs here would need to\nbe well, personnel, the firemen or\n\n81\n00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.890\nwomen who are working for you.\n\n82\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.740\nYou would need a vehicle to get to\nthe location of that fire some way.\n\n83\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.900\nYou would need equipment.\n\n84\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.110\nHoses, buckets, do they use buckets?\n\n85\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.060\nTo carry the water to put the fire out.\n\n86\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.270\n&gt;&gt; And you need the water.\n\n87\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd\n\n88\n00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.570\nI don't think the dog is\nreally a requirement,\n\n89\n00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.770\nthat's just something fun to have.\n\n90\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.950\nA little dalmatian.\n\n91\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n92\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.980\nSo on my value stream map.\n\n93\n00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.470\nRemember on my value stream map,\n\n94\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.790\nI'm gonna record everything that's\nnecessary to put the fire out.\n\n95\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.090\nNice to have a dog but on my process map.\n\n96\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Leave it out.\n\n97\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIn the process map I might have a step,\n\n98\n00:04:42.345 --> 00:04:44.150\nput the dog on the fire truck.\n\n99\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.220\nIn my value stream map\nthat's not gonna be there.\n\n100\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n101\n00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.160\n&gt;&gt; So that's a really good\npoint that you brought up.\n\n102\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.820\nSo now I'm looking at, I'm gonna\npick something easy such as water.\n\n103\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.070\nTo put out the fire I need water, right?\n\n104\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.350\nSo now I need to know,\nhow does that water need to function?\n\n105\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.700\nDoes it have to be a certain pressure?\n\n106\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.880\nDoes it have to be a certain temperature?\n\n107\n00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.390\nDoes it have to be a certain volume?\n\n108\n00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.530\nDoes it have to be a certain\nlevel of cleanliness?\n\n109\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.160\nRight?\n\n110\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.870\nSo sometimes that becomes\npart of my capability study.\n\n111\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.280\nSometimes I don't use the Y = f(x)\nrelationship till I get to measure.\n\n112\n00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.170\nIn that case I'm using it\nto help look at variation.\n\n113\n00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.300\nIn our measure phase which we'll be\ncovering next in our next session,\n\n114\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.140\nwhat I'm trying to do is I'm trying\nto establish a current picture,\n\n115\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.080\na snapshot if you will.\n\n116\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.990\nAnd so I might use the Y = f(x)\nformula to look at variations and\n\n117\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.210\nthings such as water, right?\n\n118\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.500\nBecause I wanna do a variation study.\n\n119\n00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.430\nSo, I might take the Y = f(x) and pull it\nover in to analyze, because at that time,\n\n120\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.060\nI'm trying to analyze my variation study,\nand that's called the Variation Analysis.\n\n121\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.430\nSo, this is one of those formulas\nthat if you start using in Define,\n\n122\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.820\nyou really can carry through\nall those different phases.\n\n123\n00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.060\nAnd so, this is just that reminder\nslide that we looked at about\n\n124\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.050\nall the things we could do.\n\n125\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.820\nWhen we're in Define we wanna\nask ourselves certain questions.\n\n126\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.440\nWhat's the reason for the action?\n\n127\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.669\nWhat's the target?\n\n128\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.660\nWhat's within our control?\n\n129\n00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.190\nThings that are within our control,\nwe call common cause variation.\n\n130\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.720\nThings that are outside our control,\nwe call special cause variation.\n\n131\n00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.920\nNow, there's lots of different\ntypes of variation, and\n\n132\n00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.260\nlots of different vernacular\naround what we call this.\n\n133\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.670\nSo there's cyclical, there's seasonal.\n\n134\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.040\nSome people call variation regular\nvariation verses non-regular, but\n\n135\n00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.250\nin Lean Six Sigma we have a tendency\nto say common verses special.\n\n136\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.400\nThe reason why that's important in\nDefine is that I have to figure\n\n137\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.130\nout is that variation something\nwithin my control or not?\n\n138\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.490\nSo an example would be I'm\na visitor at a company and\n\n139\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.720\nI want a cup of coffee right,\nbut I'm not from that company.\n\n140\n00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.040\nSo If I go and\nthe coffee pot isn't filled I might really\n\n141\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.480\nnot get a cup of coffee because I\ndon't where the coffee is, right.\n\n142\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n143\n00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.840\n&gt;&gt; So another example of common variation\nis just cost of doing business or\n\n144\n00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.260\nwhat happens within the normal realm.\n\n145\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.530\nSo if I buy a new car,\nat some point I'm gonna have to buy tires.\n\n146\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.530\nI'm never get a new car, no matter how new\nit is, no matter how great the tires are,\n\n147\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.270\nwhere the tires last forever.\n\n148\n00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.450\nSo if you think of common cause variation,\nthings that are in my control.\n\n149\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.980\nI have control over bringing my briefcase,\nI have control over driving my car, right.\n\n150\n00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.340\nBut I don't have control\nover someone else's car.\n\n151\n00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.320\nThat would be special variation.\n\n152\n00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.000\nSpecial variation ranges all\nthe way from simple things like\n\n153\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.890\nI don't know where the coffee is.\n\n154\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.840\nAll the way to things like hurricanes and\nearthquakes and mudslides.\n\n155\n00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.849\nSo special variation is a really big deal.\n\n156\n00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:55.385\nSo when I'm in Define what I'm trying for\nis things that fall in that common\n\n157\n00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:58.568\nvariation, cuz those\nare things that I can impact.\n\n158\n00:07:58.568 --> 00:08:03.382\nAnd sometimes, I do, I have to step\nback and look at the things my boss\n\n159\n00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:08.124\nwants me to change, and\nI have to ask myself, am I capable, right?\n\n160\n00:08:08.124 --> 00:08:10.552\nIs it a capability of the process?\n\n161\n00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:11.253\nCan I do it?\n\n162\n00:08:11.253 --> 00:08:14.665\n&gt;&gt; Right, because you don't want to stress\nyourself out if it's something that's,\n\n163\n00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:16.069\nyou can't even change or affect.\n\n164\n00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:16.637\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n165\n00:08:16.637 --> 00:08:20.070\nthat's just another one of those things\nin divine that I have to think about.\n\n166\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.810\nIs it common cause or\nspecial cause variation?\n\n167\n00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.670\nAm I trying to take on too much, right?\n\n168\n00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.700\nOkay, perfect.\n\n169\n00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.330\nAnd we've said this a number of times,\nfor buy-in purposes,\n\n170\n00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.770\nwe wanna make sure everyone\nunderstands what we're working on.\n\n171\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.260\nAnd we wanna create a purpose statement.\n\n172\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.010\nNow sometimes, this purpose statement\ncan be part of our project charter.\n\n173\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.450\nBut sometimes, that purpose statement\non our project charter, in order,\n\n174\n00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.630\nespecially in technical environments,\nin order for people to\n\n175\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.330\nunderstand what we're working on,\nit might be a little bit more elaborate.\n\n176\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.300\nWhat I'm saying with\nthe purpose statement,\n\n177\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.400\nis that you wanna have the rational,\nthe scope,\n\n178\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.290\nthe target, you wanna try to get\nthat down into like, a paragraph.\n\n179\n00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.110\nSo, if you did run into someone on the\nelevator, you could just kind of say it.\n\n180\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.130\nSo, and if you can do that on your\nproject charter, that's even better.\n\n181\n00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.140\nBut sometimes,\nour project charter, in order for\n\n182\n00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.730\nsomeone to understand the importance\nof what we're working on,\n\n183\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.370\nwe might have to do\na little bit more detail.\n\n184\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.870\nNow, remember that your\n\n185\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.460\nemployer could be the one and is gonna\ngo back to SIPOC and Process Map again.\n\n186\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.040\nYour employer could be the one that\nsays this is what I want you to fix.\n\n187\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.620\nSo, I'm in define,\nI essentially have a project charter,\n\n188\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.940\nit's not all filled out, but my boss is\nalready giving my why statement, right?\n\n189\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.170\nSo, again, even just like we do when\nwe're trying to figure out our own stuff,\n\n190\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.880\nI still think go back to the process map.\n\n191\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.420\nGo back and\n\n192\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.510\nlook at your SIPOC who wear the supplier's\ninput process output customer.\n\n193\n00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.970\nWho are all those people involved,\nbecause it might be a problem?\n\n194\n00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.760\nYou might not have capability,\nit might be special cause variation.\n\n195\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.170\nI mean, there's all kinds of things.\n\n196\n00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.810\nBut the more that you can show your logic,\n\n197\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.080\nlet's say you don't feel\ncomfortable moving forward.\n\n198\n00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they're not just like,\nCherokee doesn't wanna do this project and\n\n199\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.010\nsay no, these are my supporting facts\nas to why currently it's not possible.\n\n200\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n201\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.190\nNow, a typical question on\nexams about define, and\n\n202\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.105\nthis is going to be in your Six Sigma only\nexams through other vendors, certainly on\n\n203\n00:10:24.105 --> 00:10:29.117\nour Lean Six Sigma exam, is they're gonna\nwanna know what is the purpose of define?\n\n204\n00:10:29.117 --> 00:10:34.082\nNow, in the Lean exams, because the Lean\nexams don't recognize the DMAIC model\n\n205\n00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:39.208\nlike Six Sigma and Lean does, they look at\nthe PDCA, if you're taking a Lean exam.\n\n206\n00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:43.000\nThen for the exam purposes, you don't\nreally need to worry about this, but\n\n207\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.191\nif you're taking a Six Sigma or\na Lean Exam,\n\n208\n00:10:45.191 --> 00:10:49.580\nsome of the questions are going to be\naround what is the purpose of define?\n\n209\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.140\nAnd the reason why those questions are\nworded that way is that you have to know\n\n210\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.900\na whole host of other things to be able\nto say what the purpose is so look for\n\n211\n00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:03.190\nthings like Identifying, prioritizing,\nselecting the improvement opportunity.\n\n212\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.780\nThis is one of those sheets,\nagain, that's in your student tax.\n\n213\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.800\nSo, you can go back and refer to it.\n\n214\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.780\nOn the SSD Global exam,\nit's totally open-book.\n\n215\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.680\nSome vendors have open-book exams,\nsome don't.\n\n216\n00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.740\nASQ, and Society for Mechanical Engineers\n\n217\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.700\nalso have open book exams, so these notes,\nI think, are really important.\n\n218\n00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.920\nYou're looking at\ndeveloping team charters.\n\n219\n00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.140\nYou're looking at things defining\nother processes to be improved.\n\n220\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.880\nBecause when I'm in define,\n\n221\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.700\nI might start recognizing other\nthings that I can do, right?\n\n222\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.740\nYou're looking at customer segments,\ncustomer requirements.\n\n223\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.370\nSo, this is kind of a summary slide that\nI think when you're actually testing for\n\n224\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.900\nthe exam, these are the types\nof things they're looking for.\n\n225\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.270\nAnd they might say something, such as,\n\n226\n00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:57.240\nif you we're trying to develop a project\ncharter, what are the components?\n\n227\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.570\nSo, kinda think of-\n&gt;&gt; Knowing that scope of time frame and\n\n228\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.940\nresources should be included,\nsomewhere within that answer.\n\n229\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.060\nAnd I'm not really sure if we spoke about\nthis, but maybe we will for our overview.\n\n230\n00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.710\nBut the format if we have\nto have multiple choices or\n\n231\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.140\nsometimes it's even fill in the blank,\ncorrect?\n\n232\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, well so,\nat SST Global Solutions,\n\n233\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.530\nthe questions are multiple choice and\ntrue false.\n\n234\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.901\nAnd there some short answer once, some\ncompanies have totally multiple choice.\n\n235\n00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:28.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And no fill in the blank.\n\n236\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.990\nSo, it does change.\n\n237\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.700\nOurs has a tendency to be\nmostly multiple choice.\n\n238\n00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.986\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's because\n\n239\n00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:36.768\nit just makes the grading easier,\nand then when we,\n\n240\n00:12:36.768 --> 00:12:41.081\nif the way our tests are designed, we can\ncome back and tell you you need to study.\n\n241\n00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.897\nIf you don't do well, which I'm sure\nyou will, but if you don't do well,\n\n242\n00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:45.347\nwe can come back and say you know what?\n\n243\n00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:47.320\nYou need to study a little more and\nmeasure.\n\n244\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.460\nSo those, it makes those analytics easier.\n\n245\n00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.430\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, okay, so,\n\n246\n00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.330\none of the things in define\nis building effective teams.\n\n247\n00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.810\nOkay, now, I want you to keep in mind,\nlike I said in the other session,\n\n248\n00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.720\nit can just be team Tara,\nteam Dr. Stern, right?\n\n249\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.160\nSo, sometimes you don't\nactually have a team.\n\n250\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.340\nSometimes you get a team of people that\nnobody wants to work with, which is kind\n\n251\n00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.570\nof sad, but they don't have anything\nto do so they are kind of in limbo.\n\n252\n00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.850\nSo, what you're shooting for is something\ncalled a cross functional team,\n\n253\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.000\nand a cross functional team means\nthat you have someone from finance,\n\n254\n00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.320\nsomeone from marketing, someone from ops.\n\n255\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.980\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n256\n00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a Lean Six Sigma.\n\n257\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.040\nWe have a tendency to lean towards\njust get the expertise you don't have.\n\n258\n00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.510\nSo, if you have a large amount\nof financial expertise just\n\n259\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.840\nfrom another company, even though\nthat's not your role at that company,\n\n260\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.600\nit might not be as important to\nhave someone with that expertise.\n\n261\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.920\nBut the idea is that you wanna\nhave people on your team\n\n262\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.710\nthat know things you don't know.\n\n263\n00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:50.100\nNow, in the Lean Six Sigma environment,\nsince a lot of times, they aren't assigned\n\n264\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.240\nto you, and you might just have to\ngo around and pick up resources.\n\n265\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.380\nWhat you wanna remember is that you might\nnot be able to have everyone show up\n\n266\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.650\nto a meeting on that day.\n\n267\n00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.690\nYou might have to go out and\nindividually seek your team members.\n\n268\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.240\nSo, have individual meetings and\nlobby them for their help, right?\n\n269\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.600\nBut in a perfect world,\nyou would have a Champion.\n\n270\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.080\nAnd your Champion would be your\nrah-rah-sis-boom-bah person that's gonna\n\n271\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.930\ngo out and help you, and maybe they're\ngonna be a mentor for you, as well.\n\n272\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.470\nThe Process Owner is a member of your team\n\n273\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.410\nthat it can be kind of\na volatile relationship.\n\n274\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.410\nNow, you could be the Process Owner,\nso you're golden.\n\n275\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.800\nRight, you don't have to worry\nabout if you're the Process Owner.\n\n276\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.290\nBut if you've been brought in to improve\na process that's owned by someone else,\n\n277\n00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.860\nsometimes that can be a little tricky.\n\n278\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.750\n&gt;&gt; Nobody wants to hear\nthat their product or\n\n279\n00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.880\ntheir way of doing something\nisn't the best so it could.\n\n280\n00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and on that consulting side, I've\nnever ever gone in to an environment where\n\n281\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.450\nthey were all jumping on the box going ye,\nye, ye, here to process [INAUDIBLE].\n\n282\n00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So, but\n\n283\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.780\nI think you can make the process owner\nyour friend, and maybe teach them so\n\n284\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.420\nLean Six Sigma tools and themes,\nso, I'm just, keep them in minds.\n\n285\n00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.820\nYour process owner is just what it says.\n\n286\n00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.930\nIt's the person who owns the process.\n\n287\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.890\nNow, sometimes you might have\na hidden processor, and that's why.\n\n288\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.490\nAnd another thing that I\nlove about Lean Six Sigma,\n\n289\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.640\nis it's very sensitive to people.\n\n290\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.910\nSo, the person who built that process may\nhave been promoted up the company line,\n\n291\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.870\nand so going in and trashing that process\nis not gonna be doing you any good, right?\n\n292\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.630\nSo, you always wanna respect.\n\n293\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.200\nThere may have been\npeople that helped build\n\n294\n00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.630\nthe process\n&gt;&gt; Good point, yeah.\n\n295\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.370\nYou just always wanna respect it.\n\n296\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.450\nSomeone built this process, and\nmaybe at the time it was perfect,\n\n297\n00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.320\nit just needs to grow.\n\n298\n00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.330\nThe sponsor is always the person who\nsays it's okay to do the project,\n\n299\n00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.890\nthe one that actually signed off.\n\n300\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.280\nIt's okay for your time, or\nmoney, or whatever you need.\n\n301\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.750\nI'm giving you that time.\n\n302\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.512\nNow, that could be your boss.\n\n303\n00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:47.755\nBut it could be your boss's boss's boss,\nright?\n\n304\n00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:50.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you said something in\nthe previous episode that really head home\n\n305\n00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:53.311\nwith me, and\nit was some whoever signed that check.\n\n306\n00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:54.432\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So I like that statement.\n\n307\n00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.860\n&gt;&gt; That's your sponsor, right?\n\n308\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.605\nI mean, and that's the person,\nthat sponsor, now Sometimes you're\n\n309\n00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:06.030\ngoing to be the subject matter expert,\nwhich we call the SME.\n\n310\n00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.480\nSometimes you are,\nyou're improving your own process,\n\n311\n00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.636\nyou really are the subject matter expert.\n\n312\n00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:14.330\nBut sometimes you're improving\na process that could use some subject\n\n313\n00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.960\nmatter expertise.\n\n314\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.130\nAnd so just kinda keep in mind that\nhaving advisors is a good thing.\n\n315\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.950\nThe way I typically approach it in\na Lean Six Sigma project is I go around,\n\n316\n00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.010\nwhen I'm trying to\ngather my informal team.\n\n317\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.440\nLike they're not gonna always be with me,\nbut I have to go one on one.\n\n318\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.030\nOr one on one to my subject matter expert.\n\n319\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.540\nThe way I handle it, I usually tell them\nthis is what I'm working on and if it\n\n320\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.000\nturns out, I'll give, if it turns out\nwell, I'll give you credit in my report,\n\n321\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.450\nif it doesn't,\nI won't mention that I talked to you.\n\n322\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.080\n&gt;&gt; That's good one.\n\n323\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.218\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, without any risk.\n\n324\n00:16:45.218 --> 00:16:49.006\n&gt;&gt; And also, if you think about,\nlook, if you are working with\n\n325\n00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:53.615\na large enough organization and\nyou do have a project management office,\n\n326\n00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:58.026\nthen sometimes you can't be a subject\nmatter expert in every single.\n\n327\n00:16:58.026 --> 00:16:59.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Of those projects.\n\n328\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.050\nSo it's good to have that option as well.\n\n329\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n330\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.170\nAnd so we're kind of wind up\nthe session just talking about some\n\n331\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.890\nother popular tools and define.\n\n332\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.650\nAnd the first one is something called QFD,\nQuality Function Deployment.\n\n333\n00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:17.660\nAnd the second is something\ncalled the Kano Analysis.\n\n334\n00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.270\nNow, you're going to have templates and\na little bit more explanation on\n\n335\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.660\nthe QFD side, this is really hit\nheavily on the Six Sigma only exam.\n\n336\n00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.330\nOn the Lean side on the Lean only exam,\nKano model is hit.\n\n337\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.660\nSo I'm just gonna overview them\nbecause In Lean Six Sigma,\n\n338\n00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.910\nwe want you to know what they are, right?\n\n339\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.190\nSo I'm gonna give you the information you\nneed to pass the Lean Six Sigma test.\n\n340\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.400\nBut if you're thinking about taking the\nSix Sigma or the Lean-only test, again,\n\n341\n00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.510\nin your student packet, you might want to\nmake a note to focus on these two items.\n\n342\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.107\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because those materials will give you\n\n343\n00:17:53.107 --> 00:17:55.360\na more in depth knowledge.\n\n344\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.040\nSo, first one is QFD which stands for\nQuality Function Deployment,\n\n345\n00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.810\nthis one gets a little confusing\nbecause some people call it\n\n346\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.600\nquality function design, and\nthat would be the actual model.\n\n347\n00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.060\nSo that, we're looking at right now is\nsomething called a House of Quality, and\n\n348\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.944\nthis house actually looks like a house.\n\n349\n00:18:14.944 --> 00:18:16.450\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; Some house, yeah.\n\n350\n00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.520\nSome houses of quality\nlook like a flow chart.\n\n351\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.070\nSo kind of keep that in mind.\n\n352\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:28.170\nThe idea is that I wanna put all the\nimportant things on one piece of paper so\n\n353\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.380\nthat we understand everything there is\nto understand about our quality program.\n\n354\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:38.040\nSometimes these houses aren't\ndeveloped until control.\n\n355\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.540\nSometimes you'll have a house\navailable in Define and\n\n356\n00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.260\nthat's gonna be a way to figure out\nwhat should I be working on, right?\n\n357\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.900\nSo kind of think of it that way.\n\n358\n00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.390\nNow in this House Of Quality,\nwhen you're building it,\n\n359\n00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:53.570\nlike I'm building my House Of Quality.\n\n360\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.230\nI'm looking at what are the customer\nrequirements, what are the CTQ's.\n\n361\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.950\nI'm looking at the technical descriptors.\n\n362\n00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.970\nAnd this is what makes it a little\ndifferent than just looking at a CTQ tree.\n\n363\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.280\nI'm trying to map what the customer\nwants to my technical capabilities.\n\n364\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.280\nSo let's say I have a sandwich\ncart that comes into a building.\n\n365\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.070\nAnd it has cold sandwiches and\nit has cold drinks, right?\n\n366\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:25.200\nAnd I start finding out that my customers\nwould really like a warm sandwich, right?\n\n367\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.520\nI have to look at my cart and\nsay do I have the technical capability,\n\n368\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.260\ndo I have a power source\nto make things warm,\n\n369\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.140\ndo I have the right dishes to\nput something warm on, right?\n\n370\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.880\nSo I'm trying to map\nwhat my customer wants to\n\n371\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.520\nwhat I'm actually capable of doing.\n\n372\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.120\nI'm looking at the relationship\nlike on a scale from one to five.\n\n373\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.530\nHow close am I?\n\n374\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.150\nSo let's say I bring my sandwich cart in.\n\n375\n00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.060\nAnd there is a power source,\n\n376\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.120\nbut I'm not gonna be able to keep\nmy sandwich cart in that place.\n\n377\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.010\nI'm gonna have to move it, right.\n\n378\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.930\nSo on a scale from one to five,\nI have like maybe a three,\n\n379\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.440\nbecause it's there, but I'm probably\ngonna have to get permission and for\n\n380\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.580\nyears I've been having my sandwich\ncart in a certain place, right.\n\n381\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.120\nSo, all I'm trying to do is say,\nkind of on a scale from one to five, and\n\n382\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.210\nsome people use happy faces or\nemoji con type things, or\n\n383\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.410\nthey use moons like a full moon means\nI've got everything, a half moon.\n\n384\n00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.410\nSo people get very clever with these\nHouses Of Quality because they\n\n385\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.550\nare graphic, but\nbasically all I'm trying to say is how\n\n386\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.330\nif I were doing a scale from one to five\nand I had that, it would be a five, right?\n\n387\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.140\nIf I can get it, or if I'm never gonna get\nit, it might be a one or a zero, right?\n\n388\n00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.350\nThen I'm also looking at\nhow they interrelate.\n\n389\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.590\nI'm looking at the competitive assessment.\n\n390\n00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.770\nHow well is my customer doing in\nproviding hot sandwiches, for example.\n\n391\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.710\nI am looking at prioritizing.\n\n392\n00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.020\nOn a scale from one to five, you want\na hot sandwich, you want hot beverages,\n\n393\n00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.050\nyou want better napkins.\n\n394\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.850\nSo which one of those\nare the most important to you?\n\n395\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.210\nAnd then finally I am just prioritizing\nsome of my technical descriptors.\n\n396\n00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.719\nNow somehow some House Of Quality,\nall that stuff I just said,\n\n397\n00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.140\nsome House Of Quality are more\ncomplicated than others and\n\n398\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.030\nthe new trend in House Of Quality\nis kind of cute.\n\n399\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.400\nThe chimney means my waist and\nthe flowers mean my vision,\n\n400\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.610\nno wait my flowers are my values,\nthe sun is my vision, right?\n\n401\n00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.330\nSo some people are really\ntaking a lot of liberty.\n\n402\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.587\nWhat I want to caution you is on the Six\nSigma exam, there's a lot of questions\n\n403\n00:21:29.587 --> 00:21:34.194\nabout the math behind QFD, and that's why\nyou wanna look at your student handout.\n\n404\n00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:40.920\nBut the idea of it, and here you see\nwhat the template would look like.\n\n405\n00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.360\nI think this kinda helps.\n\n406\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.120\nThis is where you would record things,\nbut again there's different templates.\n\n407\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.520\nThis is the most popular one right now.\n\n408\n00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.610\nBut you get the idea.\n\n409\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.440\nI'm putting all of the stuff now.\n\n410\n00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.740\nIn order to make this work,\n\n411\n00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.450\nyou have to have other people on your\nteam that get the whole concept of QFD.\n\n412\n00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.501\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right, you know.\n\n413\n00:21:57.501 --> 00:21:59.901\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If they don't get what you're doing\n\n414\n00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:00.561\nthat's like.\n\n415\n00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:01.161\n&gt;&gt; What is this?\n\n416\n00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:02.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n417\n00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.560\n&gt;&gt; But again, it's quite,\nwhat we want you to know or\n\n418\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.610\nwhat we're shooting for is that.\n\n419\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.680\n&gt;&gt; We want you to be able to take\nthe exams and be successful with them.\n\n420\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n421\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.930\nSo here's an example, now this is\na slightly different template, but\n\n422\n00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.500\nhere's an example of it filled in.\n\n423\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.130\nAnd again like I said in your student\npacket this will make a little bit\n\n424\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:27.789\nmore sense.\n\n425\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.630\nAnd here's like kind of\nthe new kind of quality house.\n\n426\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.410\nWhere you'll see there's kind\nof more simple type things.\n\n427\n00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:43.702\nAnd like we were saying some of\nthem get really, really cutesy.\n\n428\n00:22:43.702 --> 00:22:46.065\nSo, the House Of Quality.\n\n429\n00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:49.575\nWhat you want to know for\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam,\n\n430\n00:22:49.575 --> 00:22:55.345\nis that the House Of Quality is a way to\nshow a picture of all the different facets\n\n431\n00:22:55.345 --> 00:23:00.620\nof what's going on in your department,\nas related to your process improvement.\n\n432\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:05.650\nIt's not used a lot in Lean Six Sigma, but\nit's heavily hit on the Six Sigma site.\n\n433\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.700\nSo on Lean Six Sigma, we just want you to\nknow what it is, in case you ran across\n\n434\n00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.450\nit in a work environment, because it\nis popular in Six Sigma environments.\n\n435\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.630\nSo kind of keep that mind\nthat that's why you need to\n\n436\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.920\nknow what a House Of Quality is.\n\n437\n00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.650\nOn the Six Sigma side again, you're gonna\nwanna understand some of the math and\n\n438\n00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.930\nsome of the relationships, and\n\n439\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.010\nthat will be explained a little\nbit more in your student package.\n\n440\n00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.390\nSo the second thing, and\nthat's on the Six Sigma side.\n\n441\n00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:34.020\nSo back again on the Lean side,\nyou're taking the Lean only test.\n\n442\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.170\nOn Lean Six Sigma,\n\n443\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:40.990\nwhat we want you to know is that the Kano\nmodel is a way to categorize your CTQs.\n\n444\n00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.700\nIt's a way to look at your different CTQs.\n\n445\n00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.180\nAnd you're looking at things\nlike performance and delighters.\n\n446\n00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.015\nAnd you're trying to categorize your CTQs,\neven back to that Likert Scale,\n\n447\n00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:52.372\non a scale from one to five.\n\n448\n00:23:52.372 --> 00:23:56.579\nOn the Lean side, Dr.\nKano is actually still alive and\n\n449\n00:23:56.579 --> 00:24:00.248\nspoke at the last ASQ\nconference in Milwaukee.\n\n450\n00:24:00.248 --> 00:24:03.047\nWhich is just kind of amazing,\nhe's in his 90s.\n\n451\n00:24:03.047 --> 00:24:10.540\nOn the Lean side,\nthe Kano model is a very well loved model.\n\n452\n00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.250\nAnd so you wanna know a little\nbit more about the Kano model\n\n453\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.590\nif you're taking the lean only test,\nif that makes sense.\n\n454\n00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n455\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.530\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe're gonna talk a little bit about it.\n\n456\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.610\nThis is what you typically\nwill see is this, thank you.\n\n457\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.480\nThis is my full screen and\n\n458\n00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.430\nwhat I'm doing is I'm taking my CTQs and\nI'm putting them in one of those boxes.\n\n459\n00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:35.600\nSo kind of think of there's things that\nare gonna satisfy your client, and\n\n460\n00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.620\nthey're kind of expected, right?\n\n461\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.510\nAnd there's gonna be things that\nare gonna delight your client,\n\n462\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.460\nthat little bit extra that\nyou might wanna give.\n\n463\n00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.499\nAnd so you're gonna put them\nsomewhere on this model.\n\n464\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.190\nThe Kano model process is very,\n\n465\n00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.100\nis a lot more serious about defining\nCTQs as well, like when we talked\n\n466\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.860\nabout CTQs we say, okay customer\nrequirement for sure is a CTQ and\n\n467\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.260\nthen anything that is gonna make your\nproject successful or bring satisfaction.\n\n468\n00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:12.180\nIn Lean Six Sigma we kind of have a little\nbit less formal idea of developing CTQs.\n\n469\n00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.150\nThe Kano model on the other hand,\nand those again for\n\n470\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.550\nthe people that are taking the Lean test,\nhas kind of a methodology\n\n471\n00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.090\neven to develop and\nthat's what you're looking at right now.\n\n472\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:27.044\nSo there are steps to developing the CTQs.\n\n473\n00:25:27.044 --> 00:25:32.940\nSo again on the Lean exam you wanna\nreally know the process of developing\n\n474\n00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.650\nthose CTQs and that is outlined in it and\nit's a handout in your student pack.\n\n475\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:43.000\nSo I'd like to just kind of closeup and\nI know you have some ideas as well.\n\n476\n00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.044\nBut the thing is is that on\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam, you want to\n\n477\n00:25:48.044 --> 00:25:54.240\nunderstand about projects and why it's\nimportant to name your project correctly.\n\n478\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.960\nAnd you want to make sure that there's\na project charter, there's a process map.\n\n479\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.380\nYou want to be able to understand\nthe components of team building.\n\n480\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.120\nYou're looking at, Defining your CTQs,\n\n481\n00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.150\nkeeping in mind on the Lean side that\nthere's actually a process to do that.\n\n482\n00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.690\nYou want to align your goals\nwith your business initiative,\n\n483\n00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.050\nand you want to determine your\nprojected return on investment.\n\n484\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.970\nAnd there's lots of different\npaths to do that, so.\n\n485\n00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.670\n&gt;&gt; You've had so much information during\nthis segment and the previous one.\n\n486\n00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.020\nIt really opens a lot of doors for us.\n\n487\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.650\nI mean, even in previous sections,\nsessions we've spoke about different tools\n\n488\n00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.350\nthat we can bring in here, like our SIPOC,\nour TIM WOODS, our voices.\n\n489\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:40.310\nWe also were introduced to our why\nstatement and in this segment we looked at\n\n490\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:46.260\nthings like our house of quality,\nthe Kano, so we see a lot of flexibility.\n\n491\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.070\nA place where we can insert\na lot of creativity.\n\n492\n00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.180\nBut we have to remember those two rules.\n\n493\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.040\nAnd those two rules to\nhave our process map and\n\n494\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.120\nour project charter before\nwe exit the define phase.\n\n495\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.510\nSo I think we got a ton of information.\n\n496\n00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:03.540\nI appreciate that so much and\nI appreciate you guys for staying here and\n\n497\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.180\nunderstanding all the different\nprocesses we have.\n\n498\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.510\nAnd I think that about wraps it up for\nthis episode.\n\n499\n00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.630\nSo we'll go ahead and sign off for\nthis particular show.\n\n500\n00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.950\nAs your host I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n501\n00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.060\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global

00:00:08.308\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.925\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.610\nIn the last episode we were\nlooking at the define phase and\n\n8\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.270\nreally where to get started.\n\n9\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.350\nNow in this phase we're moving along and\nwe're gonna be looking at measure.\n\n10\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.617\nSo in studios today we have Dr Terra\nVanzant Stern to help us with this topic.\n\n11\n00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.140\nThank you for being here today.\n\n12\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.630\n&gt;&gt; So now that we've moved\nout of our define phase,\n\n14\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.320\nwhat are the next steps\nthat we need to take?\n\n15\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, the very first thing that\nwe're gonna do now is going to measure.\n\n16\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.990\nI think what's very important\nis that sometimes someone has\n\n17\n00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.690\nalready defined the process\nimprovement that they want us to make.\n\n18\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.060\nThey're telling us.\n\n19\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.790\nNow in a perfect world,\nI got to be part of define and\n\n20\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.350\ncome up with what I needed to work on.\n\n21\n00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.360\nBut in reality, a lot of times our boss is\ngonna come to us and they're gonna say,\n\n22\n00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.380\ncan you make x better,\nfaster, more cost-effective.\n\n23\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.729\nBut we know x is called y\nbecause y is a positive outcome.\n\n24\n00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.549\nSo in measure, the very first thing we\nhave to do is we have to make sure we\n\n25\n00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.010\nunderstand the why statement, right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.340\nNow if we got to be part of define,\nwe created that why statement, so\n\n27\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.690\nit's gonna be easy.\n\n28\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.030\nBut if we weren't a part of define, we may\nneed to take a little step backwards and\n\n29\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.890\nkind of look at some of\nthose define tools so\n\n30\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.290\nthat we understand what it\nis that we're measuring.\n\n31\n00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.200\nNow if I could go to my slide deck,\nwe're going to look at measure.\n\n32\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.610\nAnd in this session we're\ngonna look at what to measure,\n\n33\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910\nand there are tools for that.\n\n34\n00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.680\nAnd how to measure, and\nthere's tools for that.\n\n35\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.640\nAnd how to articulate that measurement,\nright?\n\n36\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.470\nNow we're using the term measurement,\nand to me that's not as intuitive.\n\n37\n00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.120\nIn define, we're defining the problem,\nwe're defining what we wanna work on.\n\n38\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.970\nSo define feels really comfortable for me.\n\n39\n00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.280\nMeasure actually means,\n\n40\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.190\nI wanna get a clear,\naccurate picture of where we are today.\n\n41\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.780\nNow if I could just go take a snapshot,\nthat's what I would do and\n\n42\n00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.610\nin some some cases you just\ncompletely luck out, right?\n\n43\n00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.550\n&gt;&gt; Now if you were a part of the define\nprocess, if you were lucky enough to be\n\n44\n00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.260\ndefining the process that you wanted\nto measure, when you get to measure,\n\n45\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.240\nyou may already have a list of\nthings that you wanna check into.\n\n46\n00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.340\nBut sometimes you don't get\nthe project until after or\n\n47\n00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.310\nyou've got a lot of other\nthings on your mind.\n\n48\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.880\nSo when you get to measure,\nyou don't really even know where to start.\n\n49\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.060\nSo that's what we're gonna talk about.\n\n50\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.298\nNow keep in mind, I think a clear\nas-is picture of where you are today\n\n51\n00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:50.288\nis imperative and just think,\nif I could take a snapshot, do it.\n\n52\n00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:55.113\nIf I could take a photo on my phone and\nshow you this is we are right now,\n\n53\n00:02:55.113 --> 00:02:59.090\nthat's okay,\nthat satisfies that requirement.\n\n54\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.023\nBut typically, when you're working in\na service or a transaction environment,\n\n55\n00:03:03.023 --> 00:03:04.341\nyou can't take a picture.\n\n56\n00:03:04.341 --> 00:03:08.550\nYou're gonna have to explain\nthe picture using words and models.\n\n57\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.260\nSometimes at the end of measure,\nyou could actually be done in real life\n\n58\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.650\nbecause sometimes people just need to\nknow, hey, what is our current state?\n\n59\n00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.300\nWhat's going on right now?\n\n60\n00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and from an IT perspective,\n\n61\n00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.600\nwe talk about this all the time,\nhow important baselines really are.\n\n62\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.160\nAnd like you mentioned, let's say my end\nusers can't connect to a particular server\n\n63\n00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.531\nand they're getting error messages,\nconnectivity issues.\n\n64\n00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:35.686\nAnd then I use tools to\nmeasure my bandwidth and\n\n65\n00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:39.166\nI see that I've exceeded the number of\npeople that wanna connect to my, and\n\n66\n00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.820\nthen I find my problem is\nthat we need more bandwidth.\n\n67\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.418\nThere you go.\n\n68\n00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:43.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and\n\n69\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.150\nthat's something that I think I really,\nreally love and\n\n70\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.400\nappreciate about the DMAIC model is at\nthe end of define, you may have a project.\n\n71\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.160\nAnd remember, if it's a project\nyou just go to project plan and\n\n72\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.650\nyou just go do it, right?\n\n73\n00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.303\nAt the end of measure,\nyou may not have to go to analyze.\n\n74\n00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:02.180\nOnce you really know\nwhat's happening today,\n\n75\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.270\nyou might have solved the problem, right?\n\n76\n00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.150\nSo when we are in measure,\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna look out.\n\n77\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.561\nProbably more importantly than\nanything else is what to measure.\n\n78\n00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.584\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n79\n00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.290\n&gt;&gt; What do I wanna measure?\n\n80\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.410\nAnd then I wanna identify,\nhow am I gonna do it?\n\n81\n00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.475\nHow am I going to make that measurement so\n\n82\n00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:24.103\nthat people understand\nwhat it is I'm measuring?\n\n83\n00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:29.850\nAnd then sometimes I might have to work\non developing a measurement strategy.\n\n84\n00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.030\nAnd that's because maybe some of\nthe things that I need to find out\n\n85\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.570\naren't in my department.\n\n86\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.410\nMaybe I need to go get special permission\nto look at certain records or files.\n\n87\n00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.660\nOr even, in some cases, if you are working\nin an environment with security,\n\n88\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.500\nclearance requirements-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n89\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.990\n&gt;&gt; I might have to go get permissions.\n\n90\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.810\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I don't have\nthe tools to measure with.\n\n91\n00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.930\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n92\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.570\nremember the purpose of measure is just\nto get a clear picture of you're asked on\n\n93\n00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.950\na Lean Six Sigma exam, hypothetically,\nwhat is the purpose of measure?\n\n94\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.030\nThe purpose of measures\nis just to get a picture.\n\n95\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.320\nI need to know what's going on right now.\n\n96\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.880\nIf you're in the lean environment,\nbecause they don't use the DMAIC,\n\n97\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.200\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n98\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.790\nIf you're in the Six Sigma environment,\nyou want to be familiar with something\n\n99\n00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.590\nwe're gonna cover briefly in a moment\ncalled measurement systems analysis.\n\n100\n00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.859\nSo a lot of the measure questions\non the straight Six Sigma exam\n\n101\n00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:28.061\nare going to be how to calibrate\nyour calibrations, right?\n\n102\n00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.160\nAnd there are statistics and\nthings behind that.\n\n103\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.078\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know if you remember, but\nyou told a really interesting story about\n\n104\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:40.412\nmeasuring your measurement tools, about\na painting and not fitting on the wall.\n\n105\n00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:44.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is actually one\nof my very favorite things.\n\n106\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.810\nI have two homes.\n\n107\n00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.560\nI have one home in the mountains and\none home on the beach.\n\n108\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.830\nWhen my husband was still alive,\n\n109\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.420\nwe were at the Cinco de Mayo\ncelebration and I found this picture.\n\n110\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.700\nMy house at the beach has these very\nangular walls, incredibly angular walls.\n\n111\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.580\nAnd so I found this picture\nthat I thought would fit and I\n\n112\n00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.260\nhad the measurements in my purse, and I'm\nlike, that picture will fit on this wall.\n\n113\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.890\nAnd my husband, of course,\nis saying it's not gonna fit.\n\n114\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.730\nAnd I'm like, I'm sure it's gonna fit.\n\n115\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.540\nI have the measurements.\n\n116\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.600\nBut I didn't have a tape, so I went to the\n$0.99 store and I bought a measuring tape.\n\n117\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.665\nI went back, measured the picture,\nhad it shipped to my house.\n\n118\n00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:23.340\nNow when I opened the painting,\nguess what?\n\n119\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.925\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It didn't fit, and\n\n120\n00:06:24.925 --> 00:06:27.935\nof course my husband's going-\n&gt;&gt; I know this story, so that's not fair.\n\n121\n00:06:27.935 --> 00:06:31.965\n&gt;&gt; And of course my husband's going,\nyou know what, I told you it didn't fit.\n\n122\n00:06:31.965 --> 00:06:33.255\nI just couldn't reason it out.\n\n123\n00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:35.945\nWe had the measurements,\nit looked right, but\n\n124\n00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:39.195\nthen I got to looking\nat my measurement tape.\n\n125\n00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:42.865\nAnd when I looked at my\nmeasurement tape from China,\n\n126\n00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:45.800\nnot that I'm knocking Chinese\nprojects cuz I use a lot of them,\n\n127\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.190\nit didn't line up with\nthe regular measuring tape.\n\n128\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.494\nSo it was just enough ticks off and that\npainting is still hanging on that wall.\n\n129\n00:06:53.494 --> 00:06:56.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, it just kind of reminds me,\nI think of that story and\n\n130\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.250\nI think calibrate your devices.\n\n131\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.950\nMake sure your equipment or\nsoftware is configured.\n\n132\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.460\nMake sure you have the proper settings and\nit's just an important concept.\n\n133\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just don't think about\nmeasuring your measurement system.\n\n134\n00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.716\nIt never, ever occurred to me\nto measure my measuring tape.\n\n135\n00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:16.260\nAnd like I said that painting is still on\nmy wall, still sticks out that little bit.\n\n136\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.890\nSometimes people run into it.\n\n137\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.520\nIt's a little bit of a nightmare.\n\n138\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.740\nSo when you're thinking from\na mathematical standpoint,\n\n139\n00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.230\nthis would be the framework\nthat you're looking at.\n\n140\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.440\nAgain, this is mostly for this people who\nare talking the Six Sigma only tests.\n\n141\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.800\nThis is kind of the conceptual\nmodel that might help you.\n\n142\n00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.440\nWhat you wanna remember is that you're\nalso measuring mostly for variation.\n\n143\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.650\nNow at this point you're not trying\nto make a judgement but the idea,\n\n144\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.890\nin especially Six Sigma, is that if I\nreduce variation, and another word for\n\n145\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.670\nthat is if I standardize things, I may\nhave an automatic process improvement.\n\n146\n00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.570\nSo in measure, I'm looking for\nthings that have variation.\n\n147\n00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.757\nAnd here's a list of example\nof things that have variation.\n\n148\n00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:04.997\nNow you'll notice, some of these\nvariations I may have control over and\n\n149\n00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:06.398\nsome I don't, right?\n\n150\n00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:08.277\nSo when I'm in measure,\n\n151\n00:08:08.277 --> 00:08:14.540\nI'm probably going to focus on ones that\nI have a little bit of control over.\n\n152\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.611\nSo if I were looking at height, I probably\ndon't have a whole lot of control over my\n\n153\n00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:22.410\nheight, for example, but\nI could have some control over my weight.\n\n154\n00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.520\nDoes that make sense?\n\n155\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.100\nI probably can't make myself taller,\nalthough I'm in these really high heels,\n\n156\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.340\nso maybe I can.\n\n157\n00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.830\nBut so, when I'm in measure and\nI'm looking for\n\n158\n00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.800\nvariations, I'm not making\na judgement at this point.\n\n159\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.290\nI'm doing a variation study.\n\n160\n00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.270\nOne way we can do a variation study is\nby using a tool that we talked about and\n\n161\n00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.430\ndefined, the y equals fx statement.\n\n162\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.110\nY, as a reminder,\nis what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\n163\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.650\nX are all the inputs.\n\n164\n00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:54.990\nThe f in the y = fx relationship is how\ndo those inputs have to function and\n\n165\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.890\nthose are called variations, right?\n\n166\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.070\nBut at this time,\na variation study because remember,\n\n167\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.650\nI'm not saying it's good or bad, I'm just\nsaying this is the way it is, right?\n\n168\n00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:10.110\nSo when I'm looking at\nmeasurement systems analysis,\n\n169\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.050\nagain this is more for the Six Sigma\npeople than the Lean Six Sigma people,\n\n170\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.220\nand Lean doesn't have to really\nworry about this too much at all.\n\n171\n00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.975\nI'm looking for\nfive properties in my measurement.\n\n172\n00:09:20.975 --> 00:09:26.005\nNow, those properties would be bias,\nstability, linearity,\n\n173\n00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:28.795\nrepeatability, and reproducability.\n\n174\n00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:30.885\nSo these are kind of things\nthat I'm looking for\n\n175\n00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:34.085\nif I'm trying to determine if\nit's a good measurement or not.\n\n176\n00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:37.465\nIn the Lean Six Sigma exams\nwe don't really cover that.\n\n177\n00:09:37.465 --> 00:09:40.505\nI wanted to throw that in for\nthe Six Sigma only exams.\n\n178\n00:09:40.505 --> 00:09:43.590\nYou want to be very familiar\nwith what those terms mean and\n\n179\n00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.380\nhow they impact your measurement.\n\n180\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.440\nYou also wanna know that this is all part\nof measurement systems analysis, and\n\n181\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.510\nagain guess what?\n\n182\n00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.480\nYou have a handout in your student packet\nthat completely understands this or\n\n183\n00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.830\ncompletely, not understands it,\nexplains it and\n\n184\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.360\ngives you some formulas that might\nbe helpful in the Six Sigma exam.\n\n185\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.330\nSo, when you're measuring, essentially\nwhat you're doing is you're trying to\n\n186\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.650\ncreate the before picture, because\nin measure, here's where we are now.\n\n187\n00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.070\nHere's the before picture.\n\n188\n00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.060\nThen I'm going to roll out my process\nimprovement after I analyze it, I'm gonna\n\n189\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.960\nroll out my process improvement and\nimprove and show you the after picture.\n\n190\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.140\nSo without a clear before picture, it's\ndifficult to show you the after picture.\n\n191\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.860\nSo I need to get your buy in.\n\n192\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.940\nI need to make sure that you truly\nbelieve that this is where we\n\n193\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.980\nare right now today, right?\n\n194\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.880\nSo when we're creating the before picture,\n\n195\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.140\none of the things that we want to\nmake sure that we do is we create\n\n196\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.560\na realistic before picture because if\npeople don't buy into our before picture,\n\n197\n00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.160\nwe can roll out our process improvement\nand say hey, this is what happened after.\n\n198\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.090\nAnd they're going well I never\nbelieved the before one.\n\n199\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.615\nSo if you see that first photo.\n\n200\n00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:55.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I just think that's pretty amazing,\n\n201\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.620\nright?\n\n202\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.690\nAfter he-\n&gt;&gt; He's not sucking in at all.\n\n203\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then the second one?\n\n204\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.140\nAgain, I mean that's just kind of silly,\nthey're taking with the-\n\n205\n00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.120\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't even look like them.\n\n206\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.920\nYeah, it looks like someone\ndefinitely has Photoshopped that.\n\n207\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.950\n&gt;&gt; And the nose is different.\n\n208\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.060\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't even look\nlike the same person.\n\n209\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.720\nThat's right, no.\n\n210\n00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.220\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n211\n00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.740\n&gt;&gt; So, when we're working before and\n\n212\n00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.605\nafter\n&gt;&gt; Remember in measure I'm trying to\n\n213\n00:11:19.605 --> 00:11:21.780\ncreate my before picture.\n\n214\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.570\nI wanna make it realistic.\n\n215\n00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.800\nThat's very,\nvery important that's it is realistic.\n\n216\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.230\nI want your buy-in before I leave measure.\n\n217\n00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.930\nIm trying to tell you this,\nthis is where we at today.\n\n218\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.682\nSo Cherokee, here's even another example\nthat you could probably wouldn't believe\n\n219\n00:11:35.682 --> 00:11:37.580\nthe before picture and the after.\n\n220\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.510\nSo it's really important-\n&gt;&gt; A day at the farm?\n\n221\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n222\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.770\n&gt;&gt; And it's so important that we\ncreate a believable before picture.\n\n223\n00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.650\nAnd I can't stress that enough,\nI've said it a couple of times.\n\n224\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.510\nBut if they don't believe\nyour before picture,\n\n225\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.150\nyou can do all the process\nimprovement you want.\n\n226\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.650\n&gt;&gt; Sure, it really needs to be accurate.\n\n227\n00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.250\n&gt;&gt; And then finally I think another thing\nthat you want to consider is that you\n\n228\n00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.920\nwanna make sure your\nbefore picture is current.\n\n229\n00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:02.950\nSo.\n\n230\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.230\n&gt;&gt; This is true too.\n\n231\n00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.410\nWow.\nSo interesting.\n\n232\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.190\n&gt;&gt; We just don't even think about\nit sometimes that we may have got\n\n233\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:18.280\nan old process map that nobody\nhas ever used before or\n\n234\n00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.320\nsomeone says, how is that working\nin that department, and so\n\n235\n00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.210\nwe are giving you an inaccurate picture or\npicture that is just too old.\n\n236\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.730\n&gt;&gt; So it really should be,\n\n237\n00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.720\nthis information should be accumulated\nafter you've kick-started your project.\n\n238\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.220\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n239\n00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Not from years before.\n\n240\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.150\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nyou're trying to get a now picture, right?\n\n241\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.520\nAnd the importance of\nestablishing a current state,\n\n242\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.250\nwe've already talked about some of them.\n\n243\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.050\nBut it becomes our baseline, right?\n\n244\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.100\nBecause that's what I'm\ngonna measure against, and\n\n245\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.440\nthat's a good way to think of measure.\n\n246\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.050\nIt's the beginning of getting buy-in,\nall right?\n\n247\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.570\nSo some of our buy-in is people need\nto understand what we're working on.\n\n248\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.420\nBut some of our buy-in is that\nsometimes people think we're\n\n249\n00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.550\ntrying to fix something that's not broken,\nright?\n\n250\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.840\nAnd so we need to show them it is broken\nnow if it's not broken or there's other\n\n251\n00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.850\nthings that are more broken, we can go\nback to define and pick another problem.\n\n252\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.940\nBut what am trying to show you is that\nthis is really a serious problem right?\n\n253\n00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:20.180\nSo, in current states also what\nwe start developing our metrics.\n\n254\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.180\nSo when I'm in current state,\n\n255\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.390\nI wanna start thinking,\nhow would things look in a perfect world?\n\n256\n00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.350\nOr how would,\nwhat am I gonna look for to measure?\n\n257\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.460\nNow when we're in the PDCA model,\nwe're looking at that in plan.\n\n258\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.500\nWe're coming up because we execute\nthe plan and then we go back and\n\n259\n00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.250\ncheck the plan.\n\n260\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.990\nBut if we didn't develop some\nthings to check in plan,\n\n261\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.330\nthen we would be dead in the water.\n\n262\n00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.728\nSo in the DMAIC model,\nwe're doing this in measure, okay?\n\n263\n00:13:50.218 --> 00:13:52.705\nNow, when we're looking at Lean Six Sigma,\n\n264\n00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:56.050\nhow are some the ways that they\nestablish a current picture?\n\n265\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.040\nThey identify mistakes, right,\nthey're looking at, okay,\n\n266\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.130\nhere's some of the mistakes\nthat we've made.\n\n267\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.220\nThey're looking at inconsistencies\nbecause, remember,\n\n268\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.720\nif we reduce variation we may have\nan automatic process improvement.\n\n269\n00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.920\nAnd we're doing those things in\nthat area of the variation studies.\n\n270\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.850\nNow if we were just looking,\njust how Lean.\n\n271\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.000\nSo if you're on the Lean,\nyou're just doing the Lean exam.\n\n272\n00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.010\nSome of the ways they say is that, and\nthis is Lean Six Sigma as well, but\n\n273\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.930\non the Lean exam, I would be saying things\nlike I'm identifying potential waste,\n\n274\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.290\nI'm looking at the hand-offs,\nI'm studying the people.\n\n275\n00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.940\nI'm trying to find out if the customer\nis getting their service.\n\n276\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.398\nI'm identifying the value string.\n\n277\n00:14:39.398 --> 00:14:44.510\nSo these are all tools, they come from\nthe Lean side, I can't stress this enough.\n\n278\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.250\nRemember, on the Lean exams, they're not\ngonna talk to you about the DMAIC but\n\n279\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.410\nsome of the tools that\nLean Six Sigma borrows from\n\n280\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.690\njust the Lean tool kit are these types of\nthings to establish the current picture.\n\n281\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.140\nNow, you may have done\na value stream map in define.\n\n282\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.840\nThat would have been okay, too.\n\n283\n00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.958\nBut you might not have done that till\nyou got to measure to get a clear as-is\n\n284\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.699\npicture of where we are today.\n\n285\n00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:11.520\nYou've developed a process map in define.\n\n286\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.130\nWhen you get to measure, you may want\nto develop a detailed process map.\n\n287\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.080\nIt's required in define to\nhave a high-level process map.\n\n288\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.360\nWhen you get to measure, you might wanna\ndetail that out so that you can look for\n\n289\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.298\nthe hand-offs and study the people and\nthose types of things.\n\n290\n00:15:28.298 --> 00:15:29.547\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n291\n00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:34.952\n&gt;&gt; And remember this is just a reminder,\n\n292\n00:15:34.952 --> 00:15:38.060\na detailed process map as\nopposed to process map.\n\n293\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.294\nIf I were thinking in terms of WBS,\nmy process map that I'm required to do and\n\n294\n00:15:42.294 --> 00:15:45.816\ndefine would say step one,\nstep two, step three, step four.\n\n295\n00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:49.463\nIf I did a detailed process map,\nI'd probably have 1.1, 1.2.\n\n296\n00:15:49.463 --> 00:15:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Adding in all those little details.\n\n297\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:51.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n298\n00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.486\nNow another thing that I can use\nthat sometimes we talked about it in\n\n299\n00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:02.809\ncontext of a fish bone diagram.\n\n300\n00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:06.901\nWe said that a fish bone diagram can say\nthis is the problem that we're trying to\n\n301\n00:16:06.901 --> 00:16:09.754\nwork on and we have major\nbones that play into the fish.\n\n302\n00:16:09.754 --> 00:16:13.727\nHowever, we could name\nthose bones after the 3 Ps,\n\n303\n00:16:13.727 --> 00:16:18.965\nwhich is People, Product/Service and\nProcess to keep those 3 Ps,\n\n304\n00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:22.240\nbut we could also use\nit as a way to measure.\n\n305\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.010\nSo, let's say I get to measure and\n\n306\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.410\nI feel like I'm looking at\na blank piece of paper.\n\n307\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.570\nI have no idea where to start.\n\n308\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.830\nI could use the old TQM Philosophy.\n\n309\n00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.400\nWell, what kinds of things could\nI measure about people that\n\n310\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.550\nplay into this process that I'm trying to\nmake better, faster, more cost effective?\n\n311\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.510\nWhat kinds of things could I measure\nspecifically about the product or service?\n\n312\n00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.300\nWhat kinds of things could I measure\nspecifically about the process?\n\n313\n00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.510\nSo kind of keep in mind,\nit's a critical thinking tool.\n\n314\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.540\nI get to measure.\n\n315\n00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.360\nI may already have some ideas what\nto measure that I got from define.\n\n316\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.010\nBut I might have only started\nthe process and measure or\n\n317\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:58.420\nI could still get to measure and\ngo, I know where to start.\n\n318\n00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.660\nSo that's just such another strategy.\n\n319\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.300\nNow, another strategy, if I'm trying to\ngather measurements, is to go back and\n\n320\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.080\nlook at my CTQs.\n\n321\n00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.090\nIf I develop those CTQs, those customer\nrequirements and those things that\n\n322\n00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.950\nare required to make me successful,\nif I took the time to develop those and\n\n323\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.410\ndefine, then I could say, hey, on a scale\nfrom one to five, how am I doing on that?\n\n324\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.290\nThat could be my measurement.\n\n325\n00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:24.980\nCuz remember,\nI'm just trying to get a clear picture.\n\n326\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.820\nSame thing, on a scale from one to five,\nif I took time to\n\n327\n00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.280\nthink my voice of the customer, voice\nof the employee, voice of the process,\n\n328\n00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.240\nvoice of the business,\nhow am I doing with those things?\n\n329\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.790\nNow, it doesn't mean you had\nto develop them in define.\n\n330\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.700\nCTQ's or the voices, because you might not\nhave picked up the process until measure.\n\n331\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.590\nSo you can always step back and\ndevelop those things.\n\n332\n00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.950\nBut if you already have them placed and\ndefined, the beauty of going to measure,\n\n333\n00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.290\nis that you can now go back and\nuse those things I developed.\n\n334\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.644\nAnd I'm kind of killing\ntwo birds with one stone.\n\n335\n00:17:57.641 --> 00:18:01.892\nSo another place, and this is similar\nto the three Ps, when we talked about\n\n336\n00:18:01.892 --> 00:18:06.590\nit earlier, we were talking about it\nin context of the fish bone diagram.\n\n337\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.680\nHowever, if I'm trying to get an idea,\nwhat should I be measuring?\n\n338\n00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.510\nI wanna give my boss a clear,\nas-is picture of where we are today.\n\n339\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.940\nI don't know where to start.\n\n340\n00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.640\nWell, I can do that 3P thing.\n\n341\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.790\nMaybe I do that.\n\n342\n00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.200\nOr I can sit down and I can say,\n\n343\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.710\nokay, are there any kind of machines or\nequipment that I should be measuring?\n\n344\n00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.010\nIs there any kind of methods?\n\n345\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.670\nIs there any materials?\n\n346\n00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.110\nAre there measurements,\nmother nature, manpower?\n\n347\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.160\nIt's just a way to get my brain thinking.\n\n348\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:38.930\nNow, when you're using the fishbone, you\ncould also just use the four Ms, right?\n\n349\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.410\nAnd in this case,\nthe fishbone wouldn't be used.\n\n350\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.440\nI might use the fishbone in analyze\nto figure out my root cause.\n\n351\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.660\nI might use it in define, to just figure\nout what the heck I should be working on.\n\n352\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.920\nBut I could also just use that\nstructure when I'm in measure,\n\n353\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.220\ntrying to figure out what\nshould I measure, right?\n\n354\n00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.440\nSo in that case I'm kind of using\nthe fishbone in a different way.\n\n355\n00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.880\nAnd I might just use 4\nMs instead of 6 Ms and\n\n356\n00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.400\nthis says machines, man, method, material.\n\n357\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.740\nSo I might draw it out in a fishbone.\n\n358\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.860\nAnd where it says effect,\njust what should I measure.?\n\n359\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.270\nAnd then in each one of these categories,\njust start writing up some ideas.\n\n360\n00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.430\nSo I have one piece of paper that\nI could be doing in a meeting.\n\n361\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.770\nI might be doing this in an actual\nmeeting and just kind of drawing it out,\n\n362\n00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.282\nlike what should I be looking at?\n\n363\n00:19:25.282 --> 00:19:30.440\nSo just keep in mind that\nyou could use that as well.\n\n364\n00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.660\nAnd then we come to what we call\nthe balanced score card approach.\n\n365\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.853\nAnd the balance scorecard typically\nhas four different components,\n\n366\n00:19:38.853 --> 00:19:41.985\nit has finance, it has customer,\nit has process.\n\n367\n00:19:41.985 --> 00:19:46.635\nAnd then it has, in the case of our\ngraphic organizational capacity, but\n\n368\n00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:50.155\na lot of times that's referred\nto as training or education.\n\n369\n00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.085\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n370\n00:19:51.085 --> 00:19:54.675\nAnd so what I'm doing is I'm\npretending like I get to measure, and\n\n371\n00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:55.995\nI don't where to start.\n\n372\n00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:56.625\nSo I say, well,\n\n373\n00:19:56.625 --> 00:20:00.435\nif I were looking through a financial lens\nwhat kinds of things would I measure?\n\n374\n00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:04.445\nIf I were looking through a customer\nservice lens, or operations lens, or\n\n375\n00:20:04.445 --> 00:20:07.630\na training and development lens,\nwhat would I measure?\n\n376\n00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.650\nAnd I would write this down.\n\n377\n00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.700\nNow obviously I still have to go out and\nmeasure them.\n\n378\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.320\nBut I still maintain what to measure\nis a little bit more important than\n\n379\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.030\nhow to measure it because you can go and\nask for help.\n\n380\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.600\n&gt;&gt; Someone might have a better idea,\nexactly.\n\n381\n00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and you could go to\nthe net and say how do I measure x, right?\n\n382\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.910\nBecause I don't really know.\n\n383\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.790\nBut knowing what to measure.\n\n384\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.300\nNow, the beauty of the balance scorecard\n\n385\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.000\nis that over half of the Fortune\n500 companies use balance scorecard\n\n386\n00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.620\nas their as their enterprise-wide\nmeasurement system.\n\n387\n00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.760\nSo, if you're working with a company that\nthe company is using balanced scorecard,\n\n388\n00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.380\nwhen you go explain your current state,\n\n389\n00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.770\nthey're gonna be familiar with this\nis how we're doing financially.\n\n390\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.090\nThis is how we're doing\ncustomer service-wise etc.\n\n391\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.100\netc., right?\n\n392\n00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.560\nNow, there are scorecards\ncards out there as well\n\n393\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.460\nthat you can get from search engines.\n\n394\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.970\nSo let's say you never\nworked in supply chain,\n\n395\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.890\nyou could say supply chain scorecard and\nit's gonna come up with all kinds of\n\n396\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.310\nideas of things you should\nmeasure in the supply chain.\n\n397\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.980\nSo kind of keep that in mind.\n\n398\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.375\nThey're usually Excel spreadsheets and\n\n399\n00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:18.400\nthere's usually either no cost or\na minor cost to them.\n\n400\n00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.840\nSo if you get into a situation where you\ndon't know where to start you could type\n\n401\n00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.850\nthat, HR scorecard, and\n\n402\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.040\nit's gonna give you some ideas\nof what you should be measuring.\n\n403\n00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.110\nAnother place that you can look, and\nthis is kind of cool, is benchmarking,\n\n404\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.460\nbecause benchmarking can provide you with\nsome ideas and some measurement tools.\n\n405\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.920\nSo let's say I'm just trying to figure out\nwhat I should be measuring in the customer\n\n406\n00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.990\nservice department or IT.\n\n407\n00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.520\nI could go to a benchmarking study and\nsay, well what is everyone else measuring?\n\n408\n00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.530\nNow, if I wanna go back and say,\nokay their benchmark is here and\n\n409\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.880\nmy benchmark is there,\nthat could also be interesting.\n\n410\n00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.620\nBut maybe IT or HR or customer service or\n\n411\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.420\noperations is measuring something\nyou've never even measured before.\n\n412\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.400\nYou never even thought about measuring it.\n\n413\n00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.240\nSo there's another place you\ncould look for measurement.\n\n414\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.790\nSo another thing I want\nyou to keep in mind about\n\n415\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.920\nmeasure is some of those\nseven tools of quality.\n\n416\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.640\nNow, if you're using the seven tools\nof quality to figure out something,\n\n417\n00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.980\nyou're gonna wait until analyze.\n\n418\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.870\nBut if you're using those seven tools\nof quality just to gather information,\n\n419\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.100\njust to give us a picture\nof where we are today,\n\n420\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.312\nsome of the tools that could be\nhelpful would be your check sheet,\n\n421\n00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:30.460\nyour histograms, your Pareto charts, your\nscatter diagrams, your control charts.\n\n422\n00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:37.100\nSo those seven tools of quality can be use\nto form a really great before picture.\n\n423\n00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.030\nSo for example,\n\n424\n00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.960\nif I were showing my control chart as\na before picture and I let everyone know\n\n425\n00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.750\nthat the idea is the data points\nneeded to come close to the middle.\n\n426\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.430\nAt the end of my story I\ncould show that same control\n\n427\n00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.350\nchart to show you how I improved.\n\n428\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.520\nSame thing with the Pareto chart for\nexample.\n\n429\n00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.320\nIf I had a Pareto chart, and\nI had one thing, remember,\n\n430\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.650\nthat was completely out of whack.\n\n431\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.580\nAfter I rolled out my process improvement,\n\n432\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.780\nbecause I'm trying to\ndo that before picture.\n\n433\n00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.420\nAfter I rolled out my process\nimprovement I could show you another\n\n434\n00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.510\nPareto chart where that\nthing is minimized, right?\n\n435\n00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.840\nSo don't forget your charts and\n\n436\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.830\ngraphs as a good way to show\nyour clear as-is picture.\n\n437\n00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:19.500\nWhere it gets confusing is you don't want\nto think of those graphs as analyzed yet.\n\n438\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.360\nYou'll send those over to\nthe analyze section, but\n\n439\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.760\nyou don't wanna be analyzing them.\n\n440\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.851\nRight now you're just collecting\ninformation to form that as-is\n\n441\n00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:28.180\npicture, right?\n\n442\n00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.140\nNow, sometimes you're\ngonna get to analyze,\n\n443\n00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.870\nand all you have is a bunch\nof spreadsheets from measure.\n\n444\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.920\nThat's very possible.\n\n445\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.550\nAnd that's where you would\ndevelop your charts and crafts.\n\n446\n00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.010\nBut if you're in measure, and you go wow,\nthis would make a great Pareto chart.\n\n447\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.070\nThen you would just go ahead and\n\n448\n00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.770\ndo the Pareto chart there to\nform your before picture, right?\n\n449\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:50.210\nAnd so finally, a tool that people forget\nabout all the time is observation.\n\n450\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.090\nAnd that's just go out and\nlook at the process.\n\n451\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:56.240\nI have a number of consulting\nclients where they really haven't\n\n452\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.410\nbeen to the manufacturing floor.\n\n453\n00:23:58.410 --> 00:23:59.230\nSo seriously-\n&gt;&gt; Well, sure.\n\n454\n00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.630\nI mean-\n&gt;&gt; They just haven't been there.\n\n455\n00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.140\n&gt;&gt; Corporate doesn't always have their\nhands in the day to day functions so\n\n456\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.000\nthat's why it really is important\nto speak to those people\n\n457\n00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.290\nwho are familiar with the process and\nwho are working it every day.\n\n458\n00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.300\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n459\n00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.610\nAnd the thing is that we want to remember\nis that if we're using observation for\n\n460\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.660\nthe tool.\n\n461\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.190\nBecause that's a great tool to get a good\nclear as-is picture of where we are today,\n\n462\n00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.190\nis that we just have to make sure\nthat we watch for any kind of bias.\n\n463\n00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.700\nAnd in order to do that,\nwe might take someone with us.\n\n464\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.335\nWe might make sure,\nwe might stay cognizant of the day.\n\n465\n00:24:29.335 --> 00:24:32.240\nLike, is it the day after a holiday\nthat we're watching a process?\n\n466\n00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.430\nThat type of thing.\n\n467\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.480\nSo, observation, absolutely a great tool.\n\n468\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.470\nWe just have to be a little\ncareful with that tool.\n\n469\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.430\nAnd sometimes, unlike a chart, or graph,\n\n470\n00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:46.500\nor a statistic, we might have to back up\nthat observation with more information.\n\n471\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.890\nAnd I really do love these methodologies\nbecause you see the flexibility, and\n\n472\n00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.550\neven just building upon our tools as\nwe go along we have some options.\n\n473\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.040\nWe can bring it in during this phase,\nor the analyze phase, or\n\n474\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.670\nwe can take tools that we've already\nworked on in the define phase.\n\n475\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.530\nSo, it's pretty cool in that way.\n\n476\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.720\nBut that does about wrap it up for\nour measure phase.\n\n477\n00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720\nBut don't go anywhere.\n\n478\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.560\nWe still have some more phases to cover.\n\n479\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.150\nI think we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n480\n00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.320\nSo I'm gonna sign out as your host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n481\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.120\nAnd this is Dr Tara Van Zanstern\nwith

00:00:08.232\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.167\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:17.390\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.950\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.580\nIn the past few episodes we've\nbeen looking at the DMAIC model.\n\n8\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.190\nWe're currently up to the analyze phase.\n\n9\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.542\nSo with us to explain the analyze\nphase in the studios today,\n\n10\n00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:31.470\nwe have Doctor Terra Vanzant Stern.\n\n11\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.060\nThank you for being here today Terra.\n\n12\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.120\n&gt;&gt; And thank you Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.150\n&gt;&gt; So we've already taken a look at\nthe define phase and the measure phase.\n\n14\n00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.940\nBut where do we begin\nin the analyze phase?\n\n15\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.500\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n16\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.730\nAnd so we're gonna be pulling together\nsome of the tools that we've used in\n\n17\n00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.560\nformer sessions and even some of the tools\nthat we used in define and measure.\n\n18\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.900\nBut now the focus is gonna\nbe totally different.\n\n19\n00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.400\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n20\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.109\n&gt;&gt; So I think I'll bring up my slide deck.\n\n21\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.130\nAnd in this session, obviously,\n\n22\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.520\nwe're gonna look at the role\nanalyze plays in the DMAIC model.\n\n23\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.810\nWe're going to look at the important\ntools that we have already covered,\n\n24\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.950\nthe seven tools of quality and the voices.\n\n25\n00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.570\nAnd then we're gonna look at some\nadditional tools to help us with our\n\n26\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.494\ncritical thinking.\n\n27\n00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:20.380\nThe Hats, Critical Thinking Wheel,\nCritical Thinking Levels,\n\n28\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.180\nCritical Thinking Chart so\nyou're kinda getting the idea there.\n\n29\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.070\nSix critical questions.\n\n30\n00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.410\n&gt;&gt; They want us to think.\n\n31\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.860\n&gt;&gt; That's true, and in this session\ncontinued in your student package is going\n\n32\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.020\nto be Issues Identification, Hypothesis\nTesting and Tips for Brainstorming.\n\n33\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.214\nThe Issues Identification and\n\n34\n00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:46.360\nHypothesis Testing which is normally\ncovered in analyze on the six sigma\n\n35\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.195\nside are some things that you might need\nif you're taking the six sigma only exam.\n\n36\n00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:56.446\nAnd then Tips for Brainstorming\nis a section that's covered sort\n\n37\n00:01:56.446 --> 00:02:00.498\nof on the lean side of you're\njust doing a lean only exam.\n\n38\n00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:04.170\nThese things aren't typically\ncovered in lean six sigma exams, but\n\n39\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.750\nthey're gonna be there a new student\npackage just in case you need them.\n\n40\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.990\nSo when we're in analyze,\n\n41\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.080\nanalytical thinking follows the scientific\napproach to problem solving.\n\n42\n00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.740\nWhat we wanna keep in mind is that\nnow we have two pieces of the puzzle.\n\n43\n00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.550\nDefine what it is we're working on and\n\n44\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.220\nnow we have measure which\ntells us what's happening now.\n\n45\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.440\nOur goal in analyze is to come up\nwith two to three solutions and then\n\n46\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.680\nwhen we get into improve we're gonna ask\nwhoever we're working for to choose one.\n\n47\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.650\nThis is gonna help us with our buy in.\n\n48\n00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.320\nBut once we have those\ntwo pieces of the puzzle,\n\n49\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.170\nwhat the problem really\nis that we wanna solve,\n\n50\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.270\nwhat is the activity that we wanna make\nbetter, faster, more cost effective?\n\n51\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.370\nAnd what's going on that's\nrelated to that environment?\n\n52\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.190\nWe can kind of just start doing\nsome regular problem solving.\n\n53\n00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.010\nThat's one of our options.\n\n54\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.630\nIn scientific problem solving, what\nhappens is, we start with the problem and\n\n55\n00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.330\nthen we look at the hypothesis.\n\n56\n00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.130\nCould it be this?\n\n57\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.210\nCould it be that?\n\n58\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.030\nNow if we have more than two conditions,\nwe have to look at a different tool,\n\n59\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.510\nlike design of experiment for example.\n\n60\n00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.420\nBut if we just have one tool,\ncould it be this?\n\n61\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.830\nCould it be that, right?\n\n62\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.640\nSo we can start running our\nsolutions through this model.\n\n63\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.720\nWe look at the facts.\n\n64\n00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.740\nWe analyze the facts which\nwe got from measure.\n\n65\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.020\nAnd then hopefully we\ncome up with a solution.\n\n66\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.819\nAnd we wanna do that a couple of times\nbecause at the end of our analyzed story\n\n67\n00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.884\nwe wanna have at least three solutions.\n\n68\n00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:39.250\nNow in analyze many of the tools that\nwe've already discussed come into play.\n\n69\n00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.430\nAnd that's another thing\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n70\n00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.670\nBut when I'm in analyze, I'm looking for\nbasically four conditions.\n\n71\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.090\nOkay so I'm trying to figure out\nfirst off what is the root cause?\n\n72\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.320\nSo I've got this information for measure\nand I'm asking, well why is it that way?\n\n73\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.630\nBecause I'm hoping if\nI can figure out why,\n\n74\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.010\nI can come to three to five solutions,\nright?\n\n75\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.550\nAnd I'm done.\n\n76\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.610\nI can start moving onto that\nnext phase of the model.\n\n77\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.640\nThe other thing I'm looking for\nis correlation.\n\n78\n00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.610\nAnd in a way, in lean six sigma,\nit's really more about triggers.\n\n79\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.470\nWhen this happens, does that also happen?\n\n80\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.100\nBecause if I'm thinking about when this\nhappens, this other thing happens and\n\n81\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.385\nI'm coming up with a solution, I want\nto make sure it meets both conditions.\n\n82\n00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:27.570\nIf I know pretty much that if we do this,\nthis is gonna happen.\n\n83\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.762\nNow remember when we do\ncorrelation analysis,\n\n84\n00:04:29.762 --> 00:04:33.284\nsometimes there is no correlation but\nthere could be correlation, right?\n\n85\n00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:37.850\n&gt;&gt; And then sometimes we are looking for\nthat non-existent relationship.\n\n86\n00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly.\n\n87\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.240\nAnother thing I'm looking for is impact.\n\n88\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.822\nAnd I wanna talk about variation first\njust to remind everyone that one of\n\n89\n00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:51.277\nthe big themes in six sigma\nis it if I reduce variation,\n\n90\n00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:54.225\nI may have an automatic\nprocess improvement.\n\n91\n00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:58.478\nAnother way of saying that is if I\nstandardize things it is possible however\n\n92\n00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:02.810\nthat I could standardize things and\njust have a really bad process, right?\n\n93\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.180\nThat is possible.\n\n94\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.590\nSo impact looks at things such\nas the impact of that variation.\n\n95\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.420\nSo in six sigma we're pretty\nmuch gonna smite all variation.\n\n96\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.930\nIn lean six sigma we're saying\nwell let's look at what\n\n97\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.780\nthe impact of that variation is.\n\n98\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.816\nThere is a possibility for the small\nproject that I'm working on that maybe\n\n99\n00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:25.548\nthat variation is just something I\njust want to leave alone, right?\n\n100\n00:05:25.548 --> 00:05:30.232\nBut impact is also looking at\nhow does the current condition,\n\n101\n00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:34.930\nwhich I got from measure,\nhow does that impact our finances?\n\n102\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.511\nHow does that impact the people?\n\n103\n00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:40.178\nHow does that impact the processes, right?\n\n104\n00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:44.944\nSo I get to analyze I have all this\ninformation from measure about\n\n105\n00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:47.592\nwhere we are now and I'm looking for\n\n106\n00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:52.830\nfour conditions: Root Cause,\nTriggers, Impact, Variation.\n\n107\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.348\nNow I could be looking for other things as\nwell but these are kind of the major ones.\n\n108\n00:05:57.348 --> 00:06:02.520\nIn define and measure, I may have\ndiscovered that you don't want to do\n\n109\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.770\nanything that's going to\ncause as to higher people or\n\n110\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.170\nyou don't want us to do anything that's\ngonna be environmentally unfriendly.\n\n111\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.800\nSo that might be part of\nthe test that I look at.\n\n112\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.870\nSome of the things I run by that\nI learned in define and measure.\n\n113\n00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.990\nBut if I stick to these four conditions,\n\n114\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.740\nI'm usually gonna be able to come\nup with three to five solutions.\n\n115\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.520\nAnd remember,\n\n116\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.840\nsometimes if you just come up with\ntwo solutions, that third solution,\n\n117\n00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.010\nif it's not mutually exclusive, it means\nlike if you do one you can't do two.\n\n118\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.850\nIf it's night, it can't be day,\nthat kinda thing.\n\n119\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.640\nSo sometimes your third solution could\njust be a combination and as Cherokee's\n\n120\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.590\npointed out a number of times,\nit could also be don't do anything, right?\n\n121\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.250\nSo, it's not as hard as it sounds\nto come up with three solutions.\n\n122\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.640\nSo, when we're talking about getting to\nthe root cause of the problem, sometimes,\n\n123\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.480\nthat's referred to as root cause analysis.\n\n124\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.960\nThat's just a fancy way of saying\nwhat's really going on, right?\n\n125\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.130\nBut on your exams, there has a tendency\nto call it root cause analysis.\n\n126\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.899\nAnd we've already learned the root cause\nanalysis tool which is the Fishbone chart.\n\n127\n00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.570\nWhen you're trying to\nfigure out the root cause,\n\n128\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.300\nkind of think of these as the specifics.\n\n129\n00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.700\nThe underlying cause.\n\n130\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.460\nThose who could reasonably identify it.\n\n131\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.975\nAnd does the management\nhave control to fix it, or\n\n132\n00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:35.495\ndo I have control to fix it, right?\n\n133\n00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:38.696\nSo when I'm really\nthinking about root cause,\n\n134\n00:07:38.696 --> 00:07:41.579\nin addition to what's really happening,\n\n135\n00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:46.237\nthese are some things that might be\nable to help my thinking go along.\n\n136\n00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:47.317\nDoes that make sense, Cherokee?\n\n137\n00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:48.040\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n138\n00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.741\nI'm just thinking here from an IT\nperspective In this situation,\n\n139\n00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.112\nyou do wanna find the root cause,\nin not every environment,\n\n140\n00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:56.850\nyou wanna find the root cause.\n\n141\n00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.290\nIf it's more beneficial to my company\nto say let's just replace this PC and\n\n142\n00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.660\npush that aside for now, we don't know\nwhat's causing that PC to malfunction.\n\n143\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.160\nBut you know what, let's just be\nmore productive and keep going.\n\n144\n00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.450\nAnd so something you,\n\n145\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.180\nI believe you had told the story of\nthe pigeon poo, does that sound familiar?\n\n146\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.193\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry.\n&gt;&gt; No?\n\n147\n00:08:16.193 --> 00:08:17.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I heard this really great story about-\n\n148\n00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:19.386\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I would love to hear that.\n\n149\n00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:19.899\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n150\n00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:24.400\nit really just kind of makes sense when\nyou're trying to determine the root cause.\n\n151\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.868\nBecause there was an,\nI don't know all the details, but\n\n152\n00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:31.780\nso there is like this museum overseas,\nI think it was in London.\n\n153\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.650\nAnd all these other buildings nearby\nwere fine with their exterior paint,\n\n154\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.870\nbut this museum's exterior paint\nkept cracking and falling off.\n\n155\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.110\nAnd they had hired some\npeople to try to figure out\n\n156\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.610\nwhy the paint kept cracking off because\nthey were losing a lot of money.\n\n157\n00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.310\nSo these people were asking individuals,\n\n158\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.330\nnothing in their tests were conclusive\nto say this is why the paint is peeling.\n\n159\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.714\nSo kind of dismal and dismayed, one of\nthose researchers was sitting there in\n\n160\n00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:07.099\nthe courtyard, and he kind of just\nnonchalantly said to the groundskeeper,\n\n161\n00:09:07.099 --> 00:09:09.943\ndo you have any clue why\nthis paint is peeling off?\n\n162\n00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:13.055\nMaybe it was a conversation they were\nhaving, and he said I don't know,\n\n163\n00:09:13.055 --> 00:09:14.900\nit's probably because of the pigeon poo.\n\n164\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he's like what pigeon poo?\n\n165\n00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:21.405\nAnd he's like well,\nwe have to use a really abrasive,\n\n166\n00:09:21.405 --> 00:09:25.749\nharsh chemical to clean it, and\nhe said well, why do you have the poo?\n\n167\n00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:27.722\nAnd he said, well I don't know,\n\n168\n00:09:27.722 --> 00:09:32.019\nI'm assuming it's because there's\na source of shelter in the eaves and\n\n169\n00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:36.760\nthere's a source of food,\nlike the spiders, they eat the spiders.\n\n170\n00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.408\nAnd so by implementing a form\nof some kind of bug spray,\n\n171\n00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:44.653\nthey were able to save all this money.\n\n172\n00:09:44.653 --> 00:09:48.440\nBut that was the root cause, and\nit just kinda puts it in perspective.\n\n173\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.450\nYou need to talk to the people\nwho really are dealing with this\n\n174\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.440\non a day-to-day basis.\n\n175\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.142\nThey can offer insight that all of your\nexperience might not bring to the table.\n\n176\n00:09:56.142 --> 00:09:59.072\n&gt;&gt; And that's such a great\nsegue way because one of\n\n177\n00:09:59.072 --> 00:10:03.614\nthe tools that we've already talked\nabout is the voices, and of course,\n\n178\n00:10:03.614 --> 00:10:06.740\nvoices of the employee\nis a really big one.\n\n179\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.650\nSo we said that the primary voices\nwere voice of the customer, employee,\n\n180\n00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.420\nwhich we were talking about,\nprocess, and the business.\n\n181\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.719\nNow, in Define,\n\n182\n00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:22.019\nwe were looking at how does what we're\ntrying to do impact those voices?\n\n183\n00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:26.015\nAnd in Measure, we were saying\nthings like, where are they now,\n\n184\n00:10:26.015 --> 00:10:28.170\nwhat are those voices saying now?\n\n185\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.410\nKeeping in mind, that's not gonna be\nrelevant to every project, but if we're\n\n186\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.370\nright now, say that in Measure, we're\nlooking at what are you saying right now.\n\n187\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.042\nWell in Analyze, we're saying what\nadditional information can you be giving\n\n188\n00:10:41.042 --> 00:10:43.248\nus, what additional information?\n\n189\n00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:46.822\nNow that I know the true as-is\npicture that I got from Measure,\n\n190\n00:10:46.822 --> 00:10:50.330\nwhat can the employee tell me,\nwhat can the customer tell me,\n\n191\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.160\nwhat can the process tell me,\nwhat can the business tell me?\n\n192\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.960\nSo even though we've learned those tools,\nand\n\n193\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.960\nthey're simple tools, when we get into\nAnalyze, it's kind of a different ballgame\n\n194\n00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.670\ncuz now we're using those\ntools to do something else.\n\n195\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.580\nAnd a couple of other tools that\nwe've already learned that are very,\n\n196\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:13.390\nvery valuable is that 3 Ps and\nalso the 6 Ms and the 7 tools of quality.\n\n197\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.380\nThese are things that we've used in\nother areas of the model already, but\n\n198\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.860\nnow we're trying to figure out why.\n\n199\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.662\nSo the big question is why when\nwe're looking for root cause, right?\n\n200\n00:11:22.662 --> 00:11:27.637\nBut we're also, remember, we're looking\nfor root cause, that's the big one because\n\n201\n00:11:27.637 --> 00:11:31.479\na lot of times once we find the root\ncause, again in real life like in,\n\n202\n00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:34.497\nto get certified you have to\ndo a report for our class.\n\n203\n00:11:34.497 --> 00:11:38.355\nBut in real life when you're using the\nDMAIC model, you might get to root cause,\n\n204\n00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:42.010\nand again, you get to stop working in\nthe model, right, this is very lean.\n\n205\n00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.750\nA reminder of the tools that we used,\nand in fact, in a lot of courses,\n\n206\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.770\nthese aren't even\nintroduced until Analyze.\n\n207\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.900\nOur process maps, which includes flow\nchart, graphs, those type of things,\n\n208\n00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.420\ncause and effect, which we called\nfish bone in the other session,\n\n209\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.820\nPareto and histogram charts, check sheets,\nscatter diagrams, and control charts.\n\n210\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.870\nNow in Measure, we're using those\nto collect information, and\n\n211\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.650\nwe're trying not to be biased, right, so\n\n212\n00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.760\nwe're just collecting information\nto get our clear picture.\n\n213\n00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.773\nIn Analyze,\nwe're looking at this information, and\n\n214\n00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.140\nwe're trying to figure things out.\n\n215\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:22.822\nNow, many times when you get to Analyze,\nyou don't have a pretty chart.\n\n216\n00:12:22.822 --> 00:12:27.177\nIf Measure did a histogram as\na way of collecting information,\n\n217\n00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:31.134\nI'm in Analyze,\nthat's just a step I don't have to do.\n\n218\n00:12:31.134 --> 00:12:35.690\nI can look at the histogram and\nstart trying to analyze.\n\n219\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.785\nOur example was when we\nwere here at ITProTV,\n\n220\n00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:42.214\npeople getting calls into the help desk,\nright?\n\n221\n00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:43.901\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That was the example that we used.\n\n222\n00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:48.793\nSo I can look at that, and I can say what\ncan be done about that large bar being on\n\n223\n00:12:48.793 --> 00:12:52.355\nThursdays where they're\ngetting the most cost calls.\n\n224\n00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:56.816\nI can go straight to Analyze, but a lot of\ntimes, part of the challenges is that I\n\n225\n00:12:56.816 --> 00:13:01.120\nhave to figure out which charter\ngraph reflects this information.\n\n226\n00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.412\nSo what I want you to kind of think of\nis that if you get a spreadsheet from\n\n227\n00:13:05.412 --> 00:13:10.500\nMeasure, and let's say it was collecting\nthose 30 test grades, I probably could\n\n228\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.230\nlook at those 30 test grades and tell\nyou which is highest, which is lowest.\n\n229\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.540\nI could probably even guess on the mean,\nmode, or median.\n\n230\n00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.550\nSo in that case, I probably don't need\nto even put it in a chart or graph.\n\n231\n00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.140\nBut what if I were looking\nat 30 test grades, and\n\n232\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.340\nI gave a test every Friday for\nthree or four months?\n\n233\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.340\nWell now, having to chart a graph\nto collect that information\n\n234\n00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.140\nis just gonna let me analyze it better.\n\n235\n00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.700\nSo one of the things that I want you to\ntake away from Analyze is all those key\n\n236\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.270\ntools, the seven tools of quality,\nthe seven tools of critical thinking,\n\n237\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.350\nthe seven tools of data analysis,\n\n238\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.360\nthat those tools are only\nmeant to help you analyze.\n\n239\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.870\nSo you don't wanna do\nunnecessary graphs and\n\n240\n00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.870\ncharts because that's just not lean,\nright?\n\n241\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.420\nSo one of my first challenges might be\nI have all this data for Measure, but\n\n242\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:06.010\nI can't process it, so one way I might\nprocess it is using these seven key tools.\n\n243\n00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.030\nAnother way I might process it, is some of\nthose additional tools we've talked about,\n\n244\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:15.380\nGantt charts, PERT charts,\nthose type of things.\n\n245\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.240\nI just want to get my arms around\nthe data so that I can think about it.\n\n246\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.335\nSo in addition to the seven tools and\nthose other charts and\n\n247\n00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:27.733\ngraphs that we talked about there's some\ncritical-thinking tools that have been\n\n248\n00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.199\nadopted by Lean Six Sigma.\n\n249\n00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:31.995\nOne is just the different hats theory, and\n\n250\n00:14:31.995 --> 00:14:37.199\nthere's a lot of different depictions\nof that, the Critical Thinking Wheel,\n\n251\n00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:42.710\nThinking Levels, CT Critical-Thinking\nChart, and 6 Critical Questions.\n\n252\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.380\nSo I get to Analyze, I have a clear\nas-is picture where I'm at today.\n\n253\n00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.590\nOne of my first challenges might be to\ndigest the data, so I might reach for\n\n254\n00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.180\na chart or graph to do that.\n\n255\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.030\nNow in real life, if I reach for\na chart or graph to do that,\n\n256\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.640\nI might solve the problem there, and\nI don't have to keep going past Go and\n\n257\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.179\nfinishing the model, right?\n\n258\n00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:05.660\nBut I mean, it might be so\nobvious, that's the point.\n\n259\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.980\nBut my goal is to get to the end\nof my analyzed story and\n\n260\n00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.290\nhave at least three solutions so\nthat when I get to Improve,\n\n261\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:16.210\nI can give those three solutions to my\nboss so that they know that I really\n\n262\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.338\nthought this out, that I have a solution\nand certainly some other options, right?\n\n263\n00:15:20.338 --> 00:15:23.650\nSo we're gonna look at those\nother tools very quickly.\n\n264\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.660\nSo if I wanted to identify solutions\nusing the Normal Thought Process, and\n\n265\n00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.976\nthis is again different than\ntypical problem-solving,\n\n266\n00:15:32.976 --> 00:15:34.260\nunstructured problem-solving.\n\n267\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.054\nSo it's kind of nice to know there's\njust other problem-solving models.\n\n268\n00:15:38.054 --> 00:15:43.945\nI would get my list together, I would\nsay what's the worst possible outcome,\n\n269\n00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:48.780\nhow does it impact on others,\nwhat's the insight from others?\n\n270\n00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:54.430\nAnd I would be looking at those particular\nfactors to kind of come to a conclusion.\n\n271\n00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.320\nI think my point is that\nwhen I'm in analyze,\n\n272\n00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.370\nI can reach for all the other\nanalytical tools I've ever had.\n\n273\n00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.790\nThere's some popular ones but don't\nforget the ones that we use all the time.\n\n274\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.270\nAnd what's a could alternative but\nmaybe not feasible.\n\n275\n00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.330\nAnd why do I wanna think\nfrom that kind of,\n\n276\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:18.250\nwhy do I wanna think like this would work\nbut it's just not feasible at this time?\n\n277\n00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.000\nBecause it's gonna open up other doors,\nright.\n\n278\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Now do you think to\npresent that topic or\n\n279\n00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.320\nis it's just something you want\nyourself to be thinking about,\n\n280\n00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.910\nbecause if I representing it-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n281\n00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.930\nI definitely wouldn't\npresent it at that point.\n\n282\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That would be\n\n283\n00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.910\nkind of a thinking process to go through,\n\n284\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.310\nso what we're looking at now is normal\nthought processes, so I want to clarify.\n\n285\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.740\nThey aren't sequential.\n\n286\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.970\nIt's just these are some things that\nwhen we're looking at this data for\n\n287\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.990\nmeasure, we can approach it from\nthese kinds of questions like,\n\n288\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.380\nwhat do I wish would happen?\n\n289\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.124\nWhat do I think are the possible outcomes?\n\n290\n00:16:48.124 --> 00:16:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\nAnd\n\n291\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:53.210\nthis one that we were just talking about,\nwhat are some good alternatives but\n\n292\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.310\nthey're impossible because sometimes,\n\n293\n00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.330\nwhen we write them down we find\nout they aren't so impossible.\n\n294\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.040\nSo that would be kind of\nthe theory behind that.\n\n295\n00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wanna say this quote but\nI don't wanna mess it up,\n\n296\n00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.880\nyou might even know this.\n\n297\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.190\nSomething about Einstein, he said that it\nwasn't as important to be intelligent but\n\n298\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.690\nit's more important,\nthe way he wrote it was different.\n\n299\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.340\nBut it's more important to be creative,\n\n300\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.770\nbecause children, they're not jaded\nby hearing no all the time or\n\n301\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.370\nat least when you're younger, as an adult\nyou kinda get jaded along the way.\n\n302\n00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:25.780\nSo when you say things that sound a little\nsilly well it just might actually work.\n\n303\n00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and\nsometimes I mean I think a real red\n\n304\n00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.260\nflag when someone presents a problem to\nyou and you go I know how to fix that.\n\n305\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.036\nI think you always have to\ntake a step back and say do I?\n\n306\n00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:40.939\nHave I used my creative skills,\n\n307\n00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:44.330\nbecause maybe that's just\nthe way I've always done it.\n\n308\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.290\nSo, I think that's another time when\nyou might wanna use the DMAIC model,\n\n309\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.080\nis when you're just so sure, you're so\nsure you know the answer, right?\n\n310\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.330\nAnd you're not being\ncreative at that point.\n\n311\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.680\nOkay, so we want to cycle back,\nwe have the current state,\n\n312\n00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.020\nwhy does it look this way, right.\n\n313\n00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.740\nSo the seven tools of quality, all these\nquestions that we just looked at in\n\n314\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:11.580\nthe normal thinking process, the voices,\nCTQs, all that kind of step,\n\n315\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.400\nwe wanna keep cycling back to root cause,\nwhat are the triggers?\n\n316\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.344\nCorrelation, variation everything\nthat we are talking about and\n\n317\n00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:21.450\nanalyzed, we're trying to look\nat it through those lenses in\n\n318\n00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.050\norder to come up with\nthree to five solutions.\n\n319\n00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.490\nNow remember again everything varies,\nand I shouldn't say everything,\n\n320\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.600\nbut many things vary right.\n\n321\n00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.330\nSo we might wanna be looking at that.\n\n322\n00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.910\nWhen we're in measure we\ndid a variation study\n\n323\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.520\nwe can just look at the study, right.\n\n324\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.560\nHowever, if we're in analyze,\nwe're gonna do a variation analysis.\n\n325\n00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.460\nSo if a study wasn't done,\n\n326\n00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.330\nwe're gonna take the information we got\nfrom measure and create our own study.\n\n327\n00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.200\nAnd then we'll look at the analysis of it.\n\n328\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.030\nBut sometimes I'll actually end up\nin analyze with enough information\n\n329\n00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.320\nto do a variation analysis.\n\n330\n00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.660\n&gt;&gt; So measure, I might be saying,\nI see it this variance exist and\n\n331\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.150\nthen the analyze phase I\nwanna know why does it exist.\n\n332\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:11.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and then when I'm looking\nat that go back to those four things,\n\n333\n00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.790\nis there root a cause or\nis it there trick or\n\n334\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.400\nis there an impact is the variation\nreally real variation.\n\n335\n00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.650\nRight?\n\n336\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.620\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n337\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay so one thinking model and this is\njust a way to look at problems through\n\n338\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.560\nother lenses is something\ncalled the hat model.\n\n339\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.030\nNow on the next page it\nkind of summarizes it but\n\n340\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.330\nI just want to tell you the basic thought\nof this is I want to look at the problem\n\n341\n00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.060\nthrough different voices again, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.900\nAnd instead of saying voices,\nwe're gonna look at different hats.\n\n343\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.230\nAnd so this next one that you're seeing,\nit's called the Six Thinking Hats.\n\n344\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.190\nThere is a product out there,\nthe Six Thinking Hats, that has become,\n\n345\n00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.910\nover the years, a public domain theme.\n\n346\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.930\nBut you can also go through, like if you\nthink this is really a fun thing to do,\n\n347\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.180\nI would encourage you If you were thinking\nabout maybe doing an employee session,\n\n348\n00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.120\nI would encourage you to go out there and\nlook at people who facilitate this,\n\n349\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.830\nbecause sometimes it's\nnot as easy as it sounds.\n\n350\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.460\nSo, the deal is,\nis if you're looking at the blue hat,\n\n351\n00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.410\nyou're looking at the problem thinking,\nand you can do this yourself, or\n\n352\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.550\nactually have real people in the room.\n\n353\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.830\nI've been in some exercises where\npeople physically wear the hats.\n\n354\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.340\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, you could probably\nfind these at the dollar store just to\n\n355\n00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.170\nkind of add to that extra fun to it.\n\n356\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI mean it's just kind of a cool thing.\n\n357\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.940\nSo, in the Six Thinking Hats, keep in\nmind because a lot of people are using\n\n358\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.280\nthis now, so there's some variations.\n\n359\n00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.700\nBut in the one that is most popular in\nthe Lean Six Sigma facilitated groups\n\n360\n00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.410\nis the blue hat's gonna be process.\n\n361\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:45.110\nSo, you're looking at this problem.\n\n362\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.360\nAnd remember,\nyou got the problem from measure.\n\n363\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.250\nYou're looking at that current\nstate through the process lens.\n\n364\n00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.790\nIf you're wearing the white hat,\nyou're looking at facts.\n\n365\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.420\nIf you're wearing the red, feelings.\n\n366\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.570\nIf you're looking at green, creativity.\n\n367\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.470\nIf you're looking through yellow,\nyou're looking at benefits.\n\n368\n00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.820\nIf you look at black, it's the cautions.\n\n369\n00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.960\nWhat are the risk?\n\n370\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.150\nAnd really I have to tell you,\n\n371\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:11.060\nthis is kinda fun way just to see\nhow many people you're impacting.\n\n372\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.770\nWhat's going on in your department and\nstuff.\n\n373\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.510\nIt's a really fun way\nto look at a problem.\n\n374\n00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.580\nSo I would challenge you.\n\n375\n00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.570\nThis particular schematic is in your\nstudent packet and it's summarized.\n\n376\n00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.230\nLike I said you can go back and\nand read much more detail but\n\n377\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.540\nthere's summaries in your student package\nand I would just challenge you the next\n\n378\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.350\ntime you even have a personal issue going\non, think through these different hats.\n\n379\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.880\nIt's just kind of a fun way to do it.\n\n380\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.540\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah it is really cool.\n\n381\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.360\nOkay and here is something called\nthe critical thinking wheel and\n\n382\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.810\nit's really a very simple concept,\nagain like a fish bone's a simple concept.\n\n383\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.610\nIt's underused sometimes.\n\n384\n00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:56.550\nIt looks an awful lot like a relationship\ndiagram and if you remember a relationship\n\n385\n00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:02.630\ndiagram already has the factors out there\nand we're trying to see how they relate.\n\n386\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.110\nSo relationship diagram may even\ntake this type of a graphic.\n\n387\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.450\nSo here is the problem how does\nit relate to this problem,\n\n388\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.280\nhow does it relate to that problem?\n\n389\n00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.380\nWhat I'm looking for\n\n390\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:18.260\nin a relationship diagram is more how\nthese conditions relate to one another\n\n391\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.350\nbecause if I come up with a solution\nit might Impact one of these areas.\n\n392\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:27.060\nI might come up with something that could,\non the positive side, impact them, right?\n\n393\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.250\nSo when I'm looking at the critical\nthinking wheel, I'm starting,\n\n394\n00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.330\nit's a brainstorming type thing.\n\n395\n00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.130\nBut at the center of the wheel,\nI think, what is it I'm thinking about?\n\n396\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.690\nAnd then I just very quickly,\n\n397\n00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.080\nwithout really a lot of thought,\nwhat plays into that?\n\n398\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.950\nWhat plays into that?\n\n399\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.130\nWhat plays into that?\n\n400\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.200\nSo I get a condition for measure.\n\n401\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.720\nI can't really figure out the root\ncause right off the bat and\n\n402\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.150\nmaybe I did a fish bone diagram.\n\n403\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.220\nIt's just another way\nof looking at it right.\n\n404\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.790\nSometimes when I do the critical thinking\nwheel I might identify those triggers or\n\n405\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.110\nimpact that type of stuff.\n\n406\n00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.980\nSo it's just another way of like the fish\nbone doesn't feel real comfortable or\n\n407\n00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.468\nyou just wanna jazz it up a bit.\n\n408\n00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:07.800\nVery simple concept.\n\n409\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.970\nThen there's levels of critical thinking.\n\n410\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.560\nAnd one level, one kind of\ncritical thinking around education\n\n411\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.920\nwould be Bloom's taxonomy where it says\nthese are different steps in education.\n\n412\n00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.810\nSo kinda think if you're\nfamiliar with that schematic\n\n413\n00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.830\nthat this is sort of similar to that.\n\n414\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.600\nSo level 1 is knowledge,\nlevel 2 is comprehension,\n\n415\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.899\nlevel 3 is application, and\nlevel 4 is analysis, right?\n\n416\n00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:38.456\nThere is some other models that pop up\n\n417\n00:23:38.456 --> 00:23:43.061\nin the lean side if you're\ndoing the lean test.\n\n418\n00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:44.980\nSuch as the Kirkpatrick model.\n\n419\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.133\nAnd so in your student package\nyou'll see something, and\n\n420\n00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:53.965\nwe usually just include it in\nthe analyze phase because it relates so\n\n421\n00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:57.540\nmuch to these other levels\nof critical thinking.\n\n422\n00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.980\nSo the Kirkpatrick model is\na model that shows you teaching.\n\n423\n00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.160\nYou can learn it, but not apply it.\n\n424\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.810\nYou can apply it, but there's no impact.\n\n425\n00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:13.360\nSo just kind of keep in mind that there's\nsome other critical thinking level models.\n\n426\n00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This is the one that we use in\n\n427\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.770\nLean Six Sigma and typically, actually\nI don't think Six Sigma uses this,\n\n428\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.050\nbut Lean Six Sigma kind of thinks\nalong these critical thinking levels.\n\n429\n00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:24.550\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n430\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.360\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen there's the Critical Thinking Chart.\n\n431\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.490\nAnd once again this is\nin your student packet,\n\n432\n00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:35.040\nno one expects you to remember,\nto memorize this.\n\n433\n00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.280\nThis is a collateral that you\ncould just pull out, right?\n\n434\n00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.950\nWhat you're trying to do is you're trying\nto come up with three to five solutions.\n\n435\n00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.590\nSo those tools, when you make it graphic\nmight help you, the voices might help you,\n\n436\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.000\nCDQs might help you.\n\n437\n00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:53.850\nYou wanna run everything through\ntriggers and root cause and impact and\n\n438\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:58.303\nvariation but another thing that might\nhelp you think about your problem\n\n439\n00:24:58.303 --> 00:25:00.932\nis to look at the critical thinking chart.\n\n440\n00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:04.956\nAnd you'll see on the chart that there's\nclarity, accuracy, precision, and\n\n441\n00:25:04.956 --> 00:25:08.404\nI'm not gonna read the whole chart\nto you but it's just another way-\n\n442\n00:25:08.404 --> 00:25:09.640\n&gt;&gt; These are good to help you.\n\n443\n00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n444\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.950\nAnd you go back and you think hopefully\nwhen you get this information from\n\n445\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:20.690\nmeasure, you might even be able to say\nsomething to yourself like, you know what,\n\n446\n00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.500\nI just don't get the relevance of this.\n\n447\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.980\nI collected the information, but\nI don't know how is it relevant.\n\n448\n00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.900\nAnd then the questions I would\nask is how does that relate to\n\n449\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.630\nthe problem specifically?\n\n450\n00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.780\nHow does that bear on the question?\n\n451\n00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.740\nHow does that help with the issue?\n\n452\n00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.930\nAnd it's just a way to kind of think.\n\n453\n00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:39.620\nSo when I get the stuff for measure,\nI might look and I might say,\n\n454\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.950\nwhat is the significance or what is\nthe clarity, or how accurate is it?\n\n455\n00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.770\nSo this just gives you some\nquestions that you can ask yourself.\n\n456\n00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.620\nAnd I would use this chart if\nyou're just totally stumped.\n\n457\n00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.570\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n458\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.950\nYou're just pushing yourself\nin the right direction.\n\n459\n00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.580\nThat's what most of these tools are doing.\n\n460\n00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.830\nThey're providing that venue for you to\nsay, all right, just follow this path.\n\n461\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.100\nAnd we don't have a book\non how to work out life,\n\n462\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.750\nbut these tools are pretty close.\n\n463\n00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, I agree.\n\n464\n00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.170\nSo now here's the six questions and this\nI think is always kind of funny because,\n\n465\n00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.310\nyou know when we were in the fifth\ngrade they used it in English class and\n\n466\n00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.580\nthey would tell us, or\nmost of us when we're in fifth grade\n\n467\n00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.940\nis that if you're writing a story,\nyou need to know who, what, when, where.\n\n468\n00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n469\n00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.310\n&gt;&gt; But\nthese six critical thinking questions\n\n470\n00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.960\nare also good when you're\ntrying to solve a problem.\n\n471\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.080\nSo again, keep in mind,\nI've got the information for measure.\n\n472\n00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.470\nI know what's happening now and\n\n473\n00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.430\nthat's crucial,\nbecause you couldn't go to analyze and\n\n474\n00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.300\nstart analyzing the situation if you\ndidn't know what was going on, right?\n\n475\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.260\nSo these six questions, I'm just\napproaching it from that angle, okay,\n\n476\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.030\nthis is happening, well, who is involved?\n\n477\n00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.200\nWhat is the cause?\n\n478\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.110\nWhen did it happen?\n\n479\n00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:55.540\nWhere is it happening?\n\n480\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.530\nWhy is it happening?\n\n481\n00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.390\nHow is it happening?\n\n482\n00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:02.380\nAnd sometimes if I just go through\nthat schematic, what happens is\n\n483\n00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.690\nI come up with a brilliant idea that\nplays into my three to five solutions.\n\n484\n00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.890\nNow there's a number of tests that I\nstill want to run my solutions through,\n\n485\n00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.320\nand this is just another schematic.\n\n486\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.230\nThis is the one that would\nappear in your student package,\n\n487\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.800\njust to kinda help you think\nof questions and stuff.\n\n488\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.077\nSo, this is an example of something\nthat's in your package to study, or\n\n489\n00:27:23.077 --> 00:27:25.566\nto draw from if you're\nactually doing a real project.\n\n490\n00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.635\nI lost my train of thought there,\nCherokee.\n\n491\n00:27:29.635 --> 00:27:30.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n492\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.190\nI was distracted.\n\n493\n00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.360\nIt says, who is causing the problem for\n\n494\n00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.720\nthat question there\nunder the Who category.\n\n495\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.668\nAnd I was just hoping that\nit wasn't me [LAUGH].\n\n496\n00:27:37.668 --> 00:27:39.695\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n497\n00:27:39.695 --> 00:27:43.190\n[LAUGH] Okay, so well, back to the ranch.\n\n498\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:48.510\nThe idea is that I'm trying to come\nup with three to five solutions.\n\n499\n00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.730\nThis is the way to do it.\n\n500\n00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:55.070\nNow sometimes I'm gonna have learn\nthings from measure, define and\n\n501\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.310\nmeasure that I'm gonna add into the mix.\n\n502\n00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.920\nLike we said earlier,\nif they said we can't hire people, well,\n\n503\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.030\nI'm not gonna put that\nsolution on my list.\n\n504\n00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.800\nThey say,\nwe don't have time to do training.\n\n505\n00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.720\nWell, I'm not gonna put that\nsolution on my list, right?\n\n506\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.260\nThey might say something that\nwe're only going to do things that\n\n507\n00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.470\nare environmentally friendly.\n\n508\n00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.340\nAll those kinds of things,\nI learned in define and measure.\n\n509\n00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.580\nSo when I am running through all\nthese critical thinking models,\n\n510\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.240\nI also have information so\nthat what I put on that list,\n\n511\n00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.110\neverything is going to be pretty good.\n\n512\n00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:29.810\nNow, I am going to be responsible in the\nfinal phase of the model to sustain it.\n\n513\n00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:33.947\nSo if I start thinking about\nsustainability now when I'm in analyze,\n\n514\n00:28:33.947 --> 00:28:37.160\nthat's a good place to start thinking.\n\n515\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.250\nIt's a great idea, but\nwill I be able to keep it going?\n\n516\n00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.810\nSo, that might be another test\nthat I'm running it through.\n\n517\n00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:43.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n518\n00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.695\n&gt;&gt; Now, when we typically make a decision\nthese are the things that happen,\n\n519\n00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:53.769\nself-doubt, sometimes\nwe're over confident,\n\n520\n00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.930\nSometimes we procrastinate, and\nsometimes we have false starts, right?\n\n521\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.880\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; So we just need to kinda keep that\n\n522\n00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.420\nin mind.\n\n523\n00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.990\nYou might have a good decision and\nthen you might just kinda panic, or\n\n524\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.160\nyou might be over confident.\n\n525\n00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.440\nSo these are things that you just\nwant to think about and analyze.\n\n526\n00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.682\nAnd then you wanna think of when you're\nlooking at problem solving models.\n\n527\n00:29:17.044 --> 00:29:20.800\nOne that's really kind of a fun\none to look at is P O A C T.\n\n528\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800\nAnd I just pulled everything up at once.\n\n529\n00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.980\nBut the problem, the objectives,\nthe alternatives,\n\n530\n00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.490\nthe consequences, the tradeoffs.\n\n531\n00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.440\nAgain, just other model,\nand you would progressively\n\n532\n00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:35.120\nuse these models until you hit something\nand go this works for that problem right.\n\n533\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.340\nAnd a lot of times,\nI can't stress that enough.\n\n534\n00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.340\nA lot of times just those charts and\ngraphs are gonna do it.\n\n535\n00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.360\nJust looking at a chart or graph,\n\n536\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.380\nonce you've got all this information from\nmeasure, that might be all you need.\n\n537\n00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.690\nBut, if it doesn't work,\nthen you've got the thinking hats and\n\n538\n00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.590\nthe skills and all these other schematics\nthat you can run your problems through.\n\n539\n00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.230\nSo Cherokee, I think I'd like\nto end with this for analyze.\n\n540\n00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.260\nWhat's the best solution?\n\n541\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.530\nAnd again, I'm not really sure who\nsaid this, but I read it all the time.\n\n542\n00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:08.340\nA good solution to a well-posed problem,\nis almost always a smarter\n\n543\n00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:13.970\nchoice than an excellent solution\nto a poorly posed problem.\n\n544\n00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.600\n&gt;&gt; I like it, I really do.\n\n545\n00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.380\nSo, we were able to go through our define,\nour measure, and now we're analyzing.\n\n546\n00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.610\nAnd if we haven't already found\nthe problem at this point, well,\n\n547\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.030\nwe might want to continue into our next\nphase which would be the improve phase.\n\n548\n00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.290\nSo, we have a lot more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n549\n00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.370\nDon't go anywhere, get comfortable.\n\n550\n00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.940\nI think that's about it for this episode,\nso we'll go ahead and wrap up.\n\n551\n00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.620\nAnd I'll sign off as your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n552\n00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.600\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n553\n00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.022\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:12.487\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:16.316\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma: Green\nBelt Certification Preparation series.\n\n5\n00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:20.230\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.030\nIf you've been following along,\nwe've already traveled through the define,\n\n7\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.630\nthe measure,\nthe analyze phases of the DMAIC model.\n\n8\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.930\nAnd now we've landed on improve.\n\n9\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.590\nWith us today, we have Dr.\nTara van Zagstern In studios.\n\n10\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.190\nThank you for joining us today, Doctor.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.940\n&gt;&gt; So, we started talking\nabout all these different\n\n13\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.470\nphases that we have available to us.\n\n14\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.210\nBut, now we've gone through all the work,\nwe've come up with some pretty good ideas,\n\n15\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.990\nand now how are we going\nto implement them?\n\n16\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.350\n&gt;&gt; Well, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna start in the improve phase, right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.855\nAnd, if we could go to my slide deck.\n\n18\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.380\nImprove is a little bit different.\n\n19\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.880\nAnd when I say that it's because define,\nmeasure,\n\n20\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.650\nand analyze are pretty creative, Cherokee.\n\n21\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.920\nI mean they're creative phases.\n\n22\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.300\nWhen you get to Improve,\nit's almost like the hammer falls.\n\n23\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.860\nIt's a roadmap.\n\n24\n00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.460\nWe have to do things in\na particular order, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.630\nSo, what we're gonna talk about in\nthis session is the role that Improve\n\n26\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.760\nplays in the DMAIC, and\nthe tools that are used in Improve.\n\n27\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n28\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.070\n&gt;&gt; Now the first thing is that I had\n\n29\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.150\nfigured out my three to five solutions and\nanalyze.\n\n30\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.960\nSo, i wouldn't have really left analyze\nunless I have three to five solutions.\n\n31\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.703\nNow, sometimes I may have more, but when\nI get ready to present those solutions,\n\n32\n00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:42.442\nI just want the three to five.\n\n33\n00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:46.270\nAnd then sometimes my boss is gonna\nask me, which one would you choose?\n\n34\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.930\nI still want my boss to pick one,\nbecause that helps with the buy in,\n\n35\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.610\nbut I need to be prepared to\nsay which one I think is best.\n\n36\n00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.820\nSo what I'm about to tell you could\nhappen at the bottom of analyze.\n\n37\n00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.370\nOr it could happen at the top of Improve,\n\n38\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.840\nbefore you list your\nthree to five solutions.\n\n39\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.660\nBut your first official goal in Improve,\n\n40\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.300\nis to have three to five solutions\nthat you can present, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.660\nSo that's your first official step.\n\n42\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.990\nSo between that first official step and\nwhen you leave, analyze, or\n\n43\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.640\nthe bottom part of analyze, these are some\nthings that you wanna think about.\n\n44\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.560\nWhat are the consequences?\n\n45\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.099\nNow I'm just gonna ahead and\npull up these bullet points.\n\n46\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.370\nAnd what would be the consequences\nof each alternative?\n\n47\n00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.270\nSo what you are trying to do is\nyou're trying to either narrow that\n\n48\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.560\ndown to three to five, or\nyou're trying to pick which one,\n\n49\n00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.270\nif they ask you,\nthat you would choose over the others.\n\n50\n00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.863\nNow, sometimes you're just\ngonna naturally know.\n\n51\n00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:47.719\nYou're gonna say,\n\n52\n00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.360\nwell I picked this one because I think\nit's the greenest solution, right?\n\n53\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.034\nBut sometimes you won't.\nSo kinda of think of,\n\n54\n00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:57.403\nthis is a way to narrow down that list,\nand/or help you choose the one that,\n\n55\n00:02:57.403 --> 00:03:00.203\nif they where to ask you\nwhich one would you pick,\n\n56\n00:03:00.203 --> 00:03:02.880\nthat you would have something to say.\n\n57\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.420\nSo I'm gonna list the consequences for\neach alternative,\n\n58\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.630\nlike what are all the things\nthat could go wrong.\n\n59\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.740\nI'm gonna access future consequences.\n\n60\n00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.570\nSorry.\n\n61\n00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.745\nI'm gonna think about\nthe future consequences,\n\n62\n00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:15.408\nlike down the road what could happen?\n\n63\n00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:19.830\nI'm gonna look at the descriptions\nof the consequences.\n\n64\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.690\nI'm gonna eliminate any\nclearly inferior alternatives,\n\n65\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.312\njust because maybe there's\njust too much risk involved.\n\n66\n00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:30.310\nAnd then I'm gonna organized\nthe description of what I have left.\n\n67\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.260\nSo this is just another thinking model\n\n68\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.970\nto help me determine\nwhat's the best solution.\n\n69\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.890\nAnother way, another strategy I could\nuse is I could look at tradeoffs.\n\n70\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.470\nSo I'm gonna pull these up again.\n\n71\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.390\nOops.\n\n72\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.340\nI wanna eliminate any alternatives\nthat clearly are dominated by others.\n\n73\n00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.840\nLike this solution is so much better\nthan this other solution for example.\n\n74\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.790\nI wanna do swaps,\n\n75\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.780\nI wanna look at incremental improvements,\nbecause sometimes those\n\n76\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.760\naren't quite as scary to people if\nwe just do a little bit at a time.\n\n77\n00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.050\nAnd I wanna make consistent tradeoffs.\n\n78\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.400\nSo if I do this, maybe we could do that.\n\n79\n00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.970\nI wanna kind of think of all of those\nthings before I present my three to five\n\n80\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.110\nsolutions because, mostly, I want to be\nprepared for questions people might ask.\n\n81\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.920\nAnd then, I also wanna be prepared for\nthe uncertainties.\n\n82\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.945\nSo I'm gonna pull those up.\n\n83\n00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.170\nWhoops.\n\n84\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.430\nWhat are the key uncertainties\nof each alternative?\n\n85\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.900\nNow, I'm not saying that\nyou would introduce this.\n\n86\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.070\nWhen you do your presentation, your first\nofficial task, remember, your first\n\n87\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.300\nofficial task in Improve, is to present\nthose three to five solutions, right?\n\n88\n00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.160\nI'm not saying that you even need to\ntalk about the Key Uncertainties.\n\n89\n00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.000\nBut you want to know what those are, so\nif you get asked, well what if we do this?\n\n90\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.130\nWhat would happen, right?\n\n91\n00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.030\nSo kind of think about it\nfrom their standpoint,\n\n92\n00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.950\nwhen you present these solutions, what\nkinds of questions are they gonna ask you.\n\n93\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.010\nSo you can look at consequences,\nyou can look at tradeoffs.\n\n94\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.810\nAnd what we're looking at\nright now is Uncertainties.\n\n95\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.280\nSo the questions under uncertainty.\n\n96\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.780\nWhat are the possible outcomes?\n\n97\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.430\nWhat are the changes of the outcomes?\n\n98\n00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.370\nWhat are the consequences for\neach of the outcomes?\n\n99\n00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.860\nSo again, just some things to think about.\n\n100\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.560\nNow if you're pretty solid when you leave\nAnalyze, and you say, you know what?\n\n101\n00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.940\nI've got three to five solutions,\nI feel really good about these.\n\n102\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.380\nI feel like I can defend these.\n\n103\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.680\nI think I can answer all the questions,\nwell then you don't need this help.\n\n104\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.960\nThis help is there in case you're really\nbusy, you're working on my goodness,\n\n105\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.420\nmore than one project, and you're\ntrying to prepare your presentation.\n\n106\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.990\nAnd these aren't bad to just\nwhen you're presenting an idea,\n\n107\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.480\nthese aren't bad ideas to have\nin the back if your mind.\n\n108\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.730\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, you wanna look thorough, and\nyou don't wanna look this kind of rushed\n\n109\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.610\nand put together right before a meeting or\nsomething like that.\n\n110\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.000\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so these are kinda\ngood questions to go through.\n\n111\n00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.400\nAnd then finally in this\nlist is Risk Tolerance.\n\n112\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.620\nHow much risk do you wanna handle?\n\n113\n00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.180\nAnd you wanna kinda think from their\nstandpoint, what do they want to handle?\n\n114\n00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.310\nAnd how much are others\naffected by your decision?\n\n115\n00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.082\nA lot of times what happens\nis we make a decision and\n\n116\n00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.186\nwe're not even thinking about\nthe other people right?\n\n117\n00:06:19.186 --> 00:06:24.320\nI wanna quantify the risk,\nI wanna seek to lessen the risk.\n\n118\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.520\nAnd I want to avoid\nmaking risky decisions.\n\n119\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.560\nSo again, just another little test\nI can run things through, and\n\n120\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.450\nor think from their side\nthings that they might ask me.\n\n121\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.960\nSo, I get to the Improve Phase.\n\n122\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.910\nAnd my very first thing which\nI've said a number of times.\n\n123\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.720\nMy very, very, first thing is I want\nto list three to five solutions.\n\n124\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.300\nNow you may notice on the slide,\n\n125\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.980\nthat there's a lot of whitespace\nin between these things.\n\n126\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.070\nAnd that's because there's\nsome unpredictability there.\n\n127\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.750\nSo if I list my 3 to 5 solutions and\nI'm only working with 1 person,\n\n128\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.500\nmy boss, It might go really fast, right?\n\n129\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.430\nHowever, I could be doing\na full blown presentation,\n\n130\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.160\nin which case I want to go back and\nlook at those things we just talked about.\n\n131\n00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.890\nLike, what is my risk?\n\n132\n00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.440\nWhat's the uncertainty?\n\n133\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.510\nWhat are the trade offs?\n\n134\n00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.670\nWhat are the consequences?\n\n135\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.620\nIf I'm going to do a presentation\nin front of people,\n\n136\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.510\nI want to be prepared, cuz there's going\nto be people asking me these questions.\n\n137\n00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.100\nThat could be a much longer process right?\n\n138\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.580\nSo, if I'm working for one person\nthey may say, go with solution two-\n\n139\n00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580\n&gt;&gt; I trust your judgement.\n\n140\n00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.162\n&gt;&gt; I trust your judgement.\n\n141\n00:07:30.162 --> 00:07:30.880\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n142\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, just do what you wanna do.\n\n143\n00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.090\nBut it could be a really big deal.\n\n144\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.210\nI might have to get consensus, right?\n\n145\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.880\nBut no matter what, I have to figure out,\nI mean from a logical stand point,\n\n146\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.100\nwhat am I going to do?\n\n147\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.190\nWhich solution am I going to try out?\n\n148\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.886\nNow, this is where it starts\ngetting a little tricky.\n\n149\n00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:52.326\nBecause sometimes the problem is so\nurgent,\n\n150\n00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:57.340\nthat no one's going to be buying\ninto that you want to do a pilot.\n\n151\n00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.709\nThey may not want to fund it.\n\n152\n00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:00.325\nThey might not want the time.\n\n153\n00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:04.153\nBut when it says do a pilot,\nbasically what Lean Six Sigma is\n\n154\n00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:08.610\nsaying is that you need to figure\nout a way to try it out, right?\n\n155\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.938\nSo if you can't try it out in a small\nformat, maybe a focus group or\n\n156\n00:08:12.938 --> 00:08:17.997\na simulation, maybe you can read case\nstudies of where other people did it.\n\n157\n00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.026\nYou can do a kind of a mock,\nbeing like a simulation.\n\n158\n00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:23.689\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so the thing is,\n\n159\n00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.611\nthis actually makes a lot of sense,\nif we skip this step,\n\n160\n00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.910\nwe really wanna try it out\nbefore we roll it out.\n\n161\n00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n\n162\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.740\n&gt;&gt; And so let's say we try it out and\n\n164\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.950\nit doesn't work?\n\n165\n00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.360\nThe beauty of the DMAIC model is\nthat's when I go back up to one of my\n\n166\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.570\nother three to five solutions and\nI try that.\n\n167\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.880\nI'm not going all the back to Define.\n\n168\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.010\nI don't think anyone, including ourselves,\n\n169\n00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.990\nwants to be in a situation where it's\nback to the drawing board, right?\n\n170\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.230\n&gt;&gt; Right, well, that's the whole idea of\nhaving a plan A, a plan B, and a plan C.\n\n171\n00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.962\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly, and so,\n\n172\n00:08:56.962 --> 00:09:02.880\nthen let's say it did work because\nwe're gonna be optimistic.\n\n173\n00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.501\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; When we say it.\n\n174\n00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It did work.\n\n175\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.960\nNow what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna create our project plan,\n\n176\n00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.880\nand we're gonna stay in our project\nplan until an improvement is made.\n\n177\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.840\nNow the way we know an improvement is\nmade, is we take our picture again.\n\n178\n00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.170\nWe look at where we're at and\n\n179\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.900\nwe compare it against the before\npicture that we created in measure.\n\n180\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.455\nSo measure has our before picture, then we\nanalyzed it, then we came up with a plan.\n\n181\n00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:31.640\nThen we rolled out the plan, and now\nwe're gonna go look at that same picture.\n\n182\n00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.750\nSo if I use return on\ninvestment in measure,\n\n183\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.230\nI wanna use return on investment\nat the end of my story, right?\n\n184\n00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.004\nIf I used a control chart, I wanna use\na control chart at the end of my story.\n\n185\n00:09:43.004 --> 00:09:47.030\nSo whatever tools or\ntools I use to give you a current\n\n186\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.440\npicture of where we are today,\nI wanna use that same vehicle.\n\n187\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.680\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n188\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.590\n&gt;&gt; So really in the Improve phase,\nit's more of a a road map,\n\n189\n00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.710\nbecause you don't really\nhave a lot of choices.\n\n190\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.510\nDefine, you get to define what you want.\n\n191\n00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.827\nYou get to measure what you want.\n\n192\n00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:04.600\nYou get to analyze what you want.\n\n193\n00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.540\nYou get to improve, and it says, you know\nwhat, you have to follow these steps.\n\n194\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.020\nYou have to introduce your solution,\nyou have to get consensus,\n\n195\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.580\nyou have to try it out.\n\n196\n00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.320\nYou have to roll it out, right?\n\n197\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.690\nNow once I roll it out and I know for sure\nthat a process improvement has been made,\n\n198\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.390\nbecause I compared it against my measure\npicture, then I get to go to control.\n\n199\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.865\nMy project is not done.\n\n200\n00:10:24.865 --> 00:10:26.965\nI mean, there's still close out.\n\n201\n00:10:26.965 --> 00:10:29.205\nI still have to write\na sustainability plan.\n\n202\n00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.895\nBut I know this isn't proper English.\n\n203\n00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:34.166\nBut the moment I see an improvement\nis being made, me and\n\n204\n00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.585\nmy project plan can just go ahead and\ngo on over to control.\n\n205\n00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:38.985\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n206\n00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:44.860\n&gt;&gt; So what I wanna talk about now\nis some improvement strategies,\n\n207\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.290\nokay, so basic improvement strategies.\n\n208\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.840\nEliminate non-value added tasks.\n\n209\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.104\nI might even still do these improvement\nstrategies on my project plan.\n\n210\n00:10:54.104 --> 00:10:56.818\nBecause just because I'm\nrolling out a project plan,\n\n211\n00:10:56.818 --> 00:11:00.090\ndoesn't necessarily mean I\ncan't improve that as well.\n\n212\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.520\nSo I wanna combine tasks or functions.\n\n213\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.650\nI want to look at any\nconcurrent processes.\n\n214\n00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.830\nI wanna eliminate or reduce batching.\n\n215\n00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.820\nThat's when I'm sending a bunch\nof things at once because\n\n216\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.240\nit's a little harder to track.\n\n217\n00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.870\nI wanna shift roles and responsibilities.\n\n218\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.590\nIf I'm making my project plan and\n\n219\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.080\nI've got someone that doesn't have\nthose particular competencies.\n\n220\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.990\nOr if I'm the only one on my\nproject plan for resources,\n\n221\n00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:29.870\nwanna think about how I can maybe shift\nthe roles that I'm playing around, or\n\n222\n00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.500\nmaybe ask my boss for more time because\nit's just me working on this project.\n\n223\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in real life sometimes people\nget pulled off of one project to work on\n\n224\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.239\nanother one when you're limited\nin your human resources?\n\n225\n00:11:40.239 --> 00:11:46.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and I wanna constantly keep in\nmind like automation and solving problem.\n\n226\n00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.380\nI wanna be,\neven though I got my project plan now,\n\n227\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.560\nI still don't wanna get out of that mode\nthat I'm building in improvement strategy.\n\n228\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.669\nNow one of the things that happens when we\nget down to those three to five decisions,\n\n229\n00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.190\nlet's say we went through all of those\nquestions, and we're ending up with,\n\n230\n00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.310\nlet's say,\nthree decisions that all seem equal to us.\n\n231\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.460\nWe went through those questions,\nwe did everything,\n\n232\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.960\nwe really can't think\nof another way to go.\n\n233\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.450\nSo a tool we might use is\nsomething called a SWOT analysis.\n\n234\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.060\nAnd what the SWOT analysis does, and\n\n235\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.935\nI know a lot of you are probably\nalready familiar with this.\n\n236\n00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:26.560\nIs it lists the strengths of that\nsolution or idea, the weaknesses, so\n\n237\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.350\nthink pros and cons.\n\n238\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.920\nAnd in the old days,\nwe only had pros and cons, and\n\n239\n00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.820\nwe called that a force field analysis,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.895\nAnd if the good things\noutweighed the bad things,\n\n241\n00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:41.010\nthen we went with the, if the bad things\noutweighed the good things, we did it.\n\n242\n00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.220\nBut as time went on, we realized that\ntwo other components, opportunities and\n\n243\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.340\nthreats play an important role.\n\n244\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.390\nSo the weaknesses, the cons,\ncould be really lengthy,\n\n245\n00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.000\nbut the opportunity's so great that\nwe're gonna go ahead and do it anyway.\n\n246\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.155\nAnd then the threat just means risk.\n\n247\n00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:01.500\nSo the strengths might be there,\nbut the risk might too big.\n\n248\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.740\nSo this is kind of a 360 way of\nthinking through the SWOT analysis.\n\n249\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.770\nSWOT analysis can also be used at the\nbeginning of our story if we're trying to\n\n250\n00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.490\nfigure out and define which project\nis gonna give me the biggest bang for\n\n251\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.674\nmy buck.\n\n252\n00:13:15.674 --> 00:13:19.730\nSo there's a tool that we can use\nin addition to those thinking\n\n253\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.320\ntools that we looked at about, the ones\nthat we looked about consequences,\n\n254\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.790\nrisk, uncertainty,\nthose types of trade-offs.\n\n255\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.910\nSo in addition to that, if we still don't\nhave a good idea as to which one we should\n\n256\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.750\ntry, or let's say you get into a situation\nwhere several people are saying,\n\n257\n00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.080\nwell, we don't know.\n\n258\n00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.118\nThen you could do a SWOT\nanalysis with them.\n\n259\n00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.552\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, you might even\nhave someone in your group that\n\n260\n00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:45.440\nbelieves the saying,\nfortune favors the bold.\n\n261\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.120\nThey look at that opportunity\nquadrant and- [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n263\n00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.220\n&gt;&gt; Maybe they lean a little bit\nthat way because of that idea.\n\n264\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.590\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and the nice thing about SWOT\nanalysis is it's a good facilitation tool,\n\n265\n00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.990\nand it's one that you can do on your own.\n\n266\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.749\nThe rules for SWOT, there's not really\na lot of rules for SWOT analysis because,\n\n267\n00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:05.170\nagain, it's structured brainstorming.\n\n268\n00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.710\nBut the SWOT analysis,\nalong with some tips and\n\n269\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.140\ntricks on how to do SWOT analysis,\nis part of your student package.\n\n270\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.866\nSo just kind of keep that in mind.\n\n271\n00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:17.320\nIt's one that that you can use again\nif you feel a little stumped, or\n\n272\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.530\nif you're trying to back up\nsomething that you're trying to say.\n\n273\n00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.950\nSo when we're making decisions, and this\nwould be decisions on our project plan,\n\n274\n00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.820\neven though we've already\ngot our basic solution down.\n\n275\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.550\nOr decisions that could be used\nwhen we're trying to decide\n\n276\n00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.710\nwhich one of the three to five to use.\n\n277\n00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.250\nSo we wanna focus on what's important.\n\n278\n00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.410\nWe wanna be logical and consistent.\n\n279\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.369\nAnd when we say logical and consistent\nin this environment, we mean logical and\n\n280\n00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:46.740\nconsistent in context to\nthe company you're working for.\n\n281\n00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.481\nCuz sometimes we feel like\ncompanies don't make logical and\n\n282\n00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:52.550\nconsistent decisions, right?\n\n283\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But with this,\n\n284\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:15:00.380\nwith the company we wanna acknowledge\nthe objective and subjective factors.\n\n285\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.820\nWe wanna think, and\nthis is a big one in Lean Six Sigma.\n\n286\n00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.600\nWe wanna balance analytical\ntools with intuitive thinking.\n\n287\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.030\nWe wanna look at both.\n\n288\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.547\nNow I think I've mentioned a number\nof times that it's still numbers and\n\n289\n00:15:13.547 --> 00:15:17.340\nfacts and statistics,\nthat has a bigger chair at the table.\n\n290\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.820\n[LAUGH] But we wanna consider\nall of those other things.\n\n291\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.110\nWe don't wanna get too much information.\n\n292\n00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.800\nWe wanna try to reach consensus.\n\n293\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.820\nIf everyone's agreeing, that's just\ngonna be easier, we'll have buy-in.\n\n294\n00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.350\nAnd then we wanna make sure that\nwe're straightforward, reliable.\n\n295\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.560\nAnd again, these are kinds of things\nthat you can go back and look at.\n\n296\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.107\nThey're in your student package,\nsometimes just for validation.\n\n297\n00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:44.110\nSo I wanna talk a little\nbit about the Pilot.\n\n298\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:49.150\nSo, what happens, Cherokee,\nis that I list my three to five solutions.\n\n299\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.160\nI have to pick one.\n\n300\n00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.160\nI try it out.\n\n301\n00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.280\nSometimes I'm not gonna\nhave time to try out.\n\n302\n00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.284\nSometimes in IT, the Pilot is the project.\n\n303\n00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:05.767\nSo one of the things that we wanna stay\ncognizant of Is how do pilots work?\n\n304\n00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:08.102\nIn some environments where\nthey let you do a pilot,\n\n305\n00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:11.160\nyou're certainly gonna wanna\nhave some evaluation techniques.\n\n306\n00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.794\nYou're gonna wanna prove that it was\nworth their time to let you do a pilot.\n\n307\n00:16:14.794 --> 00:16:19.560\nAnd again, like I said,\nin IT sometimes the pilot is your project.\n\n308\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.354\nSo these are just some tips\non what the pilot purpose is,\n\n309\n00:16:24.354 --> 00:16:27.320\nand I shouldn't really say tips.\n\n310\n00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.640\nThey're more about if\nyou had to defend that.\n\n311\n00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.655\nIf you think you have\na chance because ultimately,\n\n312\n00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:37.155\nif you could do a pilot it's almost one\nof those guaranteed keys to success.\n\n313\n00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:37.754\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n314\n00:16:37.754 --> 00:16:43.640\nsome of the reasons why in IT if you said\nsometimes the pilot is in fact your test.\n\n315\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.602\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n316\n00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:47.140\n&gt;&gt; In a perfect world and\nyou've said this several times,\n\n317\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.300\nyou have all the resources and\nyou have everything you need.\n\n318\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.315\nIf you've been out in a real world,\nyou know that's not always perfect, real,\n\n319\n00:16:54.315 --> 00:16:55.328\nnot the same thing?\n\n320\n00:16:55.328 --> 00:16:59.293\nAnd it can be, it'd be great to have\na virtual environment set up to create and\n\n321\n00:16:59.293 --> 00:17:01.430\nsimulate your production environment.\n\n322\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.248\nMaybe you don't have all those\nresources it can become costly and\n\n323\n00:17:06.248 --> 00:17:10.926\nyou won't be able to simulate an accurate\npicture of your production environment so.\n\n324\n00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:11.588\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and so\n\n325\n00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:15.570\nthe things on that left hand side of\nthe column kind of facilitate that.\n\n326\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.219\nAnd then on the right\nhand side of the column,\n\n327\n00:17:18.219 --> 00:17:23.103\nit's just kind of things that you want to\nkeep in mind like involving management and\n\n328\n00:17:23.103 --> 00:17:25.784\ncarefully planning your pilot activities.\n\n329\n00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:28.788\nSo if they've agreed to\nlet you have a pilot,\n\n330\n00:17:28.788 --> 00:17:31.961\nthen you want to be accountable for\nthat pilot.\n\n331\n00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:33.430\nAnd there's some other things here.\n\n332\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.189\nThis is one of those sheets that is\nin your student package just in case.\n\n333\n00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:43.860\nAnd this isn't so much a testing sheet as\nit is if you really get to do a pilot.\n\n334\n00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.306\nSo it's just some tips and tricks you can\nuse when you're talking, or presenting,\n\n335\n00:17:48.306 --> 00:17:49.632\nor something like that.\n\n336\n00:17:49.632 --> 00:17:53.440\nIt's just so cool when you can do a pilot\ncuz this is almost guaranteed success.\n\n337\n00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.810\nBut at a lot of times like\nI said unfortunately.\n\n338\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:56.392\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n339\n00:17:56.392 --> 00:17:57.180\n&gt;&gt; There's just not time.\n\n340\n00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.170\n&gt;&gt; If you can't.\nAnd you know one thing you could keep in\n\n341\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.103\nmind though, if you weren't able\nto actually perform a pilot.\n\n342\n00:18:02.103 --> 00:18:06.910\nYou might wanna test on maybe\nsome kind of down time.\n\n343\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.877\nGive yourself a window to roll back.\n\n344\n00:18:08.877 --> 00:18:12.629\n&gt;&gt; Good idea.\n&gt;&gt; If you were unsuccessful.\n\n345\n00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n346\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.552\nOkay so we're gonna pretend like\nthey let us do a full blown pilot.\n\n347\n00:18:18.552 --> 00:18:21.850\nBut we did come up with some other\nideas that they didn't, right.\n\n348\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.152\nBut they let us do a full blown pilot.\n\n349\n00:18:24.152 --> 00:18:25.640\nAnd we're really excited now.\n\n350\n00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.457\nWe're gonna go to our project plan.\n\n351\n00:18:27.457 --> 00:18:30.574\nWe already know that our project\nplan is gonna follow WBS,\n\n352\n00:18:30.574 --> 00:18:32.530\nwork breakdown structure.\n\n353\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.008\nAnd in the beginning,\nit's not always, I mean,\n\n354\n00:18:35.008 --> 00:18:37.374\nthis is the first time\nthe rubber hits the road.\n\n355\n00:18:37.374 --> 00:18:41.230\nUp to this point, you really haven't\ndone anything you can't take back.\n\n356\n00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.694\nBut now I'm about to roll\nout that project plan.\n\n357\n00:18:43.694 --> 00:18:47.290\nI'm gonna start wearing my\nproject manager hat, right?\n\n358\n00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.688\nI'm gonna start moving forward.\n\n359\n00:18:48.688 --> 00:18:55.870\nSo it's not always easy to accurately\ndefine the time and the cost of a project.\n\n360\n00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.130\nAnd that's where the WBS comes in.\n\n361\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:03.344\nBecause if I break down my work breakdown\nstructure, I can look at each tiny entry.\n\n362\n00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:09.850\n1.1.3 is gonna cost me $30 and it's\ngonna require an hour of my time, right?\n\n363\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:14.393\nSo when I'm done doing this, when I'm done\nassessing like how much its gonna cost?\n\n364\n00:19:14.393 --> 00:19:16.480\nAnd how long its gonna take?\n\n365\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.804\nWhen I'm going to end up with is something\ncalled a cost and time baseline.\n\n366\n00:19:21.804 --> 00:19:25.090\nFrom that point forward,\nthat's what I'm gonna be graded on.\n\n367\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.110\nI'm gonna be graded on, how close I\ncome till how much I said it would cost?\n\n368\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.914\nAnd how close did I come to how\nlong I thought it would take?\n\n369\n00:19:31.914 --> 00:19:36.331\nNow, unfortunately, if I go even a little\nabove what I said it would cost and\n\n370\n00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:40.430\nthe time it would take,\npeople start getting kind of panicky.\n\n371\n00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.417\nAnd if I come a little below.\n\n372\n00:19:42.417 --> 00:19:43.300\nThey're really happy.\n\n373\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.493\nSo if I come below what I said would be\ncost and time, or even right on the money,\n\n374\n00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:48.907\npeople are pretty happy.\n\n375\n00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:51.830\nBut a little above then they're not so\nhappy.\n\n376\n00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.816\nThen if I go way above what happens?\n\n377\n00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:57.550\nI might not even have a job, right?\n\n378\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.186\nBut if I go way below you think\nthat they'd be really happy,\n\n379\n00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:03.374\nit didn't cost as much as I said it would,\nit didn't take as much time.\n\n380\n00:20:03.374 --> 00:20:04.320\nBut what happens?\n\n381\n00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.624\nWhat do people say when you\nbring a project in too early or\n\n382\n00:20:07.624 --> 00:20:09.064\ntoo much under cost?\n\n383\n00:20:09.064 --> 00:20:10.045\n&gt;&gt; Here's your next project.\n\n384\n00:20:10.045 --> 00:20:10.724\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n385\n00:20:10.724 --> 00:20:11.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n386\n00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.381\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing they say is, okay,\n\n387\n00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:15.201\nI'm gonna give you another project.\n\n388\n00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:19.713\nAnd then also too they could just what\nthey could ascertain is that maybe\n\n389\n00:20:19.713 --> 00:20:22.360\nyou're a poor project manager.\n\n390\n00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.235\nAnd we've got suspicious people\nout there who are gonna be like,\n\n391\n00:20:25.235 --> 00:20:26.339\nwhat did you not give me.\n\n392\n00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:26.853\nThat you promised me.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah or\n\n393\n00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:30.977\nmaybe you reduced quality in some area\nthat we really didn't want to reduce\n\n394\n00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:31.700\nquality in.\n\n395\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.951\nSo their kinda just second guessing\nyour work all together like you said.\n\n396\n00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n397\n00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.894\nSo kind of remember these are some\nthings about developing your project\n\n398\n00:20:38.894 --> 00:20:41.186\nplan that are on this slide\nthat you need to remember.\n\n399\n00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:46.470\nAgain these are captured more in\na chart form in your student package.\n\n400\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.042\nSo I just wanna introduce them to you.\n\n401\n00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:52.882\nBut basically stakeholders are going to\nexpect that you bring it in on time and\n\n402\n00:20:52.882 --> 00:20:54.380\nyou bring it in on cost.\n\n403\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:21:01.426\nAnd that's why you want to take time to\nlook at each one of those WBS entries.\n\n404\n00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:06.290\nNow, when I get ready to communicate the\nproject, that's kind of a different thing.\n\n405\n00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:11.384\nSo let's say it's worked out\nwell I'm rolling out my project.\n\n406\n00:21:11.384 --> 00:21:13.826\nI'm about ready to move into control,\n\n407\n00:21:13.826 --> 00:21:17.850\nwhich maybe they're not as impressed with,\nright?\n\n408\n00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.364\nAnd so I might have to communicate\nthe results of my project.\n\n409\n00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.643\nAnd so there's, when I'm doing that,\n\n410\n00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:27.720\nI want to think about what kinds\nof things would people care about?\n\n411\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.605\nNow, I might not actually even give my\nproject presentation until the end of\n\n412\n00:21:32.605 --> 00:21:33.300\ncontrol.\n\n413\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.520\nBut I really need to start thinking about\nthat when I go into control, right?\n\n414\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.305\nAnd so I wanna think,\nif I'm keeping a log of my results,\n\n415\n00:21:43.305 --> 00:21:47.994\nI'm making a final report\nto capture the information,\n\n416\n00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:51.208\na lot of different formats to do that.\n\n417\n00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:54.961\nReports can, I think I already said that,\nthat's on your slide.\n\n418\n00:21:54.961 --> 00:22:00.750\nI think I already said this, but can take\na lot of different approaches and ways.\n\n419\n00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.145\nSo I wanna take a second,\nonce we get to the projects, and\n\n420\n00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:08.451\nwe are rolling it out, and it's working.\n\n421\n00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:12.010\nI wanna reiterate that we are gonna\nhave to communicate our project results.\n\n422\n00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.383\nIf we start thinking about\nthat at the end of improve,\n\n423\n00:22:14.383 --> 00:22:17.095\nthat's probably the best place\nto start thinking about it.\n\n424\n00:22:17.095 --> 00:22:19.667\nWe may even have to,\nbefore we go to control,\n\n425\n00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:22.990\ngive a project report, so\nkind of keep that in mind.\n\n426\n00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.959\nBut if we're gathering information as\nwe go along it's not gonna be quite as\n\n427\n00:22:26.959 --> 00:22:28.083\ndifficult, right?\n\n428\n00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:31.590\nOkay, so I wanna step back,\nwe have a project now, right?\n\n429\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:36.561\nWe defined, we measured, we analyze,\nwe pick one, we piloted it,\n\n430\n00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:39.921\nwe rolled it out,\nwe have a project in the mix.\n\n431\n00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:42.240\nWhy do projects fail?\n\n432\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.380\nSo let's talk about why projects fail and\nwhy they succeed.\n\n433\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.438\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So in your world Cherokee,\n\n434\n00:22:47.438 --> 00:22:48.928\nwhy do projects fail?\n\n435\n00:22:48.928 --> 00:22:53.319\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think biggest, and\nI know it's kind of cliche just to say\n\n436\n00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:57.019\ncommunication, but\nto back my answer up a little bit Is,\n\n437\n00:22:57.019 --> 00:23:01.413\nI think by human nature people\nreally meet change with resistance,\n\n438\n00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:05.600\nif you're not explaining why\nit's important to do something.\n\n439\n00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.605\nIf you're just saying,\nwe have to do this because I said so,\n\n440\n00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:11.030\nbecause I am flexing my IT muscle or\nwhatever.\n\n441\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.889\nThey're just like,\nI'm not listening to Cherokee.\n\n442\n00:23:12.889 --> 00:23:14.911\nShe is a jerk.\n\n443\n00:23:14.911 --> 00:23:19.198\n[LAUGH] But if you put it in\na way that makes sense to them or\n\n444\n00:23:19.198 --> 00:23:22.405\neven Relates to them staying employed?\n\n445\n00:23:22.405 --> 00:23:23.223\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh?\n\n446\n00:23:23.223 --> 00:23:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Then they are a little more\nperceptive and open to your ideas.\n\n447\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.936\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, and\nthen if you had to say in your world,\n\n448\n00:23:30.936 --> 00:23:33.259\nwhat makes a project successful?\n\n449\n00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:37.631\n&gt;&gt; I think just right from\nthe beginning obtaining that buy in and\n\n450\n00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.420\nmaking everyone a cohesive unit.\n\n451\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.231\nIf they believe in you,\nthey believe in the project.\n\n452\n00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:44.720\nYou stay on top of things.\n\n453\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.981\nYou keep those communications.\n\n454\n00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:49.297\nYou deliver what you say\nyou're gonna deliver, on time.\n\n455\n00:23:49.297 --> 00:23:51.943\nThen everyone's just going to,\nin their mindsets, say look,\n\n456\n00:23:51.943 --> 00:23:54.210\nwe're gonna be successful in this project.\n\n457\n00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.619\nAnd then they can vision it out until\nthe very end from fruition to end.\n\n458\n00:23:57.619 --> 00:23:59.269\nAnd that's it.\n\n459\n00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:00.273\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n460\n00:24:00.273 --> 00:24:05.752\nOkay, so let's talk about, like Cherokee\nintroduced a number of things and\n\n461\n00:24:05.752 --> 00:24:11.010\nSome of the things that you maybe\nasked an on exam is why projects fail?\n\n462\n00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.780\nAnd we cover a bunch of them.\n\n463\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.780\nBut here's some bullet points,\n\n464\n00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.330\na failure to align the project with\nthe organizational objectives.\n\n465\n00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.900\nWe talked about that kind of early on.\n\n466\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.710\nPoor scope, I want it, scope is kind of\n\n467\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.885\ninteresting topic that comes up in project\nmanagement, comes up in Lean Six Sigma and\n\n468\n00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:33.330\nLean Six sigma scope is the area\nthat you're gonna cover.\n\n469\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.890\nSo let's say, I'm going to make\n\n470\n00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.410\nthe benefits process easier to understand\nin the manufacturing department, and\n\n471\n00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.370\nmaybe that's my pilot, right?\n\n472\n00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:48.390\nBut I'm not gonna do that for\nthe operations department yet.\n\n473\n00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.750\nRight not I'm just gonna work\njust on manufacturing, okay.\n\n474\n00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:56.290\nSo scope, it's almost better to think of\nit opposite, like what am I not gonna do.\n\n475\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.840\nI just wanna make sure.\n\n476\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.210\nAnd the reason why scope's so\n\n477\n00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:04.460\nimportant, is that if we go out of scope\nit pushes our time and our cost line out.\n\n478\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could go ahead and\n\n479\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.160\nhave those consequences and\nlose your vision so to speak.\n\n480\n00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.040\nAnd maybe someone else,\nupper management gets replaced and\n\n481\n00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.200\nthey want you to kind\nof go on their project.\n\n482\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.580\nAnd if you have that scope you're,\nlike you had say before,\n\n483\n00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.220\nnope, this is what I'm doing.\n\n484\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.880\nRefer back to the documentation.\n\n485\n00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that takes us all the way\nback to that project charter, right.\n\n486\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n487\n00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect, and so another reason\n\n488\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.260\nthere's not good executives sponsorship\nThere's not a good project manager and\n\n489\n00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:37.220\nin this case you are the project manager\nso that's common cause variation there.\n\n490\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:37.765\n&gt;&gt; Never.\n\n491\n00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:41.350\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes\n\n492\n00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.860\nit's really amazing\nthe personality complex.\n\n493\n00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.740\nA lot of projects that fail fail\njust because the people issues not\n\n494\n00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.340\nanything other than that.\n\n495\n00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.327\nAnd sometimes politics, now the reason\nwhy we're bringing this up now other than\n\n496\n00:25:55.327 --> 00:26:00.093\nthe fact that it is on your exam is that\nbefore start the exam question is gonna be\n\n497\n00:26:00.093 --> 00:26:03.434\nworded what are some reasons\nour projects might fail?\n\n498\n00:26:03.434 --> 00:26:05.676\nIt's gonna be probably\nsomething like that,\n\n499\n00:26:05.676 --> 00:26:08.558\nit might not be exactly like that but\nyou kinda get the idea.\n\n500\n00:26:08.558 --> 00:26:11.716\nOr it might say something,\nlack of project manager,\n\n501\n00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:15.730\nlack of sponsorship,\nunrealistic expectations, leads to what?\n\n502\n00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.100\nAnd that would be project failure so\nkind of think about that.\n\n503\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.650\nBut the reason why we're bringing it\nup at this point in our presentation\n\n504\n00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.190\nis that before you roll out your project\nplan, these are discussions that you need\n\n505\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.250\nto have with your group or with yourself\nif it's just you managing the project.\n\n506\n00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.290\nAnd kind of starting building into\nyour project plan some things\n\n507\n00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.720\nto keep it from failing.\n\n508\n00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.850\nAnd you're gonna know if you defined,\nyou measured, you analyzed,\n\n509\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.570\nyou've been involved\nwith all these people,\n\n510\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.560\nyou're about to roll out the project,\ndon't discount\n\n511\n00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.050\nsomething like a personality conflict,\nsomeone who might get in your way.\n\n512\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.940\nDon't discount that people\nare expecting unrealistic expectations.\n\n513\n00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.940\nMake sure that your cost and\nyour timeline are within reason.\n\n514\n00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.240\nNow, on the positive\nside the reason projects\n\n515\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.080\nsucceed are all things that Lean Six Sigma\nsays we should be doing anyway.\n\n516\n00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.190\nWe want to make sure we get\nsponsorship at the executive level.\n\n517\n00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.690\nAnd the best way we can do that is\nmake sure that our defined story,\n\n518\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.980\nour why statement, is meaningful,\nright, that we developed.\n\n519\n00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.710\nWe're saying a good project charter which\nis something else we didn't define.\n\n520\n00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.600\nWe say strong project management,\nwell that's on me, right?\n\n521\n00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.400\nBecause I'm going to manage this\nproject and if I feel like I don't have\n\n522\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.600\nstrong project management skills,\njust basic project management,\n\n523\n00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.755\nthen I need to watch a tape at\nITProTV on project management.\n\n524\n00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:39.040\n[LAUGH] I wanna make sure I have\nthe right mix of team players,\n\n525\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.690\nif I'm lucky enough to have\npeople on the team and\n\n526\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.100\nI think if you start looking\nat that again and define.\n\n527\n00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.540\nSo here I am in improve and so many of\nthe things in improve are things that I\n\n528\n00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.650\nneeded to do in define, right,\nto make sure things work.\n\n529\n00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.140\nI wanna make sure I have good\ndecision making structure and\n\n530\n00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.240\nthere were a number of different\nmodels that I could follow for that.\n\n531\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.220\nI think the important thing is\nto be consistent at least for\n\n532\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.320\nthat project, good communication, and\n\n533\n00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.170\nwe wanna make sure that the team members\nare working towards a common goal.\n\n534\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.199\nNow, in the Lean Six Sigma world,\n\n535\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.220\nthere is a tendency to recognize\nthe four levels of teams.\n\n536\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.460\nSo you're not gonna probably see this,\nwell you might see it on the Lean and\n\n537\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.660\nSix Sigma exam, not as likely.\n\n538\n00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.760\nOn the Lean Six Sigma exam,\nremember there's four phases to a team,\n\n539\n00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.430\nthat's forming, storming,\nnorming, and performing.\n\n540\n00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:38.570\nAnd so when you're first forming,\nif you are lucky enough to have a team,\n\n541\n00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.990\neverything's kind of fun, right?\n\n542\n00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.040\nAnd then you move into the storming,\n\n543\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.730\nwhere people aren't maybe\ngetting along really well.\n\n544\n00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.560\nIf you get past that, and\nsometimes people take their dolls and\n\n545\n00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.020\ngo home in the storming phase.\n\n546\n00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.920\nAnd the team is over, that happens all\nthe time, even in executive teams.\n\n547\n00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.050\nSo if you kind of keep in mind,\nyou form, and then you storm, and\n\n548\n00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.950\nthings aren't going very well.\n\n549\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.730\nIf you get past that, you get back to\nnorming, where people kiss and make up.\n\n550\n00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.651\nBut, if you're not performing,\nit doesn't matter, right?\n\n551\n00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:10.155\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's very common,\n\n552\n00:29:10.155 --> 00:29:13.740\nbecause especially if you have a lot of,\nhow do I wanna say this?\n\n553\n00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.140\nExperienced people are very\npassionate about their beliefs, and\n\n554\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.220\nabout their particular field of study.\n\n555\n00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.610\nThey might really truly\nbelieve they're 110% right and\n\n556\n00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.850\nyou do see that conflict with\nreally passionate individuals.\n\n557\n00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n558\n00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.120\nAnd the thing is that we wanna\nremember about those four phases about\n\n559\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.840\nthe forming storming, you might ran into\npeople that say well we didn't storm.\n\n560\n00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.220\nWell if you're managing that team and\nno one, everyone's just like nodding their\n\n561\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.570\nhead and saying yeah that's good I don't\nhave any other ideas well that's a red\n\n562\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:53.695\nflag to you as a manager because surely\nyou didn't do everything 100% perfect.\n\n563\n00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:57.055\nAnd so storming, as long as you\ndon't let it last too long, and\n\n564\n00:29:57.055 --> 00:30:00.445\nas long as people don't get mad at\neach other, is actually a good thing.\n\n565\n00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:04.665\nBut probably that danger point, norming,\nwhere everybody's okay again and\n\n566\n00:30:04.665 --> 00:30:08.517\neverybody's back on track is if\nit doesn't lead to performing.\n\n567\n00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:12.277\nYou want, as a project manager,\nto get them to the performing phase.\n\n568\n00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:15.237\nNow if you defined and\nyou measured and you analyzed, and\n\n569\n00:30:15.237 --> 00:30:17.987\nyou have a team that's working with you,\nyou're not working on the project by\n\n570\n00:30:17.987 --> 00:30:21.617\nyourself, you can start using that\ntime to to be building your team.\n\n571\n00:30:21.617 --> 00:30:25.350\nSo by the time you roll out your project,\nyou're ready to perform.\n\n572\n00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.300\nOkay, so I want to talk a little bit\nabout the core project management tools.\n\n573\n00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.670\nAnd the reason I'm stopping here to talk\nabout that is that now that I'm rolling\n\n574\n00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:39.210\nout my project, in some environments I may\nbe required to do a new project charter.\n\n575\n00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.330\nBecause now my project charter\nsays this is what I want to do,\n\n576\n00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.350\nthis is why I want to do it, right?\n\n577\n00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:49.350\nNow in the SSD Global Solutions program,\nalthough you're required\n\n578\n00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.370\nto do a DMAIC report, you're only required\nto do the initial project charter.\n\n579\n00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.150\nBut just kind of keep in mind that,\n\n580\n00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.970\nin a real life work environment, it might\neven be to your advantage at this point\n\n581\n00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.900\nnow that you know what you wanted to do,\nto go ahead and do another charter, right?\n\n582\n00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.450\nIt just might help you.\n\n583\n00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.770\nAnd so core project management\ntools would be the project charter,\n\n584\n00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.140\nwould be the work breakdown structure,\nbecause that's you plan.\n\n585\n00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.370\nAnd if you decided to do another\nproject charter at this point,\n\n586\n00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.290\nthat's when you would include that plan,\n\n587\n00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.600\nbecause what you're asking is\ncan we approve that as well?\n\n588\n00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.030\nAnd then the project schedule and\nthe project budget.\n\n589\n00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:31.470\nWhich we're saying in a leaner term\nis your cost in time baseline.\n\n590\n00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:36.390\nSome in some project management\nenvironments, project schedule and\n\n591\n00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.320\nproject budget are actually\nseparate documents.\n\n592\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.020\nIn Lean Six Sigma, that line that you\nput on your project, that imaginary\n\n593\n00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.880\nline just says I've added everything\nup on my work breakdown structure and\n\n594\n00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.610\nthis is how much it's gonna cost and\nthis is how long it's gonna take.\n\n595\n00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:51.680\nWe think that's a leaner.\n\n596\n00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.309\nSo I do want to just let you know that\nin our program, one project charter,\n\n597\n00:31:56.309 --> 00:31:59.522\none project report before you sit for\nthe exam, and\n\n598\n00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:03.058\nthere's a few other prerequisites\nto sit for our exam.\n\n599\n00:32:03.058 --> 00:32:07.638\nBut in a real life environment it might\nbe to your advantage to kind of think of\n\n600\n00:32:07.638 --> 00:32:09.440\nit as starting over, right?\n\n601\n00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.130\nBecause you might wanna get your\nproject and your mini approved.\n\n602\n00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.570\nWhen you're doing that project charter,\nand\n\n603\n00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.650\nthis is even when you're doing\nthe process improvement project charter.\n\n604\n00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.220\nIt's just not as likely to be recorded.\n\n605\n00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.680\nIf you're doing a project charter on\na project you know the beginning,\n\n606\n00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.490\nyou know the end,\nyou've got your project plan,\n\n607\n00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.988\none of the things that you wanna\nthink about is assumptions.\n\n608\n00:32:33.988 --> 00:32:38.060\nAnd assumptions mean, I'm assuming\nthat these things are gonna happen\n\n609\n00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.600\nbecause I'm telling you this\nis how long it's gonna cost.\n\n610\n00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.760\nThis is my projection on how\nlong it's gonna take, right?\n\n611\n00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.010\nThis is what I'm doing but\nI'm assuming certain things.\n\n612\n00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.490\nSo, for example,\nwhen I do a project for a client.\n\n613\n00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.220\nSometimes I have to write in that my\nassumption is that you're gonna give me\n\n614\n00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.330\na team of people.\n\n615\n00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.350\nBecause a lot of times I\ndo projects on my own.\n\n616\n00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.080\nBut let's say I'm doing\na very complicated project.\n\n617\n00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.900\nOne of my assumptions might be that\nyou're going to give me an office, right.\n\n618\n00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.130\nTo work, when I come to your company,\nthere's gonna be an office.\n\n619\n00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:12.240\nSo what I wanna do at this point is, I\nwanna make sure that everyone understands.\n\n620\n00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.050\nSo I'm saying it's gonna cost this much,\nit's gonna take this much time.\n\n621\n00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.950\nBut I'm assuming you're gonna do\nyour part, whatever that part is.\n\n622\n00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.990\nNow, the other thing that you wanna\nthink about with project budget,\n\n623\n00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.020\nwhen you're coming up with your actual,\nhow much you think it's gonna cost.\n\n624\n00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.940\nTheir direct costs, their indirect costs,\nand their ongoing costs.\n\n625\n00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:35.650\nAnd, sometimes, people just say,\nokay, I'm gonna just add up my\n\n626\n00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.600\nwork breakdown structure and I'm gonna\ncome up with how much it's gonna cost.\n\n627\n00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.040\nBut there are sometimes things that\nyou haven't really considered.\n\n628\n00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.870\nSo an example of an indirect cost\nare something that you might not have\n\n629\n00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.720\nthought about is maybe you are gonna\nhave to work evenings, which means\n\n630\n00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.460\nin some environments, you have a security\nguard that needs to be on staff,\n\n631\n00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.490\nbut part of your budget\nhas to go to pay for that.\n\n632\n00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:03.480\nSo you don't wanna just, you do primarily\nget your cost estimate from just\n\n633\n00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.670\nadding up those lines,\nLine 1.1 all the way up to 20.7.9,\n\n634\n00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.250\nthat's really where your primary\ncost is gonna come from but\n\n635\n00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.530\nyou don't want to forget about some\nindirect costs that you might.\n\n636\n00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.775\n&gt;&gt; Would you recommend leaving\na bit of a buffer there?\n\n637\n00:34:18.775 --> 00:34:19.785\nSo that's\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n638\n00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:21.075\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n639\n00:34:21.075 --> 00:34:23.985\nYeah, and I'm just thinking maybe\na particular piece of equipment that you\n\n640\n00:34:23.985 --> 00:34:25.795\nwanted to rent wasn't available.\n\n641\n00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:27.165\nSo you had to go to another company.\n\n642\n00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:28.205\nThat cost was higher.\n\n643\n00:34:28.205 --> 00:34:29.595\nJust random things like that.\n\n644\n00:34:29.595 --> 00:34:30.465\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n645\n00:34:30.465 --> 00:34:33.635\nAnd then a lot of times we just\nforget about those ongoing costs.\n\n646\n00:34:33.635 --> 00:34:38.290\nThere's just ongoing costs that we might\nnot have packaged into our project.\n\n647\n00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.090\nIn some cases the employer isn't\ngoing to require you to do that.\n\n648\n00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.020\nBut it's something that\nyou have to keep in mind.\n\n649\n00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.320\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n650\n00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.920\n&gt;&gt; Or your client.\n\n651\n00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:53.451\nSo just to kind of give you an idea,\ndirect cost would be your hardware,\n\n652\n00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:57.666\nsoftware, contractor fees,\ntraining fanfare.\n\n653\n00:34:57.666 --> 00:34:58.531\nOther.\n\n654\n00:34:58.531 --> 00:35:03.857\n[LAUGH] And this is just showing\nyou like if you needed to look\n\n655\n00:35:03.857 --> 00:35:08.869\nat it over a period of time,\ntypically Lean Six Sigma.\n\n656\n00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:15.274\nWhere it says year 1, year 2,\nyear 3 would be month 1, month 2, month 3.\n\n657\n00:35:15.274 --> 00:35:16.660\nNow Indirect costs.\n\n658\n00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.860\nPeople's time and effort,\n\n659\n00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.910\nother time opportunity costs you know, so\nsome of those fall in that bucket too.\n\n660\n00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n661\n00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.810\njust things too keep in mind when you're\ncoming up with your cost estimate,\n\n662\n00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.150\nwhat Cherokee is saying is add a buffer.\n\n663\n00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.212\nBecause I'll tell you from personal\nexperience there's always something\n\n664\n00:35:33.212 --> 00:35:33.743\nyou forgot.\n\n665\n00:35:33.743 --> 00:35:37.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, when you're managing the project,\n\n666\n00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.120\nthere are some things that\nyou need to think about.\n\n667\n00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.630\nNow, if you're in the Lean Six Sigma\npart of this program,\n\n668\n00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.110\nthese are really super important.\n\n669\n00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.420\nSo you're gonna see this handout\nin your student package.\n\n670\n00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.640\nWhen you're managing the project, these\nare things that are really important.\n\n671\n00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.330\nA lot of times in lean environments,\nproject managers are brought in.\n\n672\n00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:01.900\nAnd so it's kind of a little\nbit of a separate thing.\n\n673\n00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.820\nAnd then sometimes in 6 Sigma, again,\n\n674\n00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.170\nit's a little bit more numbers and\ngraph related.\n\n675\n00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.180\nBut in Lean Six Sigma, we're looking\nat these things, triple constraints,\n\n676\n00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.540\nwhich we'll look at next.\n\n677\n00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.450\nFive stages, project manager role,\ndecision making structure.\n\n678\n00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.500\nCommunication Plan, Meeting Management,\n\n679\n00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.940\nTeam Development, Navigation of\nOrganizational Politics, these are all\n\n680\n00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.100\nthings that you just wanna think about\nwhen you're managing your project.\n\n681\n00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.960\nSo if you are taking\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam and\n\n682\n00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.980\nyou probably are gonna\nasked all of these things.\n\n683\n00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.860\nBut what are some components\nabout managing your project or\n\n684\n00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.560\nthe question might say something like,\n\n685\n00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.840\ncheck all the boxes that relate\nto managing a project, right?\n\n686\n00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.740\nNow, the triple constraints, and\nthis is kind of a really interesting one,\n\n687\n00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.220\nbecause it used to always be scope,\nresources, time, right?\n\n688\n00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.270\nAnd quality was in the middle.\n\n689\n00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.840\nAnd so now, even though it's\ncalled the triple constraints,\n\n690\n00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.000\nyou're gonna see all kinds of\ndifferent depictions of it.\n\n691\n00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.970\nBut in Lean Six Sigma we're saying\nthe obvious, time, money, resources.\n\n692\n00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.100\nBut you're gonna see scope and\nquality on a lot of different diagrams.\n\n693\n00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.670\nAnd especially if you're doing\nthe Six Sigma exam or the lean exam.\n\n694\n00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.300\nScope and quality play a role.\n\n695\n00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.925\nEven though we say triple,\nthat's already four, right?\n\n696\n00:37:20.925 --> 00:37:23.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In Lean Six Sigma we make it easy.\n\n697\n00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.244\nWe say the triple constraints, the things\nthat you're gonna have to always be\n\n698\n00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:29.331\nlooking at when you're managing that\nproject that you're rolling out and\n\n699\n00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:31.840\nthe bottom part of improve,\nis people, time, resources.\n\n700\n00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:37.767\nAnd risk is another one [LAUGH] of\nthose things that, like I said,\n\n701\n00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.690\nit's got kind of crazy any more.\n\n702\n00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.520\nIt was called the triple constraints, and\n\n703\n00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.430\nnow they've just tried to put\neverything they can on that triangle.\n\n704\n00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.600\nBut I think if you think time, money,\nresources, that pretty much covers you.\n\n705\n00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.830\nNow as a project manager,\nin a traditional project manager role,\n\n706\n00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.670\nthese are the types of things\nthat you would be doing.\n\n707\n00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.580\nSo even though you're not\ntypically a project manager,\n\n708\n00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.950\nin this case you are managing\nthe project for process improvement.\n\n709\n00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.770\nAnd just wanna kind of\nremember what your role is.\n\n710\n00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:09.090\nAnd communicate is a big thing, right.\n\n711\n00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:16.790\nNow we're gonna wrap up this session with\nsomething called the FMEA thinking tool.\n\n712\n00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.305\nAnd I'm gonna have Cherokee help me.\n\n713\n00:38:18.305 --> 00:38:19.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n714\n00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.390\n&gt;&gt; So FMEA stands for\nfailure mode effect analysis.\n\n715\n00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:28.013\nAnd we're gonna look at an FMEA form when\nwe look at control because it's a good\n\n716\n00:38:28.013 --> 00:38:31.321\nform to help sustainability,\nto help us keep on track.\n\n717\n00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:34.727\nBut there is also something\ncalled FMEA Thinking tool,\n\n718\n00:38:34.727 --> 00:38:37.631\nthat you could have actually used and\ndefined.\n\n719\n00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:42.090\nSo, if were trying to come up with\nthe process improvement activity.\n\n720\n00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.900\nI might have used this in Define.\n\n721\n00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.060\nThe way I'm thinking of it right\nnow is I'm trying to mistake-proof\n\n722\n00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:47.918\nmy project plan.\n\n723\n00:38:47.918 --> 00:38:51.310\nSo I'm gonna go through my project\nplan and find out all the things,\n\n724\n00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.160\nalmost like a value stream\nmap kind of thinking,\n\n725\n00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.840\nall the things that absolutely have\nto happen beyond a shadow of doubt.\n\n726\n00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.120\nAnd I'm gonna run them through this FMEA\nThinking tool to make sure I've got my\n\n727\n00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.510\nbasis covered.\n\n728\n00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.895\nBut in order to do that,\nlet's just kind of explain the tool first.\n\n729\n00:39:05.895 --> 00:39:07.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n730\n00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:11.930\nin the FMEA Thinking,\nthis is the middle of an FMEA form.\n\n731\n00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:17.432\nSo I'm gonna take this out of the form and\nI would tackle each tasks individually.\n\n732\n00:39:17.432 --> 00:39:21.640\nSo on an FMEA form, I'd list all\nthe tasks which we're seeing function.\n\n733\n00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.437\nSo another word for\nfunction would be activity or tasks.\n\n734\n00:39:24.437 --> 00:39:27.740\nSo I'm gonna say the function\nis like put gas in the car.\n\n735\n00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:32.600\nOkay, so the potential failure is\nI don't put gas in the car, right?\n\n736\n00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.030\nThe potential effect of the failure is,\nI can't get to work on time,\n\n737\n00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.870\nand the potential cause of\nthe failure is I forgot.\n\n738\n00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.450\nGas Station was closed.\n\n739\n00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.290\nSo what is my current process control?\n\n740\n00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.720\nAnd what that means is what do I\nhave in place right now to keep\n\n741\n00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.150\nthat from happening.\n\n742\n00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:49.890\nNow if I'm in define and\n\n743\n00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:53.130\nI'm looking at the different\ntasks that that department does.\n\n744\n00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.114\nThis is that example where we go and\nthey just say fix the department,\n\n745\n00:39:56.114 --> 00:39:57.459\nwe don't know where to start.\n\n746\n00:39:57.459 --> 00:40:01.776\nSo I look at the major things that that\ndepartment is supposed to be doing.\n\n747\n00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:04.720\nAnd if I got to the current\nprocess control, in other words,\n\n748\n00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.071\nthere's nothing there to keep\nthe bad things from happening, wow,\n\n749\n00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:11.310\nautomatic process improvement opportunity,\nright?\n\n750\n00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.696\nIf I were to use this same\nthinking on my project plan,\n\n751\n00:40:14.696 --> 00:40:18.912\nI would look at task or functions\nthat absolutely have to happen and\n\n752\n00:40:18.912 --> 00:40:22.022\nif they don't happen my\nproject's gonna fail.\n\n753\n00:40:22.022 --> 00:40:26.520\nI run it through this FMEA and whatever\nI came up with Current Process Control,\n\n754\n00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.384\nI make sure I built that\nback into my project plan so\n\n755\n00:40:29.384 --> 00:40:31.540\nthose bad things wouldn't happen.\n\n756\n00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.330\n&gt;&gt; So, maybe it would be a good idea\nif I was working for a company, and\n\n757\n00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:38.310\nwe had truck drivers, and\nthey were making their deliveries.\n\n758\n00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.450\nAnd I had multiple ships\nat the end of that shift,\n\n759\n00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:45.110\nthey would have to fill that tank up,\nsign off on it, and eliminate the need for\n\n760\n00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.430\nthat person coming on to shift\nto even fill up the tank.\n\n761\n00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.510\nThings like that,\nis that what you're looking at here?\n\n762\n00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.510\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so I'm looking at those\nthings, those core tasks that either have\n\n763\n00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:59.760\nto happen on a project report or that just\nhave to happen in a company in general,\n\n764\n00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.930\nand I'm making sure that there\nare some controls in place.\n\n765\n00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.940\nNow, if I were using the same thing in\nmeasure, I might just wanna be checking\n\n766\n00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.640\nthese controls,\nI mean have you been in a situation ever?\n\n767\n00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.240\nI mean I think everyone is gonna say yes\nto this, where there were controls in\n\n768\n00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.340\nplace, there were standard operating\nprocedures, there were standard work,\n\n769\n00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:21.170\nthere were things that we were supposed\nto do but people are like not doing that.\n\n770\n00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n771\n00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:22.660\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n772\n00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:26.160\nin measure if I'm trying to get that clear\nas this picture of where we are today\n\n773\n00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.330\nI might see well how well\nare those controls working?\n\n774\n00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:32.900\nWe wrote it down, is anybody-\n&gt;&gt; Following them.\n\n775\n00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.770\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n776\n00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.200\n&gt;&gt; So I wanna finish up with this\nlittle exercise, and we'll start with\n\n777\n00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.290\njust to kind of get the gist of this,\nwe'll start with one that Cherokee deals\n\n778\n00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.070\nwith I'm sure with her children, and\nI deal with with my grandchildren.\n\n779\n00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.140\nAnd the function would be\nchildren brush their teeth.\n\n780\n00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:49.680\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n781\n00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.520\nthe opposite of that would be\nthe children don't brush their teeth.\n\n782\n00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.679\nSo what do you think are the potential\naffects of that failure?\n\n783\n00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.025\nCavities, teeth rotting out,\ngingivitis, stinky breath.\n\n784\n00:42:01.025 --> 00:42:03.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what do you think are the potential\n\n785\n00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:04.970\ncauses of that failure?\n\n786\n00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.380\nWhy are they not brushing their teeth?\n\n787\n00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.150\nWe tell them all the time.\n\n788\n00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:11.320\n&gt;&gt; They're tired, they're preoccupied.\n\n789\n00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.270\nThey think it's lame.\n\n790\n00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.330\nI don't know.\n\n791\n00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.090\n&gt;&gt; And so what are the controls we have in\nplace now to keep our children brushing\n\n792\n00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.660\ntheir teeth, or in my case my\ngrandchildren brushing their teeth?\n\n793\n00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.380\n&gt;&gt; I have a funny little story about this.\n\n794\n00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm kind of telling on myself.\n\n795\n00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:28.806\nSo I do, I get tired of always being\nthe bad person saying brush your teeth,\n\n796\n00:42:28.806 --> 00:42:29.964\nbrush your teeth.\n\n797\n00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:32.250\nI have to, I'm the mom right?\n\n798\n00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.290\nBut, I don't know if you, guys,\n\n799\n00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.340\nare familiar with these cute little\nseasonal elves, the elf on the shelf?\n\n800\n00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, our elf visited\n\n801\n00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:44.260\nus with some troll hair because there is\na movie that's popular right now, Trolls.\n\n802\n00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:49.320\nAnd he brought all kinds of troll goodies,\ntoothpaste, mouthwash.\n\n803\n00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A new toothbrush, things like that.\n\n804\n00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.520\nSo I'm trying to be innovative.\n\n805\n00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's a perfect control.\n\n806\n00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:01.120\nThat's a perfect control, making things\nfun to do so people will actually do them.\n\n807\n00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.730\nSo even though this is a simple thing.\n\n808\n00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:08.570\nYou can use this for all kinds of\npowerful things like function, preflight\n\n809\n00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:12.100\nis done and that's where they check\nout the airplane before it takes off.\n\n810\n00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.240\nSo, preflight isn't done.\n\n811\n00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.980\nWell, I don't wanna go there because I fly\nall the time, but you kinda get the idea.\n\n812\n00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.668\nThis is something,\nit's a simple tool you can use\n\n813\n00:43:20.668 --> 00:43:23.676\nin Define to figure out what\nyou might wanna work on, but\n\n814\n00:43:23.676 --> 00:43:28.101\nit's also very powerful if you're trying\nto mistake-proof your project plan.\n\n815\n00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:31.770\nSo, I think that pretty much\non my end ends up improved.\n\n816\n00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe've covered a lot in this series.\n\n817\n00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.320\nWe were able to look at things like\nour core project management tools.\n\n818\n00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.150\nWe looked at our triple constraints,\n\n819\n00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.940\nalthough there were\na couple more in there.\n\n820\n00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:48.040\nWe also are able to go ahead and\nlook at our SWAT analysis and really\n\n821\n00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:52.870\nunderstand what would cause a project to\nfail and what causes a project to succeed.\n\n822\n00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.410\nNow, that about wraps it up for\nour improved phase.\n\n823\n00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.490\nWe're gonna continue looking\nat our control phase,\n\n824\n00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:02.930\nsomething that we need to do after we've\nimplemented our concept or our project.\n\n825\n00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.660\nSo stay tuned,\nwe do have that headed your way.\n\n826\n00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:09.000\nI think I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n827\n00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.490\nAs your show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n828\n00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:15.230\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n829\n00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.708\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n830\n00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:24.252\n[MUSIC]\n\n831\n00:44:24.252

00:00:12.067\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:17.670\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Lean Six Sigma Green\nBelt Certification preparation series.\n\n5\n00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.330\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.030\nAnd we're finally at our last phase, which\nis the control phase of the DMAIC model.\n\n7\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.650\nToday we have Dr. Terra Vanzant Stern\nin the studio with us to go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.790\nexplain the last phase.\n\n9\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.250\nSo where are we gonna begin\nin this episode, Doctor?\n\n10\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.893\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're gonna start with control,\nand if we could just go to my slide deck.\n\n11\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.619\nNow, in this session we're obviously\ngonna look at the Role Control Plays in\n\n12\n00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:50.260\nthe DMAIC process, and we're gonna talk\nabout popular tools used in Control.\n\n13\n00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.900\nNow I wanna remind everyone define,\nmeasure and\n\n14\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.100\nanalyze are incredibly creative.\n\n15\n00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.179\nAnd then you get to improve and it stops\nbeing a creative process because what I\n\n16\n00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.877\nhave to do is introduce my\nthree to five solutions,\n\n17\n00:01:02.877 --> 00:01:05.414\nI've got to figure out\nwhich one I'm gonna do.\n\n18\n00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:11.000\nI piloted, I roll out my project plan but\nI'm not really and I get to leave prove.\n\n19\n00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.250\nI get to come over here to control when\nI can show an improvement has been made.\n\n20\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.770\nBut the project doesn't\nreally over Cherokee,\n\n21\n00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.590\nbecause there's all kinds of close\nout things that we have to do.\n\n22\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.318\nAnd we have to do one of the most\nimportant things in the DMAIC model which\n\n23\n00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:26.071\nis right a sustainability plan.\n\n24\n00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:32.050\nI did all this work I spend all this time\nin define, measure, analyze and improve I\n\n25\n00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.044\nnow wanna make sure that whatever process\nimprovement I out in place stays there.\n\n26\n00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.771\nSo, when you think about the control plan,\none of the things\n\n27\n00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.250\nI want you to think about is that\nhas lot to do with your audience.\n\n28\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.620\nNow, when you do a DMAIC project, for\nexample for my company for SSG Global,\n\n29\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.440\nyou have to assumes that your instructor\nreally doesn't know your business.\n\n30\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.360\nSo, sometimes you have to do a little\nbit more robust control plan.\n\n31\n00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960\nBut bottom line,\nif you're gonna keep the process yourself\n\n32\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.250\nyou might just be writing\nyourself a few notes.\n\n33\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.630\nIf you're gonna pass it over to\nsomeone like your IT person,\n\n34\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.360\nyou're gonna pass it over\nto another IT person.\n\n35\n00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.690\nMaybe that sustainability,\nhow to keep this process in control\n\n36\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.830\nmight be kind of short,\nbecause they understand your environment.\n\n37\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.925\nBut, let's say you're an IT person and\nyou're going to hand this process\n\n38\n00:02:22.925 --> 00:02:27.297\nimprovement over to manage to keep it\nin control, to say, the office manager.\n\n39\n00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:28.990\n&gt;&gt; Sure, it needs to be very detailed.\n\n40\n00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.140\n&gt;&gt; It needs to be very detailed.\n\n41\n00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.628\nIt might need to be so detailed that you\nsay press this button and if this happens,\n\n42\n00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:36.345\ncall Sam, that kind of thing.\n\n43\n00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:41.259\nSo, the control portion of the DMAIC\nreport, depends a lot on your audience.\n\n44\n00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.830\nNow, there's basically three\nparts to that control.\n\n45\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.160\nWhat did you do and, why should they care?\n\n46\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.268\nThat's your paragraph one.\n\n47\n00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:54.066\nI set out to do this, this is what I did,\nthis is what I made, saved,\n\n48\n00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.113\nor avoided spending in dollars and cents.\n\n49\n00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:01.830\nNow, if you used return on investment in\nyour before picture which is measure.\n\n50\n00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.570\nAnd then again you'll used\nreturn on investment or\n\n51\n00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.690\nany financial metric in improve.\n\n52\n00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.030\nYou can just transfer that number over.\n\n53\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.670\nHowever, if you used to control chart and\nyou just wanted to show in the before\n\n54\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.210\npicture that the data points were all\nover and that they're out of control.\n\n55\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.490\nAnd then in your improved picture,\n\n56\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.490\nyou showed that the data points were\nmoving closer to that middle line.\n\n57\n00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.300\nThe person that you're reporting\nto might say, well, that's nice,\n\n58\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.450\nbut what does it mean to me?\n\n59\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.180\nWhat did it make me, save me,\nor avoid me spending?\n\n60\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.580\nSame thing with sigma.\n\n61\n00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.220\nSigma is a very popular measurement, but\nlet's say you're working with a group of\n\n62\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.090\npeople that don't\nparticularly bond with sigma.\n\n63\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.030\nSo let's say you were\n3.2 sigma in measure and\n\n64\n00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.140\nat the end of your improve\nstory you were at 3.6.\n\n65\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.682\nWell, you know statistically\nthat you've improved but\n\n66\n00:03:49.682 --> 00:03:54.129\nagain your supervisor might say,\nwell that's nice you\n\n67\n00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.461\nwent up a some point, some-\n&gt;&gt; How does that directly effect me.\n\n68\n00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:59.388\n&gt;&gt; Effect me, exactly.\n\n69\n00:03:59.388 --> 00:04:02.060\nHow does that, what did that do to me?\n\n70\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.180\nWhat did you make me,\nsave me, or avoid spending?\n\n71\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.580\nSo sometimes that first paragraph\nis an easy thing to do.\n\n72\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.730\nAnd sometimes not so easy, because you're\ntrying to translate over the benefit.\n\n73\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.200\nWhat'd did make you save\nyour avoid spending.\n\n74\n00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.060\nThe middle part of this report\nshould be your sustainability.\n\n75\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.792\nAnd that's just your communication plan or\nyour transition plan,\n\n76\n00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.416\nhow do you keep this\nparticular thing in place?\n\n77\n00:04:25.416 --> 00:04:28.826\nAnd just like we said when we opened,\nit might be a simple report,\n\n78\n00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:30.810\nit might be really difficult report.\n\n79\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.985\nIt just sorta depends on\nwho your audiences is.\n\n80\n00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.510\nAnd then finally just close up things,\n\n81\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.340\nwhen you close a project there are just\nthings you need to do to close it out.\n\n82\n00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.469\nSo that's what we gonna talk about.\n\n83\n00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.837\nNow, in the Control Phase\non the Six Sigma exams,\n\n84\n00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:51.270\na lot of times these are the key points.\n\n85\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.180\nNow remember on the Lean exams,\nsince they don't work with the DMAIC\n\n86\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.590\nprocess you're not gonna\nget these questions.\n\n87\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.610\nOn the Lean Six Sigma exam,\nit's pretty simple.\n\n88\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.801\nWe're gonna be asking you what are the\nthree components of a Control Phase.\n\n89\n00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:06.812\nAnd we're gonna say those three\ncomponents says, we have to give\n\n90\n00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:10.204\nyou the financial benefit, we have to\ntell you how to keep it in place, and\n\n91\n00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.190\nwe have to do closeout activities.\n\n92\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.040\nThose are the main things that\nthe Lean Six Sigma tests are gonna\n\n93\n00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.690\nwanna know about Control.\n\n94\n00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.750\nBut, on the Six Sigma side, they're gonna\nwanna know the things that are bulleted\n\n95\n00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.500\nout here, that are also included\nin your student package.\n\n96\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.670\nSo, there's a little bit\nmore attention paid to this\n\n97\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.850\nin Six Sigma environments, because\nthey're working in large environments.\n\n98\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.095\nSometimes there's even a control plan\ntemplate that they want you to use.\n\n99\n00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:39.880\nSo this is the way you\nclose out that project.\n\n100\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.990\nSo, just kind of glance at these if you\nare taking the Six Sigma only test.\n\n101\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.800\nThis is another one of those\nplaces in the student packet\n\n102\n00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.190\nthat you might wanna concentrate on.\n\n103\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.250\nNow, CONTROL Tools,\nthe first one is a cost/benefit analysis.\n\n104\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.050\nSo let's say I didn't use anything to\ndo with money, which is very common.\n\n105\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.660\nI didn't use a money metric in measure, so\nin Improve I didn't use a money metric.\n\n106\n00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.480\nSo maybe in Measure I used a histogram,\nlet say Pareto chart.\n\n107\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.290\nI used a Pareto chart in Measure and\nthen I went to Improve and\n\n108\n00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.640\nI showed that the Pareto chart\ncompletely collapsed at most of\n\n109\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.530\nthe biggest thing that we\nhad going wrong for us.\n\n110\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.490\nSo, I don't really know how to get\nto that dollar and cent argument.\n\n111\n00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.200\nSo one of the things I can do is\nthe cost benefit analysis, and\n\n112\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.340\nfortunately that template is\navailable on the student page.\n\n113\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.570\nAnd that just says,\nhere was everything that it cost, and\n\n114\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.290\nit just gives you some clues\nof things to think about.\n\n115\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.880\nLike you might not have thought about\nsomething like office supplies, right?\n\n116\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.866\nSo it's just a brainstorming thing\nthat helps you calculate your cost.\n\n117\n00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:48.980\nAnd then the benefit side are gonna say,\nhow did it directly benefit?\n\n118\n00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.549\nSo that's something that I can use.\n\n119\n00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.210\nAnother control tool is something\ncalled Standard Operating Procedures,\n\n120\n00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.390\nsometimes those are just called policies.\n\n121\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.210\nSometimes that might include\nthings like standard work.\n\n122\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.070\nThe Internal Communication plan and\nthe Communication Plan Strategy,\n\n123\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.730\nsometimes you wanna think of those,\nit depends.\n\n124\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.220\nIf you have a lot of client interface,\nyour Internal Communication Plan about\n\n125\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.600\nwhat you did might be slightly different\nthan the one you send out to everyone.\n\n126\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.168\nThen you want a training plan for\nsustainability and\n\n127\n00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:27.648\nthat's just to keep that process in place.\n\n128\n00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:31.020\nYou may need it, you may not,\ndepends on who gets the project.\n\n129\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.595\nVisual Pocess Controls is another one.\n\n130\n00:07:33.595 --> 00:07:37.615\nThen at some point, and we talked\nabout this a little in Improve because\n\n131\n00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:42.960\nsometimes you have to do this at the end\nof Improve, is you project presentation.\n\n132\n00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.005\nAnd then, when we talk about project\nreplication in standard work,\n\n133\n00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:51.065\nif this is a repeatable, this is\nsomething you might wanna write up.\n\n134\n00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:55.320\nWe're gonna be doing this project once\na month or something very, very similar.\n\n135\n00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.819\nSo you might want to think about those.\n\n136\n00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:59.033\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Multiple sites.\n\n137\n00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:00.644\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And it works so well at this location.\n\n138\n00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:03.316\nWe're gonna role it out\nto all of our locations.\n\n139\n00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.080\nExactly, exactly.\n\n140\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.518\nOkay so if we go back to the first part,\nwhat did you do and why did they care,\n\n141\n00:08:09.518 --> 00:08:10.020\nright?\n\n142\n00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.514\nThat's that first thing.\n\n143\n00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:14.645\nWhat did you make, save,\nor avoid spending.\n\n144\n00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:19.623\nOne of the things I wanna point out is\nagain, if you're giving your project to\n\n145\n00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:24.308\nsomeone, a couple of notches up on\nthe hierarchy, up on the food chain.\n\n146\n00:08:24.308 --> 00:08:27.870\nYou might have to give them a little\nhistory on why this was important.\n\n147\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.760\nThey might not really\nunderstand your work area.\n\n148\n00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.040\nSo, let's say your sponsor\nis your bosses bosses boss.\n\n149\n00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.945\nSo, when you say this is what I made,\nsaved or avoided spending,\n\n150\n00:08:38.945 --> 00:08:43.358\nin that paragraph that you say, this\nis what I did and this was the result.\n\n151\n00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:47.610\nYou might wanna include a little history\nof why that was such an important process.\n\n152\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.270\nAnd again,\nthat's just kind of a judgement call.\n\n153\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.120\nSo then when you move and\nthen again you might,\n\n154\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.690\nif you're having trouble articulating\nwhat it was that was the benefit.\n\n155\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.030\nYou might want to use\na cost benefit analysis.\n\n156\n00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.300\nAnd this gives you some other ideas.\n\n157\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.717\nBut there's much more on the actual sheet.\n\n158\n00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:13.865\nOne of the things that you might want\nto do when you move to step two Is that\n\n159\n00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:17.188\nyou might wanna make sure\nthat you're already following\n\n160\n00:09:17.188 --> 00:09:20.463\nwhatever standard operating\nprocedures are in place.\n\n161\n00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:23.890\nBut you might also want to write them\nas part of the sustainability plan.\n\n162\n00:09:26.246 --> 00:09:29.809\nSo when you're writing\na standard operating procedure,\n\n163\n00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:34.180\nkeeping in mind this is stuff that\nwould be included in the second part.\n\n164\n00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.625\nSo the first part, what I did, why.\n\n165\n00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:39.943\nAnd then sometimes you might even have,\nbefore you go to part two,\n\n166\n00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:41.898\nif there were any ancillary benefits,\n\n167\n00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:46.360\nsome just kind of delighters, some things\nthat you weren't expecting to happen.\n\n168\n00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.803\nYou might want to include that as sort\nof a, by the way we did this, but\n\n169\n00:09:50.803 --> 00:09:54.061\nas a result there were these\nextra things we gave you.\n\n170\n00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:54.690\n&gt;&gt; That just happened.\n\n171\n00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that just happened.\n\n172\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.820\nSo when I move into part two,\nstandard operating procedures could\n\n173\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.820\nplay a dual role or no role at all.\n\n174\n00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.200\nSo the dual role might be that there is\nan SOP I'm supposed to be following and\n\n175\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.370\nI'm developing or\ncreating another SOP, right?\n\n176\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.440\nOr, I might want to be\ntrying to follow that.\n\n177\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.217\nSo just kind of keep in the mind the goal\nof a standard operating procedure is to\n\n178\n00:10:22.217 --> 00:10:24.495\nachieve efficiency, uniformity,\n\n179\n00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:27.960\nreduce miscommunication,\ncomply with the industry.\n\n180\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.020\nSo I might be trying to follow one, or\nI might be creating one or tweaking one.\n\n181\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.120\nSo, that's like triple role, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.830\nBut just something to keep in mind.\n\n183\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.561\nNow, the format of an SOP,\nif you're stuck with developing one or\n\n184\n00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:44.635\nlet's say you have the opportunity\nto develop an SOP.\n\n185\n00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:45.433\nThere's a,\n\n186\n00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:50.320\nyou know what you're trying to do is\ntell people what should happen right?\n\n187\n00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.577\nAnd you can do a step by step approach.\n\n188\n00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:55.890\nYou can say step one,\nstep two, step three.\n\n189\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.780\nYou could take a WBS approach, I'm gonna\nshow you this SOP what you should be doing\n\n190\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.050\nin this procedure by following\nthis work breakdown structure.\n\n191\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.610\nOr you could use a flow chart.\n\n192\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.680\nIf it's a simple enough procedure,\nsometimes a flow chart's a better deal if\n\n193\n00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.037\nyou're trying to get\npeople to follow this.\n\n194\n00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:13.110\nAnd keep in mind,\n\n195\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:18.150\nwe're talking about SOPs in context\nof the actual process improvement.\n\n196\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.030\nIf there's SOP's already in place, you may\nwant to be looking at those in define.\n\n197\n00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.299\nBecause you wouldn't want to\nget all the way to improve, and\n\n198\n00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:28.223\nget ready to roll out your project,\n\n199\n00:11:28.223 --> 00:11:32.028\nand you haven't paid attention to\nsome compliance issue or some SOP.\n\n200\n00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:35.447\nSo when we're talking about SOP's\nin control, we're talking about,\n\n201\n00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:36.970\nhave I followed the procedure?\n\n202\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.540\nDo I need to develop another procedure\nas part of my sustainability?\n\n203\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.260\nNow, part of that is your\ncommunication plan, and\n\n204\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.675\nyou wanna kind of think\nof a transition plan.\n\n205\n00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:48.120\nAnd this is internal.\n\n206\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.520\nSo I'm gonna tell you how to keep\nthat process in place, right?\n\n207\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.700\nAnd if I think about it,\nkind of, the way I think\n\n208\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.790\nabout it is if I were leaving a job and\nI'm not gonna be available.\n\n209\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.640\nI'm gonna be in some igloo in Alaska and\nhave no phone service, right?\n\n210\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.800\nWhat would they need to know\nto keep that job going?\n\n211\n00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.600\nSo if you kind of think of that and so you\ncan fall back on some just regular human\n\n212\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.580\nresource templates like job transition\ntemplates if you're having trouble\n\n213\n00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.890\nthinking what should I put in there.\n\n214\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.340\nYou want to provide this\ninformation quickly and accurately.\n\n215\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.290\nAnd it's designed to increase\nproductivity and overall performance.\n\n216\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.170\nIt helps with employee retention because\nif I get stuck handling your process\n\n217\n00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.987\nimprovement and\nI don't know what it is you're doing.\n\n218\n00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:35.478\nThe process improvement's\ngonna go down and\n\n219\n00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:37.649\nI might not even stay with the company.\n\n220\n00:12:37.649 --> 00:12:39.850\n&gt;&gt; Moral, yeah.\n\n221\n00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.195\n&gt;&gt; So when you're thinking of\ntypes of communication plans.\n\n222\n00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:47.875\nCertainly, one communication plan is\nhow to keep this process in place.\n\n223\n00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:52.205\nBut there's also strategic and\npromotional and education plans.\n\n224\n00:12:52.205 --> 00:12:56.370\nNow strategic would be something\nstrategic and educational.\n\n225\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.170\nWould be the kinds of\ncommunication plans that you would\n\n226\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.150\ninclude in your transition\nplan on an internal basis.\n\n227\n00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.362\nBut you want to remember if you\nhave improved a process there\n\n228\n00:13:06.362 --> 00:13:07.656\nmay be an opportunity.\n\n229\n00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:11.409\nMaybe not, but there may be a promotional\nopportunity where you can go out to\n\n230\n00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:15.060\nthe public or to your client and\nsay look what we've done for you.\n\n231\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.000\nRight, and so that's a different\nkind of communication plan.\n\n232\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.460\nSo just kind of keep in mind-\n&gt;&gt; New and improved product.\n\n233\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so you want to kinda\nkeep all of that stuff in mind.\n\n234\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.874\nThat there's different types of\ncommunication plans, but to be lean,\n\n235\n00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:32.917\nthere's probably components from\nall of them that you can use.\n\n236\n00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:37.905\nSo if you were building a comprehensive\nsustainability plan, keeping in mind\n\n237\n00:13:37.905 --> 00:13:42.817\nagain, it's just like when you leave\ndefine you might know what to measure,\n\n238\n00:13:42.817 --> 00:13:47.000\nyou might not have to use any\nof those measure tools, right?\n\n239\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.267\nWhen you leave analyze, for example,\n\n240\n00:13:49.267 --> 00:13:54.078\nyou might have such a good take on those\nthree solutions, three to five solutions,\n\n241\n00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:57.391\nyou don't need any of those\ntools to rethink it, right?\n\n242\n00:13:57.391 --> 00:13:58.910\nWell it's the same kind of thing.\n\n243\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.310\nIf you know your sustainability plan and\nyou're feeling really good,\n\n244\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.790\nthey need to press this button on Friday,\nthen you don't need this help.\n\n245\n00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.890\nBut this is something that's there\nIn case you're trying to think,\n\n246\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.770\nwell, what would I build\nin my sustainability plan?\n\n247\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:17.630\nAnd you see these bullets have a lot of\nwhite space on purpose because we want,\n\n248\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.362\nthese are just ways that\nyou could approach it.\n\n249\n00:14:20.362 --> 00:14:22.080\nAnd in a lot of times, it just depends.\n\n250\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.198\nSometimes, just reminding people of things\nlike the mission and vision will help\n\n251\n00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:29.790\nwith the sustainability plan\nespecially in non profit environments.\n\n252\n00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:34.236\nA lot of times you'll see in a\nsustainability plan you'll see references\n\n253\n00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:35.680\nto this kind of things.\n\n254\n00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.640\nJust to say to kinda put that extra\nelement like we all wanna do a good\n\n255\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.800\njob and we all wanna stick to doing these\nthings because remember our vision and\n\n256\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.860\nour values.\n\n257\n00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.770\nSo just these are kinds of,\nthese are just key words.\n\n258\n00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.030\nThis is a handout in your student packet.\n\n259\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.250\nThe key words you kind to remember when\nyou're building this Sustainability Plan.\n\n260\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.931\nSo, when you're putting\nout the communications and\n\n261\n00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:01.950\nthe communications in\nmy Sustainability Plan.\n\n262\n00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.900\nWhich could also, these things could also\ninclude our external Communication Plan if\n\n263\n00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.180\nwe wanted to do something promotional,\nif we wanted to do something educational.\n\n264\n00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.290\nSo kinda think in that middle\npart of the control plan.\n\n265\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.470\nFirst part, what I did for\nyou, why you care.\n\n266\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.160\nThis is what I saved, made,\nor avoided you spending.\n\n267\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.120\nSecond part, how to keep it in place.\n\n268\n00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.020\nAnd that can have a lot\nof different components.\n\n269\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.690\nAnd some of the out comes of\nthose components could help\n\n270\n00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.240\nyou with your customers or\npromotions right?\n\n271\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.390\nSo when I'm doing any kind\nof communication plan,\n\n272\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:39.210\neven though we're specifically kind of\ntalking about how to communicate how to\n\n273\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:43.580\nkeep this process in place, any\ncommunication plan will benefit from this.\n\n274\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.652\nWhat do you want them to know?\n\n275\n00:15:45.652 --> 00:15:46.905\nWhat do you want them to think?\n\n276\n00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.649\nWhat do you want them to do?\n\n277\n00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:51.144\nWhy should you care?\n\n278\n00:15:51.144 --> 00:15:52.870\nHow does it affect me?\n\n279\n00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.130\nTailor them, but\navoid contradictions and false promises.\n\n280\n00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.815\nThat's something that we want to remember.\n\n281\n00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:01.428\nStatistics in case studies,\nsometimes really helps.\n\n282\n00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:03.796\nThird party endorsements.\n\n283\n00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:06.304\nIn the case of an internal\nsustainability plan,\n\n284\n00:16:06.304 --> 00:16:10.360\nthe fact that your CEO is really\nhappy about this, doesn't hurt.\n\n285\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.190\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yea, those are all great topics or\n\n286\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.490\ngreat tips, I should say.\n\n287\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.030\nEspecially when you go to the one,\n\n288\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.660\nI really like the one\nabout the false promise.\n\n289\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.730\nI have this little quote\nthat I heard somewhere.\n\n290\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.040\nIt was under promise over produce.\n\n291\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.630\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n292\n00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.525\nAnd I think Lean would endorse that for\nsure.\n\n293\n00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:29.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now\n\n294\n00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.490\nthese are nine steps in\nthe training process.\n\n295\n00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.870\nAgain, this is a handout\nin your student packet.\n\n296\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.250\nAnd, this is really not so\nmuch for the exam.\n\n297\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.570\nThis is just if you need to fall back\non like, my goodness, in order to\n\n298\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.610\nsustain this improvement, I'm gonna\nhave to put on a whole training plan.\n\n299\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.040\nAnd that happens sometimes,\nend user training.\n\n300\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.850\nI come up with a process, it's perfect,\nI've got it rolled out but\n\n301\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.080\nnow I've got to train everyone\non how to do this process.\n\n302\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.020\nAnd it might even be something simple.\n\n303\n00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.740\nBut these are the nine steps\nthat are usually included.\n\n304\n00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.100\nAnd again I kind of want to\nthink of this as bonus material.\n\n305\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.330\nTypically on a Lean Six Sigma exam and\ncertainly on your Six Sigma and\n\n306\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.780\nLean exams you're not gonna have\na lot of questions about training.\n\n307\n00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.740\nIt's just kind of bonus material.\n\n308\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.240\n&gt;&gt; Thanks.\n\n309\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.290\nSo when you're thinking about training\nthere's also some considerations that you\n\n310\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.530\nwanna keep in mind.\n\n311\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.850\nAnd in this context,\n\n312\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.190\nI'm saying these are considerations\nto keep that process in place.\n\n313\n00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.220\nAnd one of the biggest ones is having\nhandouts, can you believe that?\n\n314\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.430\nIt's just like I tell you all\nof this stuff, but it's so\n\n315\n00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.780\nnice that after I give you a presentation\nif I just give you something,\n\n316\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.860\nI just hand you something and\nsay, this is what we're doing.\n\n317\n00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.530\nThat kind of reinforces it.\n\n318\n00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.460\nNow obviously if you're gonna do training,\nthat's gonna be part of\n\n319\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.300\nyour sustainability plan, you have to\nconsider things like time and location.\n\n320\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.210\nYou want to make sure that people under,\n\n321\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.000\nthey're not gonna come to your training\nsession if they don't understand why.\n\n322\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.700\nAnd a lot of times, I think we think of\ntraining sessions as being really long,\n\n323\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.580\nit might just be five minute presentation.\n\n324\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.640\nAnd you don't wanna get too much and\n\n325\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.010\nyou want everyone if you\ncan if it's important.\n\n326\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.280\nTo sustain in that process you wanna get\neveryone a little chance to practice\n\n327\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.250\neven if it's kinda a mock practice.\n\n328\n00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and a lot of times we also\nsee a lot of role based training\n\n329\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.380\nbecause it might slightly different from\none department to another just their\n\n330\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.510\nparticular role within\nthat entire process.\n\n331\n00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:27.890\nSo they don't like with the just,\n\n332\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.920\nyou don't want to give\nthem the entire process.\n\n333\n00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.130\nSometimes you do but\n\n334\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.540\nsometimes you really just wanna focus\nin what it is that they're doing.\n\n335\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and then when we're\ntalking about sustainability,\n\n336\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.910\nwe don't want to forget about the visual\nprocess control signs and markers.\n\n337\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.650\nBecause sometimes you don't have to write\n\n338\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.430\na long sustainability plan you\ncan just show them a sign, right?\n\n339\n00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:56.520\nAnd so that the goal a Visual Controls and\nthis is something that comes up.\n\n340\n00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.035\nAnd it's almost they way its worded\nin Lean and in lean six sigma, not so\n\n341\n00:19:01.035 --> 00:19:04.995\nmuch in the six sigma exams, is what\nis the purpose of a visual control?\n\n342\n00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:08.035\nWell the purpose is that\nit's self-regulating,\n\n343\n00:19:08.035 --> 00:19:10.745\nlike a traffic light\nwould be self explaining.\n\n344\n00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:15.375\nIt's self-improving, it's something that\nI don't have to write a report about,\n\n345\n00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:18.300\nI can just show you a sign and\nyou get the idea.\n\n346\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.250\nAnd examples of control, visual controls,\nwe have all kinds of examples,\n\n347\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.510\nred lights on our DVR,\ndifferent colored clothing for\n\n348\n00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.340\nfootball teams,\npainted lines on the freeway.\n\n349\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.432\nI know you could read this.\n&gt;&gt; Lights on your charging cord.\n\n350\n00:19:31.432 --> 00:19:31.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n351\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.310\n&gt;&gt; I like lights of my charging cord.\n\n352\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.440\nSo visual controls are a really big deal.\n\n353\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.740\nOther Visual Controls that\nyou might use however,\n\n354\n00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.700\nthroughout your Lean Six Sigma project.\n\n355\n00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.990\nTakt Boards and remember Takt\nwas the customer demand time,\n\n356\n00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.110\nhow fast does the customer\nneed that issues Board,\n\n357\n00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.040\nI'm writing down the issues so\nwe don't forget them.\n\n358\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.800\n5S Boards,\nwhich 5S is a physical organization\n\n359\n00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.980\nkind of plan on how to keep us organized.\n\n360\n00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.260\nKanban Cards.\n\n361\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.400\nSo I want you to kind of think\noutside your normal parameters\n\n362\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.769\nof what are visual controls.\n\n363\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.370\nHere is a great visual control,\nat the vet's office, I love this one.\n\n364\n00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n365\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.810\n&gt;&gt; So, I know where I'm\nsupposed to take my dog, right?\n\n366\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.380\n&gt;&gt; It just reminded me of like\nfollow the yellow brick road.\n\n367\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like absolutely.\n\n368\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.340\n&gt;&gt; And this is, visual controls can be\nreally simple, this is just labeling.\n\n369\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.570\nI don't know if you can see that\npicture as well as we can see it.\n\n370\n00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.150\nBut this is just labeling, so you know,\nthat's where I'm gonna put those files.\n\n371\n00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.510\nAnd visual controls maybe all you need\nto keep your process sustainable And\n\n372\n00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:53.090\nyou just wanna make sure that you\ndon't have useless controls like\n\n373\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.250\ncaution water on road during rain.\n\n374\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:56.200\n&gt;&gt; No way.\n\n375\n00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.180\n&gt;&gt; I told you, I think I told\neveryone I love signs that have them.\n\n376\n00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.330\n&gt;&gt; I do, I like these.\n\n377\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.280\n&gt;&gt; You wanna use your controls wisely.\n\n378\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.670\nNotice no signs allowed\nat this intersection.\n\n379\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.209\nI mean, that's kind of crazy, right.\n\n380\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.340\nAlright so I wanna,\n[LAUGH] I saw this really this funny one\n\n381\n00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.330\nI went to go teach a class at\nthe university of Virginia and someone\n\n382\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.790\nhad posted on like a constructed area they\nwere redoing the front storefront and\n\n383\n00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:27.620\nit said no flyers posted here [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the students were so clever.\n\n384\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.910\nThey went and took photos of birds that\nweren't able to fly such as penguins.\n\n385\n00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.050\nAnd they posted it all\non that store front.\n\n386\n00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.690\nAnd it was just pretty comical.\n\n387\n00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.710\n&gt;&gt; That is too funny.\n\n388\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.851\nThat is too funny, yeah, so yeah.\n\n389\n00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:43.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's cute,\n\n390\n00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:48.350\nso I wanted\n&gt;&gt; Wrap up by saying that the last thing,\n\n391\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.410\nwe'll we're gonna look at an FMEA form.\n\n392\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.350\nWe looked at FMEA thinking\nbecause this is a great way to\n\n393\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.740\nmake sure that your\nprocess stays sustainable.\n\n394\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.680\nAnd that's where we're gonna end up today.\n\n395\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.510\nBut I wanna talk a little bit quickly\nabout the last phase of control.\n\n396\n00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.090\nSo first phase, what did you do for\nme and why do I care?\n\n397\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.300\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou wanna say the process improvement, and\n\n398\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.210\nyou wanna say how does it matter.\n\n399\n00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.350\nWhat did you make, save,\nor avoid spending.\n\n400\n00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.630\nThe biggest part of control is how to\nkeep that process control in place, and\n\n401\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.820\nthe last part just goes back to\nregular project management closeout.\n\n402\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.980\nSo I always think having a party's good.\n\n403\n00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.520\n&gt;&gt; I agree.\n&gt;&gt; Celebrating.\n\n404\n00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.670\n&gt;&gt; Especially if you're gonna be working\nwith that team on a consistent basis,\n\n405\n00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.750\nyou want them to come back and\nwork with you again, right?\n\n406\n00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.622\nCelebrate a job well done.\n\n407\n00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:36.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n408\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.940\nSo that's a thing to close out.\n\n409\n00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.420\nYou wanna make sure that\neveryone that was involved.\n\n410\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.650\nHas got the notice that this\npart of the project is over.\n\n411\n00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.180\nI have a funny story,\nI think I told that last time as well.\n\n412\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.600\nI worked with a group that was working\nactually on a big process improvement and\n\n413\n00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.390\nwe met every Tuesday morning at 9\no'clock and sometimes I'm travelling so\n\n414\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.180\nI'd have to call in to the meeting.\n\n415\n00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:05.360\nThe project was over, we have this\ngreat party, we gave awards, and\n\n416\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.610\nthen that Tuesday I was in another\ncity and I got this emergency call,\n\n417\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.400\nwe're waiting for you,\nyou've never missed a meeting.\n\n418\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.060\nAnd I thought the project, I thought it\nwas pretty clear the project was over and\n\n419\n00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.410\nit's like well, we wanna work\non another project we can but\n\n420\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.950\nthere's no reason to keep meeting now on\nTuesday mornings in the conference room.\n\n421\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.790\nSo we have to make sure\nthat the project's over.\n\n422\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.780\nAnd some times the best way\nto do that is to go back and\n\n423\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.620\nlook at that side pog, who were all\nthe people that touched the project?\n\n424\n00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.860\nAnd make sure that they at least get an\nemail You know if they weren't included in\n\n425\n00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.680\nthe celebration because some people\nmight have had a small ancillary part.\n\n426\n00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.000\nWe just wanna make sure.\n\n427\n00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.133\nWe also wanna make sure that\nwe've done a presentation.\n\n428\n00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:50.132\nWe've told people if we didn't do that\npresentation already and improve and\n\n429\n00:23:50.132 --> 00:23:52.173\nthere's some ways that we can do that.\n\n430\n00:23:52.173 --> 00:23:55.020\nWe can do a storyboard,\nwe can do a case study,\n\n431\n00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.327\nit doesn't necessarily always have\nto be a formal report because some\n\n432\n00:23:59.327 --> 00:24:02.984\npeople have a lot of trouble\ndoing formal reports, right?\n\n433\n00:24:02.984 --> 00:24:04.814\nSo those are the three components.\n\n434\n00:24:04.814 --> 00:24:08.162\nBut I'd like to go back and\nfinish up with the FMEA form,\n\n435\n00:24:08.162 --> 00:24:11.150\njust because this is\na really popular form.\n\n436\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.140\nThere are industry versions of this form.\n\n437\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.392\nSo, hospital, aerospace, retail.\n\n438\n00:24:19.392 --> 00:24:22.250\nHowever, some people just\nmake up their own form.\n\n439\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.100\nBut they almost always have,\n\n440\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.000\nin the middle of the form,\nthat part that we did with FMEA thinking.\n\n441\n00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.420\nWhat's the function, what would happen if\nit went wrong, what are the ramifications?\n\n442\n00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.980\nWhat controls do we have in place\nto keep that from happening?\n\n443\n00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:40.090\nThe difference with an FMEA form, and\nthe reason why it's a good form to\n\n444\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:45.190\nuse in control, that you can either\nmake up, you can use our template,\n\n445\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.040\nyou can use an industry standard template,\nis that it keeps everything on track.\n\n446\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.630\nBecause one of the things that\nthe FMEA form does that FMEA thinking\n\n447\n00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:59.130\ndoesn't do is it has sign-offs, like,\nwho's in charge of this process control.\n\n448\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.750\nAnd it doesn't just have sign-offs.\n\n449\n00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.814\nIt says, okay, I'm gonna take\nresponsibility for this area,\n\n450\n00:25:03.814 --> 00:25:06.870\nand then after I complete it,\nI have to sign off again.\n\n451\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.130\nI'm sure a lot of you have been in\na situation where someone said they were\n\n452\n00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.848\ngonna do something and they didn't.\n\n453\n00:25:11.848 --> 00:25:12.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Never.\n\n454\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.870\n&gt;&gt; So\nit's that extra later of accountability.\n\n455\n00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.270\nAnother thing that's really\npopular with FMEA forms\n\n456\n00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:23.730\nis they give us some information\nabout our risk priority number.\n\n457\n00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.480\nAnd our risk priority number\nis just what it says.\n\n458\n00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.200\nHow bad is it if this doesn't happen,\nright?\n\n459\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.320\nNow, generally speaking, we look at\nseverity, we look at occurrence,\n\n460\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.390\nwhich just means how often\nis it happening now.\n\n461\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:42.150\nAnd we look at detection, how likely\nare we to know that that's gonna happen.\n\n462\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.329\nSo if I look at a risk, I could be looking\nat a risk on a scale from one to five.\n\n463\n00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:47.448\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n464\n00:25:47.448 --> 00:25:49.046\n&gt;&gt; Or one to ten, right?\n\n465\n00:25:49.046 --> 00:25:52.950\nAnd I could say number\none is the worst thing.\n\n466\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:58.681\nThe EPAs old schedule used to say that you\nhad to die before you got a number one.\n\n467\n00:25:58.681 --> 00:25:59.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n468\n00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.452\n&gt;&gt; Now the EPA says that any risk\nto a worker, any physical risk,\n\n469\n00:26:03.452 --> 00:26:05.720\nis the number one, right?\n\n470\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.550\nSo even those schedules kind of change.\n\n471\n00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.310\nOccurrence, that would be a metric.\n\n472\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.950\nI would actually go and\ncount how often is it happening now.\n\n473\n00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.670\nAnd then detection,\non a scale back to one to five,\n\n474\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.470\nhow likely are we to know\nthat that risk might occur?\n\n475\n00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.425\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And so I multiply those together,\n\n476\n00:26:23.425 --> 00:26:27.041\nand it doesn't really, it technically\nwouldn't really matter if we added them.\n\n477\n00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:32.310\nBut the formula is, we multiply\nthose together and we get a number.\n\n478\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.110\nNow, in sigma,\nwe're trying to make that number higher.\n\n479\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:43.420\nIf I'm in measure, and I get a sigma of 3,\nI wanna start making it 3.1 or 3.2.\n\n480\n00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.560\nIf I get a risk priority number,\n\n481\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.810\non the other hand, in measure,\nI'm trying to lower that number, right?\n\n482\n00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.330\nSo, this FMEA does a bunch of things.\n\n483\n00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.441\nThe other thing is that, in FMEA thinking,\n\n484\n00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:58.816\nwe're just looking at\none condition at a time.\n\n485\n00:26:58.816 --> 00:27:02.757\nOn an FMEA form, I'm looking at all\nthe functions of that process, and\n\n486\n00:27:02.757 --> 00:27:05.170\nI'm capturing it all in one place.\n\n487\n00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.893\nSo the form is really\njust a clever form to-\n\n488\n00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:09.581\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we actually use that in\n\n489\n00:27:09.581 --> 00:27:10.260\nIT as well.\n\n490\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.060\nWe have our SLE times our ARO.\n\n491\n00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.850\nSo your SLE is your single loss expectancy\ntimes your annual rate occurrence,\n\n492\n00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.060\nwhich will give you your ALE,\nwhich is your annual loss expectancy.\n\n493\n00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.708\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; So pretty easy in that sense.\n\n494\n00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:24.868\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so you would want,\nin that case too,\n\n495\n00:27:24.868 --> 00:27:28.000\nyou would wanna lower the number,\nright, after you got the number?\n\n496\n00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.760\nOr would you be trying to\nmake the number better or?\n\n497\n00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.025\n&gt;&gt; Well there are different models, and\n\n498\n00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:37.213\nwe would normally look at different\ntypes of risk analysis matrices.\n\n499\n00:27:37.213 --> 00:27:41.960\nYou do wanna obviously lower the number\nof your annual rate of occurrence.\n\n500\n00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.452\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; As well as your annual, or\n\n501\n00:27:43.452 --> 00:27:47.350\nyour single loss, any kind of security\ncontrol that you can implement.\n\n502\n00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:51.380\nBut you also have to make sure\nthat the controls are actually,\n\n503\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.320\nits worth the money and the effort\nthat you're putting in to go ahead and\n\n504\n00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.160\nprevent that incident from occurring.\n\n505\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.940\n&gt;&gt; And see, that's another perfect\nexample of a tool I could use in measure.\n\n506\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:01.875\nI could look at it and\n\n507\n00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:05.350\nimprove, and when I get to control,\nI could give you the results, right?\n\n508\n00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n509\n00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.929\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think,\neven though there are some reading and\n\n510\n00:28:09.929 --> 00:28:13.905\nthings that you're gonna wanna do if\nyou're taking that Six Sigma test.\n\n511\n00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:16.544\nI think I pretty much covered control.\n\n512\n00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:18.016\nThere's those three parts.\n\n513\n00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:20.348\nif you're a Lean Six Sigma person or\n\n514\n00:28:20.348 --> 00:28:23.480\nyou're trying to take\nthe Lean Six Sigma exam.\n\n515\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.440\nPart one,\nyou wanna tell them what you did for them.\n\n516\n00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.030\nPart two,\nyou wanna write a sustainability plan.\n\n517\n00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.850\nAnd part three, you wanna make sure\neveryone knows the project's over.\n\n518\n00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and looking at everything\nthat you've given us in this\n\n519\n00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.980\nepisode to go ahead and support those\nthree really important phases of, well,\n\n520\n00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.850\nour DMAIC phase, the control phase.\n\n521\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.650\nIt has, it has been a lot of information.\n\n522\n00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.810\nSo, I think what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo is have a wrap up of it and\n\n523\n00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.860\njust a brief overview of everything that\nwe've covered in the last series here.\n\n524\n00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.280\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular episode.\n\n525\n00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.262\nBut, stay tuned.\n\n526\n00:28:57.262 --> 00:28:59.540\nWe're gonna have a brief overview and\n\n527\n00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.970\nsome more great Lean Six Sigma Green Belt\nCertification information headed your way.\n\n528\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.794\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n529\n00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:13.180\n&gt;&gt; And this is Dr. Terra Vanzant-Stern\nwith SSD Global Solutions.\n\n530\n00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.597\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n531\n00:29:16.597 --> 00:29:22.595\n[MUSIC]\n\n532\n00:29:22.595 -->

00:00:08.440\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.587\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.587 --> 00:00:15.007\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification,\n\n6\n00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.540\npreparation episode overview.\n\n7\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.230\nWe've gone through the entire series,\nand now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n8\n00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.636\njust remind you what it is you've\nlearned throughout the series.\n\n9\n00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:26.890\nNow, in studios today, we have Dr.\n\n10\n00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.570\nTerra Vanzant Stern, as you already know,\nto go ahead and wrap it up for us.\n\n11\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.590\nSo where we gonna look at first here?\n\n12\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.450\nWhat topics will we look at first?\n\n13\n00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think what I'd like to start\nwith Cherokee is the DMAIC overview,\n\n14\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.260\nbecause that's what we left off\nwith We looked at, in the episodes,\n\n15\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290\nwe looked at each phase of the DMAIC.\n\n16\n00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.780\nSo I wanna just kind of summarize that.\n\n17\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680\nOkay, so if we could go to my slide deck,\n\n18\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.330\nthe DMAIC Model has five phases,\nand the first phase is Define.\n\n19\n00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.010\nAnd in Define, the most important\nthing is that we leave with\n\n20\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.100\neveryone understand what\nit is we're working on.\n\n21\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.620\nAnd then, we move to Measure and\n\n22\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.890\nto Analyze, in measure and analyze there's\na whole lot of tools that are the same.\n\n23\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.470\nIn measure we're trying to get a current\nas is picture of where we are today.\n\n24\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.330\nAnalyze, we're trying to\nanalyze that picture, but\n\n25\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.210\nthere's a whole lot of tools that can\nbe used jointly in both of those.\n\n26\n00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And then,\n\n27\n00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.760\nsorry, we move on to Improve and Control.\n\n28\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.580\nAnd Improve is where we actually\ndo the project and analyze,\n\n29\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.650\nwe leave analyze with three to five\nsolutions and improve, we actually\n\n30\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.290\nroll out the projects, we stay there until\nwe can make sure that improvements been\n\n31\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.840\nmade in a way we know that is that we\ncompare it to our measure pitcher.\n\n32\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.877\nAnd then if everything's okay,\nwe move on to Control, and\n\n33\n00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.511\nwe tell people how to keep\nthat process into place.\n\n34\n00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.748\nSo I'm gonna kind of just\nquickly go through the model,\n\n35\n00:01:57.748 --> 00:02:04.090\nthe key points of each phase, and remember\nthe DMAIC model and Lean Six Sigma.\n\n36\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.730\nIs a circular model.\n\n37\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.980\nIf you're taking the Six Sigma exam,\n\n38\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.390\nwell, through any vendor, they're looking\nat the DMAIC more as a waterfall.\n\n39\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.680\nCircular means that I'm gonna\nmove through the model,\n\n40\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.700\nI'm probably gonna manage\nthe whole process.\n\n41\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.250\nIf I have to move back through the model,\nit's okay.\n\n42\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.310\nWe said that there's a lot of different\nthings depicting the model, and\n\n43\n00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.420\nthis is one of the more complicated ones.\n\n44\n00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.780\nWe actually have some,\nI think we have that simple one.\n\n45\n00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.700\nSee if I can get it to come up, my\nslideshow is acting a little crazy guys.\n\n46\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.980\nOkay, so here's a simple model,\n\n47\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.160\nyou don't necessarily have to have a\ncomplicated one, but of the things we said\n\n48\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.010\nis having the basics of the model in\nfront of us, is really quite helpfu,\n\n49\n00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.460\nbecause there's different dynamics\nin each one of those phases.\n\n50\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.570\nSo, if I have more than one project going,\nit's kind of helpful to know,\n\n51\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.420\nin this project I'm in Measure,\nin this other project, I'm in Improve.\n\n52\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.513\nBecause just the way people\nare reacting to me and\n\n53\n00:03:02.513 --> 00:03:05.162\nmy project could be slightly different.\n\n54\n00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:08.904\nOkay, so the first one we're gonna\nlook at is the Define Phase and\n\n55\n00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:13.180\nwe said that in Define we're identifying,\nwe're prioritizing.\n\n56\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.660\nWe're selecting our teams,\nwe're looking at building effective teams.\n\n57\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.720\nWe're identifying\nthe customer segments and\n\n58\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.850\ndetermining the process to be improved.\n\n59\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.470\nAgain, there's only two rules in Define,\nwe have to start with a high level\n\n60\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.470\nprocess map,\nwe have to end with a project charter.\n\n61\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.557\nAnd remember, the basic idea of Define is\nwe wanna make sure everyone understands\n\n62\n00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:34.810\nwhat we're working on.\n\n63\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.148\nAnd the reason for that is, the number\none people don't buy into our ideas and\n\n64\n00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:42.016\nour and the things that we wanna do,\nour projects,\n\n65\n00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.100\nis because they don't understand.\n\n66\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.380\nSo Define gives you a lot of tools\nthat help people understand what\n\n67\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.840\nyou're working on.\n\n68\n00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.180\nSo then when we move to Measure,\nwe're looking at forming a picture, and\n\n69\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.355\nif I can take a picture, hey, do that.\n\n70\n00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:59.460\nBecause if you've got\na really messy supply room,\n\n71\n00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.000\nor a manufacturing floor, you literally\ncould just take a picture of that, right?\n\n72\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.090\nAnd that's,\nyou have a clear as-is picture.\n\n73\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.390\nBut what happens is a lot of times\nwe're looking at a service or\n\n74\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.280\na transaction that we\ncan't take a picture of.\n\n75\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.330\nAnd so we have to come up\nwith more creative ideas.\n\n76\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.120\nBut when I leave Measure,\n\n77\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.270\nI want you to believe my picture\nbecause that forms the before picture.\n\n78\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.738\nSo I wanna make sure that\nyou believe that picture.\n\n79\n00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:32.160\nSome of the bullet points that you're seen\non the screen are gonna help you do that.\n\n80\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.240\nDetermine the parameters to be measured,\n\n81\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.160\nI still maintain what I'm\nsuppose to be measuring.\n\n82\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.584\nIs a little bit more important than\nhow to measure it cuz you can always\n\n83\n00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:43.805\nlook up how to measure something.\n\n84\n00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:47.838\nI wanna be thinking about variation\nbecause there's a thought in just\n\n85\n00:04:47.838 --> 00:04:52.006\na Six Sigma side that if I reduce\nvariation I may have an automatic process\n\n86\n00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:53.230\nimprovement.\n\n87\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.942\nSo I might wanna do a variation study.\n\n88\n00:04:57.942 --> 00:05:02.480\nI want to think about my final solutions,\nwhat is it that I'm trying to record for\n\n89\n00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.565\nmy improve phase.\n\n90\n00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.620\nWe skipped a phase you guys.\n\n91\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.460\nOkay, so in analyze I've got a clear as\nthis picture of where we are today, so\n\n92\n00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.120\nin Analyze what I wanna do is\nI'm trying to figure out why.\n\n93\n00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.270\nAnd even though you're looking\nat those bullet points,\n\n94\n00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.160\nremember those four conditions that\nthe things I'm looking through the lenses\n\n95\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.860\nare looking through a root conslines.\n\n96\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.180\nI'm looking through a trigger's lens, like\nif this happens, does that other thing\n\n97\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.930\nhappen, and a lot of times that's I'm\nlooking at, like, correlation analysis.\n\n98\n00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.000\nI'm looking at impact,\nhow much does it matter really?\n\n99\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.770\nAnd this is where I might\ndo a variation analysis.\n\n100\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.450\nIn measure, I did a variation study, but\n\n101\n00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.290\nin analyze I might do\na variation analysis.\n\n102\n00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.340\nI don't leave Analyze until I\nhave three to five solutions, and\n\n103\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.800\nthat's the very first step\nwhen I get to improve.\n\n104\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.760\nMy very first step when I get to Improve,\nis that I'm gonna list those three to\n\n105\n00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.580\nfive solutions, and then,\nI'm gonna look at which one I'm gonna do.\n\n106\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.680\nIf I can, I'm gonna pilot it, then,\nI'm gonna roll out my project plan and\n\n107\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.230\nthe moment,\nI can show an improvement's been made.\n\n108\n00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.210\nAnd the way I do that is,\nI go back to my measure picture and\n\n109\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.190\nI say, that's before this is after.\n\n110\n00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.342\nAs soon as I can show\nan improvement's been made,\n\n111\n00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:24.755\nthen I can move on to my control phase.\n\n112\n00:06:29.075 --> 00:06:31.082\nIn Control Phase, they have three,\n\n113\n00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:33.980\nmy little phases are kind\nof out of order there.\n\n114\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.312\nIn the Control Phase,\nI have three responsibilities.\n\n115\n00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:40.822\nI wanna tell you what your\nbenefit was in dollars and cents.\n\n116\n00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:43.410\nI wanna say what I did, why I did it, and\n\n117\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.710\nthis is what you made,\nsaved, or avoided spending.\n\n118\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.875\nIf I use money metrics and measure and\nimprove, that's gonna be easy, right?\n\n119\n00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:55.790\nI'm just gonna translate it over.\n\n120\n00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.030\nBut, it might be a little more complicated\nif I used a different way to show you that\n\n121\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.850\ncurrent picture.\n\n122\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.530\nSo, if I showed you a picture of\nthe warehouse being messed up, and\n\n123\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.980\nthen I showed you a picture of\nthe warehouse just being beautiful.\n\n124\n00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.610\nI might have to break it down for you.\n\n125\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.560\nWhy you care, what did that save\nmake you or avoid you spending?\n\n126\n00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.420\nSo, if I used anything other than money,\n\n127\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.270\nthen I might have to break\nthat down a little bit more.\n\n128\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.370\nThe main thing in Control\nis what I'm trying to do\n\n129\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.370\nis I'm trying to build\na sustainability plan.\n\n130\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.680\nAnd so that that process\nimprovement stays in place and\n\n131\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.310\nthen I wrap up all those DMAIC\nphases by closing out the project.\n\n132\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:43.040\nSo, the thing is that,\nwhat I'd like you to kind of keep in\n\n133\n00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.960\nmind is all the tools and different\nthings that we studied, Cherokee,\n\n134\n00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.180\nin all those other sessions, somehow\nplay in somewhere to that DMAIC model.\n\n135\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.830\nAnd, what are some of the things\nthat we talked about in all of\n\n136\n00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.500\nthose earlier sessions, before we\ndid all those sessions on the DMAIC?\n\n137\n00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.710\n&gt;&gt; So now if we look at the complete\nprocess, the DMAIC model,\n\n138\n00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.780\nwe do understand that that's not\nthe only model available to us.\n\n139\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.766\nThere are other methodologies available,\nbut\n\n140\n00:08:10.766 --> 00:08:15.256\nnow understanding all those tools\nthat we've covered in this series.\n\n141\n00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:19.706\nHow we can significantly apply those tools\ndirectly to the models that we've learned\n\n142\n00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:20.850\nabout as well.\n\n143\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.000\nAnd we look at things like\nour seven quality tools.\n\n144\n00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.200\nWe can look at things like metrics.\n\n145\n00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.030\nWe can look at ideas of\nunderstanding waste and\n\n146\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.700\nlooking at our different voices\nare different perspectives.\n\n147\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.980\nAre different CTQs, we can look at\nthings like implementing graphs and\n\n148\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.935\ncharts to provide those visual\naids to convey our messages.\n\n149\n00:08:41.935 --> 00:08:44.810\nWe've also understood\nthe core concepts and terms.\n\n150\n00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.785\nYou should really have a good\nunderstanding of that at this point.\n\n151\n00:08:47.785 --> 00:08:50.980\nYou should also be really\nfamiliar with the basic.\n\n152\n00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.460\nThe basics of process improvement, and\nnow we can see the full picture and\n\n153\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.530\nhow it all relates and\ncan be plugged into these models.\n\n154\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.604\nSo, I appreciate that, Dr Stern.\n\n155\n00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n&gt;&gt; And now that we understand all these\n\n156\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.820\nconcepts, what do we do next?\n\n157\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.804\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well thank you for\nasking, Cherokee.\n\n158\n00:09:07.804 --> 00:09:11.949\nThe next steps that we would be taking,\nwell, first let me say that\n\n159\n00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:16.099\nSSD Global Solutions teaches\na product called Linear Six Sigma but\n\n160\n00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:21.110\nyour certifications still say\nLin Six Sigma Green Belter Black Belt.\n\n161\n00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.210\nSo we specialized in\na Lin Six Sigma Black Belt Workshop.\n\n162\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.460\nThere is a bit of a financial committment.\n\n163\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.387\nOne of the prerequisites for\n\n164\n00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:35.244\nthat workshop is that you\nare a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n165\n00:09:35.244 --> 00:09:38.130\nNow, you can take your\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n166\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.750\nRemember, you can take that\nthrough a number of vendors.\n\n167\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.390\nIf you take it through our company,\nwe have some pre-requisites.\n\n168\n00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.630\nOne of the pre-requisites,\n\n169\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.230\nare they education hours which you\nhave facilitated through ITProTV?\n\n170\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.110\nBut we, in order for you to sit for\nour Lin Six Sigma Green Belt exam,\n\n171\n00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:02.040\nwe require a project and\na project charter and a project report.\n\n172\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.500\nWe have those templates available for\nfree.\n\n173\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:05.046\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n174\n00:10:05.046 --> 00:10:08.709\nyou have to do that in order to sit for\nour exam.\n\n175\n00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:12.190\nAnd once you pass our exam,\nyou're a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.\n\n176\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.310\nAgain, I'd like to stress you can take\nyour Green Belt through anyone, but\n\n177\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.130\nin order to be in our\nLean Six Sigma Black Belt class,\n\n178\n00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.100\nyou have to be a certified Green Belt.\n\n179\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.980\n&gt;&gt; We do offer the test at\na discounted rate and like I said,\n\n180\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.780\nwe also give you the collaterals\nlike the project charter and\n\n181\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.000\nthe project report which do have\nto be reviewed by our committee.\n\n182\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.460\nOnce that's accepted,\nyou can sit for our examine.\n\n183\n00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.430\n&gt;&gt; So,\nthis is a great certification to have.\n\n184\n00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.570\nIt's internationally recognized.\n\n185\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.412\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; So now you have all the knowledge,\n\n186\n00:10:40.412 --> 00:10:43.810\nall the training, to really prep you for\nthat black belt certification.\n\n187\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.780\nJust know that there\nare opportunities available to you.\n\n188\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.323\nSo, thank you guys so much for\njoining us throughout this entire series.\n\n189\n00:10:50.323 --> 00:10:51.077\nI appreciate that.\n\n190\n00:10:51.077 --> 00:10:52.170\nAnd I appreciate Appreciate you, Dr.\n\n191\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.450\nStern, for coming in and\ndoing this with us.\n\n192\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.634\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, and I appreciate being\ninvited to ITProTV to do this.\n\n193\n00:10:58.634 --> 00:11:01.216\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a great deal for\neveryone all around.\n\n194\n00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:05.662\nSo, we're gonna go ahead sign off for\nyour last show here, for your\n\n195\n00:11:05.662 --> 00:11:10.656\nLean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification\nPreparation theories, and now you\n\n196\n00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:16.160\nknow what to do with that information and\nhow you can progress and move forward.\n\n197\n00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.355\nSo, we'll go ahead and\nsign off, and see you later.\n\n198\n00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:18.855\nBye.\n\n199\n00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:26.863\n[MUSIC]\n\n200\n00:11:26.863 -->
