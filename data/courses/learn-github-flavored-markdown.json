00:00:17.205\nI'm your show host, Wes Brian, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.995\nin today's episode we are kicking\noff our series in markdown.\n\n5\n00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:24.465\nAnd joining us back in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Justin Dennison.\n\n6\n00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:25.935\nJustin, how are we doing today, sir?\n\n7\n00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:27.695\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes, how are you?\n\n8\n00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:28.545\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.295\nOne of the things I am wondering,\n\n10\n00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:34.400\nwe talked about markdown,\nI have to ask the question there, Justin.\n\n11\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.700\nWhat is markdown?\n\n12\n00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.560\nMarkdown.\n\n13\n00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.110\nWe'll it's a delicious dish,\nno, I'm joking.\n\n14\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.730\nMarkdown is just plain text, but\n\n15\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.420\nit's plain text that has a very particular\nstructure that allows us to run it through\n\n16\n00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.270\nprocessors, or\nsometimes other transformation processes.\n\n17\n00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.510\nLike, I can get HTML out of markdown.\n\n18\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.553\nI can get a PDF out of markdown.\n\n19\n00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.261\nThere are tools that,\nI don't know how well they work,\n\n20\n00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:07.280\nI can get a .doc, a Word document,\nor things of that sort.\n\n21\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.419\nBut what's interesting is\nbecause it's plain text,\n\n22\n00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:12.943\nall I have to do is know\nthe mark down syntax,\n\n23\n00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:17.190\nrun it through these processors and\nthen I get respective documents out.\n\n24\n00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.250\nNow, why would you even wanna use this?\n\n25\n00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.930\nLet's say I'm writing an E-book and\nI just wanna be in the book, right?\n\n26\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.600\nBut I still need a little bit of\nformatting, maybe some headings,\n\n27\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.750\nsub headings, maybe I need some\nline breaks, horizontal rules.\n\n28\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.420\nMaybe I need the lists.\n\n29\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.670\nThese are all things that\nare capable with Markdown, but\n\n30\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.760\nI just have to know, if I need a list,\nI need to do this type of thing.\n\n31\n00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.148\nAnd then when you run it through and\nget an epub, a pdf, a .doc,\n\n32\n00:01:44.148 --> 00:01:48.390\npossibly an HTML file,\nif I wanted to output it that way.\n\n33\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.280\nAnd to some extent,\nI can get a png, right.\n\n34\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.540\nSo, those are all nice things.\n\n35\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.470\nYou don't have to work hard, and\nhopefully that answers what is markdown?\n\n36\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.170\nJust text that has a very particular\nstructure that makes it easy to parson and\n\n37\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.080\ntransform.\n\n38\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.820\n&gt;&gt; You know, Justin, I have hosted in\nsome of the episodes with you, and\n\n39\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.660\nwe have gone through various\nprogramming languages, and\n\n40\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.972\nI know that from time to time, you'll\nhave a specific type of editor, right,\n\n41\n00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:14.670\nto where, sometimes it might\njust be a glorified notepad.\n\n42\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.360\nBut when it comes to writing mark downs,\nis there anything that we need special or\n\n43\n00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.960\nspecific?\n\n44\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.010\nDo we need a glorified notepad?\n\n45\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Well you can actually\nwrite this in just note pad,\n\n46\n00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.705\ntext edit, Vim if that's your poison.\n\n47\n00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:28.450\nE-max, whatever it may be.\n\n48\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.620\nOr if you really wanna toe the line,\nI guess nano or even Ed.\n\n49\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890\nPhew, we're getting really esoteric there.\n\n50\n00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.060\nHowever, I am going make\na recommendation for\n\n51\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.760\nthis series that will make our\nlives a little bit easier.\n\n52\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.800\nAnd part of it is a bias of mine.\n\n53\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.770\nFull disclosure, I have a little bit\nof a bias in this selection, but\n\n54\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.620\npart of it is, ease of use.\n\n55\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.530\nAnd kind of ease of playing around and\nquick iteration.\n\n56\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.910\nAnd that's visual studio code.\n\n57\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.100\nIt is more or\nless a glorified text editor.\n\n58\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.790\nBut it is extensible.\n\n59\n00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.370\nIt also has the fault mark down support\nand we're going to be dealing with\n\n60\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.240\nget hub flavored markdown during this\nseries, which actually adds just a little\n\n61\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.540\nbit on top, but all the other standard\nmarkdown portions will work for you.\n\n62\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.700\nAnd, well,\nI think if we're gonna use that,\n\n63\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.100\nthen maybe we just spend a little time,\nset it up, get it started.\n\n64\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.690\nThere's not a lot to it, but\n\n65\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.490\nI just wanna make sure I give\nyou a nice little overview.\n\n66\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.540\nSo we come into my screen here.\n\n67\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.760\nAnd we come to a code.visualstudio.com.\n\n68\n00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.590\nI do want to really drive home the point,\n\n69\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.530\nVisual Studio Code and\nVisual Studio are different things,\n\n70\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.520\nwhich is I think unfortunate,\nbut it's a Microsoft product.\n\n71\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.770\nThey said, we have Visual Studio,\n\n72\n00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.680\nwhich is a full blown integrated\ndevelopment environment.\n\n73\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.130\nIt is for building large scale\napplications, working with teams.\n\n74\n00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.930\nYou can do those things with Visual Studio\ncode, but it's kinda paired down,\n\n75\n00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.790\nit's just simple text editor\nthat you add as you need it.\n\n76\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.440\nThey share a name, but\nthey are not the same thing.\n\n77\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.171\nAnother reason I've picked this is\nyou'll notice mine, I'm on a Mac.\n\n78\n00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.600\nAnd it says, hey download for Mac.\n\n79\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.830\nBut if I scroll all the way to the bottom,\nI have a Windows support.\n\n80\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.570\nI have 32 bit versions of Windows support.\n\n81\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.420\nI have Debian based Linux support,\nRPM packages and MacOS.\n\n82\n00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.100\nAnd, then, if you go to some other\nplatforms, every once a while you'll find\n\n83\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.850\nsome other little platforms there,\nso it is cross-platform, right?\n\n84\n00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.490\nYour experience, whether you're on\nWindows, Mac, or a Linux distribution,\n\n85\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.330\nshould be very similar to the one\nyou see in these, in this series.\n\n86\n00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.150\nAll right so if I click download for\nMac, it says well thank you.\n\n87\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.030\nAnd it actually gives you a getting\nstarted guide, some top extensions.\n\n88\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.690\nNow we're not gonna dive fully into those.\n\n89\n00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.642\nBut I would definitely say,\ntake a read at this.\n\n90\n00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:54.580\nMaybe there's, you'll find something\nthat makes you a little more productive.\n\n91\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.940\nI find new things everyday that\nmake my life a little bit easier\n\n92\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.940\nwhen I'm using Visual Studio code.\n\n93\n00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.920\nSo if I come here,\nin Mac it is just a simple zip file.\n\n94\n00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.062\nAnd I just wanna show you, it's a single\nexecutable that I just drag over into my\n\n95\n00:05:11.062 --> 00:05:13.340\napplications, and I'm good to go.\n\n96\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.300\nOn Windows, it will actually ask you,\ndo you wanna install, next, next, next.\n\n97\n00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.650\nWe're all good to go.\n\n98\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.630\nAnd then on Linux it is you're either\nusing your packet manager to install it or\n\n99\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.580\nlike a depackage whatever it may be for\nyour respective distribution.\n\n100\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.930\nAnd, well, then you should be good to go.\n\n101\n00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.570\nNow, how do I find his?\n\n102\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.070\nWell.\n\n103\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.840\nIf you look for a Visual Studio code,\nnow if you're on Windows that's\n\n104\n00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.870\nthe Windows key, you just type\nstart typing Visual Studio code.\n\n105\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.200\nOn Mac it's command shift,\nVisual Studio code.\n\n106\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.180\nAnd then on Linux it is\nthe Windows key for me,\n\n107\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.210\nit depends on your Linux distribution and\nyour desktop and things.\n\n108\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.070\nAnd then you could just type,\nI'm just looking for Visual Studio code.\n\n109\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.120\nAnd then when I open it,\nwe're going to see, well this.\n\n110\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.968\nIt's all we have, its very, very\nsimple and it's intended to be simple,\n\n111\n00:06:02.968 --> 00:06:06.040\nbecause it removes distractions\nfrom what you're doing.\n\n112\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.849\nNow, we could read a whole bunch about\nthis, we could let's get out of here and\n\n113\n00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.240\nif we click this top icon,\nthere's a little bit of a survey here.\n\n114\n00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.410\nLet's click this zoom in here.\n\n115\n00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.810\nThere's a few icons.\n\n116\n00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.040\nI have this icon which is\nyour document explore.\n\n117\n00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.290\nAnd we'll get to that.\n\n118\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.230\nHere is if I want to search, here, well,\n\n119\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.550\nwe'll probably not gonna use this,\nthis is more developer driven.\n\n120\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.960\nHowever, if you're writing\na great deal of documents,\n\n121\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.590\nsource control may be helpful to you.\n\n122\n00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.098\nI want to keep certain\nsnapshots of versions.\n\n123\n00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:43.610\nAnd then if I come on\ndown here these last two\n\n124\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.000\nare probably more developer driven\nthan just writing markdowns.\n\n125\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.380\nNow, why am I using something\nthat's geared toward developers.\n\n126\n00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.443\nWe're talking about\ngithub flavored markdown,\n\n127\n00:06:54.443 --> 00:06:58.685\nwhere your projects typically have\na Read me or some kind of description.\n\n128\n00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:03.060\nMarkdown is a great format to\nactually write those things.\n\n129\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.310\nSo these last two is a debugger and then\nthe final one is for adding extensions.\n\n130\n00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.020\nSo we're not gonna go into those but\nif we come back to our explorer tab,\n\n131\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.160\nand I'm gonna zoom out a little bit and\nsay well, you haven't opened a folder yet.\n\n132\n00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.670\nAnd by default it's trying\nto manage a folder for you.\n\n133\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.810\nSo let's open a folder and\nlet's just, I don't know,\n\n134\n00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.270\nlet's open my desktop folder I guess.\n\n135\n00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.210\nSo if I open my desktop folder,\n\n136\n00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.480\nyou'll notice there's all kinds\nof stuff on my desktop, right?\n\n137\n00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.180\nThat's all good, but\nwe don't want to worry about that.\n\n138\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.669\nWe actually just want to make a file, and\nI want to show you why it makes it easy to\n\n139\n00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.910\nuse this for github flavored mark down,\njust a quick iteration.\n\n140\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.460\nSo if we click on this little icon.\n\n141\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.670\nThere's a couple of icons here.\n\n142\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.990\nThis will create a new file\nin the current folder.\n\n143\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.200\nThis will create a new folder\nin the current folder.\n\n144\n00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.820\nAnd then you would click on that\nfolder and create a file within it.\n\n145\n00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.260\nBut we're just gonna keep on top level for\nnow.\n\n146\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.850\nCreate a new file and then if we come down\nit will bring up this little piece here.\n\n147\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.485\nAnd then let's just say, testing.md,\n.md is a file extension,\n\n148\n00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:11.660\n.markdown is also a file\nextension that you can use.\n\n149\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.540\nSo I hit enter, and then you'll\nnotice this little icon right here,\n\n150\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.280\nsee this like a downward arrow.\n\n151\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.584\nNow that's very specific to Visual Studio\ncode, I've seen a variety of icons,\n\n152\n00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:27.719\nthat lets us know this is treating\nthis file as a markdown file.\n\n153\n00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:29.980\nThat's because of that .md extension.\n\n154\n00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.150\nNow if you ever have an issue,\nif you come down here to the bottom.\n\n155\n00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.776\nAnd a lot of these other editors that\nare similar to Visual Studio Code will\n\n156\n00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:38.530\nhave this.\n\n157\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.560\nNotice this says markdown.\n\n158\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.060\nIf you do not see this then\nyou're going to have some weird\n\n159\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.460\nkind of problems like your\neditor will not give you hints.\n\n160\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.480\nWill not provide the help\nthat you expect it to.\n\n161\n00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.020\nAll right, so if you see those two things\nthen we actually have a markdown file in\n\n162\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.110\nour editor, our editor is recognizing\nit as a markdown file, and\n\n163\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.510\nwe can just start typing.\n\n164\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.000\nNow I'm not trying to give\naway too much here, but\n\n165\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.640\nif I just say, here is some text, and\n\n166\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.790\nI will, here is some more text.\n\n167\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.530\nNow notice that my editor is highlighting\nthose, then I'll have the markdown\n\n168\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.850\nsyntax highlighting, I don't get these\nhints that something has changed.\n\n169\n00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.460\nWell, how am I supposed to know\nwhat it's actually doing it?\n\n170\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.270\nAm I supposed to check the input or\nthe output rather, right?\n\n171\n00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.070\nI just, do I have to make it a PDF\nevery time to figure it out?\n\n172\n00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.960\nI like Visual Studio code because if you\nhold command shift and hit P on Mac,\n\n173\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.180\ncontrol shift P on other\noperating systems,\n\n174\n00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.920\nyou'll get this nice little toolbar.\n\n175\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.700\nNow you could do a lot\nfrom this toolbar but\n\n176\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.470\nour main goal is open\npreview of mark down.\n\n177\n00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.460\nSee how I just typed this?\n\n178\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.140\nNow, mine pre-populated because it\nactually learns what are the most\n\n179\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.200\ncommonly used commands you're gonna\nuse for a particular file packet?\n\n180\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.110\nPreview mark down, but\nif you type just mark down, you can see,\n\n181\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.570\nopen preview to the side Open Preview,\nchange Preview Security Settings.\n\n182\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.290\nYou could definitely take a look at those.\n\n183\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.490\nAnd then refresh Preview.\n\n184\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.655\nIf for some reason things aren't\nrefreshing like you expect them to,\n\n185\n00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:20.770\nControl-Shift-P or Command-Shift-P on Mac,\nhyphen mark down, and\n\n186\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.180\nyou'll see these options.\n\n187\n00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.380\nOnce you select them with the arrow and\n\n188\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.370\nit will also tell you, if you wanna do\nthis, just hold shift command v on Mac,\n\n189\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.580\nand for Windows and Linux platforms it\nwill give you the corresponding shortcut.\n\n190\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:42.310\nSo I'm gonna open the preview and it opens\nin a totally new kind of document, right?\n\n191\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.840\nSo you'll notice,\nhey this looks just like text.\n\n192\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.150\nBut this text looks different.\n\n193\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.950\nThis, when it's rendered,\nthis is how this will look, all right?\n\n194\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.790\nSo how do I get out of this?\n\n195\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.050\nOr maybe you want a side by side preview.\n\n196\n00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.190\nYou just close that document.\n\n197\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.238\nThe preview is done.\n\n198\n00:10:59.238 --> 00:11:02.230\nAnd then if I come here,\nopen preview to the side.\n\n199\n00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:09.220\nAnd now if I come and I just type, you'll\nnotice, this updates as you're typing.\n\n200\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.310\nSo this is a great way to iterate,\nto kinda go, what is that doing?\n\n201\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.340\nI'm typing things,\nis that rendering correctly?\n\n202\n00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.660\nAnd by using this, our editor is very,\nvery helpful to us, and\n\n203\n00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.650\nallows us to say, I typed this,\nwhat's going on over here?\n\n204\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.480\nCool.\nI typed this, what's going on over here?\n\n205\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.660\nCool.\n\n206\n00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.210\nOne thing I do wanna see about these\ntext editors that are kind of rich text\n\n207\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.000\neditors, if you come to the file menu and\n\n208\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.580\nthis is kind of ubiquitous\nacross all of these.\n\n209\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.280\nYou will notice there's no print.\n\n210\n00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.660\nThere's no print whatsoever.\n\n211\n00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.430\nAnd that's because it's\nexpecting you to transform or\n\n212\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.490\nuse some other method of printing.\n\n213\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.650\nIt's like, that's not my game,\nI'm not here to help you print.\n\n214\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.930\nThere are other tools that will help that,\nokay?\n\n215\n00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:00.060\nSo if you want to transform Markdown,\nyou can save as HTML, someone use that.\n\n216\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.030\nThere's some other conversion tools or\nyou just give your Markdown and\n\n217\n00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.300\nit will give you a PDF.\n\n218\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.730\nAnd well let me cover those near the end\nof this series after we get some\n\n219\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.130\nidea of what these individual\npieces of syntax mean.\n\n220\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.690\nBut for now.\n\n221\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.270\nAs long as we have our editor good,\nwe're good to go.\n\n222\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.980\n&gt;&gt; So\nwe know what we need to right markdown.\n\n223\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.730\nRight?\nWe even got an editor recommendation from\n\n224\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.520\nyou there Justin.\n\n225\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.490\nIs there anything else\nthat we need to know?\n\n226\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.880\nAnything else we need in place for\nmarkdown?\n\n227\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.770\n&gt;&gt; I think for now.\n\n228\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.250\nAs long as you have editor and, well,\nyou have an active keyboard that works.\n\n229\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.120\nThat's pretty much all we need, right?\n\n230\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.050\nWe need to be able to open and\n\n231\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.660\nclose files, create files,\ntype around, and we're good to go.\n\n232\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.750\nNow, eventually, your mark down workflow\nmay get a little more complicated,\n\n233\n00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.510\nespecially if you choose to, I want to use\nEmacs and all these other pipeline builds.\n\n234\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.060\nThat's up to you, but, for now, we're just\ngoing to stick with Visual Studio Code.\n\n235\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.160\nIf you have it installed,\nyou're going to open files.\n\n236\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160\nWe're good to go.\n\n237\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.440\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nA lot of great information.\n\n238\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.710\nThank you for getting us up and running.\n\n239\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.490\nWhen it comes to markdown, we appreciate\nhaving you here, Justin, in the studios.\n\n240\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.670\nWe appreciate you, the viewer.\n\n241\n00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.080\nHopefully, you've enjoyed, how to get\nstarted in Markdown, but keep in mind,\n\n242\n00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.350\nwe've got a lot more to come but\nit's gonna require you to stay tuned.\n\n243\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.120\nSigning off for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n244\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n245\n00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.532\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n246\n00:13:13.532 --> 00:13:18.735\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I am doing fantastic Wes, and\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.800\nhow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.221\nSo when we talk about syntax,\nwe talk about Markdown, right?\n\n10\n00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:34.670\nThere's some things that we need\nto know when it comes to text, and\n\n11\n00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.000\ncan you tell us a little bit about that?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I've kinda envisioned this,\n\n12\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.780\nbecause this is something that\nI've had trouble with, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.730\nWhen we're learning how\nto type Markdown or\n\n14\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.880\nuse Markdown rather than writing\nREADMEs or writing notes.\n\n15\n00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.280\nOr even, I've heard of people writing\nbooks, having them transformed into PDFs.\n\n16\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.390\nThere's other tools that'll make\nthem like ePubs and .mobis.\n\n17\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.300\nWell, there's a lot of times I forget.\n\n18\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.480\nNow, how do I do that one thing again?\n\n19\n00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.390\nSo kind of what I've envisioned is,\nlet's just take these little bitty pieces.\n\n20\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.330\nSee the insides and\nouts of just those individual pieces.\n\n21\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.430\nAnd in particular,\nwe're gonna be talking italicizing text.\n\n22\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.107\nSo yes, Wes?\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking when it comes to\n\n23\n00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:13.220\nMarkdown, right?\n\n24\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.250\nI know there are many different types,\n\n25\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.783\nmany different if you\nwill flavors of Markdown.\n\n26\n00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:19.930\nNow, what are we gonna be\nlooking at in today's episode?\n\n27\n00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, for\n\n28\n00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.060\nthis entire series we're always gonna\nbe looking at GitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\n29\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.600\nAnd that adds a little bit on top, but\n\n30\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.960\na lot of the things you will learn will\nbe used in other Markdown flavors.\n\n31\n00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.560\nNow, flavors not like grape, or orange, or\n\n32\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.800\nanything like that, but\nwhat is available to you?\n\n33\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.180\nNow, italicizing text,\nit's pretty ubiquitous.\n\n34\n00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.020\nWhether you're using\nGitHub Flavored Markdown or\n\n35\n00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.540\nsome of the other Markdown flavors.\n\n36\n00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.650\nI almost chuckle when I\nsay Markdown flavors.\n\n37\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.240\nBut any of those other ones,\nthis should be fairly ubiquitous.\n\n38\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.900\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here, and well,\n\n39\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.960\nlet's see how we can italicize text.\n\n40\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.950\nSo I'm in my Visual Studio code editor.\n\n41\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.930\nAnd right inside this GitHub-markdown\nfolder is just a folder that I have open.\n\n42\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.280\nI'm gonna create a new file.\n\n43\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.660\nAnd I'm gonna call it Italicizing-text.md,\nnow.\n\n44\n00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.910\nIf you use .md that will make sure\nthat you have, well, Markdowns syntax\n\n45\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.095\nhighlighting, that you can see down\nhere at the bottom of the screen.\n\n46\n00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:22.630\nMarkdown, right next to the smiley face.\n\n47\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.915\nIf yours isn't a smiley face, that\nprobably means that you need to update.\n\n48\n00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:26.800\nBut that's all right.\n\n49\n00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.260\nAnd then, let's make this a little\nbit bigger here, there we go.\n\n50\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.980\nSo I've zoomed in and\nthat's just to help, you see.\n\n51\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.045\nNow, I've typed some text,\nhello, how are you doing?\n\n52\n00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:46.996\nAnd let's say, I'm writing this in a\nREADME file, or maybe I'm writing a novel,\n\n53\n00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:51.770\nwhatever it may be, if I save this and\nif I now look at a preview, right?\n\n54\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.380\nIf I open the Markdown preview,\nyou'll notice it says, how are you doing?\n\n55\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.350\nThis is just paragraph text.\n\n56\n00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.970\nThat's it, that's all you got.\n\n57\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.312\nThere's nothing special.\n\n58\n00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:05.542\nAnd if you've ever come from another\nenvironment, you're like well,\n\n59\n00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:09.100\nnow I need to highlight this and\nthen where's my toolbar?\n\n60\n00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.830\nWell the entire impetus of Markdown is,\neverything you write has a reason for\n\n61\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.270\nexisting, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.860\nSo if I come in front of this and I put\nan underscore, and I come to the end, and\n\n63\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.820\nI put an underscore.\n\n64\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.750\nAnd you say, you notice inside of\nmy editor, it'll give me a hint.\n\n65\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.645\nAnd this is why I like VS Code.\n\n66\n00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.361\nAdam actually does this fairly well,\nthere's a couple of other ones.\n\n67\n00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.600\nAnd I come over here,\nyou'll notice that is now italicized.\n\n68\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.560\nSo it's very, very simple.\n\n69\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.490\nNow, one of the common gotchas is,\nwell, I need to write underscores,\n\n70\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.360\nbut I don't want italicize.\n\n71\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.490\nWell, that's easy.\n\n72\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.370\nYou can put a slash, right, and that's a,\nI always get those mixed up, Wes.\n\n73\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.417\nDo you know if that's a backslash or\na forward slash?\n\n74\n00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:52.430\n&gt;&gt; I think that's a backslash.\n\n75\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.727\n&gt;&gt; Okay, for some reason I always wanna\n\n76\n00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:59.162\nlike make those different.\n&gt;&gt; The only reason I know this is because\n\n77\n00:03:59.162 --> 00:04:03.119\nI personally use the backslashes for\nUNC pass browsing the network shares.\n\n78\n00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.553\nSo I know it's a backslash.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:05.553 --> 00:04:09.070\nSo backslash,\nif you're like what is a backslash?\n\n80\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.410\nIt's the slash above your enter or\nreturn key typically on your keyboard.\n\n81\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.644\n&gt;&gt; Justin I was just gonna ask,\n\n82\n00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:17.833\nwhat's the purpose of putting a backslash\nin front of the characters that\n\n83\n00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:18.382\nyou use?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n84\n00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:22.395\nthe backslash is actually going to\nallow us to escape these characters,\n\n85\n00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:25.840\nand now,\nthe Markdown syntax will no longer apply.\n\n86\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.499\nAnd we will talk about over the course\nof the series, where can I use this,\n\n87\n00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.990\nhow are they used, what are the things to\nwatch out for before it tell us in text.\n\n88\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.050\nYou always wanna make sure that\nyou want to escape the opening and\n\n89\n00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.450\nthe ending, right?\n\n90\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.596\nSo if you try to not italicize,\nbut instead you want underscores.\n\n91\n00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:44.576\nAnd there maybe times,\n\n92\n00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.480\nif you're running a technical\ndocument there underscores in names.\n\n93\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.700\nOr you have a very particular name\nof some other like reference.\n\n94\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.570\nOr maybe you're referencing a file,\nyou may have underscores.\n\n95\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.560\nAnd if you come here,\n\n96\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.420\nyou'll notice that those underscores\nare now available to you.\n\n97\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.630\nBut they're not used in\nmodifying the view of the text\n\n98\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.640\nwhen you actually render the Markdown.\n&gt;&gt; So if I wanna make sure that\n\n99\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.722\na special character, Justin,\nif I understand this right.\n\n100\n00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:12.490\nI wanna make sure that that special\ncharacter makes it into my text, and\n\n101\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.760\nthat Markdown doesn't interpret it as\nsome kind of modification of the text.\n\n102\n00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.060\nYou have to make sure that you escape it.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, escape it wholeheartedly.\n\n103\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.450\nNow, that is something to remember.\n\n104\n00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.483\nNow, what if you want to italicize\n\n105\n00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:32.221\nthe underscores that you've escaped?\n\n106\n00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:34.700\nWell, now it gets a little iffy, right?\n\n107\n00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.810\nSo if I come out here, and I look,\nand I put another underscore, and\n\n108\n00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.590\nanother underscore.\n\n109\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.640\nNotice, I have an underscore,\nand then a backslash underscore.\n\n110\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.050\nAnd then, what are you doing?\n\n111\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.380\nAnd then, another backslash underscore,\nand then another underscore, right?\n\n112\n00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.190\nSo I've only escaped one\nset of those underscores.\n\n113\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.210\nIf I save and I come back,\nI now have an italicized\n\n114\n00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.470\nset of underscores at the beginning and\nend, so I can use these together.\n\n115\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.270\nSo you can kind of compound those.\n\n116\n00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.924\nNow, what's interesting is\nMarkdown allows us sometimes to\n\n117\n00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:13.187\nuse other characters if it's\na convention for us, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:18.080\nWe've seen underscores provide\nthe ability to italicize something.\n\n119\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.700\nIf I come back, we're now back to\nregular text, but if I put an asterisk,\n\n120\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.930\nand then, another asterisk here, then I\nshould get, as you see an italicized text.\n\n121\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.420\nSo an underscore at the beginning and\nthe end,\n\n122\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.340\nand an asterisks at the beginning and\nthe end.\n\n123\n00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.500\nBoth allow italicizing, I was getting\nready to make up a word there.\n\n124\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.799\nAnd then likewise,\nif you wanted to not have this, but\n\n125\n00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:49.386\ninstead use the asterisk as\na special character, right?\n\n126\n00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:52.701\nSomething that you're gonna put in the\ndocumentation because it's important for\n\n127\n00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:54.055\nthe documentation.\n\n128\n00:06:54.055 --> 00:07:00.500\nYou'ill put backslashes in front of those,\nnotice we have regular text, right?\n\n129\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.200\nAnd then, we still have those\nrespective asterisks, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.850\nSo if we come back here and\neverything looks good.\n\n131\n00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.085\nAnd then, if I wanted those to be\nitalicized, I could even combine these.\n\n132\n00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:18.638\nAnd say well, I want the asterisk,\nbut I want those to be italicized, but\n\n133\n00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.600\nI want the asterisk to actually be there.\n\n134\n00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.240\nYou can combine those as well, and\n\n135\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.510\nthen you can see,\nhow are you doing in an italicized manner.\n\n136\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.794\nSo in order to italicize text,\nit's a single underscore at either end,\n\n137\n00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:36.406\nor a single asterisk at either end.\n\n138\n00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:41.341\nAnd you can combine those as well as use\nescape characters as we've seen here, to,\n\n139\n00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:46.064\nwell, I want the asterisk to be there not\nto apply a style like Markdown normally\n\n140\n00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:46.580\nwould.\n\n141\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.680\nSo the backslash is great for escaping.\n\n142\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.050\nAnd as far as italicizing text,\nthat is a good place to start.\n\n143\n00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.900\nPretty easy, but\nthere are a couple of gotchas.\n\n144\n00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.340\nIf you want those characters to be there,\nhave to use the escape character.\n\n145\n00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.220\nOtherwise, Markdown's gonna\nremove those apply styles\n\n146\n00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.306\nin your rendered final product.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n147\n00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:08.119\nJustin, that's a lot of great information\non some of the things that we can\n\n148\n00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:10.546\ndo with Markdown to start manipulating and\nmodifying our text.\n\n149\n00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:13.708\nTo make that text the output\nthat we're previewing look\n\n150\n00:08:13.708 --> 00:08:15.329\nexactly the way we want now.\n\n151\n00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.615\nDoes look like we're coming to\nthe end of another episode, and\n\n152\n00:08:17.615 --> 00:08:19.290\nI know we've got much more to come.\n\n153\n00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.870\nJustin, you got any final words that\nyou'd like to impart to our viewers?\n\n154\n00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.500\n&gt;&gt;

Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.520\nAnd in today's episode, we got\nan exciting show for you in store today.\n\n5\n00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.760\nWe're gonna be looking at markdown and\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.200\nsome of the things that we can\ndo to manipulate our text.\n\n7\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.010\nAnd joining us in the studios is\nnone other than Mr.Justin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.550\nJustin, how we doing today, sir?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes, and\n\n9\n00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130\nhow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.070\nOver the last couple of episodes, you've\nshown us some of the things that we can\n\n11\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.150\ndo in markdown in order to modify\nthe way the output of our text looks.\n\n12\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.000\nAnd I can only imagine that we're gonna\nbe continuing along here in this episode.\n\n13\n00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.750\nSo what do we have in store for us today?\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n14\n00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.690\nI think if we can italicize then\nwe should be able to bold, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.300\nItalicize, maybe that's\na level of emphasis,\n\n16\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.090\nbold is also a level of emphasis but\nmaybe they're not quite the same level.\n\n17\n00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.120\nBold is like, look at this, italicize is,\nyou should probably pay attention but\n\n18\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.990\nmaybe it's not quite so in your face.\n\n19\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.570\nAnd along with that there is a couple\nof things where maybe I want bold and\n\n20\n00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850\nitalicized.\n\n21\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.570\nAnd well how do we handle that?\n\n22\n00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.570\nAnd I think the best way is,\njust start putting things on the page and\n\n23\n00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.300\nsee how they render.\n\n24\n00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.070\nSo let's take a look\nat the screen here and\n\n25\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.880\nI'm just inside of my Atom text editor.\n\n26\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.166\nI'm gonna come over here and\ncreate a new file called boldingtext.md.\n\n27\n00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:28.486\nNow md is yypically, always going to\nprovide you with a, and if you don't have\n\n28\n00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:33.510\na space there, notice how I put a space\nthere and I get a weird little icon?\n\n29\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.400\nThat means it's a standard text.\n\n30\n00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.200\nMy text editor doesn't recognize it as\na markdown file and thus it will not\n\n31\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.660\ngive me markdown syntax highlighting and\ngive me a little bit of help.\n\n32\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.279\nSo, I'm gonna rename that quickly,\n\n33\n00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:47.718\ncuz I'm pretty sure I accidentally\nhit a space and I did.\n\n34\n00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:51.899\nAnd now I get the markdown\ndesignation as well\n\n35\n00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.100\nas down here I get\nthe markdown designation.\n\n36\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.780\nSo if we have some text here is\nsomething important, all right?\n\n37\n00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.800\nSo I'm thinking if I wanna\nbold something I need to\n\n38\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.710\nhave something important to bold.\n\n39\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.520\nPlease do not bold your\nentire markdown file.\n\n40\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.301\nIt's kind like,\nits bold all caps and italicized.\n\n41\n00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.100\nI immediately don't read those.\n\n42\n00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.330\nThat's just me, but if I see something\nbold I go uh-huh there we go.\n\n43\n00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.640\nThat I need to zoom in on that,\nremember that, that's important.\n\n44\n00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.070\nSo, how do I do that?\n\n45\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.260\nWell, let's open this up and I noticed\nsometimes I get a little carried away Wes.\n\n46\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.866\nI use little shortcuts that\nmaybe you're not aware of.\n\n47\n00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:39.190\nOn Mac that's Cmd+Shift+P to open this.\n\n48\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280\nOn all other platforms just Ctrl+Shift+P.\n\n49\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.802\nAnd that is inside of Visual Studio Code.\n\n50\n00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:47.873\nAnd then the only thing I'm gonna do\nis type in MARK, open markdown and\n\n51\n00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:50.230\nthis will give me that preview section.\n\n52\n00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.890\nSo we'll render whatever\nI'm seeing in the preview.\n\n53\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.000\nSo I come back over here.\n\n54\n00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.780\nWell, we know how to italicize.\n\n55\n00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.730\nLet's say that this important\nPortion is what we want to bold.\n\n56\n00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.150\nHow do I do that?\n\n57\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.120\nWell we can always use these inline.\n\n58\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.380\nAnd I can actually bold\nthis entire section.\n\n59\n00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.950\nSo let's do that,\nsee how we can move those inline.\n\n60\n00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.240\nSo if I come here and I put two asterisks\nand then two asterisks like that.\n\n61\n00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.350\nNotice that my text editor says hey,\nthose are blue.\n\n62\n00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.350\nWhy is it doing that?\n\n63\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.170\nBecause it's recognizing this is\nmarkdown well syntax for something.\n\n64\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.060\nIf I come back over here,\nnotice this is now bold,\n\n65\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.730\nthat's two asterisks before and after.\n\n66\n00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.290\nNow if I don't want,\nif let's say I want two asterisks,\n\n67\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.930\njust as a reminder I'm\ngonna put slash slash.\n\n68\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.650\nI'm gonna skip each one of those,\nand it is no longer bold but\n\n69\n00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.900\nactually has the two asterisks before and\nafter it.\n\n70\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.584\nNow along with that markdown\nsupports another syntax.\n\n71\n00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:56.626\nTo do this, and\nthat is not asterisk asterisk, but\n\n72\n00:03:56.626 --> 00:03:59.639\nnot a parentheses is not part of that.\n\n73\n00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.645\nUnderscore underscore and\nunderscore underscore just like that and\n\n74\n00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:05.310\nnotice it turns blue again.\n\n75\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.120\nAll right?\n\n76\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.320\nThat kinda deep blue and now it is bold.\n\n77\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.270\nSo it's either two underscores\nfollowed by two underscores or\n\n78\n00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.040\ntwo asterisks followed by two asterisks.\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin,\n\n79\n00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.650\nI got a question on this one.\n\n80\n00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.490\nIf you're going to use one or\nthe other, do you have your preference?\n\n81\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.789\nOr is there a recommendation?\n&gt;&gt; So actually provide my recommendation,\n\n82\n00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.760\nkeep in min this is bias this\nis kinda how I think about it.\n\n83\n00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.599\nYou can definitely choose this.\n\n84\n00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.190\nWhat I do for\nbolding is I use the asterisk.\n\n85\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.720\nSo asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.\n\n86\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.650\nI use that for bold.\n\n87\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.540\nLikewise, because this could be easily\nconfused with italicize in the previous\n\n88\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.780\nepisode, we saw the underscores,\nand single underscores and\n\n89\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.040\nsingle asterisk could provide Italicizing,\nright?\n\n90\n00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.540\nThe reason I used two asterisk for\nbolding is now if I want to mix these,\n\n91\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.720\nI can go underscore and\ncome here and underscore save, and\n\n92\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.490\nnow I have bold and italicized.\n\n93\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.530\nAnd I find this easier to read\nthan something like this.\n\n94\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.870\nThree underscores,\nthree underscores, just like so.\n\n95\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.930\nIt's still bold and italicized but\n\n96\n00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.230\nat a quick glance I may not\nknow that those are three.\n\n97\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.514\nNow you could definitely\nflip flop that but\n\n98\n00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:34.710\nI use double asterisks for that reason.\n\n99\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.410\nBut also if I'm scanning\nthrough my document,\n\n100\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.790\nmy roll markdown document I can\nquickly look and go, that's bold.\n\n101\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.168\nThese other things are,\nthose are italicized and\n\n102\n00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:52.590\nthn like this one that's an underscore and\nasterisk, that's bold and italicized.\n\n103\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.250\nAnd it gives me a visual cue.\n\n104\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.310\nSo that's my recommendation.\n\n105\n00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.580\nYou're more than welcome to do things like\nthis, three asterisk or three underscores.\n\n106\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.110\nAnd you will still get the same\nresults because both of those\n\n107\n00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.720\ncharacters are counted, they're paired\nup like two and two, boom-bold.\n\n108\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.530\nOne and one, italicized.\n\n109\n00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.580\nAnd then it just kinda parses those apart.\n\n110\n00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.620\nNow, something further that I want to,\nyou can mix and match these.\n\n111\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.870\nLet's say that I want this\nentire section in bold,\n\n112\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.000\nbecause this entire section is important.\n\n113\n00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.960\nBut I only want a subsection\nof this to be italicized.\n\n114\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.810\nI can come here, and say underscore\nunderscore around important.\n\n115\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.040\nAnd if I come back I now have\nan entire bolded section but\n\n116\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.060\nthen a subsection that is italicized.\n\n117\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.540\nLikewise I can flip that around.\n\n118\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.720\nSo I can make this underscore,\nmake this one underscore\n\n119\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.060\nand the bold the interior\nsection just like so, right?\n\n120\n00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.310\nSo now I have an italicize and\na subsection bolded.\n\n121\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.470\nSo do keep in mind, even though I'm\ntypically showing these small snippets of\n\n122\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.510\ntexts, it can be internal\nto whatever you're writing.\n\n123\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.630\nI can say, I just want this section.\n\n124\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.840\nWherever I open and close those\nrespective sections, there we go.\n\n125\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.780\nAll right?\n\n126\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.240\nNow the final thing, let's say that this\nimportant is like a programmatic term.\n\n127\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.730\nI know that when I'm programming or\nwriting README documents for\n\n128\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.380\nrepos, that there are times\nwhere the underscore or\n\n129\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.540\nthe asterisk is actually\npart of the syntax.\n\n130\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.230\nIt's something that I wanna draw\nattention to, escape is the backslash.\n\n131\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.830\nBackslash, right, Wes?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n132\n00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.320\nIt's a backslash.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n133\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320\nI'm glad he's here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.670\n&gt;&gt; Because I mess that up all the time.\n\n135\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.394\nSo if I put a backslash there,\nI now have a bolded section,\n\n136\n00:07:44.394 --> 00:07:47.740\nbut the bolding actually\ndoesn't also italicize.\n\n137\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.710\nI'm saying, hey I don't want to use\nthe underscores as part of my format.\n\n138\n00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.880\nI wanna escape just those.\n\n139\n00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.258\nSo don't get too hung up on,\nif I put an escape\n\n140\n00:07:59.258 --> 00:08:04.518\ncharacter here and\nan escape character here.\n\n141\n00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:05.603\nYou have to be careful,\n\n142\n00:08:05.603 --> 00:08:09.680\nyou have to escape every character that\nyou want to not be part of the formatting.\n\n143\n00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.360\nSo do remember that.\n\n144\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.070\nAnd if you use an editor,\nrich text editor, the S Code, Atom,\n\n145\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.700\na lot of times they'll give\nyou these nice visual cues.\n\n146\n00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.650\nAs you're typing in your markdown\nabout what's gonna happen.\n\n147\n00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.760\nHere if I see this dark blue,\nhey I'm still bolding the text.\n\n148\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.650\nBut if I see this orange,\nthe backslash and\n\n149\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.790\nthe character right after it are both\norange so I'm escaping those characters.\n\n150\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.430\nSo something to keep in mind.\n\n151\n00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.330\nBut you can combine these.\n\n152\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.740\nPretty easy to bold, my recommendation\nis use asterisks for bolding and\n\n153\n00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.910\nunderscores for italicizing, and\nthat allows you to keep your\n\n154\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.697\nseparation concerns appropriate.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that when I used markdown\n\n155\n00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.602\nmyself the three asterisks on both\nsides does get a little bit confusing.\n\n156\n00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:58.975\nSo as far as a recommendation it's for\nthe visibility of your raw markdown versus\n\n157\n00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:03.880\nwhat you're seeing in the preview.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and it helps me.\n\n158\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.510\nAgain, I use double asterisk for\nbold, underscores for italicized.\n\n159\n00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.790\nYou could easily say, well I want\ndouble underscores for bold and\n\n160\n00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.220\nsingle asterisk for italicized.\n\n161\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.293\nJust having a different character, and\nI think to some extent that's why they're\n\n162\n00:09:18.293 --> 00:09:21.335\nthere, allows you,\nlike you said in your raw markdown to go.\n\n163\n00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:23.750\nOkay, these are the conventions\nthat I have adopted.\n\n164\n00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.100\nIt's all good to go and, well, Wes,\n\n165\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.640\nthat is all we need to know\nabout bolding thus far.\n\n166\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.510\nThese will continue to build upon each\nother,but hopefully that's a nice little\n\n167\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.710\ntake away for you.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n168\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.610\na lot of great information, Justin, here.\n\n169\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.910\nWe appreciated having you in the studios\nwith us on how you can put some emphasis\n\n170\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.130\non your text and look forward to seeing\nthe episodes that are yet to come.\n\n171\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.960\nSo we appreciate again,\nlike I said having you here, and\n\n172\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.140\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n173\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.420\nSigning out here at DevProTV remember\nI've been your host, Wes

00:00:18.250\nin today's episode we got\na great show in store for you.\n\n4\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.824\nThat's right we're gonna come back with\nmore of that markdown, and showing us how\n\n5\n00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.529\nto put a little bit of emphasis on\nour text is none other than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.365\nJustin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.856\nJustin, how we doing today sir?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic Wes and\n\n8\n00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:29.700\nhow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.552\nOver the last couple of episodes you've\nshown us some different ways that we can\n\n10\n00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:35.287\ndo things like italicize our text.\n\n11\n00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.869\nWe can also bold our text, right, but\nwe have some others that have yet\n\n12\n00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.300\nto be discovered and you're gonna\nhelp us out with those, right?\n\n13\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.835\n&gt;&gt; Well, I plan to, we'll see it goes.\n\n14\n00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:48.380\n[LAUGH] Who knows what'll happen,\nbut let me set the scene for you.\n\n15\n00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.737\nWe have some bolding, some italicizing,\n\n16\n00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:53.424\nwe've seen tose in the past\nocuple of episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:56.200\nBut there are times,\nespecially in documentation for\n\n18\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.493\nsome kind of technical procedure, or\neven, I'm a developer, so documentation.\n\n19\n00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:04.464\nNo one likes to write documentation,\nbut you should, and what'll happen is,\n\n20\n00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.470\nyour documentation will change over time.\n\n21\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.700\nSomething you said originally\nmay no longer be true, but\n\n22\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.960\nit might be helpful if you're like, I need\nto reference this, keep this in here.\n\n23\n00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.390\nSo here's my recommendation.\n\n24\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.439\nIf you have some kind of technical\ndocumentation that has a change,\n\n25\n00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.711\na tiny little piece of it has changed,\n\n26\n00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:29.257\ninstead of erasing it you can use\nstrike-throughs to make a modification,\n\n27\n00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:33.752\nbut that way you can say, this is what\nit used to be, here's what it is now.\n\n28\n00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:38.371\nNow, don't go crazy with this, but\nthis is something that may be helpful.\n\n29\n00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:39.794\nSo, what do I mean by strike-through?\n\n30\n00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:41.589\nWell, it's just a line through the text.\n\n31\n00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:46.658\nIt's saying it was there, but disregard\nit, and maybe here's the follow-up.\n\n32\n00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:48.818\nI enjoy this because I don't have to go,\n\n33\n00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:53.282\nbut that says something different than it\nused to, I can't remember what it says.\n\n34\n00:01:53.282 --> 00:01:56.797\nIf it's striked through it\nallows me just to do a quick\n\n35\n00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:59.440\ncomparison.\n&gt;&gt; I work heavily with certification\n\n36\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.070\nexams, and there are times when those\ncertification exams will change,\n\n37\n00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.106\nwill update to reflect a new feature, and\nI know it is very, very handy, Justin,\n\n38\n00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.790\nwhen I have to say, okay, what's\nthe correlation with the old exam versus\n\n39\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.800\nwhat we're seeing now, and those\nstrike-throughs they really come in handy.\n\n40\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.785\nSo I'm with you there, being able\nto instantly see what was old and\n\n41\n00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:20.095\nwhat is the new, and\nbeing able to compare the two.\n\n42\n00:02:20.095 --> 00:02:21.518\n&gt;&gt; And maybe you only keep this for\n\n43\n00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:22.893\none version change, right?\n\n44\n00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:25.093\nIf you're like, I'm gonna strike\nthrough this, here's the new one.\n\n45\n00:02:25.093 --> 00:02:29.447\nIf there's an additional change, go remove\nthe old strike-through, because it's\n\n46\n00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:33.323\nway in the past now, strike-through\nwhat you had and add the new change, but\n\n47\n00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:36.740\nwe've provided impetus, but\nhow do we actually accomplish that?\n\n48\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.172\nSo let's go and\ncome to the screen here and take a look.\n\n49\n00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:43.031\nSo I'm gonna create a new document\ninside of my GitHub markdown folder, and\n\n50\n00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:44.820\nI'm gonna say strike-through.\n\n51\n00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.775\nI'm not in my in my, [SOUND] I'm not being\nreal creative today, but that's all right.\n\n52\n00:02:50.775 --> 00:02:56.711\nSo, Here is some documentation,\n\n53\n00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:01.623\nall right, to provide, and\n\n54\n00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:05.103\nthen, let's say,\n\n55\n00:03:05.103 --> 00:03:11.464\nYou should start the app with start.\n\n56\n00:03:11.464 --> 00:03:15.708\nHorrible, nonsensical, but\nmaybe a little more applicable than,\n\n57\n00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:17.618\nhere's some documentation.\n\n58\n00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:19.540\nSo here, you should start the app.\n\n59\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.010\nNow, if we open our preview, again,\nI'm gonna open up that Quick Menu,\n\n60\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.570\nwhich is CMD+Shift+P for Mac users,\nCtrl+Shift+P for other users.\n\n61\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.700\nThat nice little menu bar.\n\n62\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.690\nThat's all I have, right?\n\n63\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.920\nWell, if I wanna keep this, but say,\n\n64\n00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.430\nyou should start the app with go,\nnow I have a decision to make.\n\n65\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.190\nDo I mark out this entire thing,\nor do I just mark out start?\n\n66\n00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.510\nMy recommendation is, just for\n\n67\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.270\ncomparison, it would be a little easier if\nI did a strike-through on this portion,\n\n68\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.460\nand then right down below it, or\nright next to, it wrote my replacement.\n\n69\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.515\nNow how do I strike-through?\n\n70\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.070\nWell I have ~~ and\nlet's see if that actually comes out.\n\n71\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.066\nNotice it is now struck through,\nall right, so what is ~~?\n\n72\n00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.677\nWell, ~ is usually right\nnext to your 1 key.\n\n73\n00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:14.570\nIt's shift, you do the back tick\nthat's something different, but\n\n74\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.460\nit's the little squiggle.\n\n75\n00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.711\nBecause of my background,\nthat means a whole bunch of stuff,\n\n76\n00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:25.123\nand depending on the context,\nbut here, if I write two of them,\n\n77\n00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:29.375\nthat means strike through, and\nlet's say you replace that,\n\n78\n00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:34.979\nyou should start the app with go, all\nright, and this is very context specific.\n\n79\n00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.690\nNotice you should to\nstart the app with go.\n\n80\n00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.308\nThat's right next to it.\n\n81\n00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:39.940\nSo this is what it used to be.\n\n82\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.640\nThis is what it is now.\n\n83\n00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.873\nThis is handy for comparison.\n\n84\n00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:50.174\nNow there's nothing that limits this to\nonly having all of this entire thing.\n\n85\n00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:54.112\nWhat if I, instead for my use case, I was\nlike, you know what, I'm not gonna rewrite\n\n86\n00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:58.560\nthis you should start the app with start,\nI'm gonna rewrite this, I don't want that.\n\n87\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.030\nI just want to strike out start and\nreplace it with go.\n\n88\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.580\nWell does this work in line to the text?\n\n89\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.880\nI'm a big proponent of let's\ntry it out and find out.\n\n90\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.197\nSpoiler alert, I know the answer.\n\n91\n00:05:12.197 --> 00:05:14.391\n[LAUGH] So if I add a tilda threre,\n\n92\n00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:19.285\nI can actually strike through only\nsub-portions of a section of text.\n\n93\n00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:25.716\nSo ~~, and then until it finds another ~~,\nthat's what's gonna be struck through.\n\n94\n00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:27.940\nSo I can strike through sub-portions.\n\n95\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.000\nI can come over here, rewrite go, and\nI should probably add a space there, and\n\n96\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.330\nnow I should, you should start\nthe app with not start, but go.\n\n97\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.620\nThat is another possibility.\n\n98\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.440\nI can also combine these with\nprevious things that I've seen.\n\n99\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.768\nWhat if I want go to be bolded?\n\n100\n00:05:47.768 --> 00:05:51.696\nWell, there's bold,\nthere's bold, but in order for\n\n101\n00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:55.970\nthese to stay consistent,\nmaybe I had a bold start, right?\n\n102\n00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.040\nThat's a command,\nI want that to jump out at you.\n\n103\n00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.670\nDoes this still work?\n\n104\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.230\nWell, it is now bolded, but\nit is also still struck through, and\n\n105\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.110\nlet me just zoom in there a little bit so\nyou can see.\n\n106\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.307\nYou should start the app with start,\nstill struck through, and then there's go.\n\n107\n00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:14.200\nSo that's incredibly handy.\n\n108\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.807\nNow what I would be careful\nabout is if you go kind\n\n109\n00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:26.080\nof ridiculous on it,\nand add these, like so.\n\n110\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.634\nSo we have bold and italicized,\none of them struck through,\n\n111\n00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:32.224\nand we come back over here,\nit still works.\n\n112\n00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:36.630\nBut I would adopt a convention.\n\n113\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.420\nIf you're going to strike-through\nsomething that is bold and italicized,\n\n114\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.950\nthe strike-through's on the outer part,\nand then your formatting's on the inner,\n\n115\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.150\nso you can totally enclose that section.\n\n116\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.726\nLikewise, I would adopt\nsome convention internally,\n\n117\n00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:54.670\nwhether it's you writing documentation, or\nyour team, or something where you go if\n\n118\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.319\nyou have a bold in italics, it should\nbe italicized, then your bold section.\n\n119\n00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.880\nIf you're mixing these two things.\n\n120\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.360\nNow, we've seen this before, right?\n\n121\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.960\nWhat if I just leave off\none of these tildes.\n\n122\n00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.272\nLet's see what happens there, because,\n\n123\n00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:17.884\nin the last two things it was,\nwell one means this, two means this,\n\n124\n00:07:17.884 --> 00:07:22.668\nI don't know,I don't know, and\nI now actually get a tilde,\n\n125\n00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:27.280\nso a single tilde by itself is\nnot a reserved character set.\n\n126\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.670\nIt just gives me a tilde.\n\n127\n00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.392\nWhy would that be?\n\n128\n00:07:30.392 --> 00:07:37.770\nAnd well, from my background,\nthis takes approximately seven minutes.\n\n129\n00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.670\nSo you may see the tilde used\nas an approximation symbol, and\n\n130\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.820\nif the single symbol was the\nstrike-through symbol, then you're gonna\n\n131\n00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.040\nget weird behavior, like well, you haven't\nended the symbol yet, where does it go to?\n\n132\n00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.520\nSo intentionally it's tilde,\ntilde that is the strike-through portion.\n\n133\n00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.020\nIf by chance you really\nwanted to emphasize that\n\n134\n00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.810\nit's approximately seven minutes,\nthen if you put tilde, tilde,\n\n135\n00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.330\nlet's see what happens there, and\nthere we go, we haven't ended it.\n\n136\n00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.772\nIt still doesn't pair up.\n\n137\n00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:16.744\nThe only time you would need an escape\ncharacter here is if you wanted to\n\n138\n00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:22.647\nsurround these with tilde, tildes, but\nyou didn't want the strike-through and\n\n139\n00:08:22.647 --> 00:08:26.738\nyou would have to escape\nthese individual pieces here.\n\n140\n00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:30.598\nNotice I escaped everyone of them just\nto make sure I come back over here and\n\n141\n00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:32.588\nnow I have tilde tilde, tilde tilde,\n\n142\n00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:35.115\nand we're all good to go.\n&gt;&gt; You know Justin in some\n\n143\n00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:38.481\nof the other episodes you showed\nus with setting an italicised, or\n\n144\n00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.287\nif you're talking about bolding your text,\nyou have a couple of options.\n\n145\n00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:45.091\nYou've got some variations and\nit's up to you which one you use.\n\n146\n00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.080\nDo we have that with the strike-through?\n&gt;&gt; This is one of\n\n147\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.854\nthose kind of more edge cases.\n\n148\n00:08:49.854 --> 00:08:54.320\nStrike-through, as far as I know Wes,\nI'm not saying it's not out there,\n\n149\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.290\nI've looked a great deal, tilde,\ntilde is the strike-through operator.\n\n150\n00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.680\nIt's not a common one so,\nand a lot of times,\n\n151\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.330\nif I'm being completely transparent, the\nreason we have two characters for bold and\n\n152\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.170\nitalicize is so\nyou can mix and match them.\n\n153\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.170\nStrike-through is it what it is.\n\n154\n00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.515\nThat's it.\n\n155\n00:09:14.515 --> 00:09:20.010\nSo ~~, ~~, do keep in mind we're\ntalking about GitHub flavored markdown.\n\n156\n00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.341\nIf I'm not mistaken this is one of\nthose that, in other markdown flavors,\n\n157\n00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:27.917\nyou may get different behaviors with ~~,\nand either side,\n\n158\n00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:30.964\nmaybe not a strike-through,\nbut something else.\n\n159\n00:09:30.964 --> 00:09:32.910\nSo do remember that.\n\n160\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.096\nAll GitHub flavored markdown for\nall the things we're showing you here.\n\n161\n00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:36.602\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n162\n00:09:36.602 --> 00:09:39.847\na lot of great episodes there when it\ncomes to placing emphasis on your text.\n\n163\n00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:41.980\nWe hope that you have enjoyed it.\n\n164\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.360\nNow Justin it does look we're coming\nto the end of another episode, but\n\n165\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.200\nbefore we do, do you have any additional\nwords maybe you'd like to impart to\n\n166\n00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.790\nthe viewers before we sign out?\n&gt;&gt; Well the entire impetus of this is\n\n167\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.460\nI need to learn enough to\nwrite a markdown document, and\n\n168\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.270\nthen it can be output to a more\nkind of nice, pretty document.\n\n169\n00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.430\nThe really key point about\nmarkdown is it's just plain text,\n\n170\n00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.364\nuntil it goes through some\nkind of transformation step.\n\n171\n00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:07.740\nI can hand this to Wes,\nhe can open it on his computer.\n\n172\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.730\nI can hand it to some of the production\nteam, they can open it on their computer,\n\n173\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.990\nwith just a standard text editor.\n\n174\n00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.123\nIt's not like other formats that\nare specific to an application, and\n\n175\n00:10:17.123 --> 00:10:19.795\nhave encoding embedded in them and\nwhatnot.\n\n176\n00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:24.414\nSo, learning markdown, you're like,\nwhy do I need to learn this when I have\n\n177\n00:10:24.414 --> 00:10:29.534\nMicrosoft Word, or LibreOffice, or,\nthis allows you the nice transportability,\n\n178\n00:10:29.534 --> 00:10:32.332\nbut also has a lot tooling\nto make things nice.\n\n179\n00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:36.995\nAs I said in our previous episode,\nI can get a PDF, an HTML, I can get a pub,\n\n180\n00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:41.732\na Moby, all kinds of output formats and\nonly have to know one markdown syntax\n\n181\n00:10:41.732 --> 00:10:46.691\nwith a couple of edge cases, cuz there\nare a different flavors among those, but\n\n182\n00:10:46.691 --> 00:10:51.390\nwhatever you adopt, and when you have\nthat, you just write in plain text.\n\n183\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.590\nYou don't have to worry about selecting,\nand it's very fine grain, and then you can\n\n184\n00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.780\njust output as many types of information\nor types of documents as you need.\n\n185\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.893\nI find it incredibly handy, and really\nversatile, and that's kind of my spiel for\n\n186\n00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:06.454\nmarkdown.\n&gt;&gt; All right Justin,\n\n187\n00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:09.919\nas always we appreciate having you\nin here in the studios with us, and\n\n188\n00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.331\nwe appreciate having you\nthe viewer watching.\n\n189\n00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:16.120\nHopefully we're helping you increase your\nproductivity when it comes to markdown,\n\n190\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.926\nbut until we see again, signing out for\nDevPro.TV, I've been your host Wes Bryan,\n\n191\n00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:20.724\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison,\n\n192\n00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:22.628\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n193\n00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:28.114\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to DevProTV,\nI'm your host Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.565\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in Markdown.\n\n5\n00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:23.956\nAnd that's right, we're gonna be\nlooking at adding external links.\n\n6\n00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.372\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\nthis very endeavor is none other than Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:28.225\nJustin Dennison.\n\n8\n00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:31.065\nAnd, Justin, how we doing today sir?\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.165\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm doing great.\n\n10\n00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.690\nWe've kind of kicked off Markdown, and\nwe've looked at various topics, right?\n\n11\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.500\nBut when it comes to\nadding external links,\n\n12\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.860\nI have to tell you, I'm really\nnot exactly sure how to do that.\n\n13\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.446\nSo I'm hoping that you're\ngonna take over from there.\n\n14\n00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:45.533\n&gt;&gt; Well, here's hoping,\n\n15\n00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.340\nbecause I definitely thought you\nwere gonna host this episode.\n\n16\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.623\nBut we'll wing it and\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n17\n00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:52.550\nNo, I jest, I jest.\n\n18\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.730\nSo external links,\nwhat do I mean by external links?\n\n19\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.040\nWell, it's a hyperlink to\nan external site, that's all I mean.\n\n20\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.790\nNow, the external site could be\nactually another site that you own.\n\n21\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.310\nOr another site that's some where else.\n\n22\n00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.536\nOr if you're actually on GitHub,\nor another website that renders\n\n23\n00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:15.781\nMarkdown into HTML, it can link\nto other Markdown pieces, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:18.520\nSo it's gonna be hard to show but\n\n25\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.580\nyou'll have to take a leap of faith on me,\njust for that.\n\n26\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.025\nNow, eventually, we may circle back around\nand do a little more set up here, but\n\n27\n00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:28.560\nI really wanna focus on the syntax.\n\n28\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.463\nAnd not so much the setup of, well,\n\n29\n00:01:30.463 --> 00:01:34.399\nthis is how you put Markdown on GitHub,\nor on Bitbucket, or on GitLab, or\n\n30\n00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.170\nany of those other plethora of\nsites that render Markdown as HTML.\n\n31\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.920\nThat's not the goal, I just wanna\nshow you how to make external links.\n\n32\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.970\nI will tell you Wes,\n\n33\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.500\nthe first thing to show you is probably\ngonna be a little underwhelming.\n\n34\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.840\nBut that's all right,\nyou've been forewarned.\n\n35\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.530\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here.\n\n36\n00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.670\nAnd I have my editor open, and let's just\ncreate a new file called external links.\n\n37\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.733\nNow, do remember,\nhaving that Markdown syntax is important,\n\n38\n00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.720\nso .md, don't forget that.\n\n39\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.880\nAnd then, I’m just gonna close\nthis out real quick, all right?\n\n40\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.740\nSo let’s say that I want to\nlink to GitHub, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.150\nThat’s very appropriate, because well,\n\n42\n00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.660\nwe’re going to use\nGitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\n43\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.760\nNow, this should work in most\nof the other Markdown flavors.\n\n44\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.330\nThis is not necessarily\nGitHub Flavored specific.\n\n45\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.300\nThis will only crop up from time to time.\n\n46\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.400\nBut if I save,\nI've just typed a web address.\n\n47\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.740\nYou're like, Justin,\nthat doesn't look like very much.\n\n48\n00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.924\nBut let's come here and open the preview\nto the side, and look at that.\n\n49\n00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:44.460\nMarkdown, a lot of times will say hey,\nthis looks like a web address.\n\n50\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.790\nLet's go ahead and\nmake that a hyperlink for you.\n\n51\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.770\nAnd that's exactly what it does.\n\n52\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.620\nAnd if I were to click this,\n\n53\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.780\nthis would open up a Chrome browser,\ntake me to GitHub, and it's all good.\n\n54\n00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.120\nThat's actually all you have to do,\nWes, to have external links.\n\n55\n00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.577\nI will say though,\nthere's some issues, right?\n\n56\n00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:07.571\nDo I always have to have www.github.com?\n\n57\n00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.940\nWhat if I wanna link that just says,\nGitHub, but it links to github.com?\n\n58\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.870\nThis is not the best way, but\nyou should be aware of this.\n\n59\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.380\nBecause if you type something\nthat looks like a web address\n\n60\n00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.940\ninside of your Markdown file, you put\nit on GitHub, put it on Bitbucket, or\n\n61\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.140\nany of the other sites,\nit will actually turn it into a link.\n\n62\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.710\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n63\n00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.580\nSo this is our first way\nto create an external link.\n\n64\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.320\nIt's just write the web address and\nit happens.\n\n65\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.060\nAnd you're like, well,\nthat's actually pretty easy, it is.\n\n66\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.530\nBut let's say that I wanna give\nit a different name, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.730\nI want to send to GitHub, but\ninstead of it being www.github.com,\n\n68\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.900\nI actually want the word, GitHub stylized.\n\n69\n00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.255\nSo if we make some square brackets here,\nand I want to keep these side by side,\n\n70\n00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:55.065\nbecause I think that's handy.\n\n71\n00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:58.294\nBut I'm gonna zoom in just for a moment,\nso we can make sure we see all of this.\n\n72\n00:03:58.294 --> 00:04:03.390\nTwo [] and then,\nI'm going to type here, all right?\n\n73\n00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.220\nAnd I'm coming outside of\nthose square brackets.\n\n74\n00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.030\nAnd then, I'm going to put ().\n\n75\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.170\nNotice my editor auto-completes\nleft right parentheses.\n\n76\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.322\nSo I have square brackets,\nwhat I'm trying to type,\n\n77\n00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:22.478\nand then in here,\nI'm gonna say www.github.com.\n\n78\n00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:28.150\nThat's it, and now, I have what's\nin the square brackets as text.\n\n79\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.090\nBut it actually is a link to github.com.\n\n80\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.038\nNow, because I'm using this\non a local file system,\n\n81\n00:04:34.038 --> 00:04:37.128\nit's kind of like doing some\nadditional things for me.\n\n82\n00:04:37.128 --> 00:04:44.420\nSo if you do that, if I'm not mistaken,\nif you put the full, there, wait for it.\n\n83\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.720\nNow, it's not gonna give me the,\nthere we go.\n\n84\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.075\nNotice, by putting the https:// it doesn't\nassume that I'm talking about a folder or\n\n85\n00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.418\na file with that name.\n\n86\n00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.610\nIt actually says, that's a web URL.\n\n87\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.110\nSo do keep that in mind if\nyou're testing this locally.\n\n88\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.620\nAnd you should probably just go ahead and\n\n89\n00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.900\nbe very explicit about that,\ninstead of just leaving that off.\n\n90\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.560\nLike sometimes, I admit that I do.\n\n91\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.180\nAnd who knows where we end up, right?\n\n92\n00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.630\nSo I have this, if I want different text,\nI can put that text here,\n\n93\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.080\nand then in parenthesis following it,\nI put what web address I want it to be.\n\n94\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.937\nNow, there's additional\ndescriptors that I can put.\n\n95\n00:05:27.937 --> 00:05:30.950\nNo, I lied,\nI'm thinking of something else.\n\n96\n00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.170\nWhat I am gonna talk about is, let's say,\nthat now I wanna go to Google, right?\n\n97\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.760\nThere's Google, just like that.\n\n98\n00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.890\nBut I don't wanna put that link in line.\n\n99\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:47.045\nLet's say that I want to reuse Google,\nor the link for Google, multiple times.\n\n100\n00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.410\nWell, you're like, that's easy.\n\n101\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.537\nYou just type it and\nyou say, www.google.com.\n\n102\n00:05:53.537 --> 00:05:56.050\nAnd then, you just copy and\npaste that everywhere, right?\n\n103\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.740\nSo this is some text.\n\n104\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.640\nThe following is the link to and\nthen, boom!\n\n105\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.930\nRight, we can put that\nin line just like that.\n\n106\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.560\nBut notice I have this duplication.\n\n107\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.696\nThat's kind of weird, right?\n\n108\n00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:17.060\nNot necessarily what we want.\n\n109\n00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.480\nIt would be nice if instead of having to\nput this parenthesis with the link to\n\n110\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.480\nthe web address, if we could just put the\nsquare brackets, have it render the link,\n\n111\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.129\nbecause it knows what it is.\n\n112\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.630\nBut you do still have to\nsend it to the web address.\n\n113\n00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.760\nNow, what do I mean,\nI want to just type this, like that.\n\n114\n00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:45.570\nAnd then let's say, I wanted to say here's\nanother link To Google, just like that.\n\n115\n00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.650\nYou look at the preview.\n\n116\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.243\nBecause I do not have those parenthesis,\nI don't have a link to that web address.\n\n117\n00:06:52.243 --> 00:06:54.470\nI don't know what that is.\n\n118\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.420\nWell, anywhere in your document, and\nI like to kinda put these at the bottom.\n\n119\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.399\nIf we now type Google, and\n\n120\n00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:11.574\nyou say https://www.google.com, and boom!\n\n121\n00:07:11.574 --> 00:07:13.670\nWe got some weirdness here.\n\n122\n00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:20.231\nSo let's look, and we got Google, what?\n\n123\n00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:26.617\nWell, let's go, I am sorry, not that.\n\n124\n00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:29.492\nBut instead, it should be.\n\n125\n00:07:29.492 --> 00:07:31.070\nYou know what, Wes?\n\n126\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.956\nI think I'm missing\na couple of characters.\n\n127\n00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:36.780\nSo I wanna back up just to bring\nsome clarity to what I'm saying.\n\n128\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.090\nSomewhere else in my document,\nI can now write this link.\n\n129\n00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.680\nSo notice it's [Google],\njust like I have up here.\n\n130\n00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.974\nAnd let's move this over just\na little bit so we can see.\n\n131\n00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:51.360\nSo [Google], and\n\n132\n00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.910\nthen here's the difference, colon,\nI'm essentially making a definition.\n\n133\n00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.320\nWhat does [Google] mean?\n\n134\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.742\nWell, it means everywhere\nyou see [Google],\n\n135\n00:08:02.742 --> 00:08:05.712\nmake sure that this link is there, right?\n\n136\n00:08:05.712 --> 00:08:11.450\nNow, you'll notice, if I take this\ncolon off, I get this [Google], right?\n\n137\n00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.090\nI feel kind of odd saying square\nbracket Google, but that's all right.\n\n138\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.490\nIf I put the colon back on,\nthey now become links.\n\n139\n00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:25.440\nLikewise, if I forget any piece of this,\nthey don't work anymore.\n\n140\n00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.619\nThis just doesn't work.\n\n141\n00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:31.500\nAnd if I put them back, I do.\n\n142\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.718\nNow, the following question to that is,\nif it's so\n\n143\n00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:41.235\nspecific, what if I make\nthis a lower case g?\n\n144\n00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.652\nI make this a lower case g,\nthat's kind of odd.\n\n145\n00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:49.116\nSo the delimitation, the bracket\ndelimitation, the colon, all of it,\n\n146\n00:08:49.116 --> 00:08:53.446\nthat's very specific, but\nit looks like it's matching pretty good.\n\n147\n00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:56.043\nAnd just to make sure,\nlet's close this out.\n\n148\n00:08:56.043 --> 00:09:00.954\nWe're just gonna make sure and\nwe're gonna, maybe,\n\n149\n00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:04.920\nopen preview to the side and\nit still works.\n\n150\n00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.790\nSo this isn't as much,\nit doesn't have to be a single word.\n\n151\n00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.240\nBut it doesn't look like case has\nas much bearing as other times.\n\n152\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.515\nBut what if I want to do a multiple\nphrase, like HERE IS GOOGLE.\n\n153\n00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:24.413\nAnd apparently I wanna yell it.\n\n154\n00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:29.085\nSo HERE IS GOOGLE: and then https,\n\n155\n00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:32.200\nI'm still yelling it,\n\n156\n00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.201\nwww.google.com, just like that.\n\n157\n00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.230\nAnd notice that entire phrase has\nbeen matched, has now been changed.\n\n158\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:47.370\nAnd this is incredibly handy if I want to\nreuse these links just by this little tag,\n\n159\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.330\nright, this little shortened version.\n\n160\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:55.074\nSo I don't have to replicate\nthis portion over,\n\n161\n00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:58.207\nand over, and over again, so,\n\n162\n00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:04.340\nHere is now a fun time,\njust to make sure, here is google.\n\n163\n00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.570\nAnd notice, these are all lowercase\nletters, these are all uppercase letters.\n\n164\n00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.430\nIt still matches those, case doesn't\nmatch, but the syntax is very important.\n\n165\n00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.270\nSo if I wanna make external links,\nI can do a couple of things.\n\n166\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:22.599\nI can square bracket, the name,\nsquare bracket, and then parenthesis,\n\n167\n00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:28.034\nput the URL in those parenthesis\ndirectly after, I can do that.\n\n168\n00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:30.220\nI can actually just type the URL.\n\n169\n00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:38.020\nIt will not rename, but it will just\ngive me a link version of that URL.\n\n170\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.950\nSo it's looking for that.\n\n171\n00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:45.400\nAnd then otherwise,\nI can do this definition style, right?\n\n172\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.300\nSo if I have Google in square brackets,\nand then a colon.\n\n173\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.530\nAnd then what that means,\neither the bottom, the top,\n\n174\n00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.130\nsomewhere in your document, it goes,\nall right that's a definition.\n\n175\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.900\nEverywhere I see [Google],\nnot case sensitive, replace that with\n\n176\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.680\nthe linked version, right, the linkified\nversion, if that's even a word.\n\n177\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.510\nAnd now, that will work, okay?\n\n178\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.868\nSo that's how those things,\nas far as external links, behave.\n\n179\n00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:17.991\nAnd well, with those three you should\nbe have all of your bases covered,\n\n180\n00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.270\nat least initially.\n\n181\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.070\nNow, this is not a full deep dive but\nthis is to get you started.\n\n182\n00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.928\nHere's a few things to take away.\n\n183\n00:11:24.928 --> 00:11:26.220\nStart writing your Markdown files,\n\n184\n00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.440\nespecially if you need\nlinks to external sites.\n\n185\n00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.780\nWhich, if you're writing documentation,\nis typically the case.\n\n186\n00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.114\n&gt;&gt; I could have used that advice, myself,\n\n187\n00:11:34.114 --> 00:11:36.174\nin some of my Markdown documents and\n\n188\n00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:40.583\nnot littering the entire document up\nwith URLs and addresses galore there.\n\n189\n00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:43.106\nSo we appreciate that information,\nthere, Justin.\n\n190\n00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:43.845\nBefore we sign out,\n\n191\n00:11:43.845 --> 00:11:46.640\ndo you have any additional words maybe\nyou'd like to impart to our viewers?\n\n192\n00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.858\nCuz I know we got a lot more to come.\n&gt;&gt; Over this course of this series,\n\n193\n00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:52.600\nwe're gonna see, I could do that, and\nI could do that, and I could do that.\n\n194\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.940\nMy word of recommendation is\nfind the things like Wes just,\n\n195\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.800\nI have URLs all over the place.\n\n196\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.570\nPick this one, use this one to clean\nup your Markdown documents to make them\n\n197\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.180\na little more readable, a little\neasier to go, that's how that works.\n\n198\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.330\nAnd in that way, you become\na little more efficient with time.\n\n199\n00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.670\nDon't try to do everything,\nI figured out this little trick.\n\n200\n00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.340\nEverything at once, don't do that.\n\n201\n00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.410\nPick up little snippets that you make\nyou more productive, more efficient.\n\n202\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.790\nAnd then run with those until\nyou feel comfortable, and then,\n\n203\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.770\npick up the next one.\n&gt;&gt; Well, time has come there, Justin,\n\n204\n00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.450\nparting is such sweet sorrow.\n\n205\n00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.350\nBut it does look like we have come\nto the end of yet another episode.\n\n206\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.900\nWe appreciate having you,\nthe viewer, here watching.\n\n207\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.550\nKeep in mind that we've got plenty more\nto come in our series on Markdown.\n\n208\n00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.867\nBut until we see you again, signing\noff for DevProTV, I've been your host,\n\n209\n00:12:39.867 --> 00:12:41.087\nWes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n210\n00:12:41.087 --> 00:12:42.751\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n211\n00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:47.651\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

sir?\n\n8\n00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:29.410\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing fantastic Wes,\nand how are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.590\n&gt;&gt; Hey I'm doing great, we've been\ntalking about a lot of different topics,\n\n10\n00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.830\nthings like external links,\nand some of the basics here.\n\n11\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.470\nBut we're gonna be talking\nabout creating headings.\n\n12\n00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are going to be talking\nabout creating headings, and\n\n13\n00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.360\nwhat do I mean by headings?\n\n14\n00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.670\nWell, for the most part,\nwe think of them as headers.\n\n15\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.470\nBut I'm using the word\nheadings specifically\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.740\nbecause of what they translate to,\nall right?\n\n17\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.540\nSo if you come to a document whether\nit's marked down or whatever.\n\n18\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.290\nYou have like these respective levels\nof large text that is typically bold.\n\n19\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.564\nAnd then if you have subsections you get a\nlittle bit smaller text, it might be bold.\n\n20\n00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.213\nThen if you have subsections in there,\nyou have a little bit smaller text and\n\n21\n00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:07.589\nthey're kind of bold also.\n\n22\n00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:09.790\nAnd then after they may not be bold but\n\n23\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.945\nessentially it's to set\noff respective sections.\n\n24\n00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:17.560\nIt's to give tips to the hierarchical\nstructure of your document, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.502\nSo a chapter might have\nvery large heading text.\n\n26\n00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:24.323\nBut if there are subsections in the\nchapter depending on what you're writing,\n\n27\n00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.030\nyou may need a little bit smaller texts,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.510\nAnd then inside of those if you have\nlittle chunks that need to be set aside,\n\n29\n00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.000\nyou can have smaller sets of text.\n\n30\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.610\nSo how does one do this if you're in HTML?\n\n31\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010\nIt's a little more involved.\n\n32\n00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.099\nIf you're in Word,\nyou gotta highlight and select it.\n\n33\n00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.960\nHowever in markdown,\nmmarkdown makes it easy actually.\n\n34\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.290\nLet's take a look at the screen here and\nsee how it all comes into play.\n\n35\n00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.055\nSo we're gonna create a new document,\nand let's just call it headings.\n\n36\n00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.462\nAnd do keep in mind I'm\nusing that .md right?\n\n37\n00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:04.880\nSo make sure I have my markdown, I am\nkind of gonna harp on that a great deal.\n\n38\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.558\nSomething you saw just flick out of\nthe way, I used a keyboard shortcut.\n\n39\n00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:12.310\nYou can always just click here in\nyour editor to hide and show that,\n\n40\n00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n41\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.570\nNow let's say that I'm building something,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.080\nAnd this is my first chapter,\n\n43\n00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.960\nI'm building Chapter 1, so\nChapter 1 of a technical document.\n\n44\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.160\nSo Chapter 1, notice I put this hash,\n\n45\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.790\nalso known as an octothorpe, or\na pound sign out at the beginning.\n\n46\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.258\nLet's remove that space, as long as I\nhave that, I get some highlighting here.\n\n47\n00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:46.230\nSo Chapter 1: Intro to Markdown,\nall right, whatever it may be.\n\n48\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.740\nNow, let's see how this\nlooks when I do a preview.\n\n49\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.972\nSo that's Cmd+Shift+ P or\nCtrl+Shift+P if you're not on a Mac.\n\n50\n00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:58.897\nI'm gonna open the preview to the side,\nnotice that they're large and bold.\n\n51\n00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:03.166\nThis is a heading one,\na single pound sign, a single octothorpe,\n\n52\n00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.765\nsingle hashtag depending on\nwhat age group you're in.\n\n53\n00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:10.141\nThat means I have a level one heading,\nokay?\n\n54\n00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:13.740\nYou also see these named headers, but\n\n55\n00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.120\nbecause of my background\nI get a little weird.\n\n56\n00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.060\nIf you were to talk to Vonne,\n\n57\n00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.766\nwell, she would probably say,\nwell actually it's this.\n\n58\n00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.750\nSo it kind of depends on the terminology.\n\n59\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.630\nJust know this is top level section.\n\n60\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.860\nNow, inside of this intro to markdown,\nlet's say I come in here and\n\n61\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.030\nI'm like, this is my intro document.\n\n62\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.930\nAnd then here I want to\ntalk about headings, right?\n\n63\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.460\nSo this is a subsection.\n\n64\n00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.950\nNotice I put ## Headings in markdown.\n\n65\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.130\nOkay, so Chapter 1: Intro to Markdown,\nnotice this is a little smaller.\n\n66\n00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.619\nNotice, well it is still bold or it kind\nof looks bold, a little bit smaller.\n\n67\n00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.579\nBut it does set off from\nthe rest of the text, and\n\n68\n00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.100\nI'm going to remove that because\nI want that immediately.\n\n69\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.380\nAnd my editor's showing\nsome selections here.\n\n70\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.770\nThis is not always necessarily guaranteed,\ndepending on the renderer.\n\n71\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.720\nSo there's some differences there,\nso Headings in Markdown.\n\n72\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.760\nAnd I'm gonna say,\nwell there are several types of headings.\n\n73\n00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.300\nThere are several types of headings.\n\n74\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.490\nAnd notice, that is a section,\n\n75\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.250\nkind of this subsection heading, or\nheader, depending on your terminology.\n\n76\n00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.550\nAnd then there's this remaining portion,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.387\nThis is standard text,\nand then if I wanna go,\n\n78\n00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:50.490\nwell, let me talk about heading ones.\n\n79\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.752\nOr better yet, Headings Level 3, notice,\n\n80\n00:04:55.752 --> 00:05:01.151\nif I scroll up here,\nI know have a heading one,\n\n81\n00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.340\nbig, bold, in your face.\n\n82\n00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.450\nThis is to grab your attention.\n\n83\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.340\nWithin that section I have two pound\nsigns, Headings in Markdown, and\n\n84\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.090\nthen I'm going to talk\nabout Headings Level 3.\n\n85\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.000\nI call it level 3 because\nit has three pound signs.\n\n86\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.020\nIf you're from an HTML\nbackground this is an H3,\n\n87\n00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.190\nthat's what these get translated to,\neither respective H1, H2, H3s.\n\n88\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.170\nAnd this is a little bit smaller.\n\n89\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.871\nI am not even sure it is\nstill bold at this point,\n\n90\n00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.386\nit is kinda hard to see\nwith that white text.\n\n91\n00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:37.920\nAnd you continue on and now you want\nto talk about heading fours, right?\n\n92\n00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.869\nHeadings Level 4, and\nnotice that is bold, so\n\n93\n00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.690\nlooking at that I can tell\nthis previous one is not bold.\n\n94\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.857\nThis one is bold but\nthe font size is smaller.\n\n95\n00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:56.066\nSo I got H1, H2, H3, H4 for\nthose from web development land,\n\n96\n00:05:56.066 --> 00:06:02.050\nor a little bit of HTML knowledge or\ntop level heading, first subsection.\n\n97\n00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.150\nA subsection within this subsection and\nthen a subsection within this subsection.\n\n98\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.930\nSo if I want to make this more clear,\nhierarchical things to consider\n\n99\n00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.818\nwith heading 3, okay?\n\n100\n00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:20.230\nSo notice that this is now telling me,\nhey,\n\n101\n00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.050\nwithin this subsection I have this here.\n\n102\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.020\nAnd, well, if you have to guess,\nthere's actually an H5.\n\n103\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.320\nSo, Heading 5.\n\n104\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.840\nTiny, tiny, and these are almost either\nfootnotes or I wanna draw your attention,\n\n105\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.180\nbut it's still within this,\nmaybe a caption or a little offset.\n\n106\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.190\nAnd there is an H6, So Heading 6.\n\n107\n00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.670\nTiny font, still kind of bold,\nand we have these respectively.\n\n108\n00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.368\nNow if I were to take all of these and\njust put them one right after the other.\n\n109\n00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:59.345\nThen you could see the progression\nof getting smaller,\n\n110\n00:06:59.345 --> 00:07:01.760\nchanging kind of the font weight so\nto speak.\n\n111\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.787\nSomething to keep in mind when you're\nusing these chunks in markdown,\n\n112\n00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:15.531\npeople do not conform too much to, well,\nyou need to start with the first heading.\n\n113\n00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.689\nAnd then add another heading, and\n\n114\n00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:22.960\nthen add another heading to actually\nenforce that hierarchical structure.\n\n115\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.905\nIf you were doing this\nin some other places,\n\n116\n00:07:24.905 --> 00:07:26.597\nyou wouldn't need to adhere to that.\n\n117\n00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:30.290\nThat's convention,\nthat's a recommendation.\n\n118\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.260\nI have seen a great deal of people go,\n\n119\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.160\nI don't really want this\nlarge Chapter 1 intro.\n\n120\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.286\nI actually want it to be\na little bit smaller, so\n\n121\n00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:42.190\nthey'll use an H2 because it's smaller.\n\n122\n00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.380\nAnd you're not customizing the styling of\nthe render, you're just using this to go.\n\n123\n00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.390\nI want this to kind of pop out.\n\n124\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.610\nBut maybe not quite as big as an H1 so\nmaybe I'll use an H2.\n\n125\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.501\nSo markdown does enforce some practices\nthat are not ubiquitous across\n\n126\n00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.139\nall of the industries.\n\n127\n00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.660\nBut if I wanted headings with respective\nsubsections, I just need to remember,\n\n128\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.200\npound sign and how many pound signs?\n\n129\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.720\nAs I count up,\nI get a little bit smaller, right, and\n\n130\n00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.350\nthat reflects the individual subsections.\n\n131\n00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.560\nI could try an H7,\njust to see if it works.\n\n132\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.500\nHeading 7, and notice in my renderer,\nit doesn't even recognize that,\n\n133\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:28.790\nbecause I only get one, two, three,\nfour, five, or possibly six.\n\n134\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.260\nI don't get any more than that, and\n\n135\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.680\nany less than that,\nthen it's just regular text.\n\n136\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.550\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n137\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.240\nSo if you need headings\nwithin your documents,\n\n138\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.010\nIt's just the matter of adding pound\nsigns to those respective lines.\n\n139\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.330\n&gt;&gt; I always wondered at what point in\nhistory would we find out that if you call\n\n140\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.900\nit a pound symbol, nobody is going\nto recognize what that means.\n\n141\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.310\nAnd the moment you call it a hashtag\nsymbol, everyone is like, I know!\n\n142\n00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.830\nSo a lot of great information Justin,\nwe appreciate having you in the studio.\n\n143\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.240\nKeep in mind out there viewers,\nwe have much more to go.\n\n144\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.470\nBut you're gonna have to stick around and\nstay tuned to figure out what is next.\n\n145\n00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.920\nSo signing out here from DevProTV I\nhave been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n146\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.960\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n147\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.691\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n148\n00:09:06.691 -->

00:00:27.097\nJustin, how are we doing today, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:28.376\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:29.036\nAnd how are you?\n\n11\n00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:31.962\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great., we're gonna be\nlooking at things, like for instance,\n\n12\n00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:33.143\ncreating a Blockquote today.\n\n13\n00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:36.975\nAnd I have to tell you, I'm not exactly\nsure how we're gonna accomplish that.\n\n14\n00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:38.558\nSo, it's a good thing we have you here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:41.752\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully, I know what I'm doing\nbecause I definitely thought you were\n\n16\n00:00:41.752 --> 00:00:42.966\ngonna show us how to do it.\n\n17\n00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.313\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], it's gonna be a short episode.\n\n18\n00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:45.545\n&gt;&gt; But I've been put on the spot, so\n\n19\n00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.223\nI guess I'm gonna just\ngonna have to wing it.\n\n20\n00:00:47.223 --> 00:00:50.350\nBut before we do that, let's actually\ntalk about what is a Blockquote.\n\n21\n00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.043\nWhy would I care?\n\n22\n00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:52.540\nWhen would I use it, right?\n\n23\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.940\nWell, a lot of times you have some\nkind of little inspirational quote or\n\n24\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.650\nsomething that you want to set aside and\nattribute to someone.\n\n25\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.220\nAnd if you've ever seen\nthese hanging indents,\n\n26\n00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.160\nI think that's what they're called.\n\n27\n00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.180\nThis is where I should have\nconsulted an additional expert here.\n\n28\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900\nSo you bring it in, you have\na little bit different styling, and\n\n29\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.460\nthen you have a subquote,\nlike things are cool, said by Justin.\n\n30\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.900\nSo these individual Blockquotes\nare nice to all to set aside a section\n\n31\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.960\nto pull attention to a quote but also to\nattribute it to someone else, all right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.260\nSo you would use these in your documents\nif you wanted to quote somebody.\n\n33\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.250\nYou're using an inspirational quote,\n\n34\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.430\nor if you're telling a narrative,\nyou're using that as a starting point?\n\n35\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.050\nGreat to draw attention to those,\nbecause those can be very important.\n\n36\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.037\nIt seems like that would be\nreally hard to do in Markdown.\n\n37\n00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:52.406\nIndentation and and\nI gotta hit tab and all that.\n\n38\n00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:56.810\nWell, Markdown actually provides\nthat kind of out of the box and\n\n39\n00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.510\nit's not too hard to accomplish.\n\n40\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.280\nCouple of things we need to keep\nin mind as we're using these but\n\n41\n00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.077\nI think we'll see these as they come up.\n\n42\n00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:06.798\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the screen here and\n\n43\n00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:08.683\nlet's just make some Blockquotes.\n\n44\n00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:13.854\nSo if I open this up,\nI'm going to say blockquote.md,\n\n45\n00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:18.150\nas always making sure I\nhave that .md format.\n\n46\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.195\nLets say I'm writing along like stuff and\nthings.\n\n47\n00:02:25.195 --> 00:02:28.225\nAnd then, I come down here and\nI wanna quote.\n\n48\n00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:32.105\nI'm telling a story and\n\n49\n00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:37.348\nI wanna use this as a reference.\n\n50\n00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:40.324\nAs Gandhi said, and I make no hard,\n\n51\n00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:45.208\nI have to mention that I'll\nget all of these quotes right.\n\n52\n00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:49.216\nSo don't be like, actually so and so said.\n\n53\n00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:51.461\nIt's just for educational purposes.\n\n54\n00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:55.719\nNotice I put this greater than sign, okay.\n\n55\n00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.160\nGreater than sign at\nthe beginning of that line.\n\n56\n00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.780\nNotice it turns green,\nthat is creating a line in a Blockquote.\n\n57\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.358\nSo, be the change you\nwant to see in the world.\n\n58\n00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.196\nAnd I guess I should zoom out so\nwe can all that.\n\n59\n00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:19.109\nSo I had this single line,\nas my Blockquote.\n\n60\n00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.798\nThat's just a simple quote, it doesn't\nlook too much different than just typing\n\n61\n00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:24.728\ntext, other than that single character.\n\n62\n00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:29.371\nBut as we've seen with markdown, that\nsometimes provides a great deal of power.\n\n63\n00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:34.476\nSo if I open this up,\nopen it to the side, and you see here,\n\n64\n00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:41.278\nit kinda offsets it a little bit, and\nputs this kind of shaded border around.\n\n65\n00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:45.200\nAnd usually, my text editor\nis making this a little blue.\n\n66\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.345\nThere is usually a kind of dark line,\n\n67\n00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:51.166\neither dark gray depending on\nthe style of what's rendering it.\n\n68\n00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:57.007\nPuts this line at the beginning to say,\nhey, this is a block of texts.\n\n69\n00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:01.607\nSo seeing that, okay,\nthat draws attention to without being\n\n70\n00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:05.329\na heading as we've seen\nin the previous episode.\n\n71\n00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.200\nI'm not sure I wanna this thing to be\ngiant, or bold or anything like that.\n\n72\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.398\nI just want you to pay attention to it,\nbut also say,\n\n73\n00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:14.594\nokay, this is just standard text.\n\n74\n00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:19.953\nNow if I scroll out,\nwhat if I came down here and I said,\n\n75\n00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:24.776\nwell, Justin says,\nwho knows who are right here.\n\n76\n00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:26.330\nSo I need another line.\n\n77\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.572\nMarkdown is awesome.\n\n78\n00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:33.588\nAnd then, let's say there's\nanother part of the quote, but\n\n79\n00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:37.187\nI don't want this all on a single line,\nI kinda want this chunk together.\n\n80\n00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:41.807\nWell, I can add another one of these, and\n\n81\n00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:44.844\nsay, it really really is.\n\n82\n00:04:44.844 --> 00:04:50.082\nAnd not as your like what I figured\nthat will be on multiple lines, right.\n\n83\n00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:57.210\nThe block, this handles, irrespective\nlike how much is going on, right.\n\n84\n00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.126\nWhat I mean is,\n\n85\n00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:02.504\nthe length of the line determines whether\nit wraps to the next line or not.\n\n86\n00:05:02.504 --> 00:05:06.151\nIf, however, it's more readable for\nyou to do it on multiple\n\n87\n00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:10.710\nlines than if you put the greater than\nat the beginning of each of those lines,\n\n88\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.974\nthen it kind of puts them altogether.\n\n89\n00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:16.376\n&gt;&gt; Now Justin, one of the things I've\nnoticed is unlike some of the other ways\n\n90\n00:05:16.376 --> 00:05:19.356\nthat you manipulate the text,\nyou're not closing this one off.\n\n91\n00:05:19.356 --> 00:05:22.012\nLike, for instance,\nyou feel there's another episodes,\n\n92\n00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:24.926\nthat if you wanna do I italicized words so\nI can use the underscore,\n\n93\n00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:27.962\nyou can use the asterisk symbol but\nyou've had to close the text off.\n\n94\n00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:31.778\nSo it kinda steers away from what\nwe've seen in other episodes.\n\n95\n00:05:31.778 --> 00:05:33.329\n&gt;&gt; And this one very much does.\n\n96\n00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:36.146\nThis one works a little\nmore like a heading.\n\n97\n00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:40.050\nWhere I put it at the beginning of\na line and it affects the whole line.\n\n98\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.954\nThat has to do with a little bit behind\nthe scenes bolding, italicising,\n\n99\n00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:48.130\nthose, those are kind of\nlike an in line thing.\n\n100\n00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.619\nSo I have to close them off because\neverything else kind of bundles up.\n\n101\n00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:57.419\nNotice this block quote,\nwell these are all on one line,\n\n102\n00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.822\nthis affects this one area.\n\n103\n00:05:59.822 --> 00:06:03.311\nThe reason that doesn't have to\nbe closed is the assumption is,\n\n104\n00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:07.138\neverything you type on this line is\ngoing to be part of the block quote.\n\n105\n00:06:07.138 --> 00:06:13.742\nIf I wanted to Interestingly enough,\nsay really really is and make that.\n\n106\n00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:17.782\nLet's see if some of our other\nstyling works internally.\n\n107\n00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:20.039\nNotice I can kind of mix those together.\n\n108\n00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.196\nMarkdown is awesome,\nit really really is, right?\n\n109\n00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:27.152\nThat bolding still works in\nthe context of the block quote.\n\n110\n00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.842\nBut for comparison as Wes said,\nI have an open and\n\n111\n00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:34.536\na closed cuz I only want\nthis portion of the line.\n\n112\n00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:38.258\nA small subsection of the line,\nto be bolded but\n\n113\n00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:42.085\nthe entire line is still\npart of the block quote.\n\n114\n00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:45.016\nSo just like headings,\nit affects the whole line.\n\n115\n00:06:45.016 --> 00:06:49.840\nWhereas italicizing and boldings are\nsubsections of respective pieces of text.\n\n116\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.833\nSo if I come here and I'm like, you know,\nwell that makes a block quote but\n\n117\n00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:57.589\nwhat if I actually just want\nthe greater than symbol?\n\n118\n00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.604\nLet's say I'm writing some\nkind of math equation.\n\n119\n00:07:00.604 --> 00:07:04.813\nAnd you might be writing\na technical document.\n\n120\n00:07:04.813 --> 00:07:10.499\nAnd you say, well,\nfive is greater than four.\n\n121\n00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:13.729\nNotice it's not at\nthe beginning of the line.\n\n122\n00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.025\nThat's all good.\n\n123\n00:07:15.025 --> 00:07:17.365\nIt doesn't need an escape.\n\n124\n00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:22.761\nWhat happens if, well, you're just\ntrying to say greater than four.\n\n125\n00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd just put that there,\nthis becomes a block quote and\n\n126\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.155\nit renders as a block quote.\n\n127\n00:07:29.155 --> 00:07:34.694\nWe've seen before in a couple episodes\nthat we have the ability to escape right?\n\n128\n00:07:34.694 --> 00:07:39.060\nWhat if I escape this with a backslash,\nbackslash?\n\n129\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.855\nPretty sure it's a backslash,\nwe'll consult on that later.\n\n130\n00:07:42.855 --> 00:07:47.710\nBut this slash, notice it changes\nthe color of this greater than symbol.\n\n131\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.739\nThe greater than symbol is rendered, it\ndoes not render as a block quote anymore.\n\n132\n00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:55.346\nSo if you need, for some reason,\nfor a greater than symbol to be\n\n133\n00:07:55.346 --> 00:07:59.654\nat the very beginning of the line,\nyou can still add the escape character.\n\n134\n00:07:59.654 --> 00:08:02.797\nMake sure it renders and\ndoes not apply the styles.\n\n135\n00:08:02.797 --> 00:08:06.029\nSo these are handy if you\nwant to draw attention, but\n\n136\n00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:11.332\nnot necessarily use headings, or headers\nto really blow things up, make them bold.\n\n137\n00:08:11.332 --> 00:08:15.218\nMaybe you don't even need bolding or\nitalicizing, you want to set them aside,\n\n138\n00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:19.470\nadd a little bit of style so people read\nthem but it's still like standard text.\n\n139\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.870\nSo those are pretty easy, be very\ncareful if you need a greater than sign\n\n140\n00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.930\nat the beginning of the line, well you\njust need to make sure you escape it.\n\n141\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.680\nCuz otherwise it accidentally becomes\na block quote with a number four in it.\n\n142\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.903\nAnd that's all there really\nis to block quoting.\n\n143\n00:08:34.903 --> 00:08:38.390\n&gt;&gt; A lot of great information as we\ncontinue on here in our GitHub flavored\n\n144\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:38.991\nmarkdown.\n\n145\n00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:40.097\nAnd Justin has been so\n\n146\n00:08:40.097 --> 00:08:43.613\nkind to show us how we can do a little\nbit of manipulation of our text.\n\n147\n00:08:43.613 --> 00:08:44.609\nAnd I can tell you,\n\n148\n00:08:44.609 --> 00:08:48.596\nI wish I was actually following some of\nthe advice, some of my markdown files\n\n149\n00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:52.736\nwould look like roadmaps to a downtown\nmajor metropolitan area city, right?\n\n150\n00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:56.051\nSo Justin, as always, we appreciate\nhaving you here and we appreciate you,\n\n151\n00:08:56.051 --> 00:08:57.026\nthe viewer watching.\n\n152\n00:08:57.026 --> 00:08:59.804\nSigning out for DevProTV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n153\n00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:00.488\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n154\n00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:02.231\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n155\n00:09:02.231 --> 00:09:07.748\n[SOUND]\n\n",

here at DEVPRO.TV\nwhere, well, the fun never stops.\n\n4\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.630\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan, and in\ntoday's episode we're coming back at you\n\n5\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.700\nwith more of that\nGitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\n6\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.530\nAnd joining us back in the studios is Mr.\nJustin Dennison.\n\n7\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.640\nJustin, how are we doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.100\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fantastic, Wes, and\n\n9\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.730\nwe are continuing on with\nGitHub-flavored markdown.\n\n10\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.540\nIt's going to be an interesting episode,\nbecause well, you're like,\n\n11\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.480\nwe've already talked about headings.\n\n12\n00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.530\nI wanted to keep this\none as a separate one,\n\n13\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.210\nbecause well, there are other ways\nto make headings in markdown, and\n\n14\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.700\nparticularly this works in\nGitHub-flavored markdown.\n\n15\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.360\nCan sometimes throw people for\na loop, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.510\nSo sometimes a heading has an underline,\nright?\n\n17\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.150\nI have this big old heading, or\nheader depending on your vernacular.\n\n18\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.220\nAnd I'm sure there's a strict technical\ndifferentiation between those just in\n\n19\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.570\ncase you're wondering.\n\n20\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.510\nAnd then there's this subtle horizontal\nline to break up the section,\n\n21\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.110\nhey, you should keep this in your focus.\n\n22\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.000\nAnd there is actually two ways\nto accomplish similar things.\n\n23\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.850\nAnd I've seen some people\nwho adopt one way and\n\n24\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.080\ndidn't even know about the second way,\nor vice versa.\n\n25\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.440\nSo we want to explore those a little\nmore in depth in this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.000\nAnd well, interestingly enough, we learn\nhow to make horizontal rules to break\n\n27\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.300\nup additional sections that do not\nrequire us to have headings at all.\n\n28\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.810\nSo that's kinda handy, but let's go and\ncome into the screen here and get started.\n\n29\n00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.346\nSo I'm gonna make new a markdown file,\nit's kinda par for\n\n30\n00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:42.092\nthe course at this time, right?\n\n31\n00:01:42.092 --> 00:01:49.760\nHeadings, headings-with-underlines,\nI can't spell underlines.\n\n32\n00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.932\nThere we go, underlines, so\nI'm just gonna flip that array.\n\n33\n00:01:53.932 --> 00:01:57.390\nAnd well, let's just say\nthis is something important.\n\n34\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.990\nAnd you're like, something important,\nI really want that to stand out.\n\n35\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.180\nI want that to have real big text,\nright, top level heading.\n\n36\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.950\nAnd I want it to be underlined so that\neverything under it is kind of like, hey,\n\n37\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.310\nthis follows this section.\n\n38\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.547\nUnderlining, now you'll see\nwhat I mean by underlining.\n\n39\n00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.930\nTitling is hard, full disclosure.\n\n40\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.430\nSo if I come here and I put three dashes,\nnotice how those turn blue.\n\n41\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.244\nAnd I open this up and I open the preview\nand it's kind of hard to see.\n\n42\n00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:40.912\nThis actually makes an H1, so\nthis is an alternative one.\n\n43\n00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:46.280\nNotice there's nothing that looks\nlike there's an underline there.\n\n44\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.280\nSo I come back over here and\nI instead change these two equal signs.\n\n45\n00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.130\nYou'll notice that puts this kind\nof underline to the heading.\n\n46\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.040\nI'm not talking about\nunderlining the text per se, but\n\n47\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.860\nit underlines the heading and\nit kinda spans the entire document.\n\n48\n00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.340\nOne more time,\nI just wanna make sure everything's good.\n\n49\n00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.880\nSingle dashes, three of them.\n\n50\n00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350\nThey'll turn blue if you have an editor\nthat recognizes markdown syntax.\n\n51\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.010\nThat makes this, well let's just\ncompare Something Important.\n\n52\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.510\nIt doesn't quite make it in H1, but\nit is kind of a top-level heading.\n\n53\n00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.770\nLet's see what it actually provides us.\n\n54\n00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.410\nA little bit different,\nnot quite an H1, not quite an H2, so\n\n55\n00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.460\nit's a tiny bit different but\nit is still a heading.\n\n56\n00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.070\nBut if I change these to equal signs well,\nwhat is that?\n\n57\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.970\nNotice that text gets\na little bit bigger and\n\n58\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.730\nthere's that horizontal\nrule that comes across.\n\n59\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.800\nSo if we go something important,\nlike so, important.\n\n60\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.120\nNow we can actually see,\nwell, # Something Important.\n\n61\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.870\nThese are the same size, you can kinda\nsee, I get that underline as well.\n\n62\n00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.858\nDo want to clarify, my editor is\nshowing an underline in both of these.\n\n63\n00:04:07.858 --> 00:04:12.120\nBy and large, this syntax\n\n64\n00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.640\ndoes not guarantee an underline\ndepending on the rendering agent.\n\n65\n00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.110\nThat has been my experience at\nthe time of this recording.\n\n66\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.690\nKnowing my luck this will come out, you're\nwatching now and you go check it out and\n\n67\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.410\nall of these have underlines.\n\n68\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.830\nBut when I do this on GitHub or\non Bitbucket,\n\n69\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.550\na single hashtag heading does not\nnecessarily mean it has an underline.\n\n70\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.170\nIf I do three equal signs but\nI do have an underline.\n\n71\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.960\nSo we're good to go there, and\nwell that's all fine and good.\n\n72\n00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.500\nBut it doesn't look like I\nhave the ability to decide,\n\n73\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.590\nwell I do want an underline.\n\n74\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.639\nBut I don't want quite that large a text.\n\n75\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.090\nSo if I come back and I make these single,\nyou're like, well that's still a heading.\n\n76\n00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.600\nThis is what trips people up.\n\n77\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.160\nOn the very next line if I\ncome right after this text.\n\n78\n00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.990\nAnd I put these three equal signs,\nit turns blue, and that means something.\n\n79\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.690\nAnd that says,\ncreate a heading with an underline.\n\n80\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.550\nAnd in particular, in this case,\nthe equals signs mean, create an h1 style,\n\n81\n00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.680\nright, a level one heading.\n\n82\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.180\nBut if I hit Enter, that's no longer\nthe case, it's just three equals signs.\n\n83\n00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.080\nSo the placement of those\nare definitely important.\n\n84\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.380\nThe very next line, it means the top\nlevel heading with an underline.\n\n85\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.702\nIf I have a space between,\nit's just three equal signs.\n\n86\n00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:44.440\nAnd to further throw a wrench into things,\nthree dashes, not equal signs.\n\n87\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.310\nAnd again, this is depending on\nthe renderer actually means,\n\n88\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.020\ncreate a horizontal rule that\nis not attached to a heading.\n\n89\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.560\nSo what that means is I can come here and\nsay ###.\n\n90\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.850\nAnd I have a little bit smaller text,\na different level heading, but\n\n91\n00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.710\nI still have the horizontal rule.\n\n92\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.040\nThe styling is a little bit\ndifferent because, well,\n\n93\n00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.860\nI'm now creating the underline\nseparate from the heading.\n\n94\n00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.840\nBut I do have the ability\nto pick my heading size and\n\n95\n00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.690\njust to show you, there it is.\n\n96\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.220\nSo if we come over here and\nwe remove one of these, not there,\n\n97\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.360\nand now if we just have two of those,\nit's just two so I need the three.\n\n98\n00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.880\nIt can't be on the very next line\nbecause that creates a heading.\n\n99\n00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.120\nInstead if I just want a horizontal\nrule or a line across the page.\n\n100\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.320\nIt's three dashes, not equal signs,\nand they should be outside,\n\n101\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.870\nkind of separated from\nrespective areas of text.\n\n102\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.540\nThat allows me to make decisions here.\n\n103\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.140\nIf I come back and\nI view something like this, right?\n\n104\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.140\nAnd you'll notice the styling's\na little bit different,\n\n105\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.780\nthat has to do with\nnecessarily my text editor.\n\n106\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.810\nThe rendering styles may be,\ndepending on where you're hosting this, or\n\n107\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.070\nwhere it's being rendered to can change.\n\n108\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.220\nThis underlining is a little bit thinner\nthan this one because it's associated with\n\n109\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.250\nthis header.\n\n110\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.730\nBecause of these three equals signs here,\nokay.\n\n111\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.930\nNotice my editor didn't turn blue because,\nwell, it's helping me out and\n\n112\n00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.920\nI had an extra space there.\n\n113\n00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.630\nI come back over here,\nH1 followed by a line,\n\n114\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.590\nand then a little thicker line\nwhich is the horizontal rule.\n\n115\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.532\nIf instead I go okay, well I still\nwant lines but I want a subheading\n\n116\n00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:35.370\nlike this Subheading, and I want 3.\n\n117\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.920\nNotice I have Something Important,\nthin line,\n\n118\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.370\nSubheading, because I use\nthe standard heading syntax and\n\n119\n00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.000\nthen I created my\nhorizontal line separately.\n\n120\n00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.280\nNot necessarily in a combined syntax.\n\n121\n00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.600\nAnd really where it throws people off\nis I've seen people use just this for\n\n122\n00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.730\nheadings, and\ndidn't necessarily use any of these.\n\n123\n00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.270\nBut when they use these, they're\nlike well, I'm missing my underline.\n\n124\n00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.912\nWell you got to learn that it's\nthree minus signs, right, or dashes.\n\n125\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.910\nAnd then they're like that's kind\nof like this, except not really.\n\n126\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.030\nBy itself it just creates\na horizontal rule.\n\n127\n00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.110\nSo something to keep in mind when I need\nheadings with respective lines across\n\n128\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:22.860\nthe page.\n\n129\n00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.350\nThey can be together or separate depending\non which of the syntaxes that you choose.\n\n130\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.960\nSo hopefully, that gives you an idea\nof how to separate your sections\n\n131\n00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:38.270\nwith headings and corresponding\nhorizontal rules if you so need them.\n\n132\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.340\n&gt;&gt; Just another piece of that puzzle\nwhen it comes to manipulation and\n\n133\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.880\nchanging around your\nmarkdown documents there.\n\n134\n00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.080\nSo Justin, as always, we do appreciate\nhaving you in the studio with us, and\n\n135\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.930\nappreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n136\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.850\nWe're gonna go ahead and\ntake the time to sign out for DevProTV.\n\n137\n00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.220\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n138\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.865\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n139\n00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:56.772\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n140\n00:08:56.772 -->

and\n\n8\n00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:27.268\nhopefully you are doing well as well.\n\n9\n00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:29.186\nWow that was a lot of wells there.\n\n10\n00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.168\nThat was from the department\nof redundancy department.\n\n11\n00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:34.349\nAnd yeah we're continuing on\nwith Github Flavored Markdown.\n\n12\n00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:36.939\nIn particular we're gonna be\ntalking about internal links.\n\n13\n00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:40.680\nAnd you're like internal links,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n14\n00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.022\nWell we've actually seen external\nlinks and then we kinda took a detour.\n\n15\n00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:48.762\nWe talked about headings and block\nquotes and stuff, but there are times,\n\n16\n00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:50.200\nlet's set the scene.\n\n17\n00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.936\nLet me paint you a picture of why you\nshould even care about internal links.\n\n18\n00:00:54.936 --> 00:01:00.530\nSo internal links allow you to link\nwithin the document that you're in.\n\n19\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.023\nLet's say you have a very long markdown\ndocument that you're like wow,\n\n20\n00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:06.840\nI've got this table of contents and\nI just start writing.\n\n21\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.681\nI've done this before because I\ndon't want to have to go ahead and\n\n22\n00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.900\nsplit things up into individual\ndocuments and kind of sift through them.\n\n23\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.370\nI'll just start writing\nfrom top to bottom, right?\n\n24\n00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.580\nIt's good for stream of consciousness.\n\n25\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.854\nYou start to clean it up a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:22.943\nIt's nice to have that one document\nthat can be changed into a PDF,\n\n27\n00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:26.240\nthat can be changed into\nmaybe other formats, HTML.\n\n28\n00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.797\nAnd if it's all on a single document, you\njust have to worry about maintaining that\n\n29\n00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:34.719\ndocument either in Dropbox or\nsomething like that, or well, GitHub.\n\n30\n00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.957\nSo having those documents, when they\nreally get long, you're like woah man,\n\n31\n00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.050\nthere's a section way\ndown there on the bottom.\n\n32\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.909\nHow do I get to those?\n\n33\n00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.988\nWell, internal links allow us to do that.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n34\n00:01:45.988 --> 00:01:49.013\nyou might be helping save my thumb\nfrom a little bit of arthritis, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.013 --> 00:01:51.903\nI'm sitting there thinking,\ncontinue scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll,\n\n36\n00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:52.655\nscroll, scroll.\n\n37\n00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:55.750\nBoy it would be really nice to\nhave a way that, like you said,\n\n38\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.260\nif you had some text, a paragraph of text.\n\n39\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.393\nCouldn't I just jump right to that section\nwithout having to scroll through five\n\n40\n00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:05.032\ncontinuous pages of text?\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n41\n00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:07.740\nthat is ultimately what we're gonna do.\n\n42\n00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.960\nI'm gonna give you a nice\nlittle starter here.\n\n43\n00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.700\nInternal linking can get really crazy.\n\n44\n00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.507\nSo we're gonna take what we know from\nexternal linking, try to apply it, and\n\n45\n00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:18.747\nsee where things break.\n\n46\n00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:20.204\nBecause I will forewarn you,\n\n47\n00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:23.320\nthere are times where it\ndoesn't behave quite the same.\n\n48\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.810\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n49\n00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.966\nBut we’ve done enough talking,\nI think it’s important to,\n\n50\n00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.301\nwell, maybe just create a document.\n\n51\n00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:32.568\nSo go ahead and\ncome to the computer screen here and\n\n52\n00:02:32.568 --> 00:02:38.480\net’s create a new file called,\ninternal-links.md, all right?\n\n53\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.409\nSo let's say that I have a section\nhere called Table of Contents.\n\n54\n00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.810\nThis is somewhere in a document and\nthere we go.\n\n55\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.895\nSo I have this heading, right, this H3.\n\n56\n00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:55.600\nAnd here I'm gonna say I have Chapter 1.\n\n57\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.611\nChapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3.\n\n58\n00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:06.110\nAnd then I continue\nwriting in the document.\n\n59\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.970\nI have a little horizontal\nline that says hey,\n\n60\n00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.520\nthis is the remaining of the document.\n\n61\n00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.210\nAnd I go here is Chapter 1 and\nthen there is some text.\n\n62\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.771\nLet's just use the word text,\nand then copy and\n\n63\n00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:27.863\npaste that several times, and then\ncopy and paste that a few other times.\n\n64\n00:03:27.863 --> 00:03:32.400\nSo boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and\nthen now we're finished with chapter 1 and\n\n65\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.130\nit's great.\n\n66\n00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.580\nIt's the best chapter I've ever written.\n\n67\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.262\nI tell you what, I'm thinking about\njust going ahead and packing this up,\n\n68\n00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:42.480\ngetting out of here,\nselling this on the Internet.\n\n69\n00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.249\nI jest, I jest.\n\n70\n00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.842\nSo I'm here and\nI get to Chapter 2 and well,\n\n71\n00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:53.590\nI have some more text here and\nI'm writing Chapter 2.\n\n72\n00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.300\nAnd Chapter 2 is a little bit longer and\nwe're down here.\n\n73\n00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.140\nAnd notice Chapter 1 and\nChapter 2 have already run off the page.\n\n74\n00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.815\nAll right, this is a very small example\nand to some extent, a very fake example.\n\n75\n00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:08.570\nBut I have seen incredibly long and\nmarkdown document, right?\n\n76\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:16.110\nSo I'm now working on Chapter 3 and I\nneed to make that a heading, there we go.\n\n77\n00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.489\nAnd I'm just pasting, pasting, pasting,\npasting, pasting, pasting and there we go.\n\n78\n00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.590\nOkay, so I have Chapter 1, 2,\nand 3, let's look at the preview.\n\n79\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.670\nThere's our preview.\n\n80\n00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.470\nIt's all good to go.\n\n81\n00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.983\nHere's Chapter 1, 2, and 3, and\nlet me break these up just so\n\n82\n00:04:30.983 --> 00:04:32.145\nthey're on separate lines.\n\n83\n00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:33.580\nSo there's our Table of Contents.\n\n84\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.560\nNow, not the most beautiful Table of\nContents, but it does work, right?\n\n85\n00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.622\nAnd if we wanted to\ncreate an external link,\n\n86\n00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:44.260\nif these were in a different\ndocument hosted somewhere.\n\n87\n00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.535\nWe could put square brackets\naround these put parenthesis and\n\n88\n00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:54.291\nput www.google.com, like that.\n\n89\n00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:58.277\nAnd that is now a link to Google, right?\n\n90\n00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:03.809\nAnd for further clarity,\nwe should probably put that https.\n\n91\n00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.200\nSo if we go there, it would actually take\nme to Google from within this document.\n\n92\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.990\nHowever, that's not what I want to do.\n\n93\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.745\nI want to instead link to\nthe respective chapters,\n\n94\n00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:17.727\nbecause if I'm looking at a table of\ncontents in a standard book, right?\n\n95\n00:05:17.727 --> 00:05:21.610\nI look at the table of contents, that's\nthe chapter, I go flip to that page.\n\n96\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.139\nI don't have any page numbers.\n\n97\n00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.339\nI don't have any means of referencing.\n\n98\n00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.666\nBut here, when I make this H1, right?\n\n99\n00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.480\nOr excuse me, H3.\n\n100\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.158\nBehind the scenes,\nthis is where the trick comes in.\n\n101\n00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:38.250\nBehind the scenes this becomes\nan HTML element with a particular ID.\n\n102\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.928\nThe ID takes this text and\nsays lower case and\n\n103\n00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:46.730\nput hyphens for the spaces, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.620\nSo if I come here and I say,\nhashtag, octothorp, pound sign,\n\n105\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.160\nwhatever it may be, that says look for\nthe ID on this page.\n\n106\n00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.856\nchapter 1, notice lowercase letter, -1.\n\n107\n00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:06.155\nAll right, so it looks good and then boom!\n\n108\n00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:09.970\nI can now click and\nit will jump to that part of the document.\n\n109\n00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.799\nLikewise I can do the exact same thing for\nChapter 2.\n\n110\n00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:18.422\nSo #chapter 2, just like so.\n\n111\n00:06:18.422 --> 00:06:24.525\nAnd well just to fill it out, #chapter-3.\n\n112\n00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:26.296\nSo now I have links and\n\n113\n00:06:26.296 --> 00:06:31.224\nI could have additional things\nhere like the actual title.\n\n114\n00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:36.420\nTitle and stuff, things of that nature,\nbut now this is the link.\n\n115\n00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.032\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n116\n00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:42.737\nWe're not limited to making the entire\nthing a link to somewhere else.\n\n117\n00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:46.138\nBut because I have those,\nI can going to Chapter 1.\n\n118\n00:06:46.138 --> 00:06:46.963\nI can go to Chapter 2.\n\n119\n00:06:46.963 --> 00:06:48.827\nI can go to Chapter 3.\n\n120\n00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:53.049\nAnd what's interesting about this\nis if I need a way of navigating,\n\n121\n00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:58.010\nI have a Table of Contents section at the\nend of Chapter 1 or even below this, but\n\n122\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.510\nI'll put it at the end.\n\n123\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:08.634\nI can say [Return to\nTOC](#table-of-contents),\n\n124\n00:07:08.634 --> 00:07:12.735\nlike that and there we go.\n\n125\n00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:15.136\nSo Return to TOC, boom.\n\n126\n00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:16.125\nAnd now it makes me jump.\n\n127\n00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:19.250\nSo I can internally link\nwithin the document.\n\n128\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.020\nNow I'm keeping this\nfairly kind of general,\n\n129\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.640\nbecause we're just making use of some\nbehind the scenes render technology.\n\n130\n00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.730\nI don't wanna get too very deep\nbecause this is supposed to be easy.\n\n131\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.442\nSo this is all we need to know.\n\n132\n00:07:33.442 --> 00:07:37.241\nIf you really wanna dig deep,\nget this rendered out into HTML,\n\n133\n00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:38.680\nsee how that plays out.\n\n134\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.963\nAnd then if you know a little bit of HTML,\nyou can further refine this.\n\n135\n00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:48.559\nInterestingly enough though,\nif I come here and I'm like well,\n\n136\n00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:53.270\nI know in external links I\ncan do named links, right?\n\n137\n00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.410\nLet's say I want to link to chapter,\nlet's say this refers to Chapter 1.\n\n138\n00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:03.280\nAnd I come down here and\nI say, Chapter 1, like that.\n\n139\n00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.750\nAnd you're like, well,\nthat doesn't make a link.\n\n140\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.290\nAnd to provide some context, during\nChapter 2, I'm reading, I'm reading.\n\n141\n00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.083\nAnd there's something I've talked\nabout that said hey, you should go and\n\n142\n00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:13.846\nlook at Chapter 1.\n\n143\n00:08:13.846 --> 00:08:18.160\nIt's kind of annoying to say chapter-1,\nlike that.\n\n144\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.080\nWhen in external links,\nwe could make named links.\n\n145\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:29.246\nWe could come into the bottom of\nthe document and go Chapter 1 and then :.\n\n146\n00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:34.570\nAnd yeah colon, sometimes I\nforget that colon, not gonna lie.\n\n147\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.870\nAnd then there we go.\n\n148\n00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.920\nWhat does it go to, #chapter-1.\n\n149\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.990\nI come up here, remove this, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.007\nAnd you're like that looks handy.\n\n151\n00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:55.860\nAnd you'll notice that doesn't work.\n\n152\n00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.096\nThis is where from external links,\nand actually let's go and\n\n153\n00:08:59.096 --> 00:09:00.348\nlook at external link.\n\n154\n00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:03.062\nI'm gonna open that document,\nclose this one.\n\n155\n00:09:03.062 --> 00:09:07.623\nThis is from a previous\nepisode Well you're like,\n\n156\n00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:10.210\nwell Justin you put parentheses here for\nthat name.\n\n157\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:15.080\nI did, let's go see if that's where\nI messed up, which is very possible.\n\n158\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.630\nAnd you go okay, well okay I messed up.\n\n159\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.060\nAnd that's where you\ngo it should work now.\n\n160\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.980\nLet's see if it in fact does work.\n\n161\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.225\nSo what I mean is this is\nnow kind of this named link.\n\n162\n00:09:27.225 --> 00:09:29.830\nI can use Chapter 1 anywhere,\nincluding right here.\n\n163\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.690\nNotice this is Chapter 1.\n\n164\n00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.380\nLet's click and it still doesn't work.\n\n165\n00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.010\nThis is one of those weird\nnuances about internal linking.\n\n166\n00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:44.030\nThe named link doesn't work too well with\nthe same syntax that external links do.\n\n167\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.050\nI'm not saying that you can't\nget it to work at all, but\n\n168\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.560\nit doesn't follow the same\nkind of thought process.\n\n169\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:57.416\nSo unfortunately, to make things easy,\nI recommend being explicit.\n\n170\n00:09:57.416 --> 00:10:03.895\nchapter-1, right, and I go grab this,\nokay and delete that.\n\n171\n00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.417\nI'm not gonna put named links.\n\n172\n00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:09.411\nYou kinda just have endline them and boom.\n\n173\n00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:14.860\nAnd then if I scroll down that takes me\nback to Chapter 1 to the top of the page.\n\n174\n00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.964\nSo from the internal linking's\nperspective there is a little bit of\n\n175\n00:10:17.964 --> 00:10:19.767\na difference between external links.\n\n176\n00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:21.210\nThis is just to get us started.\n\n177\n00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:26.230\nThere is a lot more power here,\nbut it's nice to have just this\n\n178\n00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:33.393\nbasic internal document navigation that is\nalso based on these heading names, right?\n\n179\n00:10:33.393 --> 00:10:36.709\nSo I've shown you for headings because\nthat's probably the most prominent\n\n180\n00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:40.032\nway you're going to navigate,\ninstead of I wanna go look at a sentence.\n\n181\n00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:44.070\nI wanna go look at this section, which\nis going to have a heading of some sort\n\n182\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.540\nthat gets this special\nID based on the text.\n\n183\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.667\nThere's a the semi-practical limitation,\nbut\n\n184\n00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:53.500\nthere's nothing special about Chapter 1.\n\n185\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:00.330\nIf I made this Chapter One and made this\nchapter-one like so, then it still works.\n\n186\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.684\nIf I say Chapter One and\nSome Stuff, like that.\n\n187\n00:11:05.684 --> 00:11:08.945\nI know, super original,\n\n188\n00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:14.290\nand-some-stuff, well it still works.\n\n189\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.146\nSo it just follows that convention.\n\n190\n00:11:16.146 --> 00:11:20.550\nDo keep in mind if you get really long\nones, it may be hard to maintain.\n\n191\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.917\nSo as I've said before in many\nof my shows, titling is hard,\n\n192\n00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.584\nkeep it concise, yet descriptive.\n\n193\n00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:30.069\nIf it's Chapter One, say Chapter One and\n\n194\n00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:34.910\nthen create a subheading that provides\nadditional descriptions if you need so.\n\n195\n00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:39.284\nAnd that way you can link to Chapter One,\nthe respective section,\n\n196\n00:11:39.284 --> 00:11:42.893\nwithout having to type\na horrible long internal link.\n\n197\n00:11:42.893 --> 00:11:44.960\nEspecially if you're gonna reuse them.\n\n198\n00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.221\nCuz at it stands, this one doesn't work\nanymore because I would have to go change\n\n199\n00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:50.610\nthat one endline as well.\n\n200\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:55.147\nSo there are some edge cases but\nincredibly handy for creating navigation\n\n201\n00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:58.764\ninternal to a document.\n&gt;&gt; Words of wisdom when it comes to using\n\n202\n00:11:58.764 --> 00:11:59.966\nyour markdown documents.\n\n203\n00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:03.036\nNow it does look like we're coming\nto the end of another episode.\n\n204\n00:12:03.036 --> 00:12:06.270\nBut before we sign out, Justin,\ndo you have anything else that you would\n\n205\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.872\nlike to impart to our viewers?\n&gt;&gt; I just wanna say we're using\n\n206\n00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:11.901\nGitHub Flavored Markdown because some\nof the things we'll see here and\n\n207\n00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:13.430\nthere are very specific to GitHub.\n\n208\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.670\nA lot of the things that we see\nare actually just marked down in general.\n\n209\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.357\nWill work regardless of whether\nit's GitHub Flavored Markdown or\n\n210\n00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:24.710\na MultiMarkdown.\n\n211\n00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.413\nPick your poison on that deal.\n\n212\n00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:27.520\nIn addition to,\n\n213\n00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.594\nthis is not meant to go to super deep\nbehind the scenes how everything works.\n\n214\n00:12:32.594 --> 00:12:37.195\nThis is to little practical snippets\nto help you go how do I make\n\n215\n00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:39.198\nlinks internal in a doc?\n\n216\n00:12:39.198 --> 00:12:41.835\nThere I go, that's all I need know, right?\n\n217\n00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:45.931\nThese are reference materials instead\nof all the inner workings of markdown.\n\n218\n00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.720\nSo do remember that.\n\n219\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.743\nDo a quick search, see what you\nneed to get done, and get it done.\n\n220\n00:12:50.743 --> 00:12:52.025\n&gt;&gt; All right, thanks Justin for\n\n221\n00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:53.980\nbeing here, we appreciate having you here.\n\n222\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.602\nAnd we appreciate, you,\nthe viewer watching.\n\n223\n00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:57.384\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nsign out for DevProTV.\n\n224\n00:12:57.384 --> 00:12:59.805\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n225\n00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:00.830\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n226\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:08.084\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It is going fantastic, Cherokee.\n\n7\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.212\nHow are you today?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n8\n00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:31.936\nI've actually been working in markdown,\nbut I've never tried to create a lists, so\n\n9\n00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:34.527\nI think I'm looking forward to this show.\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully,\n\n10\n00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:37.387\nyou'll learn a little bit of something and\nmaybe you'll learn something as well.\n\n11\n00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:39.260\nSo list, what do I mean by lists?\n\n12\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260\nWell you've probably created\na number of lists in word or\n\n13\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.050\nsome other text editor, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.810\nWhere you go, all I need one,\ntwo, three, four.\n\n15\n00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.350\nThat's an ordered list.\n\n16\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.900\nThat's important because the one,\nthe two, the three and the four.\n\n17\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.853\nThose are kind of like this is first,\nthis is next, this is next.\n\n18\n00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:56.684\nAnd then there's other lists that\nare just kinda bullet points, right?\n\n19\n00:00:56.684 --> 00:01:01.860\nYou have some kind of rounded\nbullet point, typically.\n\n20\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.220\nI've seen really extravagant bullet\npoints that are images and stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.800\nBut bullet points means, I need to\nconsider all of these four things, or\n\n22\n00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.750\nfive things, or six things.\n\n23\n00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.237\nBut it doesn't really matter which order,\nper se, right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:19.650\nThey're just all collected, and\nI wanna see top level outline.\n\n25\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.583\nIn addition to, if you're in Word or\nthings like Word, you hit tab,\n\n26\n00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:27.573\na lot of times you get a different bullet.\n\n27\n00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:28.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n28\n00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.610\nLike an indented bullet?\n\n29\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.300\nAnd that's like,\nthis is a sublist of this list.\n\n30\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.501\n&gt;&gt; Well something I have noticed\n\n31\n00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:34.081\nin markdown.\n\n32\n00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.370\nIf I go for\nsome bullet of sorts like an asterisk,\n\n33\n00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.542\nmaybe if I use an asterisk somewhere\nelse in that line of text,\n\n34\n00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:45.897\nit totally changes the formatting and\nI'm like, what did I do?\n\n35\n00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:48.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that'll get you.\n\n36\n00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.317\nAnd when we create lists, we're gonna\nhave to be careful because some of\n\n37\n00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:54.770\nthe characters that we've seen on\nprevious episodes are actually reused.\n\n38\n00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.410\nWell, we've talked a little bit,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n39\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.340\nsee how do we create lists?\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n40\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.020\n&gt;&gt; So if we come down\n\n41\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.000\nto the computer here.\n\n42\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.499\nAnd I'm just gonna create a new document\ncalled creating-lists, creating-lists.md.\n\n43\n00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.393\nAgain, remember, .md is gonna help\nyou with syntax highlighting,\n\n44\n00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.160\nkeep things clean.\n\n45\n00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.230\nSo if I want a groceries list,\nyou're like, here's the groceries list.\n\n46\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.999\nThat's all I want.\n\n47\n00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.795\nI can hit a minus sign or a dash, hit\na space, and notice that it turns blue,\n\n48\n00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:26.395\njust like that.\n\n49\n00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:27.885\nWell what do I need from the grocery?\n\n50\n00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:29.995\nI need cheese and milk.\n\n51\n00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.295\nApparently I have an infatuation\nwith dairy products.\n\n52\n00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:32.855\n&gt;&gt; So Justin,\n\n53\n00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:36.535\nare you the type of person who reorganizes\ntheir list once it's written and\n\n54\n00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:38.235\nthe order of where it is in the store so\n\n55\n00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:40.865\nyou can just go and?\n&gt;&gt; No, Cherokee,\n\n56\n00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.071\nI don' t have that kind of time in my day.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:44.736\n&gt;&gt; So I just made a list and\n\n58\n00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:49.230\nthen I played it out in my mind and\nI just check it off.\n\n59\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.648\nWe gotta figure out how our schedules\nwork cuz I ain't got that kind of time.\n\n60\n00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:54.404\nAnd let's have a little bit of [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; I don't get out\n\n61\n00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:55.070\nmuch, Justin.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.232\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n63\n00:02:57.232 --> 00:02:57.829\n&gt;&gt; Apparently not,\n\n64\n00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.548\nwhen you get that excited\nabout the grocery store.\n\n65\n00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:03.500\n[LAUGH] So we have these dashes, right?\n\n66\n00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.480\nThey've turned blue.\n\n67\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.780\nThat's an indicator, hey,\nthis is probably some balanced syntax.\n\n68\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.670\nIf I open up my preview to the side, I now\nhave this kind of indented, bulleted list.\n\n69\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.870\nIt's a simple bulleted list.\n\n70\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.960\nThis is an unordered list, and\nI can use minus signs to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.090\nThe tricky part is the minus or\n\n72\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.160\nthe dash is not the only character that\nallows me to make a list like this.\n\n73\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.700\nIf I come back and I put an asterisk, and\n\n74\n00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.950\nI put an asterisk, notice these are single\nasterisks at the beginning of the line.\n\n75\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.070\nAsterisks can also mean bold or\nitalicized, depending on how you use them.\n\n76\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.965\nI get the exact same bulleted list.\n\n77\n00:03:44.965 --> 00:03:46.457\n[SOUND] Well,\n\n78\n00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:50.685\nI'm about to get crazy up in here.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n79\n00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:53.045\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I put a plus sign,\n\n80\n00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.140\nI still get the same bulleted list.\n\n81\n00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.010\nSo I have three characters that\nallow me to make a bullet list.\n\n82\n00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.730\nAn asterisk, a minus sign or\n\n83\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.760\ndash, or plus sign given at\nthe very beginning of a line.\n\n84\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.350\nIt's not wrapped in any sorts.\n\n85\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.100\nIf it's not at the beginning of a line,\nright,\n\n86\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.550\nnotice my tab,\nI start getting a different bullet.\n\n87\n00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.658\nWell why is that?\n\n88\n00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:23.037\nIf I do a space, space doesn't quite\nwork like you would expect it to.\n\n89\n00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:24.840\nI can create sublists.\n\n90\n00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.387\nLets say that I need a variety of cheeses,\nright?\n\n91\n00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:28.381\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.912\n&gt;&gt; Of course because that's exactly what\n\n93\n00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:33.950\nwe need.\n&gt;&gt; I need gouda, and feta, and\n\n94\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.310\ngorgonzola, I need all of them.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n95\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.550\nif I need that but I wanna keep a sublist\nbecause I wanna look at my list.\n\n96\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.857\nMaybe I'm not rearranging it-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:04:41.857 --> 00:04:43.627\n&gt;&gt; To see how I walk through the store,\n\n98\n00:04:43.627 --> 00:04:47.830\nbut maybe I'm rearranging it so,\nthat's the cheese top-level topic.\n\n99\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.160\nAnd then check, check, check, check.\n\n100\n00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.170\nI can get all of my cheeses because I\nknow the cheeses are grouped together\n\n101\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.920\nin the store.\n\n102\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.168\nRegardless of where-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:54.916\n&gt;&gt; They are in the store.\n\n104\n00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.720\nSo, I'm gonna hit tab.\n\n105\n00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.870\nAnd then, my recommendation,\nyou can use another plus sign and\n\n106\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.480\nsay, let's say feta, and then another\nplus sign, and say gorgonzola.\n\n107\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.458\nAnd maybe I'm exposing too\nmuch about myself here.\n\n108\n00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:11.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:12.610\n&gt;&gt; So, cheddar, right?\n\n110\n00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.830\nAnd then a little bit of gouda.\n\n111\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.231\nSo notice I've used plus signs, but\n\n112\n00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:19.400\nI get this indented list.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n113\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.790\n&gt;&gt; I can continue to do that more or\n\n114\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.400\nless as much as I want.\n\n115\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.335\nHowever if I look at this, for me, I'm\nlike, I came back to this a week later.\n\n116\n00:05:32.335 --> 00:05:34.220\nI'm finally gonna go to the grocery store.\n\n117\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.151\nI'm like, well how did I do that?\n\n118\n00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:36.925\nSo I'm like, [SOUND].\n\n119\n00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:41.661\nAnd then I messed up my list because I\nhaven't given myself a hint that this is\n\n120\n00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:43.210\na sublist, right?\n\n121\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.860\nSo I'm gonna tab that back over.\n\n122\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.341\nAnd instead my recommendation is for\neach level of indentation,\n\n123\n00:05:50.341 --> 00:05:55.134\nyou pick a new character to\nstart your list with, right?\n\n124\n00:05:55.134 --> 00:06:00.161\nSo if I have cheddar, and\ncheddar has sharp and mild,\n\n125\n00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:06.970\nand I want an additional sublist,\nI might use mild and sharp as such.\n\n126\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.940\nAnd then I get an additional\nlevel of indentation.\n\n127\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.560\nSo I would pick a different character\nbecause it gives you a nice hint that your\n\n128\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.520\nintentions in the markdown file were\nto have these as a nested lists.\n\n129\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.970\nNow I made a list like\nthis with groceries.\n\n130\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.860\nBut this could easily be-\n&gt;&gt; Like a word breakdown structure.\n\n131\n00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.290\nBut then again, that would be ordered.\n\n132\n00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.220\nSo I think I might need to hang around for\nsome more shows.\n\n133\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.340\n&gt;&gt; Well let's go ahead and say it's very\n\n134\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.210\nimportant that you organize your groceries\nbased on where they are in the store.\n\n135\n00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.608\nAnd so you're gonna order them like one.\n\n136\n00:06:40.608 --> 00:06:42.460\nThat's the first thing I'm gonna come to.\n\n137\n00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.880\nTwo, that's the next\nthing I wanna come to.\n\n138\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.730\nSo let me make a little\nhorizontal rule here.\n\n139\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.478\nAnd then well what's gonna\nhappen first in the store,\n\n140\n00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:52.168\ngiven my grocery store?\n&gt;&gt; It's aisle one.\n\n141\n00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:53.987\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, aisle one, right?\n\n142\n00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:54.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n143\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.590\n&gt;&gt; So let's say it is aisle one.\n\n144\n00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.940\nSo I have bread in aisle one.\n\n145\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.735\nIf you're like,\n\n146\n00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:01.431\nbread is not an aisle one in my store.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:02.050\n&gt;&gt; That's because all\n\n148\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.380\ngrocery stores are different.\n\n149\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.530\nAnd then I say well, here's the dairy and\nthen, aisle three, canned goods.\n\n150\n00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:17.189\nNotice, I get a one, two,\nthree list just by using one, two, three.\n\n151\n00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:19.220\nThat's all I have to do.\n\n152\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.343\nNow I used a period here.\n\n153\n00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:21.630\nWhat if I take this period away?\n\n154\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.150\nIt's not quite the same.\n\n155\n00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.190\nWhat about other separation characters?\n\n156\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.365\nWhat if I've seen people do this, right?\n\n157\n00:07:34.365 --> 00:07:36.105\nStill not formatting.\n\n158\n00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:40.046\nFor an ordered list, that means\nthere is an intrinsic order to it.\n\n159\n00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:43.352\nThe expectation is,\nat least at the beginning,\n\n160\n00:07:43.352 --> 00:07:47.725\nthere's always fancy tricks\nthat you can pull, number, dot.\n\n161\n00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:51.705\nNow if you're in the bread aisle,\nand you need hot dog buns,\n\n162\n00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:56.210\nand hamburger buns, and\nyou need some honey wheat bread.\n\n163\n00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.849\nBut you're like, I don't really\nknow the order down the aisle.\n\n164\n00:07:58.849 --> 00:07:59.559\nI just know the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Aisle order.\n\n166\n00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.502\nSo if I tab over-\n&gt;&gt; Don't get silly now,\n\n167\n00:08:03.502 --> 00:08:04.417\nJustin.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n168\n00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:05.022\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n169\n00:08:05.022 --> 00:08:07.440\n&gt;&gt; I know, me being silly.\n\n170\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.560\nWho would have thought?\n\n171\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.650\nSo, I know that in the bread aisle,\nI have those respective things, right?\n\n172\n00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.789\nSo, hamburger buns, hot dog buns and\n\n173\n00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:23.628\nwell, honey wheat bread.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n174\n00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.270\n&gt;&gt; Honey wheat bread.\n\n175\n00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.480\nI wanted to show you this, because I\ndon't know the order in that sublist,\n\n176\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.240\nthat's not necessarily as important.\n\n177\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.070\nBut I can still maintain\nthe order at the top level topic.\n\n178\n00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.900\nAnd then have a sublist\nthat is unordered so\n\n179\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.910\nI can mix these as well\nbased on indentation.\n\n180\n00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.530\nFurther indentation,\nI would still apply the same rules\n\n181\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.640\nto an unordered list where I go,\nwell I need to talk about hamburger buns,\n\n182\n00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.570\nwhether I want potato bread hamburger buns\nor white or wheat, whatever it may be.\n\n183\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.000\nI would change that character so\nI could get further divisions, and\n\n184\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.200\ngive me a visual cue in my markdown\nfile before I accidentally unindent and\n\n185\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.130\njust jack stuff up.\n\n186\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.760\nSo creating lists is pretty easy, but\nthere are a few conventions that I\n\n187\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.260\nrecommend that maybe you find something\nthat works a little better for you.\n\n188\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.108\nJust remember, ordered lists,\nwell, they're numbered, all right?\n\n189\n00:09:13.108 --> 00:09:14.798\nAbout one, two, three, period.\n\n190\n00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:18.840\nAnd then unordered list can either\nuse a plus sign, an asterisk,\n\n191\n00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.923\nor a dash minus sign at the beginning\nof the bulleted point, okay?\n\n192\n00:09:23.923 --> 00:09:26.590\nIndentation, switch around,\n\n193\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.880\nand you'll be good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Awesome Justin.\n\n194\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.660\nThat was so helpful.\n\n195\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.425\nI think I just may create a list of\nall the things I learned in this show.\n\n196\n00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:36.890\n[LAUGH] Hopefully you guys have\nlearned something as well, but for\n\n197\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.120\nnow let's sign out.\n\n198\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.520\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n199\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.971\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at DevPro.\n\n200\n00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:46.869\n[SOUND]\n\n",

It is going fantastic, Cherokee.\n\n8\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.290\nHow are you today?\n\n9\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.860\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\nI'm super excited about learning\n\n10\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.980\nhow to add an image,\nbecause I do use markdown, but\n\n11\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520\nI've never had the urge,\nI've never felt compelled to add an image.\n\n12\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.560\nSo today's my day.\n\n13\n00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.744\n&gt;&gt; Well maybe today is your day,\nor maybe it's not, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.854\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are times where you may want\n\n15\n00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:43.690\nto add an image.\n\n16\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.801\nIf you're building an open source project,\nor\n\n17\n00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.816\nmaybe you're building it as a book, right?\n\n18\n00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:52.488\nYou're writing your book in markdown,\nyou're gonna have it put into PDF or\n\n19\n00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.320\nePub or .moby, whatever it may be.\n\n20\n00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.060\nYou may have images, right?\n\n21\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.000\nMaybe you have diagrams.\n\n22\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.820\nIf you're running a technical document,\nyou have screenshots or actual drawings,\n\n23\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.210\nright, architectural drawings.\n\n24\n00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.670\nWhatever it may be,\nthose are times where you may have images.\n\n25\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.930\nNow, we do use markdown internally here.\n\n26\n00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.220\nWe typically don't have\na lot of images in ours.\n\n27\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.530\nIt's just a very much text and lists.\n\n28\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.230\nBut it's more for\nus than it is anything else.\n\n29\n00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.170\nSo if you haven't used an image,\n\n30\n00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.160\nthere's nothing wrong with that but\nmaybe one day you're like man,\n\n31\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.460\nit would be real awesome if I just had\na png of a logo right here at the top.\n\n32\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.370\nWell, you can do that in markdown and\nit's actually pretty easy.\n\n33\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.126\nFull disclosure,\nbecause we don't do it a whole, whole lot.\n\n34\n00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:38.251\nI sometimes get things backwards and well,\n\n35\n00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.490\nyou may get to watch me\nstruggle a little bit.\n\n36\n00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.570\nBut in order to get the struggling\nstarted, let's go ahead and\n\n37\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.160\ncome into the screen here and\nget things set up.\n\n38\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.950\nFirst off,\nI've just grabbed our logo, right?\n\n39\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.230\nThis is DevPro, but we're associated\nwith ITProTV, so here we go.\n\n40\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.010\nITProTV logo, all good.\n\n41\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.776\nAnd let's create a new document called\nadding images, just like that, .md.\n\n42\n00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.600\nAgain it's a markdown file.\n\n43\n00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.474\nNow, in order to add images,\nit's similar to creating links.\n\n44\n00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:16.380\nBut here's the general kind of an outlook.\n\n45\n00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.280\nWe have an alt text and\nthen we have the img link right here.\n\n46\n00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.230\nSo what is the image?\n\n47\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.660\nNow because I'm not on the interweb.\n\n48\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.110\nOr it's not being rendered through\na website, or it's not all being compiled.\n\n49\n00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.957\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; You may get\n\n50\n00:02:32.957 --> 00:02:36.780\nsome weirdness within the rendering\nof the document in our text editor.\n\n51\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.260\n&gt;&gt; So if you have it locally, the image,\nand then you try to share it externally,\n\n52\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.840\nwill others be able to view that?\n\n53\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.250\n&gt;&gt; They have to have the image kind of\nshipped with it, unless you turn it into\n\n54\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.231\na PDF at which point it becomes\nan embedded part of the document.\n\n55\n00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:52.100\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; So that's our general rule.\n\n56\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.760\nBut let's see how that kinda works out,\nright?\n\n57\n00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.630\nSo, if I exclamation point, what is our?\n\n58\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.240\nThis is just our logo.\n\n59\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.193\nAnd then, well, hm,\nlet's itpro, all right,\n\n60\n00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:07.335\ncould have named that a little easier.\n\n61\n00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:09.987\nitpro.tv.pgn.\n\n62\n00:03:09.987 --> 00:03:13.450\nLet's see if we can get this to render,\nand there it is.\n\n63\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.930\nIt's actually that easy.\n\n64\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.910\nNow what is the alt text?\n\n65\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.060\nThat's an accessibility feature,\njust in case you forget to send the image.\n\n66\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.990\nIt's actually gonna render that alt text,\n\n67\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.120\nthat alternate text,\nto describe what the image should be.\n\n68\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.778\nThis should be the logo.\n\n69\n00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:33.230\nSometimes this alt text is probably\nbetter to have a more descriptive image.\n\n70\n00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.062\nLike itprotv-logo, right, just like that.\n\n71\n00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:41.870\nIt doesn't change anything when\nthe image actually renders, but\n\n72\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.695\nif the image is not there,\nit's gonna be a little more descriptive.\n\n73\n00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:48.360\nDon't go crazy with that and\ngo I gotta do all these thing, no,\n\n74\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.270\nthat's not what I mean.\n\n75\n00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.420\nAnd this looks very similar\nto external links, right?\n\n76\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360\nAnd to some extent internal links.\n\n77\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.040\nThe only difference is this\nexclamation point, and\n\n78\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.940\nthen here I'm not linking to a website,\nI'm linking to an image.\n\n79\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.400\nAnd that little change of\nsyntaxes bring this image in.\n\n80\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.950\nSo I'm gonna compare that.\n\n81\n00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.360\nWe come over to external links.\n\n82\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.980\nThis is from a previous episode.\n\n83\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.846\nAnd I look, notice then, well,\nthere's Google and here's.\n\n84\n00:04:17.846 --> 00:04:22.162\nBut down here,\nwe had this ability to rename things.\n\n85\n00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:25.580\nRight, we could have this name look up.\n\n86\n00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.700\nThat makes me think we\nshould try that with images.\n\n87\n00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.010\nBecause what if you have\nvery long image URLs?\n\n88\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.488\nMaybe you're hosting all of your images\non s3, so you don't have to remember,\n\n89\n00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:39.480\nwell, did I put the images in\nthat zip file with that document?\n\n90\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.190\nYour goal then is as long as I have\nInternet connection, it can grab it and\n\n91\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.370\nput it in the document, right?\n\n92\n00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.055\nSo let's go ahead and close out of that\nand see if we can get a named image here.\n\n93\n00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:55.224\nSo we go here and now,\n\n94\n00:04:55.224 --> 00:05:00.155\nI forgot that I'm not in Vim, and\n\n95\n00:05:00.155 --> 00:05:06.849\nwe come down here and\nwe say itprotv-logo and\n\n96\n00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.567\nlet's just img, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:15.440\nSo we go here, and we take this,\n\n98\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.871\nand we cut it and boom.\n\n99\n00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.391\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like\ncreating an alias here.\n\n100\n00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:22.026\nI don't know.\n\n101\n00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:25.574\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to some extent it is like\ncreating an alias, but it doesn't quite\n\n102\n00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:29.940\nwork yet, right, because the image has\nto do a lookup internal to the document.\n\n103\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.527\nThis has disappeared, but now itpro.\n\n104\n00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:38.633\nYou know what, from here on out,\nCherokee, I'm gonna need-\n\n105\n00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:39.523\n&gt;&gt; How do you spell it?\n\n106\n00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:40.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n107\n00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:41.970\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I don't know.\n\n108\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.720\nWe're gonna have to logo-img and\nuh-oh, here we go.\n\n109\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.830\nWe got something going on.\n\n110\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.720\nIt did the lookup but what's going on.\n\n111\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n112\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.310\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure ITProTV, there we go.\n\n113\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.398\nAnd if we come back and look at\nexternal links, we need to make sure.\n\n114\n00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:01.998\nOkay, this is like that, but\n\n115\n00:06:01.998 --> 00:06:05.977\nwe had some weirdness with internal\nlinks where that didn't quite work.\n\n116\n00:06:05.977 --> 00:06:13.760\nSo hm, let's see here if we come back and\nwe put this square bracket.\n\n117\n00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.430\nStill not working.\n\n118\n00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.810\nWhy is that?\n\n119\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.440\nWell we gotta do a little\nlive action to bugging here.\n\n120\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.370\nitprotv-logo, logo-img, logo-img.\n\n121\n00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.030\nLooks good.\n\n122\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.950\nRemove that, remove that, and\n\n123\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.600\nthat's where there's a little\nbit of a difference here, right?\n\n124\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.570\nSo we tried external links,\ncuz we were like, okay, well,\n\n125\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.332\nthis kinda looks like those links.\n\n126\n00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.740\nI should be able to use\na named alias effectively.\n\n127\n00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.900\nBut there's a little bit different\nsyntax in the context of images.\n\n128\n00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.090\n&gt;&gt; Drop those brackets?\n\n129\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.460\n&gt;&gt; I have to use the brackets up\ntop before the URL or the link or\n\n130\n00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.860\nthe file path or whatever it may be.\n\n131\n00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.063\nI do not have to put the parenthesis or\nanything around it when I'm defining it.\n\n132\n00:06:56.063 --> 00:07:00.981\nSo that one's a little bit different, but\nnow you can just say, well, here's an alt\n\n133\n00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:04.986\ntag and here's the named image\nreference and everything is good to go.\n\n134\n00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:05.820\nAll right, so\n\n135\n00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.858\nthose are two ways that we can add\nimages to our document pretty easy.\n\n136\n00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:13.070\nAnd if I had a whole bunch of them, I\nwould probably put aliases at the bottom.\n\n137\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.220\nPick a naming convention that's\nnot hard to type or super long.\n\n138\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.220\nAnd then you can just kind of\nuse them as you need them.\n\n139\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.310\nIf you only need them one or two times,\nI would probably do them inline,\n\n140\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.510\nand you're not limited\nto just local images.\n\n141\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.730\nYou can actually put a full web URL and\neverything will still work.\n\n142\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.420\nNow because I'm not rendering this online,\nI haven't done that.\n\n143\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.807\nBecause my editor and Internet being\na little flakey here and there.\n\n144\n00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.280\nI didn't wanna risk it.\n\n145\n00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.989\nIt is capable if you're using like GitHub,\nor Bitbucket, or anything to markdown.\n\n146\n00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.416\nOr excuse me, to render, or\nif you're actually running it through\n\n147\n00:07:48.416 --> 00:07:51.844\na transformation process where\nyou're getting a PDF, an ePub, or\n\n148\n00:07:51.844 --> 00:07:55.200\nsomething like that, and\nyou have active Internet connection.\n\n149\n00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.144\nSo you can use full URLs for\na web based resource.\n\n150\n00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:02.530\nI've just used mine locally so\neither one works.\n\n151\n00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.239\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\nWell now I'm gonna turn my notes in with\n\n152\n00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:10.100\nall sorts of little bells and whistles now\nJustin, so thank you so much for that.\n\n153\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.908\nI know you're shaking your head at me\nlike I'm just crazy, but that's okay.\n\n154\n00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:14.558\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know that too.\n\n155\n00:08:14.558 --> 00:08:16.059\nThank you so much for joining us though.\n\n156\n00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.120\nWe're gonna sign out now.\n\n157\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.690\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n158\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.430\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n159\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.050\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at DevProTV.\n\n160\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.427\n[SOUND]\n\n",

I am doing fantastic, Cherokee.\n\n10\n00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.840\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.820\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing wonderful.\n\n12\n00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.100\nI've had a lot of caffeine and\nwe just watched our last show about\n\n13\n00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.930\nadding an image, but\nthis one's a little bit different, right?\n\n14\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there are times,\nespecially if you're building something.\n\n15\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.430\nMaybe you have a project\nwhere you have a logo.\n\n16\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.340\nYou want the image in your README or\nmaybe it's part of pamphlet or a book, and\n\n17\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.880\nyou're using markdown.\n\n18\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.140\nBut also, if it's in a digital\nformat you're like, this logo,\n\n19\n00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.697\nI want it to lead to my website.\n\n20\n00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.402\nMaybe it's a marketing website or a\nlanding page or additional documentation.\n\n21\n00:00:58.402 --> 00:00:59.220\n&gt;&gt; Click here.\n\n22\n00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n23\n00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.755\nI don't know if it's gonna blink.\n\n24\n00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I make no promises about that.\n\n25\n00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:04.666\n&gt;&gt; I told you it's the caffeine, Justin.\n\n26\n00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.171\nYou gotta-\n&gt;&gt; Wee, [LAUGH] but\n\n27\n00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.627\nit would have been nice if when\nyou hover over that image,\n\n28\n00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:13.030\nit becomes a clickable\nlink instead of just text.\n\n29\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.080\nAnd you may have seen this on websites,\nbut\n\n30\n00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990\nyou could actually do that in markdown.\n\n31\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.613\nForewarning, we're kinda combining\ntwo elements, and it gets a little,\n\n32\n00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:23.379\nyou're like, that's [NOISE].\n\n33\n00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:25.100\nI need a nap after that.\n\n34\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.390\nBut it will be okay, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.150\nSo let come down into the computer here.\n\n36\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.750\nAnd well, let's just create a new,\nlet's say images with links.\n\n37\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.330\nImages with links.\n\n38\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.360\nNow when I say links,\nI'm talking about hyperlinks,\n\n39\n00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.760\nnot the linking to a file necessarily\nbecause we've already done that.\n\n40\n00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.610\nAnd unfortunately in technology,\n\n41\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.660\na lot of times there are-\n&gt;&gt; Duplicate terminology?\n\n42\n00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.170\n&gt;&gt; There are duplicate terminologies,\nlike the word server.\n\n43\n00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.210\nIn my world, server means something\ndifferent than maybe in your world, right?\n\n44\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.550\nPhysical architecture versus\napplication architecture.\n\n45\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.600\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n46\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.610\nAnd we have images with links.\n\n47\n00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.816\nSo just as a quick reminder,\nif we go [SOUND] and\n\n48\n00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:13.042\nsay, ITProTV like so,\nthat is the alt text.\n\n49\n00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:17.213\nAnd then if we put ITProTV.png like so,\nand\n\n50\n00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:22.720\nmake a preview,\nit pulls that image into our document.\n\n51\n00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.180\nNotice it is still the same click.\n\n52\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.020\nAnd let me make this a little larger here.\n\n53\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.890\nThis is just a standard pointer,\nit's not a click to anywhere.\n\n54\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.600\nBut if I come out here and\nI think about it,\n\n55\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.580\nthis is almost like the text\npart of a hyperlink.\n\n56\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.087\nSo remind ourselves about external links,\nand we come here and\n\n57\n00:02:47.087 --> 00:02:49.988\nwe say google, like so, google.com.\n\n58\n00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:54.666\nAnd notice, actually let me just make\ngoogle because if I put google.com it\n\n59\n00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:57.233\nalready goes yeah, that's a link.\n\n60\n00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:01.644\nBut if I say https://www.google.com,\n\n61\n00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:07.420\nlike so,\nthis becomes a link that links to Google.\n\n62\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.890\nBut let's say for ITProTV, the image\nshould also link back to the home page.\n\n63\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I look here, eh,\n\n64\n00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.400\nif I take this and I were to put\nit in here instead of the text,\n\n65\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.930\nI may actually get\na clickable linked image.\n\n66\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.680\nWell, let's see if we can accomplish that.\n\n67\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.269\nAnd I'm gonna remove this,\nand come here, and\n\n68\n00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.113\nI'm gonna wrap all of this, right,\nall of our image markup, or\n\n69\n00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:44.180\nmarkdown, or eh, markdown,\nit's not a markup language, but kinda is.\n\n70\n00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.080\nAnyway, and then-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n71\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.940\nit's like a little play on words\nthey've got going on here.\n\n72\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're a shifty bunch.\n\n73\n00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:51.799\n&gt;&gt; So punny!\n\n74\n00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see what you did there.\n\n75\n00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.190\nI'm not sure, anywhere I can\ngo with it but it's all right.\n\n76\n00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.440\nSo if I move this back over and\n\n77\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.597\nI say https://itpro.tv.\n\n78\n00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:08.990\nOkay, and there we go.\n\n79\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.865\nNotice this now changes to the actual\nlittle clicking finger and\n\n80\n00:04:14.865 --> 00:04:19.216\nthen actually sends us\nto the ITProTV website,\n\n81\n00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:26.090\nassuming that I haven't messed up in\nmy haste with the actual domain name.\n\n82\n00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.440\nSo let's click it.\n\n83\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.240\nLet's see what happens.\n\n84\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.470\nSo I click it, and, boom, there we go.\n\n85\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.680\nIt actually takes us to that site,\nit'll open it up.\n\n86\n00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.470\nThis is a document.\n\n87\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.160\nIf this was online,\nit would just kind of redirect you.\n\n88\n00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.030\nIf I'm not mistaken, it opens a new\ntab by default when it renders.\n\n89\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.140\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n90\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.840\nBut I've done that by nesting two elements\nthat I already knew how to use, right?\n\n91\n00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.960\nIf I instead wanted to, if I come back and\nlook, and I look at creating images.\n\n92\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.610\nWhere'd you go?\n\n93\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.346\nAdding images, excuse me.\n\n94\n00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:07.360\nI can do this named portion,\nright, just like here, or here.\n\n95\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.910\nWhat if the source of the image was\nactually somewhere on the page?\n\n96\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.350\nSo you go, okay, well,\nI want a link to ITProTV, but\n\n97\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.363\nI want to use the image from their page\nbecause I don't wanna download it.\n\n98\n00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.170\nOr maybe you're doing this internally and\nthis is your logo, right?\n\n99\n00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.580\nIt's on S3.\n\n100\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.870\nIf I come to adding images,\nI actually have our image URL.\n\n101\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.670\nAnd in a previous episode I didn't\nwanna complicate things, but\n\n102\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.610\nI can just put that right in line,\nand it still renders.\n\n103\n00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.860\nThis is reaching out to the Internet,\nin an S3 bucket in this case,\n\n104\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.600\ngrabbing the image, and it's there, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.372\nThis is kind of messy, so\nif I wanted to instead grab this and,\n\n106\n00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:03.502\nSay logo, just like that,\n\n107\n00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:09.349\npaste, boom, and then-\n&gt;&gt; Maybe make something a little shorter.\n\n108\n00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:10.288\n&gt;&gt; Logo.\n\n109\n00:06:10.288 --> 00:06:15.490\nSo the itpro.tv,\nthat is the alt text for this image.\n\n110\n00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.320\nThe logo actually looks up for this URL.\n\n111\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.100\nThis is all wrapped with that\nexclamation point at the front,\n\n112\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.500\nwhich creates the image.\n\n113\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.560\nBut then I wrap the image again,\nand send it this link, this href.\n\n114\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.520\nSo now I have a clickable link that\nactually loads the image from a remote\n\n115\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.680\nresource.\n\n116\n00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.564\nAnd I've done that by taking the\nindividual pieces that I already knew in\n\n117\n00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.313\nmarkdown, and\nkind of composing those together.\n\n118\n00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:43.630\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool, and I mean,\nyou got a nice little workable.\n\n119\n00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.240\nI mean, I don't know exactly what\nI'll be adding into my documents, but\n\n120\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.970\nnow I know I have the option to do so.\n\n121\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.250\nSo thank you, Justin.\n\n122\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.784\n&gt;&gt; Not a prob, and just as a quick\nreminder, where are we gonna put these?\n\n123\n00:06:55.784 --> 00:06:57.130\nThis might be in Dropbox.\n\n124\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.590\nThese images could be hosted in Dropbox,\nGoogle Drive, Clicker, Instagram,\n\n125\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.290\ndepending on how you share those.\n\n126\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.480\nSo if you wanted to build a document\nthat sourced those images,\n\n127\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.270\nmaybe you're building a little flyer or\nall of your icons are there, or\n\n128\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.900\nyou have a design team that's\nputting images into Dropbox.\n\n129\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.220\nYou can continue writing,\njust update the links, and\n\n130\n00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.243\nthen when you export this to a PDF,\nit pulls those either remotely, right,\n\n131\n00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:26.560\nfrom Dropbox, from that shared link,\nputs them in there.\n\n132\n00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.450\nOr if you put on Github, Bitbucket or\n\n133\n00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.875\nany other hosting service, it pulls those\nbut also creates a link that is clickable.\n\n134\n00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.190\nIf I'm not mistaken, pdf still has\nclickable links in them as well, so\n\n135\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.180\nif you export it as a pdf you\nkinda get all of that in one.\n\n136\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.230\nInteresting, well, thank you so\nmuch for your time today, Justin.\n\n137\n00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.690\nAnd thank you for your time as well.\n\n138\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.310\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n139\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.820\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n140\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.610\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n141\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.717\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at DevProTV.\n\n142\n00:07:49.717 --> 00:07:55.007\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I am doing fantastic, Cherokee,\n\n8\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.410\nhow are you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well,\n\n9\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.200\nI'm looking forward to learning\nhow to create tables, and\n\n10\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.330\nmaybe even some ASCII hearts and\nstars and smiley faces.\n\n11\n00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.201\nAre we gonna do that today, Justin?\n&gt;&gt; Well, I might be\n\n12\n00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.290\nable to deliver all but one of those and\nit is not the ASCII hearts or stars.\n\n13\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.081\nI will say, ASCII heart is kind of\nhard actually, you're like all right,\n\n14\n00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.170\nI gotta put all these characters together.\n&gt;&gt; I have seen some really\n\n15\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.180\nintricate things out there.\n&gt;&gt; I have as well, like people's faces.\n\n16\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.503\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is crazy but\n\n17\n00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:55.385\nthat is not what we are going to do but\nit does tie in,\n\n18\n00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:59.360\nbecause well there are times where\nyou want to have like tabular data.\n\n19\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.020\nI want rows and columns for arrangements,\nand maybe its just check boxes or\n\n20\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.490\nmaybe it's checklists or maybe it's\na feature comparison between two products.\n\n21\n00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.650\nAnd your well I could do that as\nan image and then bring it in, but\n\n22\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.680\nI really just need more or less a simple\ntable, well, if I do that in Markdown when\n\n23\n00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.820\nI export it I get decently rendered\ntables and if it's on the web it ends\n\n24\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.895\nup becoming a nicely styled HTML table.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n25\n00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:32.515\nalso, I know just from personal\nexperience, if I'm in an area with poor\n\n26\n00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:36.755\nnetwork bandwidth, like a highly NC\nenvironment maybe it's just more\n\n27\n00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.585\nbeneficial to have a table instead\nof trying to bring in an image and\n\n28\n00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:43.347\nwaiting for that to load also.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly if you have something that's\n\n29\n00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:47.047\nrendering it for you kind of on the fly\non a local machine you're more or less\n\n30\n00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:52.237\ntransmitting text or markdown and then\nwhat you're seeing is the rendered output.\n\n31\n00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:55.097\nSo, it’s just saying well you\nfollow this convention boom,\n\n32\n00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:57.267\nhere's the rendered output,\nand we're all good to go.\n\n33\n00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:02.260\nSo, very nice, now, we're gonna see\nhow tables work it's a little more\n\n34\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.420\ncomplicated than some of the things\nwe've seen in Markdown thus far.\n\n35\n00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.680\nSo do kind of buckle up, hold on, and take\na look at some of these small details,\n\n36\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.510\nI still mess them up from time to time,\nso no worries.\n\n37\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.400\nSo if we come into the screen here and,\nwell,\n\n38\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.870\nlet's just start creating some tables.\n\n39\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.510\nAnd, well, let's just call it tables.md,\nthere we go so\n\n40\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.570\nin order to create tables we\nneed a variety of characters.\n\n41\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.680\nThe table columns are divided\nby a vertical pipe, so this\n\n42\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.362\nvertical pipe, unfortunately it's usually-\n&gt;&gt; Underneath here.\n\n43\n00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:40.100\n&gt;&gt; Right above, it's below delete or\n\n44\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.450\nbackspace, depending on your computer, or\n\n45\n00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.830\nright above your enter key and you have\nto hold shift, so with a back slash.\n\n46\n00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.590\nIs that back slash?\n\n47\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.720\nI always get those mixed up, yeah, that's\na back slash, you're leaning backwards.\n\n48\n00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.100\nOne some keyboards,\n\n49\n00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.764\nit actually shows not a solid-\n&gt;&gt; A double\n\n50\n00:02:55.764 --> 00:02:56.503\nslash.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n51\n00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.050\nnot a solid vertical pipe\nit shows vertical but\n\n52\n00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.670\nthen there's part of it\nmissing in the middle.\n\n53\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.520\nBut if you type it it'll still be\na solid vertical pipe in your text, so\n\n54\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.290\nif you've never typed\nthis character before,\n\n55\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.962\nyou're like, I don't know where that is.\n&gt;&gt; Where is it?\n\n56\n00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:09.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a shift-\n\n57\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.334\n&gt;&gt; Knowing is half the battle, Justin.\n\n58\n00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:11.945\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n59\n00:03:11.945 --> 00:03:14.440\nit is and hopefully we don't\nget hit with a trademark issue\n\n60\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.710\njust by saying those phrases.\n\n61\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.560\nBut typing that one character,\nthat was a really long explanation, but\n\n62\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.010\nit's not typical for if you're just\ntyping text, like where did that table,\n\n63\n00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.890\nwhere did that character come from.\n\n64\n00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.860\nI'm familiar with it-\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\n\n65\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.535\nunless you work in PowerShell,\nand then it's everywhere.\n\n66\n00:03:29.535 --> 00:03:30.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I don't work in\n\n67\n00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.590\nPowerShell because,\n\n68\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.550\nwell, it's just against my beliefs.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.530\n&gt;&gt; But I do work in Bash, and\n\n70\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.650\nI use them in Bash and I use them in\nvarious other programming languages.\n\n71\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.980\nSo, I was aware of it but the first\ntime I encountered it I was like,\n\n72\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.620\nwhere is that, it looks like\nan exclamation point but it's not.\n\n73\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.960\nSo, we're creating columns with this so\nlet's say Food, there seems to be\n\n74\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.090\na reoccurring theme with me around here.\n&gt;&gt; It's okay, it's getting near\n\n75\n00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.920\nlunch time so I'm totally cool with it.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n76\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.970\nthen we say Fats, Carbs.\n&gt;&gt; Wait,\n\n77\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.660\nwhat?\n&gt;&gt; Proteins, all right, this is gonna be\n\n78\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.240\nall made up by the way and then notice\nthese kind of create our columns.\n\n79\n00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.830\nAll right, we have Food, Fats, Carbs.\n\n80\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.610\nAll right so we have Food name and\nthen appropriate tabular data there and\n\n81\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.040\nthen here I'm gonna add\njust a bunch of dashes and\n\n82\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.510\nyou're like, wow,\nthat seems like a lot of work.\n\n83\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.100\nAnd it is, but\n\n84\n00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.430\nyou can get pretty fast at it and\nthere are some tools that will help you.\n\n85\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.580\nAnd, typically we're not making\ntables too often, right,\n\n86\n00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.830\nwe're not doing a whole lot of tables.\n\n87\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.780\nBy adding this what that\nallows me to do is it\n\n88\n00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.030\ndivides this header row, right, so,\nI have this row this becomes the header or\n\n89\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.500\nthe set of heading elements of\nthe table and then after this,\n\n90\n00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.450\nwe will have respective record rows.\n&gt;&gt; Does it divide it with a solid line or\n\n91\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.590\ndoes it make it a little bold or\n\n92\n00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.045\nwhat is that distinction?\n&gt;&gt; Well, we are just\n\n93\n00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:03.466\ngoing to have to wait and find out-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [CROSSTALK].\n\n94\n00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:04.035\n&gt;&gt; That's a great\n\n95\n00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:04.881\nquestion.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n96\n00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:07.542\n&gt;&gt; It is a great question, but I don't\n\n97\n00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:11.028\nknow I can't show all of my cards before-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n98\n00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:13.337\n&gt;&gt; We get to them, so whats a food here,\n\n99\n00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:17.170\nI don't know, donuts,\nthat is a horrible food to use.\n\n100\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.529\nFats, a lot.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:20.251\n&gt;&gt; Carbs-\n\n102\n00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.778\n&gt;&gt; Just as many [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:26.882\n&gt;&gt; some more and then Proteins, none.\n\n104\n00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:28.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.850\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we have that,\n\n106\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.760\nnow notice, as I was typing these\nfirst two rows, I try to make\n\n107\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.750\nsure those vertical pipes were the same.\n&gt;&gt; But when you got to the carbs,\n\n108\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.900\nyou just, you gave up Justin.\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did,\n\n109\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.560\nand that's because I like to\nhave a little bit of spacing, so\n\n110\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.530\nI can read the elements, so\nit doesn't all smash together.\n\n111\n00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.160\nI wonder if that messes stuff up,\nwe'll see.\n\n112\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.760\nLet's zoom out and\nlet's come to the reveal and here we go.\n\n113\n00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.090\nThis rendered portion creates a line,\nnotice\n\n114\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.590\nthat I have bold elements for\nthe headings, for\n\n115\n00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.920\nthe header row and\nthen I have the respective record rows.\n\n116\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.380\nThere is a line here, depending on the\nstyle sheet of whatever is rendering it\n\n117\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.910\nthis can be a little different.\n\n118\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.350\nI've actually seen not\nquite as dark of a line,\n\n119\n00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.680\nmaybe it's just bold and\nthen alternating lines there.\n\n120\n00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.680\nOn GitHub I think it's bold and\nthen all the other record rows\n\n121\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.370\nare shaded alternating lines.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n122\n00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.160\n&gt;&gt; So it depends on what the rendering is,\n\n123\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.020\nnotice this still is kinda\nall right even though-\n\n124\n00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I like it.\n\n125\n00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.090\n&gt;&gt; I had stuff,\n\n126\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.680\nman that stuff messed up super bad over\nthere, so if I bring this back and\n\n127\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.620\nnow I have this little\nkinda of work through.\n\n128\n00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.200\nNotice the, some more,\n\n129\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.424\nis still in the Carbs-\n&gt;&gt; Oof.\n\n130\n00:06:56.424 --> 00:06:57.641\n&gt;&gt; Column, right,\n\n131\n00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:02.274\nI don't know if you're saying oof\nabout the carbs or the some more.\n\n132\n00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.778\n&gt;&gt; The some more,\n\n133\n00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:08.480\nhow it's on that double line.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n134\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.130\nI wonder if we can fix that and\nwe'll see if we can fix it for\n\n135\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.970\nCherokee and no we can't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.640\n&gt;&gt; But that actually has to do I think\n\n137\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.490\nmore with me squishing this-\n&gt;&gt; That's the viewer in there,\n\n138\n00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.300\nthe preview.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the view is not so\n\n139\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.160\ngreat so, if I, I always like\nto keep these columns uniform\n\n140\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.350\nwidth just because it's easier to\nlook at your table when it's text,\n\n141\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.280\nwhen it's actually in Markdown\nnot the rendered portion.\n\n142\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.245\nBut if we come back and we add another\nrecord, right, so what's another,\n\n143\n00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:45.310\nCarrots, that is not how you\nspell Carrots and Fats, I don't\n\n144\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.910\nthink there are any, but there are-\n&gt;&gt; Carbs [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.500\n&gt;&gt; A fair amount, you like my\n\n146\n00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.960\nmeasurement system?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] we're not gonna\n\n147\n00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.440\nuse the scientifically perfect gram unit\nof measurement we're just gonna wing it.\n\n148\n00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit of this,\n\n149\n00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.316\na little bit of that and then Proteins I\nthink there might be a small amount,\n\n150\n00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:11.170\nsmall, right, and boom.\n\n151\n00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.339\nNow, if I bring those back over,\nso it renders,\n\n152\n00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:20.933\nmy text messes up and I look for\nthis rendered output, I get bold,\n\n153\n00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:25.120\nkinda thicker, heavier-weight line.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n154\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080\n&gt;&gt; And then I get another line under that,\n\n155\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.010\non some HTML rendered websites,\nthat's actually alternating row shading.\n\n156\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.050\nSo, it'll be a white row, and then\na little gray row or maybe a blue row,\n\n157\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.330\nlike a lighter color so you have that\nvisual distinction between rows.\n\n158\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.844\nYeah, I mean, heaven forbid if you\ngot the nutrition facts of donuts and\n\n159\n00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:49.246\ncarrots mixed up.\n&gt;&gt; I know that would be, you're like,\n\n160\n00:08:49.246 --> 00:08:52.924\nwell I'm all right because\nthere's no fat in donuts.\n\n161\n00:08:52.924 --> 00:08:53.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n162\n00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.810\n&gt;&gt; And you're like [SOUND] and it's bad.\n\n163\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:00.058\nSo, using this table, I can now\nrepresent kind of any amount of data,\n\n164\n00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:05.340\nthis could be a feature comparison between\nsites or your product and someone else’s.\n\n165\n00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.330\nYou can write these in\nMarkdown have them render,\n\n166\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.370\nnow, this is one of those\nfeatures I'm saying Markdown.\n\n167\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.050\nWe're talking specifically\nabout GitHub-Flavored Markdown,\n\n168\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.440\nI know that renders appropriately.\n\n169\n00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.950\nI am not 100% sure I've looked around and\n\n170\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.846\nsometimes Markdown multi Markdown,\nthe types of Markdown are not\n\n171\n00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:29.200\n100% clear about whether they\nrender tables correctly or not.\n\n172\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.390\nIf I'm not mistaken,\nthis works very well for,\n\n173\n00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.420\nthis is not the mistaken part, this works\nvery well for GitHub-flavored Markdown and\n\n174\n00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.130\nanything that supports\nthat flavor of Markdown.\n\n175\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.680\nOther renderers that are using\na different Markdown flavor\n\n176\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.570\nyou may get weird results\nthis may not work at all so\n\n177\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.830\ndo keep that in mind this is\none of those Educates features.\n\n178\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.590\nThere are a few other things about tables\nthat are kind of interesting, okay.\n\n179\n00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.640\nSo if I scroll this back over and\n\n180\n00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.210\nthis by default is left justified\nit's kinda hard to see.\n\n181\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.720\nBut I want these respective\ncolumns let's say\n\n182\n00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.630\nI want the Fats centered,\nI want them centered.\n\n183\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:19.420\nSo I add a colon and\na colon to this row, okay, so we may not\n\n184\n00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.900\nbe able to see a whole lot of difference\nand now we kind of have this centered.\n\n185\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.050\nBut we'll see a difference\nbetween these two rows\n\n186\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.040\nbecause I'm going to right\njustify Carbs and Proteins, so\n\n187\n00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.580\nin order to right justify,\nfor the respective rows,\n\n188\n00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.850\nadd that and notice that actually\njumped over and right justified.\n\n189\n00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.620\nAnd then I'm going to add\none here as well and now,\n\n190\n00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.940\nthe text in the Fats column is centered.\n&gt;&gt; Nice, so\n\n191\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.560\nwe see here in Markdown that the colon is\naffecting the nutrition, but in real life,\n\n192\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.750\nthe nutrition affects the colon.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I see what you did\n\n193\n00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.430\nthere.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.170\n&gt;&gt; And I'm not sure if that's how I would\n\n195\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.890\nremember it when in fact the colon\nis affecting the text layout.\n\n196\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.530\nSo do keep that in mind and\n\n197\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:16.100\ndon't get, man, you went there and\nI congratulate you.\n\n198\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.218\nBut here we have a colon on either\nside of this header, right,\n\n199\n00:11:20.218 --> 00:11:25.190\nthis heading designation,\nmeans center this column, right.\n\n200\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.120\nThat's how you determine if\nit's centered without them,\n\n201\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.830\nit's left justified by default, with\nit on the right, it is right justified.\n\n202\n00:11:35.016 --> 00:11:37.580\nThe only thing is if you\ndon't pre plan this,\n\n203\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.280\nnotice how my column's\ngot all out of whack.\n\n204\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.680\nThe rendered portion looks fine,\nright, the justification is right but\n\n205\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.240\nif you come here and\nyou start looking at your text,\n\n206\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.430\nthis now bothers me.\n&gt;&gt; So would you say to remove\n\n207\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.480\none of the dashes and\nreplace it with a colon to compensate for\n\n208\n00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.360\nthat spacing issue you're seeing?\n&gt;&gt; You could do that,\n\n209\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.488\nwhat I typically do is because we're\nkind of running out of room real estate,\n\n210\n00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:04.925\nI as I'm working kinda planning out,\n\n211\n00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:08.890\nI'll make it just a little bit bigger\nuntil it gets to a certain extent, right.\n\n212\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.510\nSo I just went back and\nadded spaces to each one of these lines,\n\n213\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.420\nto line them up again and\nthat's just for readability for me.\n\n214\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.220\nThere's nothing the computer needs that\nfor, right, our Markdown parser but\n\n215\n00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.570\nif I come back and I add these like so,\nnow it's all back in line,\n\n216\n00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.840\nI get a little more real estate,\nand it's all good.\n\n217\n00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.370\nYou could do exactly as you said and\nsay, well if I added to colons but\n\n218\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.275\nI want the space to be exactly the same,\ntake out two of the dashes.\n\n219\n00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:39.836\nYour font may not be monospace font,\nso it still may not be totally right,\n\n220\n00:12:39.836 --> 00:12:45.215\nit should be plain text, but depending\non what your editor is rendering it as,\n\n221\n00:12:45.215 --> 00:12:49.858\nif it's not monospace font,\nmono width you want a uniform width for\n\n222\n00:12:49.858 --> 00:12:51.873\nall characters.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Not all fonts are uniform with like a W\n\n224\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:00.040\ntakes more space than an A, right,\nso be careful cuz if you use one\n\n225\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.830\nof those fonts in your editor if you are\nnot using visual studio code or whatever,\n\n226\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.710\nyou may have a hard time getting things\nto match up in this vertical pattern.\n\n227\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.390\nYou don't have to have them,\nbut for some reason,\n\n228\n00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.540\nI have a little bit of\na compulsion that makes me want to\n\n229\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.280\nline those vertical bars up.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n230\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.470\n&gt;&gt; And I will add spaces as I need them so\n\n231\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:26.970\nlike some more, if I had a really long\nsentence I would probably just add more\n\n232\n00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:35.000\nspace to that until I get to a certain\nlevel, I don’t want it to run on forever.\n\n233\n00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.640\nThe wrapping portion of\nthe words as you can see\n\n234\n00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.540\nis dependent on the real estate of\nthe rendered table, so keep that in mind.\n\n235\n00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.000\nIt may actually do some word wrap,\ncreate a higher\n\n236\n00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.630\nlarger height columns to accommodate\nhow much text or whatever.\n\n237\n00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.210\nYou can put images in here,\n\n238\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:57.350\nyou can put links everything still renders\njust as it has from the previous episodes,\n\n239\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.770\nbut this is how you make a table,\nchange the justification.\n\n240\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.830\nAnd it's pretty nice to have this tabular\ndata That I can look at, it's good, but\n\n241\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.210\nit renders nicely in the final resultt\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Justin, thank you so much for\n\n242\n00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.280\ntaking my Markdown game\nto the next level here.\n\n243\n00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.430\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off, though,\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n244\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.220\n&gt;&gt;

And well, I will hopefully reveal,\n\n7\n00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:34.218\npull the wool from your eyes, and\nlet you know what I mean by inlining code.\n\n8\n00:00:34.218 --> 00:00:35.328\nSo let me set the scene here.\n\n9\n00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:39.321\nThis is very developer-centric or\nmaybe system admin centric.\n\n10\n00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:43.116\nHave you ever had to list a set of\nsteps that someone had to follow, but\n\n11\n00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:47.110\nwhen you're writing your command-line or\nyour PowerShell commands,\n\n12\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.740\nthey kinda get lost in standard texts,\nright?\n\n13\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.723\nAnd you're like and then run the following\nand then it just looks like normal text.\n\n14\n00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:55.255\nAnd you're like well,\n\n15\n00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.678\nhow am I supposed to know what to do?\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n16\n00:00:57.678 --> 00:01:00.412\nyou need to differentiate it in some way.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n17\n00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:03.410\nthat's what we're trying do is,\nI need these little snippets.\n\n18\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.590\nOr maybe you're trying to draw\nattention that hey, this is a command.\n\n19\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.529\nThis is either a PowerShell cmdlet,\na Bash, a little runtime,\n\n20\n00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.185\na Bash function or a Bash utility.\n\n21\n00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:19.600\nOr maybe it's well, you run this command\nto actually execute this script.\n\n22\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.059\nThese are not meant for\nlong pieces, but more or\n\n23\n00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:28.005\nless either single lines or\neven embedded within text, all right?\n\n24\n00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.241\nSo inlining code is a great way\nto draw attention to those so\n\n25\n00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.766\nyou don't mess things up.\n\n26\n00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:37.623\nBecause I can't tell you how many times\nI've been copy+paste, it says to run this,\n\n27\n00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:40.669\nand then I find out that I\nforgot the final character.\n\n28\n00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:43.453\nAnd then I'm,\nlike I hope that didn't break anything,\n\n29\n00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:46.007\nso cross my fingers.\n&gt;&gt; I've actually read books where\n\n30\n00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.019\nthe author, at the beginning,\nwould actually provide a little\n\n31\n00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:52.279\nkey on how to read this book,\nwhere they came up with their own style.\n\n32\n00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.801\nSo I wonder if there's a standardization\nand I think you're about to tell me here,\n\n33\n00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:57.559\nJustin.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we'll see if it's standard.\n\n34\n00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.686\nI don't know how standard it is cuz I\ndon't typically follow standards as well I\n\n35\n00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:02.924\nwas I probably should.\n\n36\n00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:08.759\nBut it is some highlighting,\nsome styling, that will give us a cue.\n\n37\n00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.969\nAnd then maybe you provide your own\nconvention based on the context of\n\n38\n00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.083\nwhat you're writing.\n\n39\n00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.536\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome to the screen here.\n\n40\n00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:19.868\nAnd this is gonna be fairly easy but\nI wanted you to\n\n41\n00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:24.848\njust grab this little snippet,\nso inline-code.md.\n\n42\n00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:27.245\nAll right, so setting the scene.\n\n43\n00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.464\nIn order to remove the files from the,\n\n44\n00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:36.222\nlets say, tmp directory.\n\n45\n00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.351\nNow, I'm more of a Linux person.\n\n46\n00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:42.859\nI don't know what Cherokee\nwould say in this context.\n\n47\n00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.710\nThen run the rm -rf /tmp/*,\n\n48\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.267\nand I gotta escape that.\n\n49\n00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:56.449\nSo I just type this out, right?\n\n50\n00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.991\nLet's say I'm trying to create\na list of things in order to do.\n\n51\n00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.635\nMaybe the tmp directory is getting\nfilled up with intermediate files, or\n\n52\n00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:07.470\nwhatever it may be, and\nI wanna go ahead and remove them.\n\n53\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.043\nI'm just providing instructions\non what to do for an individual.\n\n54\n00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:14.302\nWell if I open this up in preview.\n\n55\n00:03:14.302 --> 00:03:20.304\nWell that, the tmp directory,\n/tmp/, got it and then run.\n\n56\n00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:25.807\nIt's really hard to differentiate\nunless you're familiar,\n\n57\n00:03:25.807 --> 00:03:29.752\nsuper familiar, I see-\n&gt;&gt; Right and if you put it in quotes or\n\n58\n00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:32.904\nsomething like that then people\nmight actually assume that that's\n\n59\n00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:33.855\npart of the syntax.\n\n60\n00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:35.920\nAnd then you're all kinds of messed up.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\n\n61\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.426\nCherokee you're absolutely correct.\n\n62\n00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.740\nI've seen people go well let me just\nput quotes around it like that.\n\n63\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.638\nAnd then people see this and\nthey go so I need the quotes?\n\n64\n00:03:45.638 --> 00:03:47.973\nNo, you don't need the quotes.\n\n65\n00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:52.070\nThe quotes are meant to say hey,\noffset this.\n\n66\n00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.861\nSo in order to combat that Markdown,\nGitHub-flavored Markdown,\n\n67\n00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:59.128\nbecause of the nature of GitHub,\nthis is very prevalent.\n\n68\n00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:01.537\nThey have an inlining syntax.\n\n69\n00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:07.409\nSo if I remove those quotes,\nit's very similar to ` `.\n\n70\n00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.678\nIt's very similar to those quotes,\nbut now look at that.\n\n71\n00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:16.056\nHere it doesn't render as much,\nas clearly.\n\n72\n00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:22.096\nBut wait for it, what are you doing?\n\n73\n00:04:22.096 --> 00:04:24.894\nHere we go, here we go.\n\n74\n00:04:24.894 --> 00:04:25.940\nThere we go.\n\n75\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.820\nSo I had some weirdness there at the end.\n\n76\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.619\nAnd there we go.\n\n77\n00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:36.503\nI don't have to escape characters because\nthis says keep this literally and\n\n78\n00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:37.967\nprovide some interaction.\n\n79\n00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:42.959\nSo what I mean is originally I escaped\nthat asterisk because it was rendering\n\n80\n00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.385\nas a special character in Markdown.\n\n81\n00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.052\nWhen I put a ` and a `, where is the `?\n\n82\n00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:49.401\nIt's under your Esc key,\n\n83\n00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:53.272\nunless you have a keyboard like mine\nwhere I don't have a physical Esc key.\n\n84\n00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:59.000\nIt's the tilde to the left of the 1, right\nabove your Tab key for the most part.\n\n85\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.850\nIt is just a single ` and\nthen another ` at the end.\n\n86\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.321\nVery much like the asterisk that we\ncan use for italicizing or bolding,\n\n87\n00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.753\nthings of that nature.\n&gt;&gt; And right, and hopefully your actual\n\n88\n00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:14.931\nsyntax that you're trying to convey\ndoesn't have any escape perimeters there.\n\n89\n00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:18.579\nYeah and hopefully is a good key word.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n90\n00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:21.430\nI mean it happens sometimes right?\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely does, and\n\n91\n00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.703\nI'm glad this happened because\noriginally I had this escape but\n\n92\n00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:27.628\nwhen I put back ticks it takes\nmore of a literal approach.\n\n93\n00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:28.913\nIt says this is code.\n\n94\n00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:30.712\nThis is meant to be taken literally.\n\n95\n00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:36.606\nI'm gonna apply some styles to say hey,\nthis is the command to run.\n\n96\n00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:42.995\nAnd it's not going to apply your escape\ncharacters, okay, to the Markdown syntax.\n\n97\n00:05:42.995 --> 00:05:47.780\nBecause you actually may need escape\ncharacters as part of the command.\n\n98\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.230\nIf this was tmp space something,\nI need an escape character for that space.\n\n99\n00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.670\nSo that has to be rendered so\npeople don't mess that up.\n\n100\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.976\nSo as a result,\nI don't need that escape character,\n\n101\n00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:04.731\nbecause that's no longer a valid\nMarkdown kind of section.\n\n102\n00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.103\nAnd this is offset,\nif I come here and read.\n\n103\n00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:10.153\nAnd as I said, in my editor,\nbecause it's dark,\n\n104\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:13.630\nit just gives that little\nbit of highlighting.\n\n105\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.700\nIf nothing else, that's handy, right?\n\n106\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.693\nYou go in order to remove\nthe files from the tmp,\n\n107\n00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:27.039\nthen run rm -rf /tmp/* and\nthen it's all good to go.\n\n108\n00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.636\nNow this is completely in-line, all right?\n\n109\n00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:35.481\nIf I come back and I hit Enter,\nand I hit Enter again,\n\n110\n00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:40.438\nI have seen people use this as,\nthis is a single line,\n\n111\n00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:44.089\nand offset it to where it's like this.\n\n112\n00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.324\nSo it's here, on GitHub, on BitBucket.\n\n113\n00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:53.148\nThis actually gets a gray box, and\neither darker kind of grayish text or\n\n114\n00:06:53.148 --> 00:06:58.310\nsometimes red text,\ndepending on the rendering style sheet.\n\n115\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.563\nIt will let you know, this is a command.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n116\n00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:05.483\nI think it's pretty easy to understand at\nthat point in time you're not guessing,\n\n117\n00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:08.906\nit's pretty obvious.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this is just a helper, and\n\n118\n00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:13.110\nthen applying what Cherokee said\nat the beginning of the show.\n\n119\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.238\nIf you have a standard convention.\n\n120\n00:07:14.238 --> 00:07:16.335\nLet's say you talk about\nthis at the beginning.\n\n121\n00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:21.391\nAnd you say, anytime you see the $, don't\nuse the $, but that means type this in\n\n122\n00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:26.106\nthe terminal, or type this in PowerShell,\nor type this in your interface.\n\n123\n00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:29.100\nSo then people go this highlighted,\nthis is outlined.\n\n124\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.660\nIt has the appropriate syntax,\nit's very literal.\n\n125\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.360\nThere's a $ at the beginning of it.\n\n126\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.640\nThis is the command that I need to run.\n\n127\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.900\nAnd you can just keep on, kind of,\nchaining these together and\n\n128\n00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.102\nthen say, well, here,\ngotta type the right character.\n\n129\n00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:48.635\nWell maybe I need to add something\nto the tmp directory and-\n\n130\n00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.325\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n131\n00:07:49.325 --> 00:07:54.096\nthese are two seperate commands that\nkind of are dependent of each other.\n\n132\n00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:56.597\nSo we need to have these separate\nlines to distinguish that.\n\n133\n00:07:56.597 --> 00:07:57.131\n&gt;&gt; Right and\n\n134\n00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:01.951\nwe're giving some implicit orders, say do\nthis first, do this next, do this next.\n\n135\n00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:05.236\nAnd this is handy,\nespecially if you're writing up\n\n136\n00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.626\na technical-\n&gt;&gt; Tutorial.\n\n137\n00:08:06.626 --> 00:08:08.571\n&gt;&gt; Tutorial, either a tutorial, or\n\n138\n00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.456\na procedure, or\na standard operating procedure,\n\n139\n00:08:11.456 --> 00:08:13.608\ndo this, then do this, then do this.\n\n140\n00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:17.059\nYou can say this is the line,\nthis is the line, this is the line.\n\n141\n00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:23.469\nAnd because it provides literal,\nwithout having escape characters, right?\n\n142\n00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:27.832\nI can say echo, or excuse me, cat.\n\n143\n00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:29.866\nFull disclosure if some of\nyou are watching this and\n\n144\n00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:33.190\nyou're like that's not how you're supposed\nto use cat, I am fully aware of that.\n\n145\n00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:38.616\nIf there's a tmp directory and\nI have something.txt here.\n\n146\n00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:43.926\nAnd then I say | cuz I'm gonna\npipe the output of the cat\n\n147\n00:08:43.926 --> 00:08:49.136\ncommand into grep, and\nsay grep \"tacos\", right?\n\n148\n00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:52.955\nThis is number one, a very odd technical\ndocument because you're grepping a tmp\n\n149\n00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:56.468\nfile for tacos.\n&gt;&gt; I'm always looking for tacos, Justin,\n\n150\n00:08:56.468 --> 00:08:59.738\nthat's my MO.\n&gt;&gt; Well I will say I do enjoy tacos as\n\n151\n00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:00.243\nwell.\n\n152\n00:09:00.243 --> 00:09:03.664\nSo I can't fault you there and\nthen if we come here,\n\n153\n00:09:03.664 --> 00:09:08.696\nall of it is still rendered exactly as\nit should be on the terminal, right?\n\n154\n00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:13.841\nSo I just wanted to show this takes\nvery literal I have some, this |,\n\n155\n00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:19.452\nthat's actually a Markdown thing and\nthat'll start is that a table?\n\n156\n00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:21.882\nBut because it's in `s it doesn't.\n\n157\n00:09:21.882 --> 00:09:24.009\nWonderful for inlining code.\n\n158\n00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:25.397\nI've shown terminal commands.\n\n159\n00:09:25.397 --> 00:09:31.500\nThere's nothing that says that if you\nhave a Python script, or a Node script,\n\n160\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.592\nor a PowerShell script, or\nanything, you run python main.py.\n\n161\n00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:39.630\nAnd still offsets those and\nyou're all good to go.\n\n162\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.190\nSo this is for those little snippets\nof code, gives them offset.\n\n163\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.283\nWe're all good to go.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect well thanks for\n\n164\n00:09:46.283 --> 00:09:48.411\nhelping me enhance my documentation.\n\n165\n00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:50.165\nHopefully you guys learned something too.\n\n166\n00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:51.858\nBut it is that time to sign out.\n\n167\n00:09:51.858 --> 00:09:54.340\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n168\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.542\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here\n\n169\n00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:03.590\nat DevPro.TV.\n\n",

It is going fantastic, Cherokee.\n\n9\n00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:28.280\nHow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n11\n00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.223\nI really don't know how to\ncreate a code block here, so\n\n12\n00:00:31.223 --> 00:00:34.074\nI'm looking forward to whatever it\nis you wanna share with us today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:36.470\n&gt;&gt; Well, Cherokee,\nI figured this was gonna be the case.\n\n14\n00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.422\nI know you're not\nnecessarily a programmer.\n\n15\n00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:40.880\nI know you play around with\na little bit of automation.\n\n16\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.261\nBut you probably haven't had a need for\n\n17\n00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.678\nlarge chunks of code to be rendered\nto where they're readable, right?\n\n18\n00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:51.770\nIn another episode, we talked about\nhow to just do inline commands.\n\n19\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.024\nAnd that makes a sense for\na lot of people, whether it's a developer,\n\n20\n00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:57.852\nwhether it's a sysadmin,\nor just someone learning.\n\n21\n00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:00.896\nI need to run these commands,\na nice little outset.\n\n22\n00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:04.233\nHowever, if you want to get\nsomething a little bit longer,\n\n23\n00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.326\nthat starts to break down.\n\n24\n00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.900\nNow if you've watched\nany of my other shows,\n\n25\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.920\nyou know that I have my hands kind\nof in a bunch different places.\n\n26\n00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.556\nSo I'm gonna use those examples, not\nnecessarily to teach you how to program.\n\n27\n00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:22.031\nBut if you have a particular\nprogramming language that you enjoy,\n\n28\n00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:26.540\nthis may be helpful if you're writing\na tutorial, you're doing an analysis.\n\n29\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.410\nOr maybe, to some extent, you can even use\nMarkdown to write little blog articles,\n\n30\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.760\nchange them into PDF, distribute them.\n\n31\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.070\nOr some blogs actually let\nyou write in Markdown, and\n\n32\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.500\nthen render it appropriately.\n\n33\n00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.210\nSo let's go ahead and\ncome down into the screen and\n\n34\n00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.300\nsee what I mean by a code block.\n\n35\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.760\nSo let's create another Markdown\nfile called code-blocks.md.\n\n36\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.060\nThere we go, and let's say Take\na look at this javascript function.\n\n37\n00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.192\nA very general thing.\n\n38\n00:01:58.192 --> 00:02:03.000\nAnd if I want to make a code block, well\nyou're like well I could just say add.\n\n39\n00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.929\nThis is a horrible kind of super\ngeneric contrived function,\n\n40\n00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.219\nso don't worry about that.\n\n41\n00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.300\n&gt;&gt; Is this the one that you always see for\nan example?\n\n42\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.517\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah you'll see this a lot for\n\n43\n00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:16.408\nan example because we don't\nreally care about the code.\n\n44\n00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:19.550\nThe code could be wrong for all we care.\n\n45\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.476\nHopefully it's not, nope it's not.\n\n46\n00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:24.520\nAs far as I know, you're like\nactually Justin you missed this.\n\n47\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.337\nIf we try to use this, we have it on\na new line and we open it, ooh, ooh.\n\n48\n00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:35.800\nI used appropriate conventions for\nJavaScript, indentation and-\n\n49\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.320\n&gt;&gt; Formatting.\n\n50\n00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.150\n&gt;&gt; But when it came in Markdown,\nit's not really readable.\n\n51\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.120\nWe've kind of run into that other problem\nwhere it's just looking like plain text\n\n52\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.277\nand it's hard for\npeople to understand that.\n\n53\n00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:52.116\nWell, in order to get a code\nblock if I come above this and\n\n54\n00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:53.770\nI put three tick marks.\n\n55\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.005\nAnd really we should end\nthis three tick marks.\n\n56\n00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:03.840\nAnd it's kind of hard to see but\nyou'll see this kind of darker outline.\n\n57\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.766\nIt's on GitHub.\n\n58\n00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.970\nIt's a grey outline.\n\n59\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.061\nYou may not be able to see it,\nbut it's an offset.\n\n60\n00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.641\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that's better.\n\n61\n00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.287\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I can see it slightly,\n\n62\n00:03:14.287 --> 00:03:15.140\na little bit.\n\n63\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and with these monitors you may\nactually be able to see it better where\n\n64\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.209\nyou're watching than necessarily\nCherokee can in the studio.\n\n65\n00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:24.921\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I'm blind too.\n[LAUGH]\n\n66\n00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:26.290\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's also that, and\n\n67\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.620\nI don't mean to laugh at your misfortune,\nso I'm not going to.\n\n68\n00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.617\nSo I have this and it's nice for\nthe formatting, but you know what?\n\n69\n00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.150\nIt still doesn't feel\nlike JavaScript to me.\n\n70\n00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.047\nThe formatting's nice but sometimes it's\nhelpful when you're trying to illustrate\n\n71\n00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:45.672\nsomething that certain\nsyntax is fulfilled.\n\n72\n00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:51.890\nLike keywords or your saying well here's a\nfunction name, look at these parentheses.\n\n73\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.846\n&gt;&gt; Referencing color coding?\n\n74\n00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:55.321\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, color coding.\n\n75\n00:03:55.321 --> 00:04:00.430\nThere's no color coding in here and\nI can't do without that.\n\n76\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.927\nSo if I come here and\nI type JavaScript like that,\n\n77\n00:04:04.927 --> 00:04:10.424\nnot only do you get it in\nthe rendered product but look here.\n\n78\n00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:13.070\nYou actually get it while you're typing.\n\n79\n00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.599\nAnd that's just helpful\nto you in your editor.\n\n80\n00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.710\nIf you open this up in Notepad or\nTextEdit, it's not going to show that.\n\n81\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.680\nIt'll show just this portion.\n\n82\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.240\nBut now I have syntax highlighting.\n\n83\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.750\nThis function is a keyword.\n\n84\n00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.612\nThis return is a keyword.\n\n85\n00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:33.950\nadd, that's the function name,\nx and y are parameters.\n\n86\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.800\nAnd it's not perfect all the time.\n\n87\n00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.140\nThis comma really shouldn't be orange,\nI don't think.\n\n88\n00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.699\nBut it's better,\nit helps provide the visual cues.\n\n89\n00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.680\nI wrote the language, right?\n\n90\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.696\nWhat if I change this language to Python?\n\n91\n00:04:48.696 --> 00:04:51.020\nIt goes, the only thing I\nrecognize is the return keyword,\n\n92\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.820\ncuz that's the only thing that's\nsimilar between the two languages.\n\n93\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.657\nSo you have to be careful there.\n\n94\n00:04:55.657 --> 00:04:59.046\nNow on GitHub,\nif you use GitHub or Bitbucket or\n\n95\n00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:01.504\nanything like that to host these,\n\n96\n00:05:01.504 --> 00:05:06.900\na lot of times if you do not put the\nlanguage type, it does some fancy ticks.\n\n97\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.940\nAnd it'll kinda go\n&gt;&gt; Assume it?\n\n98\n00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.000\n&gt;&gt; It'll assume or try to make the best\nguess at what the language type is.\n\n99\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.681\nSo Javascript is this one,\n\n100\n00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.226\nbut if we had another code block where\nyou wanted to compare Java, right?\n\n101\n00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:22.707\nAnd you wanted to compare method, so\n\n102\n00:05:22.707 --> 00:05:27.220\npublic static void main|string[|args).\n\n103\n00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.889\nYeah, you're like what?\n\n104\n00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:36.050\nAnd then System.out.println(\"Hello\").\n\n105\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.495\nJust like that,\nit still uses the same color set.\n\n106\n00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.768\nBut it's recognizing different keywords\nbased on the language that you've\n\n107\n00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:45.320\npicked for them.\n\n108\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.630\nSo you can do this for\ncrazy esoteric languages,\n\n109\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.550\nbut I think the best support is going\nto be for languages that you know.\n\n110\n00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.050\n&gt;&gt; Pretty common\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty common languages.\n\n111\n00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.950\nSo if we do the corollary to the Python\none, this add is the same function.\n\n112\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.254\nNotice it now has Python syntax\nhighlighting because it's Python\n\n113\n00:06:06.254 --> 00:06:08.560\nsyntax versus JavaScript's highlighting.\n\n114\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.411\nAnd I could do the same thing for Java but\n\n115\n00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:16.865\nI would have to write a lot more code for\nan add function so I'm not going to.\n\n116\n00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:18.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Quitter.\n\n117\n00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.613\n&gt;&gt; I know, I know, guilty as charged.\n\n118\n00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:22.664\nI'm not gonna lie.\n\n119\n00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:27.440\nThere's a reason I kinda strayed from\nthe Java world a little bit there.\n\n120\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.701\nBut having the syntax highlighting is very\nhelpful, especially if things like hey,\n\n121\n00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.449\nI wanna show Cherokee, hey,\nhere's this nice little PowerShell cmdlt.\n\n122\n00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.590\nI'm not even sure I could say that with\na straight face and be serious about it.\n\n123\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.294\nBut if I wanted to show her some Bash,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:41.294 --> 00:06:43.650\nCherokee wants to learn more about Linux.\n\n125\n00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.311\nAnd I'm like,\nwell here's some common Bash commands.\n\n126\n00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.929\nOr here's a Bash script that\naccomplishes the following.\n\n127\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.840\nAnd I want to comment it, and annotate\nit and put all it on a Markdown file so\n\n128\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.354\nit looks nice in a PDF that\nI can just hand to her.\n\n129\n00:06:57.354 --> 00:06:58.771\nAnd maybe she reads on her phone or\n\n130\n00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:00.850\nsomething like that then\nthis would be helpful.\n\n131\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.464\n&gt;&gt; I have it like taped up all\nin my bedroom and living room.\n\n132\n00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:07.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, she studies like that.\n\n133\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.983\nBut this is helpful,\ninstead of having it in another editor and\n\n134\n00:07:10.983 --> 00:07:15.387\ntrying to take pictures of it and things\nlike that, it just renders appropriately.\n\n135\n00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:20.440\nAnd luckily, most Markdown renderers,\nGitHub-Flavored in particular,\n\n136\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.820\nthe ones that support it, almost always.\n\n137\n00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.693\nThere are a few exceptions.\n\n138\n00:07:25.693 --> 00:07:32.360\nHave a syntax highlight feature that will\nhighlight based on the language type.\n\n139\n00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.443\nThey always have the triple tick code\nblocks that will provide formatting so\n\n140\n00:07:36.443 --> 00:07:38.815\nyou don't get weird squished formatting.\n\n141\n00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:42.343\nThere's no guarantee based on the style\nsheets that this will always work for\n\n142\n00:07:42.343 --> 00:07:44.560\neverything, so do keep that in mind.\n\n143\n00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.412\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, Justin.\n\n144\n00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:48.470\nThere you have it, no more smushing.\n\n145\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.179\nI appreciate your knowledge today,\nand thank you guys for joining us.\n\n146\n00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.960\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n147\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.500\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n148\n00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n149\n00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.890\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at DevProTV.\n\n150\n00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:02.367\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

It is going fantastic here,\nhow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.265\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.735\nBut I do recall in a previous show, we did\nget together, and we talked about how to\n\n12\n00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:43.975\ncreate a list, an ordered list, and you\nshowed us all these cool little tricks.\n\n13\n00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.552\nWhat will we be looking looking at here?\n\n14\n00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:49.792\n&gt;&gt; Well, you might oversold how\ndifferent they are, actually.\n\n15\n00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.672\nThey're not wholly different.\n\n16\n00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:54.486\nBut this is one of those extensions\nthat we get that is guaranteed in\n\n17\n00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:59.182\nGitHub-Flavored Markdown, where a lot of\ntimes when I'm making a list, I go, well,\n\n18\n00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:03.062\nI need to do x, y, and z,\nwhether it's ordered or not, right?\n\n19\n00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.572\nIf I need to do something first,\nI'll put that as a number one.\n\n20\n00:01:05.572 --> 00:01:09.320\nBut if I just need to accomplish, you've\nheard these called honey-do lists or\n\n21\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.530\njust to-do lists whatever they may be.\n\n22\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.590\nBut a lot of times you're like, well,\ndid I do that or did I do this other one?\n\n23\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.855\nYou either mark them off, if you're\nphysically writing them on paper or\n\n24\n00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.200\nyou'll check them, right?\n\n25\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.220\n&gt;&gt; It creates a sense of accomplishment,\na feeling, that good warm fuzziness.\n\n26\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620\n&gt;&gt; It's either warm, and\n\n27\n00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.395\nfuzzy or you look at how many\nthings that you have unchecked.\n\n28\n00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:35.900\n[LAUGH] Or marked off, and you go,\nI'm not gonna do any of those.\n\n29\n00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.940\nBut associated with a project or maybe\na checklist for setting up infrastructure.\n\n30\n00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.330\nYou're like,\nI need to accomplish these things.\n\n31\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.030\nAnd you wanna keep track\nof it in documentation,\n\n32\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.020\nespecially when you're using\nversion control systems,\n\n33\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.330\nlike GitHub, or BitBucket or well, when\nI say that, that's where they're stored.\n\n34\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.600\nYou're using Git in\nthose common instances.\n\n35\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.670\nThen it would be nice if you could keep,\nhey,\n\n36\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.120\nthis is true, this is a roadmap, right?\n\n37\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560\nThese are the things that I have done.\n\n38\n00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.800\nHere are the things that I plan to do.\n\n39\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.775\nAnd those are either checked off or not.\n\n40\n00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:09.175\n&gt;&gt; Great for shared documents too,\nand shared projects,\n\n41\n00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:12.715\nbecause then you know who's done what,\nyou're not reworking things.\n\n42\n00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:14.245\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n43\n00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:17.325\nActually, I use these in my\ninternal documentation for\n\n44\n00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:22.395\nthe courses that I prepare, so I know\nwhat I have done for respective episodes.\n\n45\n00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:24.145\nSo I just try to keep those as my outline.\n\n46\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.490\nThis is by and large not available\nin all flavors of Markdown.\n\n47\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.000\nI'm not gonna say the one you're\nusing doesn't support it, but\n\n48\n00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.110\nwith GitHub-flavored, it is supported,\nand it's pretty handy.\n\n49\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.640\nSo let's go ahead, and\ncome to the screen here,\n\n50\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.400\nand see how we make a task list\nthat is not wholly different\n\n51\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.070\nthan a regular list, but it does have,\ntypically, a different use.\n\n52\n00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.656\nI'm keeping a running total, instead\nI'm just kinda brain spurting onto the,\n\n53\n00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:55.006\nbrain spurting, I don't even know.\n\n54\n00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:56.158\n&gt;&gt; Gosh.\n&gt;&gt; I don't even know why I said that, woo.\n\n55\n00:02:56.158 --> 00:02:58.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That escalated quickly.\n\n56\n00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:01.165\n&gt;&gt; What kind of task list\nare we working with here?\n\n57\n00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:01.924\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n58\n00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:03.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think we should keep\n\n59\n00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.270\nthe theme, right?\n\n60\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.240\n&gt;&gt; Food?\n&gt;&gt; Food, and groceries, right?\n\n61\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.250\nAnd let's say that you have\nsome kind of digital processor,\n\n62\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.140\nmaybe you have your tablet, or\nyour phone, and you're typing, and\n\n63\n00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.260\nyou want to keep track of\nthe groceries that you've bought.\n\n64\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.810\nSo if I come here, and I say,\nwell I need some carrots,\n\n65\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.660\nand I need some bread, and I need some-\n&gt;&gt; Ice cream.\n\n66\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.660\n&gt;&gt; Ice cream.\n\n67\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.320\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.235\n&gt;&gt; I don't keep any ice cream in my house.\n\n69\n00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ice cream, steak.\n\n70\n00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.860\nMeats, steak, maybe steak again just for\nthe niceness, right?\n\n71\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.797\nSo I have this list, and if I render this,\nand I open the render, gotta actually,\n\n72\n00:03:47.797 --> 00:03:49.470\nboop, there we go.\n\n73\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.400\nThen I just get a a regular list.\n\n74\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.200\nNow, some of the things that we've\nlearned in a previous episode,\n\n75\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.090\nif you wanted to mark this off and\nsay, I've got all the carrots, right?\n\n76\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.060\nI could do this, and\nthat will actually strike this out.\n\n77\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.910\nBut now, I don't have anything that kinda\n\n78\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.070\nreminds me that I'm doing this\ncheck off process versus not.\n\n79\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.960\n&gt;&gt; Strike it out.\n\n80\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.780\nI might just be blind again here, but\n\n81\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.430\nyou mean just having a line\nthrough the actual word carrots?\n\n82\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the strike through, strike it out.\n\n83\n00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.659\n[SOUND] If you were writing this,\nthat's probably what I-\n\n84\n00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.161\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n\n85\n00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:20.883\n&gt;&gt; Line through,\n\n86\n00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:24.165\nand I feel like Cherokee's making\nfun of me, and I'm not aware of it.\n\n87\n00:04:24.165 --> 00:04:25.752\nBut that's all right, that's all right.\n\n88\n00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:30.140\nSo what if instead, I wanted to say,\nhey, there's a little checkboxes, and\n\n89\n00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.370\nI want to know whether I have\naccomplished those things.\n\n90\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.230\nNow, this is a grocery list,\nI would probably use this more for\n\n91\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.730\ntechnical documentation,\nfeatures that I'm doing or\n\n92\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.600\nif I'm trying to set up a process or\nplan something.\n\n93\n00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.390\nWhat stages have I accomplished?\n\n94\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.145\nIf I come here, and I put empty square\nbrackets, and then a space, right?\n\n95\n00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:56.790\n[COUGH] And\nI got some weird rendering here.\n\n96\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.160\nBut that's all right.\n\n97\n00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.960\nSo if I come here, and there we go, and\n\n98\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.000\nthen come here, and\ncome here, and come here.\n\n99\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.590\nThere we go.\n\n100\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.015\nSo if I put these here, and it looks good,\nit doesn't quite do this checkbox, right?\n\n101\n00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.738\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is actually what I do personally, and\n\n102\n00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:25.697\nthen I'll just put a capital x in the\nbrackets whenever I finish something, but-\n\n103\n00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.476\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is not,\n\n104\n00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:33.440\nthis editor is not providing a render\nthat is compatible with this.\n\n105\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.420\nSo I wanted to show you that in case\nyou're using Visual Studio Code,\n\n106\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.502\nthis capital x is exactly what you do,\nthis is a checkbox.\n\n107\n00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:45.400\nIn GitHub-flavored Markdown for full\ncompliance, if you put this on GitHub or\n\n108\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.380\nuse another editor, then this becomes\na checkbox here, and then the X.\n\n109\n00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Sweet.\n&gt;&gt; Actually checks it.\n\n110\n00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.360\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n111\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.980\n&gt;&gt; And to show you that, we've been using\nVisual Studio Code this entire time.\n\n112\n00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.240\nI'm gonna hop over, and I'm gonna open\nanother editor that maybe you've used, and\n\n113\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.990\nit works for you.\n\n114\n00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.410\nI'm gonna open up Atom, and there we go.\n\n115\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.029\nI don't want to consent\nto any telemetry stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.050\nAnd here we go.\n\n117\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.510\nLet's open or add project folder.\n\n118\n00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.140\nAnd I'm going to come to my Desktop.\n\n119\n00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.440\nAnd I'm just gonna open the same folder\nthat I have open in Visual Studio Code,\n\n120\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.860\nand task list.\n\n121\n00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.170\nSo here's my task list,\nit's exactly the same, and\n\n122\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.560\nI forget all the keyboard\nshortcuts are a little different.\n\n123\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.080\nThat's all right.\n\n124\n00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.920\nAnd then, notice down here, no, down here,\nthis actually says GitHub Markdown.\n\n125\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.780\nThis is behind my head here, there we go.\n\n126\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.840\nIt actually says GitHub Markdown\nbecause Atom is produced by GitHub.\n\n127\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.100\nSo you may get a more feature full,\n\n128\n00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.730\nkind of-\n&gt;&gt; More rich.\n\n129\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Rich support for GitHub Markdown,\nbecause this is a GitHub product.\n\n130\n00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.050\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n131\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.520\n&gt;&gt; Likewise, if I come back,\nand I save, and let's see here,\n\n132\n00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.770\nI want to mark down,\nI want to preview, toggle to preview.\n\n133\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.966\nSo here we go.\n\n134\n00:07:09.966 --> 00:07:17.270\nAnd notice, the bullets for\nthis list are now check boxes.\n\n135\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.830\nI can actually check them\nbecause they are HTML rendered.\n\n136\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.290\nThat's not always the case in\nevery document, if it's in a PDF,\n\n137\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.660\nit just looks like an empty check box.\n\n138\n00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.840\nBut notice here, I get a bullet with an x.\n\n139\n00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.455\nAnd this is what a lot of people do\nbecause you don't get necessarily\n\n140\n00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:35.400\nrendering, it's just a reminder.\n\n141\n00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.200\nIf I instead come here, and\nI move this over, and I save,\n\n142\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.510\nit doesn't look like it does anything.\n\n143\n00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.890\nIf I change this to lower case x,\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n144\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.550\nIf I move it back, there we go.\n\n145\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.410\nThat's kind of odd, right?\n\n146\n00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.500\n&gt;&gt; What do you mean odd?\n\n147\n00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.680\n&gt;&gt; That I can't check it.\n\n148\n00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.180\n&gt;&gt; That it's a solid-\n&gt;&gt; It's a solid box.\n\n149\n00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because if this is rendered\n\n150\n00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.880\nto a document, then I'm not going to be\nable to click this, and have it stay.\n\n151\n00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n152\n00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:11.700\n&gt;&gt; But if I now, hopefully, nope,\nhopefully, it's being finicky on me.\n\n153\n00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.190\nAnd this is something that I had trouble\nwith, getting this to render to show you.\n\n154\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.630\nYou put this on GitHub with a lowercase or\n\n155\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:23.180\nan uppercase x,\nyou should get a rendered checked box.\n\n156\n00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:25.950\nHaving this local,\n\n157\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.740\nI didn't want to get into using Git, and\nputting stuff on GitHub, and things.\n\n158\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.250\nThis will give you\na checked box that looks,\n\n159\n00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.580\nby default, like this checked box here.\n\n160\n00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.530\nIf you instead,\nthere's a couple of things to remember.\n\n161\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:46.540\nIf you move these to the end, which kind\nof makes sense to me, it doesn't work.\n\n162\n00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.040\nBecause what it's doing is it's\nreplacing the bullets with a checkbox\n\n163\n00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.020\nin order to make your task list.\n\n164\n00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.320\nSo if you separate those two,\n\n165\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.760\nthe positioning of those\nopen brackets do matter.\n\n166\n00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.380\nSo don't do that,\nput them at the beginning.\n\n167\n00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.810\nAnd wait for it, wait for it.\n\n168\n00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.910\nHere we go, aha, there we go.\n\n169\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.140\nI finally get it to work.\n\n170\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.860\nI like the spaces around it,\nbut depending on your render,\n\n171\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.490\nas we've seen, We can get a nice little\ncheckbox if we just put an X in there.\n\n172\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.260\nNow, Cherokee said she put a capital x,\nI wonder if that matters, and\n\n173\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.040\nit does matter.\n\n174\n00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.580\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, so all of my work that I've\ndone just wouldn't render properly.\n\n175\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that is ultimately\ndependent on the renderer.\n\n176\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; I have used capital x's, and\n\n177\n00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.176\nhad it work.\n\n178\n00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:32.430\nNot 100% sure that it was GitHub,\nit might have been on another\n\n179\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.450\nversion control system that rendered this,\nso don't quote me on that.\n\n180\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.960\nBut if we put a lower case x in these,\nright, I backspace, I lower case x, and\n\n181\n00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.980\nnow, as I write that it,\nmy rendered document gives a check.\n\n182\n00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.450\nI would probably not use this for\na grocery list, right?\n\n183\n00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.430\nActually, I would probably write it down,\nand strike through it.\n\n184\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.881\nBut if I was creating a project or there\nwere steps that I need to accomplish in\n\n185\n00:09:55.881 --> 00:10:00.612\nthe creation of a project, and I need to\nmaintain documentation, I very well may\n\n186\n00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:04.742\ncreate a Markdown document that has\nall the things that I needed to do.\n\n187\n00:10:04.742 --> 00:10:10.481\nAnd as I accomplish them, go back, put\nan x, save, so I can keep track of where I\n\n188\n00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:17.050\nwas, especially if it's going to take a\nlong time in order to complete said thing.\n\n189\n00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.490\nSo task lists are available to you.\n\n190\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.970\nJust remember, the placement isn't\nimportant, and spacing is important.\n\n191\n00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.980\nOne final thing, if I come here, and\n\n192\n00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.170\nI change all of these to asterisks,\nit still renders.\n\n193\n00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.279\nSo it's still just a list, but\nif right after the list character I\n\n194\n00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.960\nput square brackets, and\nthen if I have an x in it, it's checked.\n\n195\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.630\nIf I don't then it's not.\n\n196\n00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.270\nAnd furthermore,\n\n197\n00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.980\nbecause it is just a list character,\nthen some of our other things also work.\n\n198\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.370\nI dunno, like baby carrots.\n\n199\n00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.945\n&gt;&gt; If I come over here,\nnotice, I've gotten carrots.\n\n200\n00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:59.270\nThere's no relationship,\nit's not anything fancy.\n\n201\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.280\nThere's no relationship between sublists,\nand particularly,\n\n202\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.880\nwe check boxes versus not.\n\n203\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.000\nSo if you need to keep\ntrack of to do things,\n\n204\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.150\nthis is a great way inside\nof your Markdown documents.\n\n205\n00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.570\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, now, I can just go ahead, and\n\n206\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.400\ncheck this off my list of\nthings to learn for the day.\n\n207\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.760\nSo thank you for that Justin.\n\n208\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.890\nHopefully, you guys did too.\n\n209\n00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.420\nBut for now, let's sign out.\n\n210\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.050\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n211\n00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.880\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n212\n00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.500\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at DevProTV.\n\n213\n00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.583\n[SOUND]\n\n",
