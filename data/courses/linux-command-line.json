00:00:08.482\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:12.317\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.275\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:16.825\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.614\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:22.260\nin today's episode we are kicking\noff our Linux command line series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.540\nIt's gonna be a lot of fun,\ngonna learn a lot about Linux.\n\n10\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.590\nAnd joining us in the studio,\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.010\nDon, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.020\nThanks for coming today.\n\n13\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.149\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.410\nAnd this is a really fun topic for me.\n\n15\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.050\nDiving into the shell and\nactually getting these working.\n\n16\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050\nWe've got a series coming up on batch\nscripting that's gonna have a ton of\n\n17\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.250\nreally cool things that you can do that\nare all driven by the command line.\n\n18\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.960\nSo we need to know how to get in and\ninteract with that shell,\n\n19\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.380\ninteract with the interface that we have,\nto actually kind of\n\n20\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.810\ntalk right to the Linux kernel and\nget to do some really neat stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.930\nAnd one of the things that I always try\nand remember is that in the Linux world,\n\n22\n00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.450\nalmost everything is developed\nfrom the command line first, and\n\n23\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.330\nthen eventually gets a nice little GUI\nstuck on it, a graphical user interface.\n\n24\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.087\nBut if you just stick in\nthe graphical environment,\n\n25\n00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:12.605\nyou're really limited, there's only so\nmany things you can do.\n\n26\n00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.325\nAnd when you pull those shackles off and\ndive right into the command line,\n\n27\n00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:17.286\nsky's the limit.\n\n28\n00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.520\nSo you can do so much stuff.\n\n29\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240\nSo I'm excited to dive into it here in\nthis episode, and really the whole series,\n\n30\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.930\nto be able to see what we can do from\nthe command line, how we can use it, and\n\n31\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.960\nsome of the neat utilities that are there\nthat let us talk to that system.\n\n32\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.840\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, when we start talking about\nterminals, right, the command line stuff,\n\n33\n00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.640\nthere are terminals.\n\n34\n00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.690\nIt's a little black box that pops up and\nwe type command into it.\n\n35\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.144\nAnd we think, that's kind of vanilla.\n\n36\n00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:41.221\nBut there's a bit more to it than that,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:45.916\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the olden days where we had\na mainframe or something in that nature,\n\n38\n00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.330\nyou would have a dummy terminal.\n\n39\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.100\nAnd a dummy terminal was a keyboard and\na monitor, and when you sat down at it,\n\n40\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.600\nyou would just see a command prompt.\n\n41\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.000\nYou didn't have a graphical user\ninterface, you didn't have a mouse.\n\n42\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.350\nBut on most computers these days,\n\n43\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.722\nwhen you sit down at them, you actually\nget a graphical user interface.\n\n44\n00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.520\nSo that the terminal, the command line,\n\n45\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.740\nis kind of hidden away behind the scenes,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.082\nSo we need to know how to get to it.\n\n47\n00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:13.232\nAnd fortunately, there's actually\na number of different ways to get to it.\n\n48\n00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.563\nNow, remember that Linux,\nwhether it's running as a desktop or\n\n49\n00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:20.270\nwhether it's running as a server,\nit really is the same under the hood.\n\n50\n00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.090\nThere's a lot of operating\nsystems that differentiate.\n\n51\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.480\nYou have Windows Server versus\nWindows Desktop, two different products.\n\n52\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.850\nBut in the Linux world,\nit's really the same.\n\n53\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.170\nThe big difference is that when\nyou install Linux as a server,\n\n54\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.440\nyou normally leave the GUI off.\n\n55\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.490\nSo if you push the power\nbutton on a Linux server,\n\n56\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.600\non the screen you see\nthe text-based terminal,\n\n57\n00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.960\nthe command prompt that you can jump\ninto and start to work with, right?\n\n58\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.800\nBut if you do it on a desktop,\nyou get a graphic user interface.\n\n59\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.970\nSome people put a graphic\nuser interface on a server.\n\n60\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.300\nBut you're not really supposed to,\nbut you can.\n\n61\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.780\nSo either way, if we get the graphical\ninterface, how do we get at it?\n\n62\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140\nWell, it's not that\nthe text-based one is gone,\n\n63\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.810\nthe text-based one is\njust kind of hidden away.\n\n64\n00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.110\nSo let me show you here on my laptop.\n\n65\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.446\nSo this is my laptop, I use it every\nsingle day, and so I have a graphical user\n\n66\n00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:06.912\ninterface on it because I don't want to\ndo everything from the command shell.\n\n67\n00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:08.750\nAlthough, I do a surprising\namount of things.\n\n68\n00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.655\n&gt;&gt; Quite a bit, yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So when I log in,\nit's graphical, right?\n\n70\n00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.980\nSo I can launch in here and\nI can browse my files, and\n\n71\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.250\ndo all the different things that I\nneed to do right here through a GUI.\n\n72\n00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.540\nAnd then that's great, right?\n\n73\n00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.160\nBut if I want to access the terminal,\n\n74\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.050\nthe command prompt is actually\nrunning in the background.\n\n75\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.830\nI just don't see it, right?\n\n76\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.470\nOn most Linux distributions, you actually\nhave usually about six text-mode\n\n77\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.580\nterminals that are running in the\nbackground you're just not seeing, right?\n\n78\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.130\nThey fire up briefly while the computer's\nbooting up, and then the GUI loads and\n\n79\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.920\ntakes over from there.\n\n80\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.250\nSo I'm in X Windows but no Window\nmanagers, all kind of running and\n\n81\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.580\ngiving a GUI.\n\n82\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.720\nIf you wanna see the text based stuff,\nyou can, but\n\n83\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.330\nit's not as good as it used to be.\n\n84\n00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.885\nAnd the main problem with that\nis high resolution monitors.\n\n85\n00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:57.123\nSo the monitor on my laptop,\nI forget my resolution,\n\n86\n00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:00.580\nit's something like 3,200 by 1,800\nsomething ridiculous like that.\n\n87\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.450\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n&gt;&gt; And high resolution monitor,\n\n88\n00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.505\neven like a 1920 by 1080 monitor these\ndays makes the terminal almost unreadable.\n\n89\n00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:09.910\n&gt;&gt; It's like a postage stamp\non your screen, it's crazy.\n\n90\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.410\n&gt;&gt; It's really tiny.\n\n91\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.800\nSo here, let me pull mine up.\n\n92\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.110\nAnd I'm just gonna switch right over\nto one of my text-mode terminals.\n\n93\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.350\nSo you're gonna see my monitor blank out,\nand then there it is, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.280\nI'm now in a text-mode terminal.\n\n95\n00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.070\nAnd it's asking me to login.\n\n96\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.208\nNow, how do I know that?\n\n97\n00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because if you look, I mean,\n\n98\n00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.060\nthat is really, really small.\n\n99\n00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.040\nI know for you guys in TV land, you're\nseeing this in the little boxed in view.\n\n100\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.480\nBut even if you were to full screen it,\nit's really small.\n\n101\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.790\nEven looking at my own monitor,\nit is really small, I can barely read it.\n\n102\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.458\nAnd unfortunately, there's no way for\n\n103\n00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.900\nme to adjust that without like really\ngoing in and re-engineering this terminal.\n\n104\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.381\nYou have to put in a giant font and\nall this other stuff, so\n\n105\n00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:50.480\nthere's not an easy way to do it.\n\n106\n00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.710\nAs a result, this is not how we\nnormally access the terminal.\n\n107\n00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.000\nIf you do, if you ever want to do this,\nthe keyboard shortcuts are Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n108\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.580\nAnd it's usually Ctrl+ F1 through F7, and\none of those will have the GUI, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.219\nMost operating systems\ntoday put the GUI on F1.\n\n110\n00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.490\nSo if I hit ctrl+alt+F1, it should\nreturn me back to my GUI, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.300\nSome distros put it one F7, though.\n\n112\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.140\nAnd you hit Ctrl+Alt+F7, and there you go.\n\n113\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.982\nMeanwhile, one through six,\nor whatever ones aren't used,\n\n114\n00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:23.760\nthose are the text-based terminals.\n\n115\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.920\nSo they're there, they're running,\nand you use them.\n\n116\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.979\nIf you ever lock up your graphical\nuser interface and you're stuck,\n\n117\n00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.878\nyou can drop to one of those terminals and\ntry and fix the problem,\n\n118\n00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:34.697\nit's nice to have, if you also\nhave a magnifying glass [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:05:34.697 --> 00:05:35.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n120\n00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:39.293\nthat's not the normal way that\nwe get into our command prompt,\n\n121\n00:05:39.293 --> 00:05:42.450\nto get into that kind session\nto talk to the Linux kernel.\n\n122\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.910\nSo instead, what we normally\nuse is a terminal program.\n\n123\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.830\nAnd there are a number of different\nterminal programs that are available.\n\n124\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.647\nAnd what you'll find is that over time,\nyou'll find one you really like,\n\n125\n00:05:54.647 --> 00:05:57.934\nthat you'll kind of bond with,\nyou'll team up and be buddies.\n\n126\n00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.035\n&gt;&gt; That's like the Linux manifesto, right?\n\n127\n00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:04.750\nIs do it the way you like to do it and\nthere's many options on the smorgasbord\n\n128\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.300\nof different things that do\nkinda the same stuff, right?\n\n129\n00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n130\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.740\nAnd there's no right or wrong answer here.\n\n131\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.780\nYou need to find the one that\nworks out the best for you.\n\n132\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.989\nNow, the best piece of advice I can\ngive you is don't just use what I use,\n\n133\n00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.197\nbecause what I use is just what I like.\n\n134\n00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:25.013\nAnd I get a little bit lazy sometimes,\nnot lazy as in I don't want to do work,\n\n135\n00:06:25.013 --> 00:06:29.630\nbut lazy as in I'm in a hurry and I want\nto get to a terminal as fast as I can.\n\n136\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.159\nThere might be some flashy terminal\nthat has a lot of bells and\n\n137\n00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.357\nwhistles that's awesome.\n\n138\n00:06:33.357 --> 00:06:34.863\nBut if it's not installed by default,\n\n139\n00:06:34.863 --> 00:06:37.750\nI don't want to deal with it cuz I don't\nhave time to install the terminal.\n\n140\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.358\nI want to use something\nthat's already there.\n\n141\n00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:42.446\nSo a lot of times, I'll pick one\nthat I know is not as feature rich.\n\n142\n00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:44.733\nSo don't let me influence you.\n\n143\n00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:46.072\nYou need to find out what works for you.\n\n144\n00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.500\nOr you might agree with me and say, hey,\n\n145\n00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.403\nI only want to use stuff\nthat's installed natively.\n\n146\n00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:53.420\nI don't want to have to install extra\npackages to get to some crazy terminal.\n\n147\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.900\nNow, when you install your Linux distro,\n\n148\n00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.290\nit will have at least\none terminal available.\n\n149\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.490\nAnd so you can use whatever GUI\nyou've got, if you got Unity,\n\n150\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.290\nor I'm on GNOME here, if you have KDE.\n\n151\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.375\nWhen you bring up your menu and\nyou just type in terminal,\n\n152\n00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.507\nsomething's going to come up, okay?\n\n153\n00:07:11.507 --> 00:07:14.166\nNow, I have a number of terminals\ninstalled in my machine, so\n\n154\n00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:15.500\nI see several choices.\n\n155\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.010\nBut you may only see one, right?\n\n156\n00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.910\nIt just depends on the distro.\n\n157\n00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.790\nAnd the one that you'll normally\nhave is this guy right here,\n\n158\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.990\nhe's called Xterm, right?\n\n159\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.880\nThe X Windows GUI is kind of the defacto\nstandard for graphical interfaces.\n\n160\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.860\nNow, it's changing.\n\n161\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.370\nWe have a replacement for X Windows\ncalled, or Xterm is what that's actually\n\n162\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.620\ncalled, that's slowly being\nreplaced by a product called Mir.\n\n163\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.390\nAnd, or sorry, not Mir, Wayland.\n\n164\n00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.955\n&gt;&gt; There we go [LAUGH].\n\n165\n00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Gotta get my managers right.\n\n166\n00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.100\nSo Wayland is kinda taking over, so\nyou might not have XTerm in that case.\n\n167\n00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.688\nIn which case, you have other\nterminals that might be available.\n\n168\n00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:52.859\nBut normally,\na distro will take some terminal and\n\n169\n00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:56.450\nlabel it as just plain old terminal, okay?\n\n170\n00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.142\nNow in a GNOME environment that's actually\nwhat's called the GNOME Terminal.\n\n171\n00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:04.154\nIn a KDE environment, this would be\nlinking to what's called Konsole.\n\n172\n00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:06.860\nWhich I actually have installed also,\nKonsole with a K.\n\n173\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.190\nThis is from KDE.\n\n174\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.530\nBut there are other terminals that\nare out there that you might see.\n\n175\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.430\nAll of them provide the same\nbasic functionality.\n\n176\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.350\nBut then some of them\nadd a lot of bells and\n\n177\n00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.020\nwhistles that enable you to\ndo some really neat things.\n\n178\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.870\nSo if I were to launch into xterm,\nthat's the oldest one.\n\n179\n00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.690\nThat's the most basic terminal.\n\n180\n00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.939\nAnd when I get into it, I see-\n&gt;&gt; A postage stamp.\n\n181\n00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:30.451\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty small.\n\n182\n00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:34.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And if I were to zoom in,\n\n183\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.500\nI can read it now, right?\n\n184\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.130\nBut xterm is really operating the same way\n\n185\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.850\nas those text mode terminals\nin the background.\n\n186\n00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.130\nIt's just putting a GUI\nwrapper around that terminal.\n\n187\n00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.170\nAnd I can get in and\nI can do some set term commands to try and\n\n188\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.650\nchange the background color.\n\n189\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.140\nAnd other things to try and\nmake it useful.\n\n190\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.410\nBut as far as the GUI is concerned,\nthere's not really any options for me.\n\n191\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.910\nThere's not much of a menu here\nother than minimize and maximize.\n\n192\n00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.610\nAnd even if I go up to the menu\nitems up here, there's just quit.\n\n193\n00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.770\nI don't get a lot of\nfunctionality with xterm.\n\n194\n00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.520\nThis was the original, graphical\nterminal that was made available and so\n\n195\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.090\nit's got a very basic set.\n\n196\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.590\nSo most of us aren't gonna use that one.\n\n197\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.520\nMost of us are gonna use GNOME Term or\nKonsole if you're in KDE.\n\n198\n00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.830\nBut GNOME Term is really\nthe most popular one.\n\n199\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:28.190\nIf you're running Ubuntu,\nDebian, Fedora, RedHat, Centos.\n\n200\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.780\nAll of those distros\ndefault to Gnome Term.\n\n201\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.550\nUbuntu is using the Unity window manager.\n\n202\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.770\nBut the Unity window manager actually\nuses GNOME Term as its terminal.\n\n203\n00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.520\nSo even though it's not GNOME,\nit's still using that terminal.\n\n204\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.400\nSo that's kind of the most popular one.\n\n205\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.610\nAnd that's the one that I'm gonna use for\nthe rest of this series.\n\n206\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.680\nSo for the whole series,\nI'm going to be using the GNOME Terminal.\n\n207\n00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.740\nBut I wanna walk you through a few of the\nother terminals here in this episode to\n\n208\n00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.830\ngive you an idea of which ones might\nbe great or which ones might be lame.\n\n209\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.930\n&gt;&gt; They get kind of fancy,\ndon't they, Don?\n\n210\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.650\n&gt;&gt; They really do.\n\n211\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.090\nSome of them, some have some\nreally impressive feature sets.\n\n212\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.660\nSo, for example,\nlet me just fire up real quick.\n\n213\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.170\nWe'll breeze through a few real quick and\n\n214\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.110\nthen I'll do a deeper\ndive into some of them.\n\n215\n00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.840\nSo, for example, the GNOME Termina.\n\n216\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.670\nIf I just fire up my terminal, this is the\nGNOME Terminal, the default built one in.\n\n217\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.640\nSee how I got a nice big font?\n\n218\n00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.890\nWell, it didn't have that by default but I\nwas able to change it because I've got all\n\n219\n00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.940\nthese menu options up here\nwhere I can tweak it.\n\n220\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.600\nI can change the font size.\n\n221\n00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.920\nI can change the colors.\n\n222\n00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.450\nI can change what's being rendered.\n\n223\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.875\nThere's a lot that you can do [CROSSTALK].\n\n224\n00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:30.652\n&gt;&gt; I love the fact that once\nyou make those changes,\n\n225\n00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:33.440\na lot of these will have\nprofiles you can create.\n\n226\n00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.830\nAnd say,\nI want this to be my default profile.\n\n227\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.140\nAnd that way if I want\nto do different things,\n\n228\n00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.540\nI can just load different profiles\nthat's already preset for me.\n\n229\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.540\nThat is a fantastic option on\nnewer style terminals like this.\n\n230\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some of the other features\nthey add really take advantage of the GUI.\n\n231\n00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.900\nIf I need more than one terminal open,\nI can open more than one window, right?\n\n232\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.860\nYou can go up here to file and\nopen terminal and\n\n233\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.170\nnow I've got two terminal windows open so\nI could run two different commands.\n\n234\n00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.030\nBut this one actually have\ntabbed terminals as well.\n\n235\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.590\nUnder that file option here,\nI had open tab.\n\n236\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.010\nAnd so now I could have two tabs,\nor three tabs, or four tabs.\n\n237\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.200\nYou just do Ctrl+Shift+T and\nI get more and more tabs.\n\n238\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.120\nSo I might run something like,\nmaybe I run Midnight Commander which\n\n239\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.800\nI don't have installed, so\nlet me install Midnight Commander.\n\n240\n00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.070\nSo I'm installing a program here and\n\n241\n00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.160\nwhile it's installing I could jump\nover to another tab and be doing work.\n\n242\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.200\nAnd then when I come back to the first\ntab, it finished installing.\n\n243\n00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.880\nI can run Midnight Commander so\nnow it's running.\n\n244\n00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.090\nAnd I can switch over to another tab and\nperform more work.\n\n245\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.690\nAnd so I can take advantage of those tabs\n\n246\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.857\nto do more than one thing all from\nright inside of the terminal.\n\n247\n00:11:40.857 --> 00:11:44.320\nSo that's kind of a nice feature to have\nthat we didn't have in the older xterm.\n\n248\n00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.083\nOr you definitely don't have in the\ntext-based console if I do Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n249\n00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:53.200\nAlthough I could Ctrl+Alt+F1,\nF2, F3 and move between them.\n\n250\n00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.990\nThat was the earliest\nform of multitasking.\n\n251\n00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.560\nThat you could run these full screen or\n\n252\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.880\nlocked applications that\nwould lock your session and\n\n253\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.410\njust switch over to another terminal and\nfire up more applications that way.\n\n254\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.230\nSo you had that functionality.\n\n255\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.910\nNow, GNOME Term is pretty powerful.\n\n256\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.960\nBut there're some things that it\ndoesn't do that other consoles or\n\n257\n00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.480\nother terminals might\ndo that you appreciate.\n\n258\n00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.690\nSo, for example,\nI use one called Guake, G-U-A-K-E.\n\n259\n00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.900\nGuake is nice because it is built off of,\n\n260\n00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.960\nit's actually modeled after\nthe old video game Quake.\n\n261\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.240\nIn the video game Quake,\n\n262\n00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.200\nit was one of the first video\ngames that had a dropdown console.\n\n263\n00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.440\nYou could hit,\nI think it was tilde on the keyboard.\n\n264\n00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.704\nAnd this little console would drop\ndown from the top of the screen, and\n\n265\n00:12:32.704 --> 00:12:34.300\nyou could type in cheat codes.\n\n266\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.780\nIt's really all you ever type.\n\n267\n00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.980\nFor people like me that\nuse a terminal a lot.\n\n268\n00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.460\nI'm constantly going to the terminal.\n\n269\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.110\nI don't necessarily want it to be\na window that pops up like this.\n\n270\n00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.550\nI would like it just to be something\nthat I can quickly access.\n\n271\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.890\nAnd if you install Guake,\nit's running in the background.\n\n272\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:57.561\nI've actually got a little tool item,\nwhoops, somewhere up here that shows it.\n\n273\n00:12:57.561 --> 00:12:59.841\nWell, anyhow, it's way up here.\n\n274\n00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:04.125\nThis little tool item and\nI can hit F12 on on my keyboard and\n\n275\n00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:08.105\nthere's a console that pops up and\nI have that access.\n\n276\n00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.561\nAnd so if I wanna jump in and\nrun something really quick I can.\n\n277\n00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:15.061\nAnd it's really handy if I'm, now,\nI'm browsing on the internet and\n\n278\n00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:17.470\nI come across some tutorial, right?\n\n279\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:23.370\nSo maybe I'm doing a Vim tutorial\nto learn some Vim commands.\n\n280\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.547\nAnd so I'm here and\n\n281\n00:13:24.547 --> 00:13:29.030\nI'm reading about how to do something and\nthen I pull up that terminal.\n\n282\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.120\nI run something real quick.\n\n283\n00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.130\nI get it out of the way.\n\n284\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.142\nAnd so just tied to my F12 key,\nI can make that pop up and come and go, so\n\n285\n00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:35.530\nthat's a neat feature.\n\n286\n00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.370\nIt's a different terminal but I like it\nbecause it gives me some functionality\n\n287\n00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.315\nthat I don't have in the normal terminal.\n\n288\n00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.180\nAnother one that I use from\ntime to time is Terminator.\n\n289\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.370\nTerminator is a third-party terminal.\n\n290\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.200\nIt's available in Ubuntu, and Debian,\nFedora, it's available in all of them.\n\n291\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.697\nAnd it has a neat function that\nlet's you split the screen, right?\n\n292\n00:13:57.697 --> 00:14:02.710\nIn GNOME Terminal, I could do tabs and\nif I had multiple tabs I could\n\n293\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.080\nhave multiple terminals but I couldn't\nsee them both at the same time, right?\n\n294\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.830\nIf I wanted to see more then one thing at\nthe same time, I could fire up Terminator.\n\n295\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.280\nAnd with a simple right-click\nI can split horizontally, or\n\n296\n00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.200\nsplit vertically, so\nI'll do a vertical split.\n\n297\n00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.115\nAnd now I've got two\nterminals side-by-side.\n\n298\n00:14:20.115 --> 00:14:24.560\nAnd I could even come in and take one and\nI could split it horizontally.\n\n299\n00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.920\nAnd now I'm starting to lay these out\nwhere I've got all these different\n\n300\n00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.820\nterminals.\n\n301\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.850\nAnd that's handy because I might be\nrunning something like htop here.\n\n302\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.740\nSo I'm monitoring\nperformance on my server.\n\n303\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.950\nAnd then down here,\nmaybe I'm doing a little journal CTL-F.\n\n304\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.740\nAnd so I'm following my system d-logs,\nright.\n\n305\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.261\nSo now in the top left,\nI'm seeing system performance.\n\n306\n00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.224\nIn the bottom left,\nI'm seeing what's going on.\n\n307\n00:14:48.224 --> 00:14:50.950\nAnd in the right,\nI could be doing my work.\n\n308\n00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.360\nI could come in and I could say,\nwell, I need to restart some service.\n\n309\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.410\nI'll restart I don't know,\nI'll restart my network stack, right.\n\n310\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.980\nWhy not?\n\n311\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.250\nSo I'll restart something and\n\n312\n00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.550\nI can see the log messages down here\nbeing generated as part of that restart.\n\n313\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.750\nAnd I can see any CPU or\nmemory activity that was modified by it.\n\n314\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.030\nAnd I could start to\ndo more than one task.\n\n315\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.140\nThat's a pretty neat function.\n\n316\n00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.729\nBy being able to slice\nyour screen up like this,\n\n317\n00:15:15.729 --> 00:15:18.250\nis not something I could do in GNOME.\n\n318\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.590\nBut I can easily do it\nright here in Terminator.\n\n319\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.400\nSo that's where I go back in saying when\nit comes to picking a terminal, there's\n\n320\n00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.040\na ton of them that are out there and you\nneed to find the one that you like best.\n\n321\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.580\nThese guys right here, they each have some\nkind of shining advantage to them, right?\n\n322\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.010\nTerminator can split the screen but\nit's not installed by default.\n\n323\n00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.740\nI would have to install it if\nI wanted to use it, right?\n\n324\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.260\nSo if I'm in a hurry on a system,\nI might not want to install it.\n\n325\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.439\nI might wanna use\nsomething that's built-in.\n\n326\n00:15:46.439 --> 00:15:50.029\nBut boy, slicing up the screen\nlike this is pretty handy, right?\n\n327\n00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:52.296\nSame thing goes for Guake.\n\n328\n00:15:52.296 --> 00:15:55.878\nIt's really nice to have that drop down\nfrom the top that I have to install it and\n\n329\n00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:56.543\nget it set up.\n\n330\n00:15:56.543 --> 00:15:57.781\nIt's not installed by default.\n\n331\n00:15:57.781 --> 00:16:00.020\nSo I might not wanna deal with that.\n\n332\n00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.350\nIt's kind of a pros and\ncons type approach.\n\n333\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.602\nYou need to find out which\none meets your needs.\n\n334\n00:16:03.602 --> 00:16:06.549\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Don, and I really like\nhow it splits the screen for you.\n\n335\n00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.570\nBecause if you've ever tried to, and even\nif you come from a Windows background.\n\n336\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.116\nAnd you're like,\nlet me check out this Linux thing.\n\n337\n00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:13.919\nYou have the black screens and\nyou're moving around.\n\n338\n00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:17.130\nYou're trying to, I'll snap to this side,\nsnap to that side.\n\n339\n00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.011\nAnd try to get everything\nto look just like you like.\n\n340\n00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:22.860\nWhere I'm just, okay, split this, split\nthat, and it's kind of doing that for me.\n\n341\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.740\nIt takes a lot of the hard work out of it,\nof getting everything lined up perfectly.\n\n342\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.209\nAnd that kind of takes us into something\nelse, Don, which we kind of alluded to,\n\n343\n00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:33.537\nwhich was customizing these terminals.\n\n344\n00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:36.090\nCan you walk us through\nsome of that customization?\n\n345\n00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.269\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let me fire up my\nregular Gnome terminal again.\n\n346\n00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:42.760\nAnd I want to show you guys profiles,\nright?\n\n347\n00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.412\nProfiles, Daniel mentioned them earlier,\n\n348\n00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:46.330\nare a way that we can kind\nof customize our terminal.\n\n349\n00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.260\nAnd change the way that it appears and\nget it to suit our needs.\n\n350\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.501\nThe default profile for\nmost systems is not something that I like.\n\n351\n00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:56.630\nIt's usually very small,\nit's maybe not a font that I like.\n\n352\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.963\nAnd so I usually do some customizations\nthere that are part of my user profile.\n\n353\n00:16:59.963 --> 00:17:03.434\nI bring it along with me when\nI sit down at a new system.\n\n354\n00:17:03.434 --> 00:17:06.486\nSo if I wanna go in and\ntake a look at that.\n\n355\n00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:11.343\nWhat we do is inside of Gnome,\nif you take a look at your menus up top,\n\n356\n00:17:11.343 --> 00:17:13.860\nor inside a Gnome terminal.\n\n357\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.060\nWe can go to Edit, and\nunder Edit you'll see two options,\n\n358\n00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.300\nthere's Preferences, and\nProfile Preferences.\n\n359\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.820\nAnd that is a little bit confusing,\n\n360\n00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.870\nwhy do I have these two\nthings that are very similar?\n\n361\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.610\nPreferences, those are settings that\naffect the entire terminal, right?\n\n362\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.960\nNot just my little session inside of it.\n\n363\n00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.600\nAnd the Profile Preferences,\nthat's what affects my session.\n\n364\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.260\nSo let's start with Preferences,\nand kind of see what's in there.\n\n365\n00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.672\nYou'll find that there's actually not\na whole lot of options tucked away inside\n\n366\n00:17:43.672 --> 00:17:44.330\nof this.\n\n367\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.390\nSo taking a quick glance at it,\nfirst I've got, Show menubar by default.\n\n368\n00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.500\nWell, I need my menubar,\nthat's why I'm in the options.\n\n369\n00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.340\nBut if you've memorized all\nthe keyboard shortcuts,\n\n370\n00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.460\nyou might not need that menubar.\n\n371\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.303\nYou can get a little\nmore screen real estate.\n\n372\n00:17:55.303 --> 00:17:59.700\nEnable mnemonics, such as Alt+F\nto open the File menu, right?\n\n373\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.570\nThose are turned off by default because we\nmight need to send Alt+F to the program\n\n374\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.520\nrunning inside of the terminal, right?\n\n375\n00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.980\nBut if you use those, you can turn it on.\n\n376\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.430\nThis is one that I usually turn off,\nthis is on by default.\n\n377\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.168\nEnable the menu accelerator key,\nF10 by default.\n\n378\n00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:15.711\nWhich means if you hit F10,\n\n379\n00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:19.920\nthe next series of keys you hit is being\nsent to the menu for the terminal.\n\n380\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.370\nWell, there's a lot of programs like\nMidnight Commander that I ran earlier.\n\n381\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.100\nF10 is the key to exit Midnight Commander.\n\n382\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.661\nIf it's mapped to the terminal,\n\n383\n00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:31.360\nthat's gonna make it where I can't exit\nMidnight Commander, it's a [LAUGH].\n\n384\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.250\n&gt;&gt; Open another terminal, and [LAUGH].\n\n385\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.326\n&gt;&gt; You could, you find a way around it.\n\n386\n00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:37.350\nBut it's neat that we can come in and\nwe can change that.\n\n387\n00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.010\nAnd then you've got themes.\n\n388\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.360\nSo we can do the Light theme or\nthe Dark theme.\n\n389\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.410\nYou got shortcuts that you can define.\n\n390\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.000\nYou can override keyboard shortcuts\nto set them with different themes.\n\n391\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.190\nMaybe you just don't find\nthe default ones very intuitive.\n\n392\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.870\nThe Profiles I'll talk about in a second.\n\n393\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.690\nAnd then the Encodings, right?\n\n394\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.941\nIf you're here in the US,\nit usually defaults to UTF-8,\n\n395\n00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:58.031\nwhich is probably what this one is at.\n\n396\n00:18:58.031 --> 00:19:00.710\nLet's find out, yeah, UTF-8.\n\n397\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.940\nBut if you are in another country,\nif you're typing in other languages.\n\n398\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.550\nWell, UTF-8 is designed to be universal,\nthat's what the whole U part is.\n\n399\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.530\nBut some languages still\naren't perfect with that.\n\n400\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.600\nSo you will see where there's other\ncharacter sets that you can use.\n\n401\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.770\nLike Greek or Cyrillic to be able\nto support your alphabet and\n\n402\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.950\nrender it better on screen.\n\n403\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.900\nSo those are things we can change.\n\n404\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.880\nNone of those settings that I just\nshowed you have to do with font size,\n\n405\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.500\nor color, or\nperformance of the console itself.\n\n406\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.460\nSo these are all just kinda general\nsettings that apply to the terminal.\n\n407\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.520\nUnder Profiles,\nthis is where we create Profiles.\n\n408\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.860\nAnd you'll have one profile by\ndefault it's usually called Default.\n\n409\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.360\nI've renamed mine Don's Custom, but\nyou can call it whatever you want.\n\n410\n00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.540\nYou can have one or more Profiles, and\n\n411\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.234\nthe Profiles are where all your\nspecial settings really end up.\n\n412\n00:19:49.234 --> 00:19:52.790\nThat's where the real work gets\ndone inside of these things.\n\n413\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.610\nSo if I have a shared computer\nthat I use alongside Daniel.\n\n414\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.370\nHe might have his profile and\nI have my own profile, and\n\n415\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.290\nwe can easily switch back and forth.\n\n416\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.970\nNow that doesn't normally happen.\n\n417\n00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.660\nBecause normally, Daniel has his own user\naccount, I have my own user account, so\n\n418\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.270\nwe don't bump heads.\n\n419\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.378\n&gt;&gt; Never the twain shall meet, right?\n\n420\n00:20:09.378 --> 00:20:12.140\n&gt;&gt; But I might need some\ndifferent profile based on\n\n421\n00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.950\napplications that I'm running, right?\n\n422\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.643\nI might have a certain color scheme that\nworks well with one application, and\n\n423\n00:20:16.643 --> 00:20:17.853\ndoesn't work well with another.\n\n424\n00:20:17.853 --> 00:20:19.995\nSo I can come in, and I can create those.\n\n425\n00:20:19.995 --> 00:20:22.940\nBut a lot of times, we'll just have one.\n\n426\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.870\nYou can use the Default one if you want,\nand\n\n427\n00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.810\nyou can edit it to\ncustomize it how you want.\n\n428\n00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:28.469\nNow I went into the Preferences screen.\n\n429\n00:20:28.469 --> 00:20:33.510\nAnd if I choose Edit, it's going to\ntake me to the Profile Preferences.\n\n430\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.740\nThat's the same as if I've gone\nback out here and gone to Edit and\n\n431\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.580\nProfile Preferences.\n\n432\n00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.790\nThe difference is this immediately\ntakes me to the Don's Custom profile.\n\n433\n00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.101\nVersus going to the regular\nPreferences screen,\n\n434\n00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:49.300\nI can pick which profile I want to\nedit if I have more than one profile.\n\n435\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.590\nSo that's the only difference.\n\n436\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.060\nIf I just wanna modify the profile I'm\ncurrently in, I can go to Edit, and\n\n437\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.670\nProfile Preferences and\njump right in there.\n\n438\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.812\nAnd now we can jump in and\nstart to customize things.\n\n439\n00:20:58.812 --> 00:21:02.430\nNow I wanna show you some of the standard\nthings that I customize, right?\n\n440\n00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:07.250\nThe first thing, just the very first thing\nthat I do is go to a custom font, right?\n\n441\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.837\nA lot of times the default\nfont is set to Monospace 10.\n\n442\n00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:15.940\nAnd a 10 pitch font on a high resolution\nmonitor is very, very difficult to read.\n\n443\n00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.795\nNow, I'm getting older.\n\n444\n00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:19.912\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Getting a little older each day, and\n\n445\n00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:21.775\nit gets harder and harder for me to see.\n\n446\n00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:24.188\nSo I need a slightly bigger font.\n\n447\n00:21:24.188 --> 00:21:27.463\nYou might be young, you're 18,\nyou're in high school, and\n\n448\n00:21:27.463 --> 00:21:29.170\nyou can read a microscopic font.\n\n449\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.540\nAnd so you set the highest\nresolution font, good for you.\n\n450\n00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.159\n&gt;&gt; Or you're Mike Rodrick.\n&gt;&gt; One of our other hosts,\n\n451\n00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:36.360\nhe always has tiny fonts,\nI don't understand it.\n\n452\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.940\nBut you can pick whatever font you want,\nand you can make that larger or smaller.\n\n453\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.190\nYou can actually choose from\na number of different fonts.\n\n454\n00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.268\nMaybe, I have seen people that like the\nones that look like cursive or whatever.\n\n455\n00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:48.813\nYou can get all kinds of fancy-pants\nwith this stuff, if you want.\n\n456\n00:21:48.813 --> 00:21:51.902\nAnd you can load custom fonts too,\nif you really wanna go crazy.\n\n457\n00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:53.860\n&gt;&gt; Those look good, I like that.\n\n458\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.542\n&gt;&gt; Some don't work as well as others.\n\n459\n00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:58.140\n[LAUGH] So you might not want those.\n\n460\n00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.488\nWe're not going to pick the Wingdings\nfont or whatever, or Webdings.\n\n461\n00:22:01.488 --> 00:22:05.390\nBut you can customize this\nto be pleasing to you.\n\n462\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.570\nIf you are going to be working\nin this terminal a lot,\n\n463\n00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.980\nyou want it to be\nsomething that makes sense.\n\n464\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.770\nBut for me it's normally the font\nsize that impacts me the most, and\n\n465\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.340\nI can see that right down here.\n\n466\n00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.390\nI've got mine at a 16 pitch,\nyou might need to go even larger.\n\n467\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.150\nIf you're on a super\nhigh resolution monitor,\n\n468\n00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.280\nyou may want it at a 24 or\nsomething higher like that.\n\n469\n00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.120\nBut usually, 10 or 11 is the default and\nfor me that's just too small.\n\n470\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.630\nSo we can customize that.\n\n471\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:29.240\nAfter that,\n\n472\n00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.230\nthere's other things we can customize\nlike the Initial terminal size, okay.\n\n473\n00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.884\nNow, the default here, let's do this.\n\n474\n00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:36.580\nLet me get out of this one.\n\n475\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.630\nAnd I'm gonna go and I'm gonna switch, let\nme go into my Preferences and Profiles,\n\n476\n00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.237\nall right?\n\n477\n00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:46.430\nAnd I'm gonna create a new Profile here,\nright?\n\n478\n00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.470\nAnd this is just at the default,\nso see how it's Monospace 12,\n\n479\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.240\nslightly off on that.\n\n480\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.389\nBut the initial terminal size is 80 and\n24, right?\n\n481\n00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:56.829\nSo that's kind of the default\nsettings here for\n\n482\n00:22:56.829 --> 00:22:59.540\nthis Unnamed profile that I've created.\n\n483\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.341\nSo I'm going to take that profile, and so\n\n484\n00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:05.472\nwe've got this Unnamed\nprofile right there.\n\n485\n00:23:05.472 --> 00:23:08.220\nAnd I'm going to switch\nmy terminal to use that.\n\n486\n00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.362\nNow, you probably noticed the option\nwhere I can pick the default\n\n487\n00:23:11.362 --> 00:23:13.030\nprofile that's going to be used.\n\n488\n00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.365\nAnd right now it's going\nto default to Don's Custom.\n\n489\n00:23:15.365 --> 00:23:17.083\nSo I'm gonna choose Unnamed,\n\n490\n00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:21.560\nand the reason I'm doing that is I want\nit to just launch when I first launch.\n\n491\n00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.360\nWe can always switch when\nwe launch a new terminal,\n\n492\n00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.320\nwhen we open one from\nan existing terminal.\n\n493\n00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.895\nBut when you open a new one\nit takes that default value.\n\n494\n00:23:27.895 --> 00:23:30.567\nAnd so here's the default terminal.\n\n495\n00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:34.550\nAnd you'll see kind of my point,\nit's really small, it's hard to read.\n\n496\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.060\nIt's not necessarily the ideal situation.\n\n497\n00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.830\nIt's also not very wide, okay?\n\n498\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:46.360\nNow, I can come in and hit\nCtrl+Shift+Plus and make it bigger, okay?\n\n499\n00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.581\nBut that's a one time thing.\n\n500\n00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:50.641\nIf I come up here and\nsay File &gt; Open Terminal,\n\n501\n00:23:50.641 --> 00:23:55.122\nuntil I actually get choices now\nbetween which Profile I wanna use.\n\n502\n00:23:55.122 --> 00:23:59.884\nI can open another one unnamed and\nsee how the new one comes back small.\n\n503\n00:23:59.884 --> 00:24:02.176\nIt even does that with tabs,\nwhich is super annoying.\n\n504\n00:24:02.176 --> 00:24:04.632\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If I go to open a tab and\n\n505\n00:24:04.632 --> 00:24:08.840\nI do it unnamed, see how this tab\nis small, and then this tab is big?\n\n506\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.940\nAs I switch tabs, it's changing.\n\n507\n00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.082\nThat's pretty annoying, too.\n\n508\n00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:13.762\n&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm on\npsychedelics watching that.\n\n509\n00:24:13.762 --> 00:24:14.463\nWhat's going on here?\n\n510\n00:24:14.463 --> 00:24:16.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's usability, right?\n\n511\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:21.220\nWe have to get in here and kind of\ncustomize this to meet our needs, right?\n\n512\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.150\nThat's just really the whole\npoint of having these profiles\n\n513\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.240\nis being able to set them to whatever\nit is that our system needs.\n\n514\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.329\nSo if I go back into my preferences, I can\nchange that default profile back to mine.\n\n515\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.400\nAnd I can edit it.\n\n516\n00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.750\nBut I like to modify the font size,\nand then the width of the terminal.\n\n517\n00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.728\nThe terminal itself will\ndefault to 80 by 24,\n\n518\n00:24:41.728 --> 00:24:44.260\ncuz that's what the old\ndummy terminals used.\n\n519\n00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.704\nThe mainframe terminals I mentioned,\nthey were 80 characters wide and\n\n520\n00:24:48.704 --> 00:24:50.646\n24 characters or lines tall.\n\n521\n00:24:50.646 --> 00:24:54.130\nThat can be kind of small on\nour new widescreen monitors.\n\n522\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.510\nMost people buy 16 by\n9 monitors these days.\n\n523\n00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.670\nSo it makes sense to make\nthe terminal a little wider.\n\n524\n00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.133\ni usually go 100 by 24,\nlike that, is kinda my default.\n\n525\n00:25:03.133 --> 00:25:04.786\nA few other things you can tweak,\nthe terminal bell.\n\n526\n00:25:04.786 --> 00:25:05.798\nThe terminal bell is super annoying.\n\n527\n00:25:05.798 --> 00:25:07.093\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Any time,\n\n528\n00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:10.985\nmaybe you backspace to delete characters\nand there's no more characters,\n\n529\n00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:14.170\nevery time you hit backspace it goes ding,\nding, ding.\n\n530\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.110\nIt gets annoying.\n\n531\n00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.380\nSome people really like that, right?\n\n532\n00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.320\nSo we can leave that bell on or off.\n\n533\n00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.700\nMine's on, but I keep my laptop muted so\nit doesn't matter.\n\n534\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.570\nBut you might wanna disable that.\n\n535\n00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.240\nYou can specify a command.\n\n536\n00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.520\nWhen you first launch the terminal,\nwhat does it do?\n\n537\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.824\nWell, the default is it drops you to\ncommand prompt, and it sits there and\n\n538\n00:25:31.824 --> 00:25:33.333\nit waits for you to do something.\n\n539\n00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:37.081\nBut if there's a command that you run\nevery time you launch the terminal,\n\n540\n00:25:37.081 --> 00:25:40.420\nyou can come in here and tell it,\nhey, I want you to run a command.\n\n541\n00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.253\nMaybe I don't want it to\ngo to a regular terminal.\n\n542\n00:25:42.253 --> 00:25:44.802\nMaybe I want it to go to\nsomething special, like tmux.\n\n543\n00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:49.150\nTmux is a special kind of terminal\nthat's very much like Terminator.\n\n544\n00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.424\nThey'll let you slice up the screen, but\nit does it all with keyboard shortcuts,\n\n545\n00:25:52.424 --> 00:25:53.762\nand it does it all in one session.\n\n546\n00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:55.257\nIt's kind of,\nit's almost borderline magic.\n\n547\n00:25:55.257 --> 00:25:57.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can say, hey,\n\n548\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:01.520\nwhen I launch a shell, I want you to just\ngo straight into tmux, don't go into Bash,\n\n549\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.440\nor whatever my default\nshell happens to be.\n\n550\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.370\nSo you can override those values here.\n\n551\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.060\nNormally, we don't do that,\nbut you could do it.\n\n552\n00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.810\nThe colors?\n\n553\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:09.990\nThe colors are kinda fun.\n\n554\n00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.750\nIn the olden days, right, we just had\nwhite text on a black background.\n\n555\n00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.140\nOr maybe the other way around.\n\n556\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.930\nBlack text on a white background.\n\n557\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.535\n&gt;&gt; Or your favorite,\nblack text on black background.\n\n558\n00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:20.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n559\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.845\n&gt;&gt; It's always great.\n\n560\n00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.891\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The stealth shell, right?\n\n561\n00:26:22.891 --> 00:26:25.002\n[LAUGH] But you can change it.\n\n562\n00:26:25.002 --> 00:26:27.870\nYou'll see like green on black,\nto get that true retro feel.\n\n563\n00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.110\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] that,\nyou'll really feel like a dummy terminal.\n\n564\n00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.190\nYou can do that.\n\n565\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.030\nBut all of these color settings\ncan be overridden from within\n\n566\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.550\nthe terminal itself.\n\n567\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.641\nAnd you'll see that pretty frequently\nwhen you're working with these terminals\n\n568\n00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:42.248\nbecause things get colorized.\n\n569\n00:26:42.248 --> 00:26:45.730\nWhen I pulled up my directory listing,\ndifferent files had different colors.\n\n570\n00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:48.210\nThat's being determined by\nthe shell that I'm using.\n\n571\n00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:50.717\nSo the terminal has a default color set,\n\n572\n00:26:50.717 --> 00:26:53.677\nand that's really what\nyou're picking here.\n\n573\n00:26:53.677 --> 00:26:55.999\nAnd then the shell can override\nthat at different places.\n\n574\n00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:59.190\nAnd there's some default schemes\nthat you can choose from.\n\n575\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.730\nYou'll see down here,\nmine's set to custom for some reason.\n\n576\n00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:02.990\nI don't remember customizing it.\n\n577\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:07.520\nBut you can choose from some of these\nother default color schemes to pick\n\n578\n00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.860\nwhatever it is that you want and\nget things kind of set to your liking.\n\n579\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.120\nThe scrolling tab is kind\nof an important one for me.\n\n580\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.070\nAs you run commands, there's often\ntimes when commands will exceed\n\n581\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.650\nthe top row of your screen,\nit'll scroll off the screen.\n\n582\n00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.660\nYou need to be able to scroll back and\nsee it.\n\n583\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.700\nSome operating systems have that\nscroll back buffer set really small.\n\n584\n00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.260\nIf it's only set to 100 lines, and\n\n585\n00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.210\nI do a yum update and\nthere's more than 50 updates,\n\n586\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.140\nit's gonna be more than 100 lines, I'm\ngonna lose messages that were at the top.\n\n587\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.810\nOkay, that's how it works.\n\n588\n00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.270\nSo I need to have scrollback buffer\n\n589\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.310\nthat's big enough to let me\nscroll back to see messages.\n\n590\n00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.778\nNow you don't want to go too big,\n\n591\n00:27:44.778 --> 00:27:47.253\nbecause where does that\nscrollback buffer get stored?\n\n592\n00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:48.420\nIt's stored in RAM.\n\n593\n00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.180\nSo the bigger your scrollback buffer,\nthe more RAM you're eating up.\n\n594\n00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.540\nNow this day and age, we usually have tons\nof RAM, so it's not that big of a deal.\n\n595\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.078\nBut you don't wanna set this to be\nmillions of lines stored in RAM.\n\n596\n00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:04.210\nSo 10,000 here is actually a really good\nnumber, that's a huge number of lines to\n\n597\n00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.540\nscroll back and see, but\nwithout consuming too much memory.\n\n598\n00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.950\nBut you might wanna tweak that and change\nit, make it smaller, make it bigger.\n\n599\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.600\nYou certainly have that option.\n\n600\n00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, Don, I know a lot of people\nlike to, and with these newer terminals,\n\n601\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.210\nthey have the ability to increase\nthe transparency of the terminal.\n\n602\n00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.739\nVery cool stuff, kind of an effect thing.\n\n603\n00:28:20.739 --> 00:28:22.990\nBut that's kind of a personal thing,\nright?\n\n604\n00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.657\n&gt;&gt; It is, I hate it.\n\n605\n00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:25.357\nWhere is that, is that under colors?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n606\n00:28:25.357 --> 00:28:26.588\nI've noticed you're not a huge fan.\n\n607\n00:28:26.588 --> 00:28:27.900\n&gt;&gt; No, I absolutely hate it.\n\n608\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.160\nHere it is, transparent background.\n\n609\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.230\nIf you watch a hacker movie-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n610\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.589\n&gt;&gt; Any hacker movie.\n\n611\n00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Any hacker movie,\nthey love the transparent terminals.\n\n612\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.080\nI don't know why.\n\n613\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.370\nIt's like, I've got this readable\nterminal, let's make it less readable.\n\n614\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.294\nThe transparency, right, so if I turn\nthat on, this transparent background,\n\n615\n00:28:45.294 --> 00:28:47.401\nwhat it does is it takes\nthe background of your terminal and\n\n616\n00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:49.280\nit makes it read kind of see through it.\n\n617\n00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.290\nAnd the idea behind that is if I\nhave multiple terminals, right?\n\n618\n00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:55.710\nSo let me close out of this.\n\n619\n00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.920\nI'm gonna open up a new terminal, right?\n\n620\n00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.220\nAnd I'm in here and I'm doing work, well,\n\n621\n00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.279\nsee how you can see my wallpaper\nthrough the terminal now?\n\n622\n00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:04.494\nYou can see the big 7.\n\n623\n00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:05.420\n&gt;&gt; I see the Linux.\n\n624\n00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.210\n&gt;&gt; The word Linux up there, yeah.\n\n625\n00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.500\nI'm seeing through my terminal.\n\n626\n00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.870\nAnd if I open up another terminal window,\n\n627\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.840\nsee how I can see the old\nterminal through my new terminal?\n\n628\n00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.962\nIt gets super confusing, doesn't it?\n\n629\n00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:20.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think the idea was if I needed\n\n630\n00:29:20.755 --> 00:29:25.440\nsome information from the other terminal\nI could see it while I'm in here.\n\n631\n00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.930\nBut in practice what happens is you\nend up with just overlapping stuff.\n\n632\n00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.687\nAnd it becomes really confusing and\ndifficult to read.\n\n633\n00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.326\nAnd this is just terminal windows, right?\n\n634\n00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:39.771\nMaybe I've got a webpage open,\nand so I'm browsing to ITProTV,\n\n635\n00:29:39.771 --> 00:29:43.835\nand so I'm browsing the Internet,\nthere we go.\n\n636\n00:29:43.835 --> 00:29:47.432\nAnd so I fire open my terminals,\nand I can kind of see through them.\n\n637\n00:29:47.432 --> 00:29:49.165\nAnd I've got the transparency set at 50%.\n\n638\n00:29:49.165 --> 00:29:51.150\nThat's probably a little\ntoo aggressive here.\n\n639\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.980\nIf we were to tweak that down a bit,\n\n640\n00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.410\nit creates a kind of artistic\neffect that some people like.\n\n641\n00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.284\nI absolutely hate it.\n\n642\n00:29:57.284 --> 00:30:00.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But some people, boy,\n\n643\n00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.360\nthey just love that stuff.\n\n644\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.540\nSo if I take that transparent background,\nand\n\n645\n00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.770\nlet me ratchet it down to\na more reasonable level, right?\n\n646\n00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.920\nNow you can still sort of\nsee the web page behind it,\n\n647\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.740\nbut it's not totally in the way.\n\n648\n00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.360\nYou can get that and\nincrease a nice little artistic effect.\n\n649\n00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.158\nThere are some distros that\nhave this set by default.\n\n650\n00:30:16.158 --> 00:30:19.660\nAgain, I usually just come in and\ndisable that transparent background.\n\n651\n00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.340\nNow I can read everything nice and neat.\n\n652\n00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.670\nThat's the way that I like it.\n\n653\n00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.410\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, I know we're running\nsuper short on time, but\n\n654\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.500\nI was wondering if you could just touch on\nsome of the, or one of the major things\n\n655\n00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:33.380\nthat we do inside of our computing\nexperience, which is copy, cut, or paste.\n\n656\n00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Can we do this in the terminal and\n\n657\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.150\ncan we go from like your web\nbrowser to the terminal?\n\n658\n00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can, but\nit does get a little bit tricky, right?\n\n659\n00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.030\nSo normally,\n\n660\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.950\nwhen you're in an application,\nlike if I'm in a web browser back here.\n\n661\n00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.410\nAnd I wanna copy\nEnjoy IT Training Courses, so\n\n662\n00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.630\nI wanna copy this little marketing slogan.\n\n663\n00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.450\nI can take that and I can hit Ctrl+C\non my keyboard and that copies.\n\n664\n00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.530\nAnd then when I go up here,\nI can hit Ctrl+V and it pastes, right?\n\n665\n00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.092\nWell, that works.\n\n666\n00:30:59.092 --> 00:31:02.370\nIt even works in a lot of terminals,\nbut it doesn't work in every terminal.\n\n667\n00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:07.490\nAnd, the main reason is that Ctrl+C\nis usually a breaking command.\n\n668\n00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.120\nIt's how you abort a command.\n\n669\n00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.093\nSo for example, if I start pinging\nsome server, It's gonna ping, and\n\n670\n00:31:13.093 --> 00:31:16.010\nit's gonna ping forever,\nuntil I hit Ctrl+C.\n\n671\n00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.730\nCtrl+C tells it to stop, right?\n\n672\n00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.960\nCtrl+C doesn't tell it to copy,\nit tells it to stop.\n\n673\n00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.800\nAnd so if I highlight some text, like with\nmy mouse here, I'll highlight some text,\n\n674\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.829\nand hit Ctrl+C, it didn't copy.\n\n675\n00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:33.670\nAnd if I do Ctrl+V,\nit doesn't do much of anything, right?\n\n676\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.720\nSo those traditional copy and\n\n677\n00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.430\npaste don't quite work the way\nthat you might expect them to.\n\n678\n00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.390\nNow you can always use your mouse,\nright, which is a little bit anti-Unix.\n\n679\n00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.031\nBut we're not in Unix,\nright, we're in Linux.\n\n680\n00:31:44.031 --> 00:31:47.705\nI can highlight with the mouse and\nI can right-click and I can choose copy,\n\n681\n00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.225\nand then I can right-click and\nI can choose paste.\n\n682\n00:31:50.225 --> 00:31:52.484\nAnd there we go, it worked, right?\n\n683\n00:31:52.484 --> 00:31:57.411\nBut a lot of terminals will rematch\nshortcuts to something that actually does\n\n684\n00:31:57.411 --> 00:31:59.165\nwork inside of a terminal.\n\n685\n00:31:59.165 --> 00:32:02.678\nWhichever terminal you pick, you'll need\nto look at what its defaults are, right?\n\n686\n00:32:02.678 --> 00:32:06.870\nBack up here and edit and preferences.\n\n687\n00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:11.698\nWe had the shortcuts and right here is\nwhere I could define a number of shortcuts\n\n688\n00:32:11.698 --> 00:32:13.391\nincluding copy and paste.\n\n689\n00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:16.639\nAnd if you take a look at\nthe ones that are in here,\n\n690\n00:32:16.639 --> 00:32:19.824\nit's got Shift+Ctrl+C, Shift+Ctrl+V.\n\n691\n00:32:19.824 --> 00:32:22.973\nSo instead of just hitting\nCtrl+C I hit shift as well and\n\n692\n00:32:22.973 --> 00:32:26.464\nthat's how it avoids sending\nthe breaking command, right?\n\n693\n00:32:26.464 --> 00:32:30.456\nSo that'll make sure that it does that and\nensures that I can copy it.\n\n694\n00:32:30.456 --> 00:32:33.812\nSo now, I could come in and\nI could highlight something.\n\n695\n00:32:33.812 --> 00:32:37.556\nAnd I could hit, I don't usually do\nShift+Ctrl, I usually do Ctrl+Shift.\n\n696\n00:32:37.556 --> 00:32:41.320\nBut Ctrl+Shift+C to copy and\nthen Ctrl+Shift+V and\n\n697\n00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.851\nthere I'm pasting what I highlighted,\nall right?\n\n698\n00:32:44.851 --> 00:32:47.047\nNow in the GNOME Terminal,\nthat's the way you do it.\n\n699\n00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:48.869\nThat's the shortcut that you remember.\n\n700\n00:32:48.869 --> 00:32:52.361\nIn some terminals though they do\nwhat's called copy on highlight,\n\n701\n00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:55.059\nwhere if you just highlight\nsomething the moment you\n\n702\n00:32:55.059 --> 00:32:57.835\nlet go off your mouse it\ncopies it into the clipboard.\n\n703\n00:32:57.835 --> 00:33:02.456\nAnd the moment you right click it\nimmediately paste that data, right?\n\n704\n00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:05.298\nThe GNOME Terminal doesn't do that but\nthere are terminals that do.\n\n705\n00:33:05.298 --> 00:33:08.558\nAnd they usually just call that\ncopy on click or copy on highlight.\n\n706\n00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:10.676\nSo as you dig through\nthe options on your terminal,\n\n707\n00:33:10.676 --> 00:33:12.560\nyou may find something\nthat indicates that.\n\n708\n00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.817\nAnd I don't think I have\nthat option here at all.\n\n709\n00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:18.788\nIf we take a look at even Shortcuts,\n\n710\n00:33:18.788 --> 00:33:21.959\nO'm pretty sure GNOME Terminal\ndoesn't support that.\n\n711\n00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:25.599\nBut like I said, yours might and if you\ndig through your options you may find it\n\n712\n00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:28.406\nand see where you can turn that on or\ncustomize that option.\n\n713\n00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:30.323\nSo that's another way we might do that.\n\n714\n00:33:30.323 --> 00:33:32.963\nBut again, it does vary a bit\nfrom terminal to terminal.\n\n715\n00:33:32.963 --> 00:33:33.468\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n716\n00:33:33.468 --> 00:33:35.133\nWell Don,\nwe've run out of time with this episode.\n\n717\n00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:39.960\nI know you have more to go,\njumping into the shells area or the arena,\n\n718\n00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.967\nshould I say.\n\n719\n00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:43.257\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But looks like we'll have to wait for\n\n720\n00:33:43.257 --> 00:33:44.135\npart two on that.\n\n721\n00:33:44.135 --> 00:33:45.302\nWe do thank you for joining today.\n\n722\n00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:48.717\nIs there anything you'd like to\npart our guests with before we go?\n\n723\n00:33:48.717 --> 00:33:50.768\n&gt;&gt; I certainly didn't get to\nevery terminal in the world,\n\n724\n00:33:50.768 --> 00:33:53.136\nthere's hundreds of them, and\nyou might have a favourite one.\n\n725\n00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:56.218\nI know I left out Konsole,\nthe one from KDE.\n\n726\n00:33:56.218 --> 00:34:00.595\nKDE's console has a neat little bookmark\nfeature, where you can bookmark folders as\n\n727\n00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:03.714\nyou navigate your file system,\nyou can bookmark location.\n\n728\n00:34:03.714 --> 00:34:05.864\nAnd so when you launch that console,\nyou can say go to this bookmark and\n\n729\n00:34:05.864 --> 00:34:07.437\nit jumps right to that\nlocation on the file system.\n\n730\n00:34:07.437 --> 00:34:09.265\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; It's a neat feature.\n\n731\n00:34:09.265 --> 00:34:14.125\nAll of those terminals, they have bright\nshiny spots that make them great to use.\n\n732\n00:34:14.125 --> 00:34:16.349\nThey usually have a couple of\ncons that make them not so great.\n\n733\n00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:19.574\nYou just gotta find the one that's\nperfect for you and it's trial and error.\n\n734\n00:34:19.574 --> 00:34:21.970\nUsually they're very small so\nit's easy to install a bunch of them.\n\n735\n00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.989\nI probably have five different\nterminals installed here.\n\n736\n00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.070\nJust take a look at what you've got and\nfind out what one you like and\n\n737\n00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.333\njust know that it's pretty easy to\nmove to another one if you chose to.\n\n738\n00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:31.946\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n739\n00:34:31.946 --> 00:34:33.054\nIt never hurts to test drive something,\nright?\n\n740\n00:34:33.054 --> 00:34:35.076\nYou're not locked into it.\n\n741\n00:34:35.076 --> 00:34:37.752\nYou don't like it, you delete it,\nand you move on to the next thing.\n\n742\n00:34:37.752 --> 00:34:38.972\nDon, thanks for joining us today.\n\n743\n00:34:38.972 --> 00:34:42.865\nWe appreciate your expertise on this and\nimparting that into us.\n\n744\n00:34:42.865 --> 00:34:45.048\nBut as I've said,\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n745\n00:34:45.048 --> 00:34:47.877\nDefinitely come back for\npart two as we look into shells.\n\n746\n00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:51.363\nBut as for this episode and we are gonna\ngo ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n747\n00:34:51.363 --> 00:34:52.928\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n748\n00:34:52.928 --> 00:34:53.865\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n749\n00:34:53.865 --> 00:34:56.548\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n750\n00:34:56.548 --> 00:35:02.089\n[MUSIC]\n\n751\n00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:05.459\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
