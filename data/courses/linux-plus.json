The certification covers the basic knowledge required of a junior level Linux administrator. Candidates are expected to be able to work competently across a wide array of environments and skill sets. Unlike many certifications, candidates who complete the Linux+ exams (LX0-101 and LX0-102) are awarded with not one, but two certifications: the CompTIA Linux+ certification and the LPI LPIC-1 certification. That makes this an excellent starting point for people interested in working with Linux as you gain essential base knowledge as well as fill out your resume.",

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:08.950\nAll right.\n\n3\n00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.340\nToday we're gonna take a look at\nthe Linux+ certification from CompTIA.\n\n4\n00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.110\nThis is kind of an interesting\ncertification compared to\n\n5\n00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.940\na lot of the ones that CompTIA does,\n\n6\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.160\nbecause it's the first one that\nthey didn't actually develop.\n\n7\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.820\nAnd so that makes it interesting,\nso we do wanna talk about it.\n\n8\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.570\nKinda what it is, what it covers, and\nwhy CompTIA didn't develop this exam.\n\n9\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.270\nIt's all important stuff to know,\n\n10\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.170\nso let's just start with\nthe basics with what is Linux+?\n\n11\n00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.780\nIt's a certification from CompTIA,\n\n12\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.590\nthe same people that bring you A+,\nNet+, Security+, they bring you Linux+.\n\n13\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.770\nAnd it's designed to show that\na network or systems administrator\n\n14\n00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.760\nhas a basic level of knowledge in\noperating Linux servers and workstations.\n\n15\n00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.760\nIt's designed to be vendor neutral so\nit's not Red Hat only or\n\n16\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.670\nUbuntu canonical, whatever.\n\n17\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.690\nIt is design to be vendor neutral but\n\n18\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.660\nit does actually focus a little bit on\nthe Red Hat-based Linux products and\n\n19\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.080\nthe Debian-based Linux products,\nwhich almost everything is these days.\n\n20\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.635\nSo it does a great job of straddling\nthe fence between those and\n\n21\n00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:16.025\nshowing concepts, commands,\nadministration tools and\n\n22\n00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:20.980\ntechniques that apply to both sets of the\nLinux distributions that are out there.\n\n23\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.210\nSo it is a great certification in that it\ndoes show you have that general knowledge.\n\n24\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.180\nNow, in the beginning,\n\n25\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.250\nCompTIA actually had their own in-house\ndeveloped Linux+ certification.\n\n26\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000\nBut over time,\nthey wanted to make it better and\n\n27\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.270\nmore generally accepted\namongst the community.\n\n28\n00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.150\nSo instead of continuing to\nwrite the exam themselves,\n\n29\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.810\nthey partnered with the LPI,\nthe Linux Professional Institute.\n\n30\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.850\nLPI actually had, or has, four levels\nof Linux certification available,\n\n31\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.780\nfrom basic all the way up to\nsuper mega expert, right?\n\n32\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.511\nYou have to wear suspenders and\nhave a beard for that one.\n\n33\n00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.265\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Even if you're a woman.\n\n34\n00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:02.260\n[LAUGH] And so you know they've\ngot some really advanced stuff and\n\n35\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.640\nCompTIA said well you know,\nwe really just want the lower end, right?\n\n36\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.025\nThe introductories,\npeople have the base knowledge,\n\n37\n00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.330\nit's the equivalent of one year of\nfield experience working with Linux.\n\n38\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.320\nThat's what they're shooting for\nand the LPI said well great.\n\n39\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.910\nWhat you can do is you can use our first\ntwo exams for our certification track and\n\n40\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.460\nuse that to gauge your Linux+ testers,\nright?\n\n41\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.910\nAnd so that's what they did,\nthey partnered up,\n\n42\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.880\nit's been a great partnership\nbetween the two organizations.\n\n43\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.850\nAnd so when you look at the CompTIA\nwebpages, it'll always say,\n\n44\n00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.859\nwell look I've got it\npulled up right here.\n\n45\n00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.612\nCompTIA Linux+ Powered by LPI, and\nthat lets you know that while it is\n\n46\n00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:43.580\na CompTIA certification,\nit's actually developed by the LPI.\n\n47\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.700\nOn a neat side,\n\n48\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.730\nit means when you pass the exams,\nyou actually get two certifications.\n\n49\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.360\nYou get the CompTIA Linux+ which\nis what most of us are after.\n\n50\n00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.120\nAnd then on the LPI,\nLinux Professional Institute, side,\n\n51\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.850\nyou'll see that you actually end up with\nwhat's called their LPIC-1 certification,\n\n52\n00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.160\nJunior Level Linux certification.\n\n53\n00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.640\nAnd to get that you have to\npass their first two exams\n\n54\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.330\nwhich are the same exams you\nhave to take for Linux+.\n\n55\n00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.200\nSo you actually end up double\ncertified which is just kind of neat.\n\n56\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.910\nNow, CompTIA does stop there at Linux+,\nthey don't go beyond that.\n\n57\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.670\nAnd so if you want to get\nmore advanced Linux skills,\n\n58\n00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.290\nwell that's where you come over to LPI and\nyou do LPIC-2, LPIC-3, right?\n\n59\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.150\nThat's how that partnership works, and how\nboth companies benefit from it and how you\n\n60\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.250\nbenefit from it too, because I'll tell\nyou a lot of people have heard of Linux+.\n\n61\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.339\nIt's a very popular certification, not\nas many people have heard of LPIC-2 and\n\n62\n00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.088\nLPIC-3.\n\n63\n00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:45.590\nThey're great certifications, believe me,\nbut not as many people have heard of them.\n\n64\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.430\nIf you want advanced certifications,\nthey're the way to go, right?\n\n65\n00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.080\nBut if you're just trying to do that\nentry-level thing, something that's higher\n\n66\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.000\nvisibility is great,\nlooks great on the resume, so here you go.\n\n67\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.140\nAll right, now the Linux+ certification\nis actually broken up into two exams.\n\n68\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.058\nSo, we have.\n\n69\n00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:01.797\nActually do they show it on this page?\n\n70\n00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:06.525\nThere it is, the LX0-101 and the LX0-102,\n\n71\n00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:10.030\ntwo different certification exams.\n\n72\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.195\nThey are a little bit on the pricey side,\nas most CompTIA exams have been lately,\n\n73\n00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:18.140\nthey've kind of raised\na bunch of their prices.\n\n74\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.140\nBut it's right around\n180 dollars per exam.\n\n75\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.095\nObviously, it varies based on your country\nbut it's right around in that area.\n\n76\n00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:29.248\nSo to take both of them you\nare looking at almost 400 dollars,\n\n77\n00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:34.180\nUS dollars, so it can be a little\nbit pricey, but it is two exams.\n\n78\n00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.370\n90 minutes each, so they're not incredibly\nlong, but you'll have 60 questions so\n\n79\n00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.190\nthat means you get about a minute and\na half per question and\n\n80\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.120\nyou don't wanna dabble too much.\n\n81\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.780\nThey are mostly multiple choice,\n\n82\n00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.750\nthere have been rumors of simulation\nquestions making it on the exams.\n\n83\n00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.550\nI haven't seen that yet but the rumor's\nout there, so it's mostly multiple choice,\n\n84\n00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.560\nand you can take it in\nseveral different languages.\n\n85\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.220\nLike all CompTIA exams,\nthey're administered through Pearson VUE.\n\n86\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.260\nSo you just find the local VUE\ntesting center that is near you.\n\n87\n00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.102\nIf you're not familiar with VUE,\ntheir website is pearsonvue, it's V-U-E,\n\n88\n00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:15.170\n.com and they have testing\nlocations all over the world.\n\n89\n00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.010\nSo you just come in here and you say,\ntest taker services, you're trying to take\n\n90\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.365\na test and you'll come in and pick what\nyou're trying to get certified in.\n\n91\n00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:29.485\nSo we can go to IT and\nfind old CompTIA in here, there we go.\n\n92\n00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.005\nAnd once we're in here.\n\n93\n00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:33.432\nNice, thank you for\ntelling me about your cookies.\n\n94\n00:05:33.432 --> 00:05:36.607\n[LAUGH] So you can come in here, and you\ncan kinda figure out what it is you want.\n\n95\n00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.227\nAnd you've got locate a test center, and\n\n96\n00:05:39.227 --> 00:05:43.207\nwe can find the test center that is\nnear us based on wherever it is you are.\n\n97\n00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:47.097\nSo maybe you are in Paris, France,\nso I'll just punch that in.\n\n98\n00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:55.477\nAnd looks like we got a couple there,\ndepending on which you are in.\n\n99\n00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:57.337\nSee, I'll show off my\nwitty Parisian knowledge.\n\n100\n00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.242\n>> That's nice, yes.\n\n101\n00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:00.170\nSo, anyhow you can see some\nof the different places\n\n102\n00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.330\nthat are available to test there.\n\n103\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.290\nAll over the world.\n\n104\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.464\nI think we have 2 of them here in our\ntown, and our town is a pretty small one.\n\n105\n00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:08.908\nSo you can go and take the test there,\nit's pretty low pressure, right?\n\n106\n00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:14.680\n60 questions, 90 minutes, multiple choice,\nit's not so bad if you know your stuff.\n\n107\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.215\nSo what is the stuff that we need to know?\n\n108\n00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:20.430\nWell the two exams\nare a little bit different.\n\n109\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.890\nWe've got the LX0-101,\nthat's the first exam, and\n\n110\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.250\nit covers what I consider to be\nthe introductory information.\n\n111\n00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.930\nNow if you've never\nworked with Linux before,\n\n112\n00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.670\nsome of this is pretty challenging.\n\n113\n00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.200\nBut if you've got experience with Linux,\n\n114\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.800\nif you've been running it on your desktop\nor as a server for years and years.\n\n115\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.370\nThis one's actually the easier of the two\nexams because it's covering things like\n\n116\n00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.660\nhow to get Linux installed.\n\n117\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.935\nSo, just installing it on a computer, how\nto get it updated to make sure that you're\n\n118\n00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:57.110\ndoing hot fixes and security updates, it's\ncovering basic command line exercises.\n\n119\n00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.250\nNow that's really important.\n\n120\n00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.000\nA lot of people say, well,\nI've been running Linux for five years and\n\n121\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.380\nI use Ubuntu and I love it, right?\n\n122\n00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.140\nAnd then I say okay how often do you drop\n\n123\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.550\nto the terminal shell to\nactually run command line?\n\n124\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.890\nAnd they go well never,\nI do it all through the GUI.\n\n125\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.340\nWell that's a recipe for disaster, right?\n\n126\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.640\nBecause the GUI differs so\n\n127\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.150\nmuch from distro to distro, it's hard\nto learn one way that works everywhere.\n\n128\n00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.305\nAnd if you're on a server you\nshouldn't have a GUI at all.\n\n129\n00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:32.750\nRight, so the exam is almost\nentirely based on command line.\n\n130\n00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.957\nCuz when you learn something that way,\nwhen you learn it command line style,\n\n131\n00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.442\nyou can use it on any\nGNU Linux distribution.\n\n132\n00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:44.850\nAnd so that really makes life easy,\nstandard, compliant, right?\n\n133\n00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.670\nSo if you've got a lot of graphical\nuser interface experience,\n\n134\n00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.700\nthat will help you a little bit on\nthe second exam, but on the first exam,\n\n135\n00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.780\nyou're gonna be dead in the water,\ncuz it's almost all command line.\n\n136\n00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.840\nSo we tackle that,\nthe GNU and Unix commands.\n\n137\n00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.490\nWe also take a look at how\nhardware devices are accessed,\n\n138\n00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.390\nhow the file systems work, and the file\nhierarchy, how the folders are arranged.\n\n139\n00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.190\nAnd again, if you've been\nworking with Unix or Linux for\n\n140\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.370\na while, then that's second\nnature by now more than likely.\n\n141\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.100\nBut, if you're brand new to this,\n\n142\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.690\nit's really different than a lot of other\noperating systems that are out there.\n\n143\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.970\nIf you've got a lot of Windows experience,\nthis stuff will blow your mind,\n\n144\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.690\nbecause it's really different,\n\n145\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.230\nthat hardware devices reference as files,\nnot as objects.\n\n146\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.621\nIf you're used to OSX and Mac OS,\n\n147\n00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.070\nMac OS is running on top of BSD so\nyou might think they're similar.\n\n148\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.610\nBut Apple is tweaked with that file system\nso much that directories and paths and\n\n149\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.250\nstuff are just not the same\nas we see in the Linux world.\n\n150\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.130\nSo getting used to this can be\na little challenging, right, so\n\n151\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.270\ndefinitely keep that in mind.\n\n152\n00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.030\nSo that's kind of what you\nexpect to see on the first exam.\n\n153\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:56.490\nNotice that the bulk of it, 43% of that\nexam, is from the command line, right.\n\n154\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.250\nGNU and Unix, or GNU, sometimes called\nNew, in Unix command line utility.\n\n155\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.120\nSo, you've really got to\nspend some time on that.\n\n156\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.750\nIf you are, [LAUGH] if you're\n30 plus years old and you cut\n\n157\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.650\nyour teeth on DOS and Windows 3.1, then\nit's not a big challenge to pick that up.\n\n158\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.940\nBut if you're 20 years old and just out\nof high school and you grew up with\n\n159\n00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.130\nWindows XP and stuff, you might not\nhave used the command line very much.\n\n160\n00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.389\nAnd even if you've been in\nthe Linux world for 10,\n\n161\n00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:30.990\n20 years, you might be GUI-heavy and\nnot command line-heavy.\n\n162\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.110\nSo, we do need to make sure we focus\nin on that and spend some time.\n\n163\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.480\nThat's what you're gonna\nsee on the first exam.\n\n164\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.920\nSo basic operational skills and really,\n\n165\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.120\neverything that you learn in this exam\nshould apply to any Linux distribution\n\n166\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.982\nthat you're running unless it's some\ncrazy completely whacked out one.\n\n167\n00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:49.269\n[LAUGH] But\nmost of them will work just like this.\n\n168\n00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.327\nAll right,\n\n169\n00:09:51.327 --> 00:09:55.270\nnow each of these topics are broken\ndown into quite a bit of sub topics.\n\n170\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.140\nYou'll see some of the different things\nthat it goes into and we'll go over all\n\n171\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.320\nthese during the actual show so I don't\nwant to bore us to death with them now.\n\n172\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.280\nBut lets take a look at that second exam.\n\n173\n00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.800\nThe other exam is the LX0-102,\n\n174\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.840\nthis guy right here, and it breaks\nthings down a little bit differently.\n\n175\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.860\nYou'll see where we tackle Shells,\nScripting and Data Management, all right?\n\n176\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.890\nIn my opinion, scripting is one of\nthe most useful things that you can learn,\n\n177\n00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.920\nbecause you don't wanna\nrun the same task over and\n\n178\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.300\nover again if you can automate it, and\nscripting is all about automating it.\n\n179\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.830\nSo we're gonna get\na chance to see that and\n\n180\n00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.770\nas an administrator that's something\nwe really do benefit from.\n\n181\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.340\nWe'll see user interfaces and desktops,\nwe're gonna talk about several of\n\n182\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.930\nthe different graphical user interfaces\navailable because you've got Gnome and\n\n183\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.665\nKDE, you've got Enlightenment,\nI think ten people run that.\n\n184\n00:10:44.665 --> 00:10:46.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Xfce, which is one of my favorites,\n\n185\n00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.940\nso there's several different user\ninterfaces that are out there,\n\n186\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.810\nwe'll take a look at each of them and\nsome of the ins and outs.\n\n187\n00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:57.565\nBut notice, user interfaces and\ndesktops, only 8%,\n\n188\n00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:02.665\nvery small part of that exam because\nit's just not standard between systems.\n\n189\n00:11:02.665 --> 00:11:06.435\nWe'll see general administrative tasks,\nthings like creating user accounts,\n\n190\n00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:09.600\nchanging file permissions,\nstuff like that.\n\n191\n00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.200\nEssential system services, we'll take a\nlook at web servers and e-mail servers and\n\n192\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.520\nsome of the things that we typically run.\n\n193\n00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.290\nWe'll definitely spend some time on SSH\ncuz that's such an important service and\n\n194\n00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.290\na few of the other services that we\nmay use as a part of running Linux.\n\n195\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.890\nWe've got networking fundamentals.\n\n196\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.800\nSo configuring our network adapter, some\nof the neat features we have in Linux,\n\n197\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.560\nIPv4 and IPv6 support,\nsome of the different things there.\n\n198\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.830\nAs well as NFS, the network file system,\nwe’ll cover it in there too.\n\n199\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.250\nAnd then lastly, security,\nit’s last but not least.\n\n200\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.370\nIn a very literal sense,\nsecurity is really important to us.\n\n201\n00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.710\nA lot of us are using Linux as a server\noperating system and in that scenario,\n\n202\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.970\nsecurity's really important so\nwe need to take a look at that.\n\n203\n00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.930\nWe're gonna take a look at configuring\nsoftware firewalls under Linux, as well as\n\n204\n00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.990\nother processes like just staying up to\ndate that are really, really important.\n\n205\n00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.730\nSo, the first exam is based on\n\n206\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.170\nfundamentals that every Linux\nadministrator should have.\n\n207\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.660\nThe second exam is based\nmore on practical skills,\n\n208\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.570\nthings we're gonna do on\nan ongoing day-to-day basis.\n\n209\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.160\nSo they're really two neat\nexams that individually don't\n\n210\n00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.118\nprovide you with a well-rounded\nenough basis for Linux knowledge, but\n\n211\n00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:29.110\ncombined, it is the best\nstarting point bar none, right.\n\n212\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.600\nIt just really is a great starting point\nfor somebody who's getting into Linux and\n\n213\n00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.820\nlearning it.\n\n214\n00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.820\nIf you have never studied or\nused or even installed Linux,\n\n215\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.760\nthis certification is still for you, or\nat least our show is for you, right.\n\n216\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.960\nThe certification, you're probably\nnot ready for that exam today.\n\n217\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.810\n>> Right.\n>> So it might not be for you today, but\n\n218\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.680\nour show is.\n\n219\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.370\nWe're gonna show you how to install Linux,\nhow to get the operating system, how to\n\n220\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.140\nget it installed and how to do the work\nwith it, and it's a very rewarding thing.\n\n221\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.000\nLearning a new operating system, it's fun,\njust fun to see things that are different.\n\n222\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.920\nNow you even if the operating system\n\n223\n00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.490\nsucks,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.700\n>> It's still a lot of fun to learn\n\n225\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.630\nsomething new.\n\n226\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.112\nSo, not that the Linux distros do.\n\n227\n00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:09.085\n>> [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Some of them do.\n\n228\n00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:12.760\n[LAUGH] Yeah, choosing your distribution,\nthat is a tough, tough choice.\n\n229\n00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.100\nYeah, that's basically\nwhat this works out to.\n\n230\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.390\nKeep in mind, that it is two exams.\n\n231\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.586\nNow, we're gonna record one big show or\nseries of episodes and\n\n232\n00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:25.070\nwe're gonna cover both of those exams,\nright?\n\n233\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.578\nSo, it's not gonna be two entries in\nour episode library, or anything but\n\n234\n00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:30.090\nit is all gonna be there.\n\n235\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.870\nIt's important that you know both,\nI encourage you to go ahead and study for\n\n236\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.400\nboth before you take the first exam.\n\n237\n00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.780\nSome people study just the stuff for\nthe first exam and then go take it.\n\n238\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.935\nBut as you study for the second exam,\n\n239\n00:13:42.935 --> 00:13:46.650\nyou're kind of reinforcing your knowledge\nthat you are gonna have on that first one.\n\n240\n00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.730\nAnd so if you do the whole thing, if you\nstudy for the whole thing, when you go to\n\n241\n00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:55.160\ntake that first exam you'll be that much\nmore prepared, and so I do recommend that.\n\n242\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.300\nBut again, that's entirely up to you,\nwhatever is your preference.\n\n243\n00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:58.880\n>> Yeah.\n\n244\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.020\nOur show should also help you,\n\n245\n00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.200\nin the very fact that what we'll be doing\nis we'll be installing it right away.\n\n246\n00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.040\nWe'll show you how you can get it running\non your machine, so that you can practice.\n\n247\n00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.400\nThe more hands on practice,\nlike anything that you do it's\n\n248\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.110\ngonna actually bring you better results\nand you're gonna learn it better.\n\n249\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.990\nSo make sure you pay attention and\nespecially in the early episodes as we set\n\n250\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.268\nthis thing up, and we get it rolling\nto the front when we need to.\n\n251\n00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:20.470\n>> Yeah.\n\n252\n00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.709\nAll right well as far as general stuff\nI think that pretty much knocks it out.\n\n253\n00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:28.866\nThere is one other thing I do wanna\nmention is that Linux+ like all\n\n254\n00:14:28.866 --> 00:14:33.200\nCompTIA certifications now, does use a.\n\n255\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.730\nNot expiration, but\ncontinuing education type environment.\n\n256\n00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.000\nSo you do after renew your\ncertification every two years, so\n\n257\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.950\nbe aware of that, that once you\nget certified, you're not done.\n\n258\n00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.700\nIf you wanna maintain you\nLinux+ certification,\n\n259\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.770\nyou've gotta recertify every two\nyears through continuing education.\n\n260\n00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.430\nSo normally, we just retake the exam and\nyou're back in business.\n\n261\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.130\nSo, keep that in mind too.\n\n262\n00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.540\nIf you're already Linux+ certified,\n\n263\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.190\nyou may have gotten in in the early\ndays when there was a lifetime cert.\n\n264\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.240\nIf not you do need to repeat that\ncertification as time goes on.\n\n265\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.020\nBut other than that I think\nthat pretty much covers it.\n\n266\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.750\nDefinitely stay tuned, we're gonna kick\noff the show if you're watching live,\n\n267\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.060\nwe'll kick it off later today.\n\n268\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.220\nSo you'll get a chance to see that\nwealth of great information there and\n\n269\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.270\nif you've never used Linux+ boy,\nyou're in for a treat.\n\n270\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.760\nOr if you've never used Linux you're in\nfor a treat because it's a neat operating\n\n271\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.660\nsystem that has some great\nuses that are out there.\n\n272\n00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.200\nAnd it's really an interesting\nculture to become a part of.\n\n273\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.670\n>> It is.\n\n274\n00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.230\n>> All right, well stay tuned.\n\n275\n00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.472\nWe'll be back with\nthe Linux+ show after this.\n\n276\n00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:44.679\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
